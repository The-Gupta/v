All patients had an approximately threefold rise in IgG level. Five patients showed no change in lymphocytotoxic antibody (LCTAb) activity and no response to random donor platelets that were administered after the immune globulin. The activity of LCTAb either disappeared or diminished after immune globulin infusion in two patients, and they had borderline acceptable corrected count increments 1 hour after transfusion of pooled random-donor platelet transfusions. Because of the diminished LCTAb activity, the improvements in response to pooled random-donor platelet transfusions cannot be ascribed to the administration of immune globulin.

The results suggest that the immature thymocyte population includes both TGP-producing and TGP-responding cells.

It is derived from petroleum and coal and is used both as a solvent and as a starting material in chemical syntheses. The numerous industrial uses of benzene over the last century need not be recounted here, but the most recent addition to the list of uses of benzene is as a component in a mixture of aromatic compounds added to gasoline for the purpose of replacing lead compounds as anti-knock ingredients. The best known and longest recognized toxic effect of benzene is the depression of bone marrow function seen in occupationally exposed individuals. These people have been found to display anemia, leucopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. When pancytopenia, i.e., the simultaneous depression of all three cell types, occurs and is accompanied by bone marrow necrosis, the syndrome is called aplastic anemia. In addition to observing this decrease in humans and relating it to benzene exposure, it has been possible to establish animal models which mimic the human disease. The result has been considerable scientific investigation into the mechanism of benzene toxicity. Although the association between benzene exposure and aplastic anemia has been recognized and accepted throughout most of this century, it is only recently that leukemia, particularly of the acute myelogenous type, has been related to benzene. The acceptance of benzene as an etiological agent in aplastic anemia in large measure derives from our ability to reproduce the disease in most animals treated with sufficiently high doses of benzene over the necessary time period. Unfortunately, despite extensive efforts in several laboratories, it has not been possible to establish a reproducible, reliable model for the study of benzene-induced leukemia. The recent demonstration that several animals exposed to benzene either by inhalation or in the drinking water during studies by Drs. B. Goldstein and C. Maltoni suggests that such a model may be forthcoming. Nevertheless, at this time it is not clear whether bone marrow damage of the type that leads to aplastic anemia is required for the development of leukemia. Most studies of benzene toxicity have involved dosing animals with benzene either by inhalation or by injection, using high doses to ensure a toxic response. Very few studies have concentrated on the oral route of administration and none have concentrated on administering benzene by mouth at the low doses occasionally detected in drinking water.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Marcus, W L']",['Marcus WL'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/analysis', 'Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/poisoning/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Carcinogens', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'United States']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/074823378700300108 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 1987 Mar;3(1):205-66. doi: 10.1177/074823378700300108.,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor-induced human platelet aggregation was inhibited by addition of the following agents to platelet-rich plasma (PRP): a calcium channel blocker (verapamil), a chelator of divalent cations (EDTA), stimulators of adenylate cyclase (2-fluoroadenosine and forskolin), and inhibitors of cAMP phosphodiesterase (oxagrelate and papaverine). The platelet-aggregating activities of both cell lines were completely blocked by treatment of the cells with heat, sonication, phospholipase A2, and Triton X-100. These data suggest that L5178Y and RAG cell-induced human platelet aggregation are dependent on a heat-labile phospholipid component of the tumor cell membrane. L5178Y cells had greater platelet-aggregating activity in human plasma than in rat or mouse plasma, whereas RAG cells had greater procoagulant activity in rat or mouse plasma than in human plasma. The procoagulant activity of RAG cells in rat and mouse plasma was demonstrated by three lines of evidence: RAG cells induced heparinized PRP to clot; the thrombin inhibitor DAPA lengthened of the clotting time and the lag time before aggregation; and RAG cells shortened of the recalcification time of the plasma. The above data indicate that RAG cell-induced murine platelet aggregation and coagulation is dependent on thrombin generation.","['Panton, R W', 'Agarwal, K C', 'Robison, B S', 'Parks, R E Jr']","['Panton RW', 'Agarwal KC', 'Robison BS', 'Parks RE Jr']",['eng'],"['CA 07340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Blood Coagulation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/physiopathology', 'Leukemia L5178/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*physiopathology', '*Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity']",1987/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0049-3848(87)90207-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0049-3848(87)90207-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 1987 Apr 1;46(1):65-76. doi: 10.1016/0049-3848(87)90207-6.,,,,,,,,,,

These regimens are associated with a 25% CR rate and have comparable tolerable and reversible toxicity spectra. An increase in the total number of doses to 12 does not appear to increase the remission frequency in relapsed patients but does decidedly increase the spectrum, frequency, and severity of toxic manifestations. Studies of important pharmacologic determinants such as membrane transport and cellular accumulation of ara-CTP suggest that a lower unit dose may be just as effective, an approach that could potentially lower the frequency and severity of toxicity. However, these concepts must be tested in suitably designed clinical trials. In contrast to the response rate noted in patients with relapsed AML, patients with refractory AML have a substantially lower CR rate (approximately 10%) when treated with HDara-C alone. These lower CR rates are comparable to those reported for other recently introduced new drugs such as m-AMSA and mitoxantrone. In this setting of primary refractory leukemia, multi-institutional and cooperative group trials of HD-ara-C----ASNase show a consistently higher response rate in the range of 30% to 50%. Why ASNase should especially contribute to this particular group is unknown at present. Studies show that the gene for asparagine synthetase is repressed in AML cells. It is speculated that in the initial leukemia cell population (as encountered in refractory AML), the gene for asparagine synthetase is repressed and hence, the leukemia is sensitive to ASNase. In contrast, in the relapsed patient with recurrent leukemia, the gene for asparagine synthetase may be derepressed and the leukemia would be ASNase-insensitive. The therapeutic index of HDara-C----ASNase is schedule dependent. In leukemic mice, pretreatment or concurrent administration of ASNase and HDara-C leads to antagonism of both the therapeutic and toxic effects of HDara-C. These effects are consistent with similar effects of other protein synthesis inhibitors on ara-C toxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Capizzi, R L', 'Powell, B L']","['Capizzi RL', 'Powell BL']",['eng'],"['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage', 'Cerebellar Diseases/etiology', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Diarrhea/etiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(87)90040-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1987 Jun;14(2 Suppl 1):40-50.,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells were isolated from venous blood samples. The intracellular concentration of ara-C 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and in two of the patients the plasma concentration of ara-C was determined by radioimmunoassay. A rapid biphasic elimination of the drug from plasma with an initial half-life of 18 minutes was seen after SC injection. After about 1.5 hours, the concentration was lower than that obtained at steady-state during continuous IV infusion. In the leukemic cells, the concentration of ara-CTP was higher after SC injection than during continuous IV infusion for about five hours. The mean half-life was 2.1 hours. Judging from the intracellular concentration of ara-CTP, considered to be the active metabolite, the results suggest that SC administration of ara-C can mimic continuous IV infusion if the dose interval is reduced from the traditional 12 hours to four to six hours. The results of this study emphasize the differences between the plasma pharmacokinetics of the parent drug and the concentration of the active metabolite in leukemic cells.","['Liliemark, J O', 'Gahrton, G', 'Paul, C Y', 'Peterson, C O']","['Liliemark JO', 'Gahrton G', 'Paul CY', 'Peterson CO']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Arabinonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(87)90062-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1987 Jun;14(2 Suppl 1):167-71.,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have reported that HD-ara-C administered during the first remission of ANLL has resulted in long remission durations and a high proportion of patients with long-term disease-free survival. In this update, those patients have been observed further and additional patients have been treated, affirming the initial conclusions. Since August 1979, 55 adult patients with ANLL in first remission received one to three courses of HD-ara-C (3 g/m2 by one-hour infusion every 12 hours for 12 doses on days 1 to 6) alone or with daunorubicin (30 mg/m2 for two or three doses on days 7 to 9). Three patients died of sepsis or hemorrhage during consolidation and 19 patients have relapsed from 5 to 48 months after diagnosis. The remaining 33 patients remain in continued complete remission (CCR) from 5 to 75 months. Denoting all deaths in remission as relapse, the actuarial probability of CCR is 51% at 75 months with an apparent plateau in the survival curve. Of the first 22 patients is 27 months. Using univariate and multivariate analysis, age is the only statistically significant prognostic parameter with the actuarial CCR of ages less than 25, 25 to 44, and greater than 44 being 100%, 48%, and 23%, respectively. Due to its heightened antileukemic activity, HD-ara-C allows brief but effective consolidation of ANLL in first remission with long-term disease-free survival comparable with other approaches including bone-marrow transplantation.","['Wolff, S N', 'Herzig, R H', 'Phillips, G L', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Greer, J P', 'Stein, R S', 'Ray, W A', 'Herzig, G P']","['Wolff SN', 'Herzig RH', 'Phillips GL', 'Lazarus HM', 'Greer JP', 'Stein RS', 'Ray WA', 'Herzig GP']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1987 Jun;14(2 Suppl 1):12-7.,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, a distinct humoral regulator stimulating growth of GM-CSF/IL-3 factor-dependent (FD) hematopoietic progenitor cell lines was detected following radiation to doses above 2,000 rad. This humoral factor was not detectable in conditioned medium from irradiated cells, weakly detected using factor-dependent target cell populations in agar overlay, and was prominently detected by liquid co-cultivation of factor-dependent cells with irradiated stromal cell cultures. Subclonal lines of FD cells, derived after co-cultivation revealed karyotypic abnormalities and induced myeloblastic tumors in syngeneic mice. Five-eight weeks co-cultivation was required for induction of factor independence and malignancy and was associated with dense cell to cell contact between FD cells and stromal cells demonstrated by light and electron microscopy. Increases in hematopoietic to stromal cell surface area, total number of adherent cells per flask, total non-adherent cell colonies per flask, and cumulative non-adherent cell production were observed after irradiation.

This suggests that abnormal PMN may circulate in ANLL patients in complete remission in spite of a normal differential count and that functional studies may be useful for detecting such a population.","['Bottari, V', 'Fattorossi, A', 'Nisini, R', 'Petti, M C', 'Fenu, S', 'Fontana, L']","['Bottari V', 'Fattorossi A', 'Nisini R', 'Petti MC', 'Fenu S', 'Fontana L']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Ric Clin Lab,La Ricerca in clinica e in laboratorio,7613947,['298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemotaxis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/immunology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/*physiology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Remission Induction']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02909387 [doi]'],ppublish,Ric Clin Lab. 1987 Jan-Mar;17(1):41-6. doi: 10.1007/BF02909387.,,,,,,,,,,

Although relatively high ratios of tumor to normal tissues could be obtained (e.g., greater than 90 for tumor/muscle), the kidneys were found to have the highest concentration of the metalloporphyrin at all doses and time periods tested. A significant decrease in the longitudinal relaxation time was measured for excised tissues (kidney, tumor, liver, muscle) from mice that were treated with Mn(III)TPPS4. A linear correlation was observed between the longitudinal relaxation rate determined for L1210 tumor and the corresponding concentration of Mn(III)TPPS4 found at various injected doses and time intervals between the injection and analysis. A small animal radiofrequency receiver coil designed for use with a 0.15-T clinical imager was employed to evaluate the ability of Mn(III)TPPS4 to selectively increase the signal intensity of the implanted L1210 tumor. The images show a conspicuous enhancement in the contrast between the tumor and adjacent tissue upon treatment with this agent.

At high concentrations (10(-5) M) cortexolone alone is inactive. The ability of cortexolone to block the TA-mediated biological effects is reflected in its ability (1000-fold molar excess) to effectively block the binding of [3H]TA to the cytoplasmic unactivated form of the receptors eluted from DEAE-cellulose at approx. 180 mM potassium phosphate (KP). Likewise a 1000-fold molar excess of TA inhibits the specific binding of [3H]cortexolone to the unactivated receptors and to a peak which elutes at low salt concentration (35 mM KP) but does not appear to represent activated [3H]cortexolone-receptor complexes. Thermal activation/transformation (25 degrees C for 30 min +/- 10 mM ATP) of the [3H]TA-receptor complexes significantly enhances the subsequent DNA-cellulose binding capacity of these complexes and also results in their elution from DEAE-cellulose at the low salt (50 mM KP) activated position. In contrast, exposure of the cytoplasmic [3H]cortexolone-receptor complexes to identical in vitro activating (transforming) conditions fails to enhance subsequent DNA-cellulose binding capacity or to result in the appropriate shift in DEAE-cellulose elution profile. This inability of [3H]cortexolone to facilitate activation/transformation of receptors was also verified using cytosol prepared from the glucocorticoid-resistant 'activation-labile' mutant, 3R7. Taken collectively the data suggest that cortexolone, unlike an agonist such as TA, fails to promote in vitro activation/transformation, a conformational change which also occurs in vivo under physiological conditions and is a prerequisite for nuclear binding.","['Schmidt, T J', 'Davidson, C J']","['Schmidt TJ', 'Davidson CJ']",['eng'],"['AM 25295/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 34490-02/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Steroid Biochem,Journal of steroid biochemistry,0260125,"['0 (17-Hydroxycorticosteroids)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)', 'WDT5SLP0HQ (Cortodoxone)']",IM,"['17-Hydroxycorticosteroids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', 'Cortodoxone/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0022-4731(87)90097-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Steroid Biochem. 1987 Mar;26(3):329-36. doi: 10.1016/0022-4731(87)90097-5.,,,,,,,,,,

Neither the diagnosis, disease status, sex, nor the regimen altered the incidence of severe cerebellar toxicity (when corrected for age). A second course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside, administered to 62 patients, did not increase the incidence of severe cerebellar toxicity, which occurred in five (8%) of these patients. Two of the five patients had severe toxicity with the initial course. Of the 60 patients with no antecedent cerebellar dysfunction, three (5%) had severe toxicity with the second course: one of 41 patients were less than 50 years old; two of 19 patients were greater than or equal to 50 years. Since the occurrence of severe cerebellar dysfunction is greatly affected by age, reduced doses of high-dose cytosine arabinoside should be given to patients greater than 50 years old, and methods for reducing the cerebellar toxicity should be investigated in these patients.","['Herzig, R H', 'Hines, J D', 'Herzig, G P', 'Wolff, S N', 'Cassileth, P A', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Adelstein, D J', 'Brown, R A', 'Coccia, P F', 'Strandjord, S']","['Herzig RH', 'Hines JD', 'Herzig GP', 'Wolff SN', 'Cassileth PA', 'Lazarus HM', 'Adelstein DJ', 'Brown RA', 'Coccia PF', 'Strandjord S', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cerebellar Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.6.927 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Jun;5(6):927-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.6.927.,,,,,,,,,,

Cycles 1 (induction), 3, and 5 included conventional doses of daunomycin, cytosine arabinoside, 6-thioguanine, vincristine (VCR), and prednisone. Cycle 2 was cytosine arabinoside 3 g/m2 intravenously (IV) every 12 hours for four doses, followed by L-asparaginase 10,000 U intramuscularly (IM) at hour 42; this combination was repeated 1 week later. Cycle 4 included amsacrine 120 mg/m2/d and etoposide 100 mg/m2/d, both IV for five days, and cycle 6 was three monthly courses of VCR on day 1, and prednisone, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate each for five days. Seventy-four patients (74%) achieved complete remission (CR) (51 with cycle 1 and 23 after cycle 2). The overall disease-free survival (DFS) for patients achieving CR is 27% at 3 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis, while for patients achieving CR with cycle 1 it is 34%. The actuarial probability of being free from relapse at 3 years for patients achieving CR is 34%. Sixteen of the 74 CR patients (22%) died in CR while continuing to receive intensive chemotherapy, including 12 (18%) who succumbed to infection (nine bacterial, three fungal). After a median follow-up of 20 months, 36 patients have relapsed and 21 remain alive in CR. Intensive consolidation with high-dose cytosine arabinoside, amsacrine, and etoposide can modestly prolong DFS compared with historical controls. However, relapse continued to be a major problem and, in addition, with more aggressive consolidation therapy, infection during marrow aplasia resulted in a significant number of deaths.","['Tallman, M S', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Amos, D', 'Goldberg, R S', 'Livingston, R B', 'Mortimer, J', 'Weiden, P L', 'Thomas, E D']","['Tallman MS', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Amos D', 'Goldberg RS', 'Livingston RB', 'Mortimer J', 'Weiden PL', 'Thomas ED']",['eng'],"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Statistics as Topic']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.6.918 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Jun;5(6):918-26. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.6.918.,,,,,,,,,,

The CL emission to both Zymosan or PMA was enhanced in the whole blood of the patient's group in comparison to whole blood of healthy blood donors. CL reactivity induced in Dextran-sedimented leukocytes derived from neoplasia patients and healthy blood donors did not differ in the two groups.

Therefore, enhanced CL reactivity to PMA or Zymosan observed in the whole blood of the patients' population appears to be due to the presence of interferon in serum blood components as a consequence of IFN-infusion rather than to other symptoms or treatments of the neoplastic diseases, since the relative CL enhancement in patients is abrogated when isolated blood leukocytes are used for CL assay.","['Muller, S', 'Krasner, J', 'Ozer, H', 'Blumenson, L']","['Muller S', 'Krasner J', 'Ozer H', 'Blumenson L']",['eng'],"['39008-00/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA 43201/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '5EXP385Q4F (Luminol)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Luminol', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Phagocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Zymosan/pharmacology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1987.7.1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1987 Feb;7(1):1-15. doi: 10.1089/jir.1987.7.1.,,,,,,,,,,

A survey of serum carnitine concentrations was made in 54 cancer and 81 noncancer patients for the purpose of determining the carnitine profile. The total carnitine, nonesterified carnitine, and acid-insoluble acylcarnitine concentrations of cancer patients were similar to noncancer patients and within the normal range; however, the acid-soluble acylcarnitine concentration was significantly lower in cancer patients than in controls (6.7 vs 11.5 nmol/ml). When percentages and ratios were calculated for the relative proportions of acylcarnitines, large variations were found to occur among cancer types. The acylcarnitine ratio (the sum of acid-soluble and acid-insoluble acylcarnitine divided by nonesterified carnitine) ranged from 0.17 in leukemia to 0.30 in breast cancer cases. Since the acylcarnitine concentration and ratio are reflective of the metabolic state, the depressed acylcarnitine ratio in cancer patients may be due to decreased production, increased utilization, or increased excretion of acid-soluble acylcarnitine. Elevated concentrations of nonesterified carnitine and total carnitine were observed in two patients, and some of the lowest acylcarnitine concentrations and ratios were observed in advanced cancer cases. The therapeutic regimen and/or the neoplastic process itself may be responsible for the observed differences in the serum carnitine profile.","['Sachan, D S', 'Dodson, W L']","['Sachan DS', 'Dodson WL']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Coll Nutr,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,8215879,"['0 (Esters)', 'S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carnitine/*blood', 'Esters', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*blood']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07315724.1987.10720173 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Coll Nutr. 1987 Apr;6(2):145-50. doi: 10.1080/07315724.1987.10720173.,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency per liver of hepatocellular nodules was similar in the two hybrids. However, in male mice the mean volume of nodules was about 10-fold greater in B6C3 than in B6C mice receiving NDEA followed by vehicle, and the treatment with TCPOBOP after NDEA stimulated nodule growth, with a much greater response in B6C3 mice. In female mice no differences in the mean volume of nodules were seen between hybrids after NDEA and vehicle, whereas upon NDEA and TCPOBOP treatment the mean volume of nodules was 25-fold greater in B6C3 than in B6C females. In addition, a few hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed, mostly in animals treated with NDEA and TCPOBOP, and they were 3-fold more numerous among B6C3 than B6C mice. TCPOBOP alone induced the same biochemical and hyperplastic effects in the liver of both hybrids. Using DNA probes homologous to Moloney murine leukemia virus, intracisternal A particle and virus-like 30S sequences, no correlation was apparent between the expression of any of these endogenous retroviral families and the strain susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis.

Phospholipid-stimulated protein phosphorylation occurred in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+; kinase activity was greater with Mg2+ than with Mn2+ from 4 to 10 mM, although at lower divalent cation concentrations Mn2+ was preferred. A Mr 75,500-77,000 endogenous protein doublet and a Mr 42,000 endogenous protein were phosphorylated in whole cell extracts under these conditions. These substrates contrasted with those identified under protein kinase C conditions. Of the exogenous proteins tested, phospholipid-stimulated phosphorylation was highest with histone H2B followed by other histones. In addition to DA-1 cells, phospholipid-stimulated protein kinase also was detected in high levels in normal mouse spleen, marrow, and kidney but not detectable in brain extracts. The phosphatidylglycerol-stimulated kinase was separated from protein kinase C by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, from which it eluted at 0.2 to 0.3 M NaCl. Physiological dissociation of the two types of kinase activity was demonstrated by down regulation of protein kinase C over 24 h by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetic acid. Under these conditions phosphatidylglycerol kinase activity and subcellular distribution were unaffected. Thus, phosphatidylglycerol-stimulated kinase was detectable in both normal and malignant cells and contrasted with, and was separable from, protein kinase C in numerous respects.

The amplification is relatively stable as there was only a 2- to 3-fold decrease in the number of amplified TS genes when cells were grown in the absence of selection for 375 generations. We also observe a 30- to 40-fold increase in number of copies of the dihydrofolate reductase gene with 7-fold elevation of the RNA product, and we suggest that this may be due to cross-inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by CB3717. Thymidylate synthase mRNA levels in L1210 and L1210:C15 show no variation within the different phases of the cell cycle but are significantly reduced during quiescence.","['Imam, A M', 'Crossley, P H', 'Jackman, A L', 'Little, P F']","['Imam AM', 'Crossley PH', 'Jackman AL', 'Little PF']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', '*Gene Amplification', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",1987/05/25 00:00,1987/05/25 00:01,['1987/05/25 00:00'],"['1987/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)48246-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 May 25;262(15):7368-73.,,,,,,,,,,

In 1980, the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations (BEIR) showed that lifetime cancer risk is three times greater if the relative risk (RR) model is used instead of the AR model. Recently, several arguments have been advanced to promote the RR model to the detriment of the AR model. As a result, one may raise the question whether exposure dose limits should be reduced. This work shows that, together with the RR model, the linear-quadratic dose-response model has also been set forth as a competitor to the linear model. If the linear dose response and AR models are to be replaced by the linear-quadratic dose response and RR models, then lifetime risk predictions remain unchanged and a revision of exposure dose limits might be not necessary.","['Chau, N P']",['Chau NP'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-198706000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 1987 Jun;52(6):753-61. doi: 10.1097/00004032-198706000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,

The cell lines used in these studies included murine L-1210 leukemia, human RPMI 8226 myeloma, MCF-7 breast cancer and WiDr colon carcinoma. Soft agar colony forming assays showed that BSO was most effective at reducing tumor colony formation when exposed continuously to cells in vitro. Drug concentrations which inhibited colony formation to 50% of control levels ranged from 2.0-6.2 mM (for 1 hour exposures), 2-100 mM for 24 hour exposures and 0.4-1.40 microM (for continuous BSO exposures). Human myeloma cells proved most sensitive to BSO. In vitro cytotoxicity correlated with depletion of intracellular nonprotein sulfhydryls to less than or equal to 10% of control values in both L-1210 and 8226 cells. This was routinely achieved with prolonged exposures to mM BSO concentrations for greater than 24 hours. Normal mice tolerated high BSO doses (up to 5.0 g/kg) without evidence of acute toxicity.

A large case-control study by Boice et al.

These substrates were administered individually and as a mixture to 10 healthy adult male volunteers to determine if clearances of any of the compounds were affected by simultaneous administration. Mean clearances of the substrates were not different when administered alone (9.97, 0.78, and 0.53 ml/min/kg) vs. together (11.5, 0.89, and 0.52 ml/min/kg), using a paired t test. Since we were using this method to assess hepatic drug clearance in children with leukemia, the effect of short-term allopurinol was assessed. The three model substrates were administered to the volunteers after 0, 1, 8, and 22 days of treatment with allopurinol, 200 mg t.i.d. There was no change in mean clearance of any of the three compounds at any point during allopurinol treatment (repeated-measures ANOVA).

In the presence of dCyd concentrations (10(-3) M), far exceeding normal human plasma levels (0.5 to 4.0 X 10(6) M), substantial but partial reversal of pyrimidine antagonist-mediated growth inhibition and restoration of intracellular dCTP levels was noted in all cell types except HL-60/Ara-C. When high concentrations of dCyd (10(-3) M) were combined with low levels of uridine or cytidine (10(-5) M), full restoration of growth was observed in sensitive cell lines. When exposed to supraphysiologic concentrations of dCyd, HL-60/Ara-C cells were more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of pyrimidine antagonists than parent HL-60 cells; this phenomenon was maximal at 10(-4) M dCyd and was not observed in the presence of dCyd concentrations of 10(-6) M or lower. These studies suggest that in the presence of low concentrations of uridine or cytidine, perturbations in intracellular dCTP pools may play a critical role in determining the in vitro antiproliferative response of human leukemic myeloid cells to diverse inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. They also raise the possibility that modulation of exogenous dCyd concentrations may improve the therapeutic efficacy of pyrimidine antagonists toward certain salvage pathway-deficient, drug-resistant leukemic cells.","['Bhalla, K', 'Grant, S']","['Bhalla K', 'Grant S']",['eng'],['CA-35601-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '263CU738ZY (3-Deazauridine)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '4B15044GQZ (pyrazofurin)', '681HV46001 (Ribose)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['3-Deazauridine/pharmacology', 'Amides', 'Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/deficiency', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles', 'Pyrimidines/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Ribose', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00252977 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1987;19(3):226-32. doi: 10.1007/BF00252977.,,,,,,,,,,

Catheters were flushed daily with heparin (10 units/ml), and urokinase (5000-10,000 units) was injected when blood could not be drawn. Clots within the catheter lumen were detected visually after expressing, onto a 4 X 4-inch gauze pad, the first 5-10 ml of admixed blood and flush solution or iv infusion fluid drawn from the catheter prior to blood drawing. Clots were detected in 153 of 508 specimens (30%). Forty of 43 patients had clots, varying in length from fragments to 5 cm, in at least one specimen. Inpatients and outpatients had a similar percentage of clotted specimens. Eight patients developed clinical (six) or autopsy-proven (two) thrombosis.

Menadiol was tested alone and in combination with standard antineoplastic agents. Drug effects were then compared with the effects of the same drugs in normal human lymphocytes and in fresh specimens of human non-small cell lung cancer. By itself, menadiol was moderately toxic to HLN, but not to normal lymphocytes or non-small cell lung cancer. Menadiol, menadione, and two structurally related congeners were equitoxic to HLN cells, but sodium metabisulfite (present in menadiol solutions as a preservative) was nontoxic. Menadiol increased the cytotoxic effects of a number of standard agents in HLN but not in normal lymphocytes. Cell survival times with mechlorethamine, vincristine, and dexamethasone were converted from a range characteristic of drug resistance (ie, range observed in relapsed patients) to a range characteristic of drug sensitivity (ie, range observed in untreated patients) in the presence of menadiol. These effects occurred at a concentration (2.0 micrograms/ml; 4.7 microM) of menadiol which is probably clinically achievable and which did not deplete intracellular glutathione.

Molecular pharmacological studies at this institution suggest that teniposide, in doses that are achievable in vivo, blocks methotrexate efflux from cells, enhancing formation of methotrexate polyglutamates which are active retentive forms of the drug. Hence, the combination might show a synergistic effect if teniposide is given at an appropriate time in relation to administration of methotrexate. This paper considers the problem of estimating the optimal dose levels and timing of administration of these drugs in B6D2F1 mice bearing L1210 leukemia in vivo as a model for the analysis of multidrug regimens when time and dose are variables. Because of the complexity of these experiments, an adaptive approach was applied. Three cycles of treatment were given using methotrexate at 0-400 mg/kg, teniposide at 0-60 mg/kg, and an interval of 0-54 hours between the two drugs. The single drugs prolonged median survival up to 24 days under the conditions of these experiments. The combination given simultaneously resulted in median survival of up to 33.5 days, while use of an appropriate interval between drugs prolonged median survival to greater than 50 days. An analysis of the underlying dose-time response gives a much better appreciation of the relationships among the variables. The concept that optimal doses included less methotrexate and more teniposide as the interval between drugs is increased was developed only through modeling. This finding is critical in demonstrating the importance of including all nonnegligible variables in the experimental design if the results are to be considered valid. Confidence regions about the optimum dose and about the response at the optimum provide a sound basis for a claim of therapeutic synergism as demonstrated by use of a scheduling variable in the experiment design. A nonproportional hazards analysis permits the conclusion of nonproportionality and emphasizes the contribution of methotrexate to optimal short-term survival (15-24 days) and teniposide to long-term survival (24-39 days).","['Wampler, G L', 'Carter, W H Jr', 'Campbell, E D', 'Goldman, I D']","['Wampler GL', 'Carter WH Jr', 'Campbell ED', 'Goldman ID']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mathematics', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Biological', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage']",1987/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1987 Jun;71(6):581-91.,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have characterized these cell lines with regard to their expression of lymphocyte and macrophage differentiation antigens, adherence, phagocytic properties, binding of various lectins, binding of antibodies to glycolipid asialo-monoganglioside, and the role of butanol extractable cell surface molecules to determine if any of these cell surface properties are associated with the malignant potential of RAW117-H10 cells. The only major difference in immunological phenotypes between RAW117-P and RAW117-H10 cells was an increased expression of Thy-1 molecules by the latter. However, the highly malignant RAW117-H10 cells bound significantly less concanavalin A, Ricinia communis agglutinin, succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, and particularly anti-asialomonoganglioside than their parental counterpart and were resistant to natural killer cell mediated cytolysis. Removal of butanol extractable cell surface molecules significantly decreased the malignancy of RAW117-H10 cells and increased their susceptibility to natural killer cell mediated cytolysis. The butanol treated RAW117-H10 cells regained high in vivo malignancy when recultured for 3 days to permit regeneration of their cell surface components. The butanol extracted RAW117-H10 cells still expressed high levels of Thy-1 indicating that this most probably represented ""inappropriate"" antigen expression. Since the expression of lymphocyte differentiation antigens did not correlate with the malignant behavior of the cells, we postulate that these antigenic differences merely represent phenotypic variation.

The variant P388/VP-16 cell line was 159-fold resistant to 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-9-(4,6-O-ethylidene)-beta-D- glucopyranoside and showed cross-resistance to vincristine (18.9-fold) and Adriamycin (522.9-fold), determined by comparing the 50% inhibitory concentrations in a 48-h growth inhibition assay. To identify the possible role of Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) in this drug resistance, we studied the specific phorbol ester binding component and protein kinase C in the parent and drug-resistant sublines of P388 cells. The phorbol ester receptor, as expressed by the numbers of sites per cell, significantly decreased in P388/VP-16 (57.6% of control). Scatchard analysis revealed that the variant contained a single class of binding sites. However, no difference was observed in the dissociation constants (Kd), thereby suggesting much the same affinity of receptors between the two lines. Phorbol diester analogues inhibited [20-3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate binding of both the variant and control cell lines, in a stereospecific manner and consistent with their binding potency. The activity of protein kinase C, which is related to the phorbol ester receptor, significantly decreased in the variant cell. The enzyme activity, particularly in the membrane fraction of P388/VP-16 cells, was remarkably decreased. These data suggest that the decrease in the specific phorbol diester receptor and protein kinase C in the variant cells might correlate with the pleiotropic drug resistance.","['Ido, M', 'Sato, K', 'Sakurai, M', 'Inagaki, M', 'Saitoh, M', 'Watanabe, M', 'Hidaka, H']","['Ido M', 'Sato K', 'Sakurai M', 'Inagaki M', 'Saitoh M', 'Watanabe M', 'Hidaka H']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', '*Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phorbol Esters/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Vincristine/toxicity']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jul 1;47(13):3460-3.,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of clonogenicity in vitro was maximized at a drug concentration of 0.2 microM. Higher drug concentrations produced less cell kill, and the surviving fraction observed after exposure to 25 microM TG was 1 log higher than at 0.2 microM (2% versus 0.2% of control cloning efficiency, respectively). Delayed G2 arrest in vitro was also found to be most pronounced at 0.2 microM, with G1 arrest more predominant at higher concentrations. Studies in vivo were conducted using C57BL X DBA/2 F1 mice, with or without advanced L1210 ascites tumor. In initial experiments performed on animals without tumor, the 50% lethal dose for 12-h s.c. infusions of TG was approximately 0.8 mumol/kg/min. Correlation of steady-state TG plasma levels with infusion rate revealed a linear relationship up to 0.62 mumol/kg/min, above which the TG plasma concentration increased disproportionately to input rate. Total body clearance of TG, calculated from the linear portion of this curve, was 123 ml/kg/min. The antitumor effects of TG infusions were correlated with steady state plasma concentrations achieved in each individual animal, and it was found that dose rates yielding levels from 1 to 10 microM increased survival time by about 40%, with no apparent optimum plasma level in this range. Examination of the cytokinetic effects caused by TG infusions at the low and high ends of this maximally therapeutic range showed that, as was the case in vitro, lower concentrations of TG caused delayed G2 arrest, while higher concentrations induced more rapid G1 arrest. On the basis of these, as well as previous findings, we propose that the operative mechanism of cell kill by TG in vivo may be dose dependent and may be reflected by the relative degree of G2 versus G1 arrest. We also suggest that the appropriate strategy for the clinical use of TG is to determine the drug concentration which produces maximum G2 arrest of tumor cells, and to infuse continuously at a rate to achieve that level for the maximum time tolerated by the patient, rather than to select an arbitrary length of infusion followed by escalation to maximum tolerated drug concentration.","['Maybaum, J', 'Morgans, C W', 'Hink, L A']","['Maybaum J', 'Morgans CW', 'Hink LA']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Thioguanine/blood/*therapeutic use']",1987/06/15 00:00,1987/06/15 00:01,['1987/06/15 00:00'],"['1987/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jun 15;47(12):3083-7.,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this paper was to show that the procedure is simple, effective and associated with few complications. Ninety-six patients (32 men, 64 women) with lymphoma (25), leukemia (28), metastatic breast cancer (28) or other malignant lesions (15) were referred for insertion of a Silastic permanent indwelling catheter into the superior vena cava. The catheter was inserted through a subclavian vein using a Cordis Vein Dilator Kit, itself introduced over a guide wire inserted initially under fluoroscopic control. Local sepsis at the insertion site occurred in 6 of the first 43 patients treated but in none of the remainder. Six catheters became thrombosed and required revision.

The in vitro culture studies showed that the erythroid precursor was dependent upon erythropoietin (Ep) for differentiation and proliferation during the erythroblastic phase. However, the Ep dose-response curve showed that a peak of erythroid colony formation occurred at a lower concentration than in the healthy controls.

Isocratic elution with low phosphate buffer at pH 4.0 was used. The detection limit was 20 pmol per injection, which is comparable to previously described radiometric assays. The HPLC assay was compared with a spectrophotometric assay measuring orotic acid formation in a deproteinized reaction mixture. Absorbance was measured at the optimal wavelength for orotic acid, 278.5 nm. This assay is less sensitive and less specific than the HPLC assay, which can also detect UMP which might be formed from orotic acid in whole homogenates.

We have generated two monoclonal antibodies which are specific for the cell surface antigens of multidrug-resistant human cell lines. However, the antigens of both monoclonal antibodies were difficult to detect by either immune blot or ordinary immunoprecipitation methods. We used a cleavable crosslinking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) to covalently link the monoclonal antibody with its antigenic determinant in the membrane of intact cells. By this method, we were able to detect the antigens for these two monoclonal antibodies following solubilization, immunoprecipitation, and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

We sought to define its therapeutic mechanism by assessing clinical and cytogenetic responses to treatment in conjunction with careful in vitro study of both morphologic and functional characteristics of bone marrow cells cultured with Ara-C. Sixteen patients (12 ANLL, four myelodysplastic syndrome) were treated. All developed pancytopenia and 11 of 12 had bone marrow hypoplasia during treatment. Four had a meaningful clinical response while five more showed in vivo leukemic cell sensitivity to low-dose Ara-C. Seven showed no response. Cells with cytogenetic abnormalities were either decreased in number or eradicated during clinical improvement. Liquid culture of marrow mononuclear cells with Ara-C (.033-.333 micrograms/ml X 7 days) produced little evidence of morphologic or functional differentiation (ten of 11 studied). No functional maturation was observed in cells from clinically responding patients. We conclude that low-dose Ara-C is modestly effective for some patients with ANLL or myelodysplasia.

The bone marrow of most patients and controls had similar distributions of immune effector cells characterized by a diffuse array of predominantly cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells and occasional nodular aggregates of helper T-cells. Cells displaying the natural killer cell marker HNK-1 were sparse in controls and most neutropenic patients. However, marked increases in marrow HNK-1 + cells were identified in four of the 15 patients. Three of these patients had diffuse HNK-1 + infiltrates associated with increased Leu 4+ (OKT-3+) T-cells while one had a nodular HNK-1+ infiltrate associated with small B-cell follicles. Each of these patients had clinical features similar to those described in the large granular lymphocyte (LGL) lymphocytosis (leukemia) syndrome, but only one of four demonstrated persistently increased numbers of LGLs in the peripheral blood. Thus, this study extends the association of neutropenia and increased numbers of cells with a T/NK phenotype to include patients whose bone marrow is the only demonstrable site of involvement.

Serial measurements of height, weight, and weight for height were obtained by retrospective chart review. The effects of 1800 rad (18 Gy) and 2400 rad (24 Gy) treatment were indistinguishable. Height percentiles among irradiated patients decreased by a mean of 12% six months after diagnosis, and growth generally did not catch up. Moreover, although 33 irradiated patients maintained heights within the normal range, In 11 patients (33%) a dramatic falloff occurred such that by three years following diagnosis their height for age was more than 30 percentiles below the original value. These patients were all identifiable at six months since their height percentiles had already decreased by more than 15%. Although weight percentiles did not change following irradiation, the weight-for-height ratio increased and patients were relatively stockier three years after therapy than they had been at diagnosis. In patients who had received chemotherapy alone, the weight-for-height ratio also increased, but this appeared to be due to a disproportionate increase in weight.

MoMuLV or amphotropic 4070A pseudotypes of the virus were injected intraperitoneally into newborn mice. The MoMuLV pseudotype produced only helper-virus-induced leukemias. The amphotropic pseudotype caused fibrosarcomas after a long latent period. The results of these and other in vivo experiments are discussed in relation to known pathogenic effects of other retroviruses carrying H-ras or K-ras genes.","['Souyri, M', 'Koehne, C F', ""O'Donnell, P V"", 'Aldrich, T H', 'Furth, M E', 'Fleissner, E']","['Souyri M', 'Koehne CF', ""O'Donnell PV"", 'Aldrich TH', 'Furth ME', 'Fleissner E']",['eng'],"['CA-07848/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40620/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Fibrosarcoma/microbiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Transfection']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(87)90239-x [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1987 May;158(1):69-78. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(87)90239-x.,,,,,,,,,,

Five different genes participate in the formation of baseline sister-chromatid exchanges and spontaneous chromosomal aberrations.,99-106,"In a search for cell mutants that show an increase or a decrease in the frequency of baseline sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) or spontaneous chromosomal aberrations (CAs), large numbers of mutagen-sensitive clones previously isolated from mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were analyzed. In addition to two SCE mutants (ES 4 and AC 12) previously reported, three other mutants were identified as an SCE mutant. An ethyl methanesulfonate-sensitive mutant ES 2 and an alkylating agent-sensitive mutant MS 1 exhibited, respectively, 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold higher baseline SCE frequencies than did the parental L5178Y. In contrast, M10, which is sensitive to X-ray and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, showed a reduced frequency of baseline SCEs (0.65-fold). These 5 mutants including ES 4 and AC 12 had 3--9-fold increases in spontaneous CA frequencies. Measurement of baseline SCE formation in inter-mutant hybrids revealed that M10 mutation is dominant, MS 1 and ES 4 mutations are semidominant, and ES 2 and AC 12 mutations are recessive. Because SCE frequencies in hybrids formed between pairs of 4 mutants (ES 2, MS 1, ES 4 and AC 12) were significantly lower than those in the tetraploid mutant cells, these 4 mutants probably belong to different complementation groups. Since M10 behaved dominantly with respect to SCE phenotype, it was not possible to determine by complementation test whether it belongs to a different group from the other mutants. However, the finding that M10 is complemented by other mutants for EMS sensitivity indicates that the M10 mutation is different from the other mutations. From these results, it is concluded that at least 4 different genes participate in the formation of high levels of baseline SCEs. The defects in ES 2, MS 1, ES 4, and AC 12 produce common lesions responsible for the formation of both SCEs and CAs. In contrast, the defect in M10 is associated with a high increase in spontaneous CA frequency, but conversely associated with a decrease in baseline SCE frequency. This suggests that M10 is defective in the process involved in the formation of baseline SCEs.","['Tsuji, H', 'Takahashi, E', 'Tsuji, S', 'Tobari, I', 'Shiomi, T', 'Hama-Inaba, H', 'Sato, K']","['Tsuji H', 'Takahashi E', 'Tsuji S', 'Tobari I', 'Shiomi T', 'Hama-Inaba H', 'Sato K']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', 'AT5C31J09G (Methyl Methanesulfonate)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Genes', 'Hybrid Cells/physiology', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Methyl Methanesulfonate/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Mutagens', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0027-5107(87)90091-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(87)90091-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1987 May;178(1):99-106. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(87)90091-1.,,,,,,,,,,

These modifications were produced in culture by adding specific fatty acids to the growth medium or by feeding fat-supplemented diets to tumor-bearing mice. The phospholipid fatty acid composition of the plasma membrane was modified, but there were no changes in membrane phospholipid or cholesterol content or in phospholipid head group composition. Each of the most abundant membrane phosphoglyceride fractions exhibited some degree of fatty acid modification. Electron spin resonance measurements with nitroxystearate spin probes indicated that the fatty acid modifications were sufficient to alter the physical properties of the plasma membrane. The K'm for methotrexate uptake was reduced when the L1210 leukemia cells were enriched in linoleic acid. Even when the kinetics of uptake at 37 C were not altered, such as for melphalan and phenylalanine uptake, the temperature transition of transport was modified, indicating that these transport systems also are responsive to the membrane fatty acid modifications. Enrichment with highly polyunsaturated fatty acid did not affect either the growth rate or radiosensitivity of the L1210 leukemia. However, the sensitivity of the L1210 cells to the cytotoxic effects of Adriamycin and hyperthermia was increased. These findings suggest the possibility that fatty acid modification of tumors may be a useful adjunct to certain currently available therapeutic modalities.","['Burns, C P', 'Spector, A A']","['Burns CP', 'Spector AA']",['eng'],"['CA17283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK28516/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Culture Media', 'Dietary Fats/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02537299 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 1987 Mar;22(3):178-84. doi: 10.1007/BF02537299.,,,,,,,,,,

TA3Ha tumors metastasized regularly to the lymph nodes but the L1210 tumors seldom metastasized to the lymph nodes. Tail implants of TA3Ha tumors behaved similarly in the athymic nude mice and strain A mice. TA3Ha cells inoculated into the Millipore chambers and maintained in mice for greater than 150 days were viable and able to form tumors. The results demonstrate that the anatomic location of the tumor affects the growth and metastatic behavior of the tumors, and that the tumors of different histologic origin metastasize differently even when grown in corresponding locations.","['Murthy, M S', 'Travis, J D', 'Scanlon, E F']","['Murthy MS', 'Travis JD', 'Scanlon EF']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology/secondary', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Time Factors']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jso.2930350111 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 1987 May;35(1):44-9. doi: 10.1002/jso.2930350111.,,,,,,,,,,

Three independently obtained cell lines were examined. In two of these cell lines, the vector was introduced by viral infection, while in the third the construct was introduced by DNA transfection. Such transfected cell lines (including the one examined) usually express 10- to 50-fold less virus-specific RNA than do cell lines obtained by viral infection. All three cell lines exhibited similar patterns of DNase I-hypersensitive (HS) sites. Two strong DNase I HS sites were detected in the 5' long terminal repeat, which contains signals required for proper and efficient initiation of viral transcription. One of these sites was found to overlap the viral enhancer sequences, while the other site mapped very close to the start site for viral transcription. A third HS site was detected in nearby internal viral sequences. Only one HS site was found in the 3' long terminal repeat, which contains the signal(s) required for proper addition of a poly(A) tail to viral transcripts. This HS site was located in the region of the viral enhancer. Several weak DNase I HS sites were also found in the cellular sequences adjacent to the integration sites, at different locations in each cell line analyzed. No common pattern of cellular DNase I HS sites was found. These observations suggest that the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats of integrated retroviral proviruses exhibit different chromatin conformations, possibly reflecting the different functions encoded by the otherwise identical sequences, and the DNase I HS sites detected in these studies reflect only a potential for transcription and are not a reflection of the high transcriptional activity characteristic of retroviruses.","['Rasmussen, J A', 'Gilboa, E']","['Rasmussen JA', 'Gilboa E']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.61.5.1368-1374.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1987 May;61(5):1368-74. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.5.1368-1374.1987.,,,,PMC254111,,,,,,

However, because of the multiple pharmacologic and hematologic variables present in these patients, the exact contribution of L-asparaginase to these coagulation abnormalities is unclear. We studied platelet function and plasma coagulation parameters in 12 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving daily L-asparaginase as a single agent when in complete remission. Changes in the prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and fibrinogen, while statistically significant, remained within or close to the normal range during the study. Platelet function also remained normal during the study. In contrast, levels of protein C antigen decreased to a mean of 42%, a significant change from pretreatment values. Levels of antithrombin III (AT III) were likewise depressed to 15 mg/dL (34% of pretreatment value).

Incorporation of [14C]acetate into a mammary carcinoma FM3A was also stimulated by AF. In contrast, AF stimulated uptake of methylglucose in all cell lines tested. The effect of AF was further studied using mouse myeloid leukemia, M1 cells. AF slightly stimulated the incorporation of [14C]acetate into undifferentiated M1 cells, and strongly stimulated that of hydrocortisone-differentiated M1 cells. In contrast, AF suppressed the incorporation of [14C]acetate into retinoic acid-differentiated M1 cells. Glucose consumption of these three types of M1 cells was all stimulated.

Overall, 3,157 second cancers were observed, as compared with 2,420 expected at least one year after the first cancer. Survivors of testicular and ovarian cancer experienced 30% and 20% more cancers respectively than the general population comparison group, and patients previously diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease had an 80% excess of cancer. No information was available either on treatment for the first cancer, or other risk factors. However, temporal patterns in the risk of specific second cancers were analysed, with particular reference to the possible role of therapy for the first cancer. Leukaemia of the acute or non-lymphatic type, which has been previously linked to alkylating agent therapy, occurred in excess following all 3 first cancers, as did non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (overall relative risks of 6.1 and 1.8 respectively, with considerably higher relative risks following Hodgkin's disease). Other cancers for which important and plausibly therapy-induced excesses occurred were lung cancer following Hodgkin's disease (relative risk 1.9), breast cancer following Hodgkin's disease (relative risk 1.4) and bladder cancer following ovarian cancer and Hodgkin's disease (relative risks 1.7 and 2.2 in women, respectively). Rarer sites at which striking excesses occurred were the salivary gland, thyroid, bone and connective tissue. There were smaller, but clear excesses for cancers of the rectum and colon following ovarian cancer and testicular cancer, skin cancer following Hodgkin's disease, and kidney cancer following ovarian cancer. Overdiagnosis, misclassification of metastases and confounding by other risk factors were all considered as explanations of observed excesses. Nonetheless, it appeared that there are clear excess risks for cancers other than acute leukaemia which must be ascribed to therapy for the first cancer, especially in view of the possible under-reporting in registry material.

Chromosomal aberrations are therefore likely to exist in the majority of HCL patients. Separation of HCL cells into sheep erythrocyte rosette and non rosette forming cells revealed similar DNA abnormalities in both cell populations, suggesting that the leukemia encompasses cells with B and with T markers.","['Arrenbrecht, S', 'Heider, S']","['Arrenbrecht S', 'Heider S']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Monocytes/analysis', 'Ploidies', 'Spleen/analysis']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900050102 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1987 Jan-Mar;5(1):1-7. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900050102.,,,,,,,,,,

Cytostatics with strong SCE-inducing ability (melphalan, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide + vincristine + 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide + vincristine + procarbazid + prednisolone) usually exhibited a longlasting SCE elevation. Cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea, vincristine, 5-fluorouracil, tamoxifen, and azathioprine did not induce SCEs. These data were compared with the leukemogenic potential of the same drugs in order to validate the relevance of SCE studies in man to signal carcinogenic hazards. It was found that over 80% of all secondary leukemias (collected from the world literature from 1930 to 1980) were preceded by the administration of cytotoxic compounds inducing long-lasting SCE elevation in lymphocytes. Only 3% of all secondary leukemias can be attributed to drugs not inducing SCEs in vivo in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes. This indicates that the lesions important for SCEs and secondary leukemias to emerge bear close biological similarities.

Ara-AIPy inhibited the growth of L1210 leukemia when both the tumor transplantation and the drug treatment were administered by iv route (500 mg/kg on Days 1, 5, and 9; ILS, 181%). The routes of administration of ara-AIPy experiments showed that the drug was effective by both ip and iv routes of administration; however, better therapeutic values were obtained by ip schedules. These studies demonstrate that ara-AIPy exhibits highly significant and broad-spectrum antitumor activity against a variety of experimental animal tumor models and suggest a possible future role for this drug in the treatment of human neoplasia.","['Furusawa, S', 'Mian, A M']","['Furusawa S', 'Mian AM']",['eng'],"['CA-14395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '10212-22-3 (araAIPy)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1987 May;71(5):441-6.,,,,,,,,,,

Since those dose levels were lethal to the host mice, tumor response was based on the results of in vivo bioassays of spleen and/or tumor from drug-treated and control mice. When mice bearing about 10(8) drug-sensitive leukemic cells were treated with a single, conventional (approximately 10% lethal) dose of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, L-phenylalanine mustard (melphalan), or 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, 10(1) to 10(4) tumor cells were recovered by bioassay. Treatment at doses that were 2 to 8 times the 10% lethal dose of either of those drugs resulted in no recoverable cells and survival of all bioassay recipient mice. Mice bearing advanced L1210 leukemia resistant to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (L1210/DDPt), 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (L1210/BCNU), cyclophosphamide (L1210/CPA), or melphalan(L1210/L-PAM) also were treated with a 10% lethal dose and greater doses of the drug to which the tumor line was resistant. Bioassay results indicated a direct correlation between dose intensity and tumor cell kill, the response being linear. Similarly, when mice with L1210/BCNU were treated with high doses of N-(2-chloroethyl)-N''-(2,6-dioxo-3-piperidinyl)-N-nitrosourea or 1,1',1''-phosphinothioylidynetrisaziridine (thioTEPA) and when mice with L1210/DDPt were treated with cyclophosphamide, an increasing, linear cell kill resulted throughout the high-dose range. Overall, these results indicate that resistance to these alkylating agents can be overcome by dose intensification and that the tumor response is linear in relation to increasing dose level.","['Griswold, D P Jr', 'Trader, M W', 'Frei, E 3rd', 'Peters, W P', 'Wolpert, M K', 'Laster, W R Jr']","['Griswold DP Jr', 'Trader MW', 'Frei E 3rd', 'Peters WP', 'Wolpert MK', 'Laster WR Jr']",['eng'],"['1PO1-CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-47580/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Biological Assay', 'Carmustine/therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1987/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 May 1;47(9):2323-7.,,,,,,,,,,

Because of its potential clinical application, we evaluated the ability of verapamil to modulate the effect of ADR and vinblastine on the in vitro cloning of fresh human tumor cells. Fifty-three tumors were cloned in a soft agar system. Continuous exposure to verapamil at concentrations of 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 micrograms/ml, did not significantly modulate the overall inhibitory activity of ADR and vinblastine (P greater than 0.05). There was no evidence of an effect when results were analyzed by tumor type or previous treatment except in the subgroup of 13 tumors obtained from patients who previously had a clinical response to ADR but were relapsing at the time the tumor specimen was obtained. In this population, at three concentrations of ADR, there was a significant modulation of drug effect (P = 0.10, 0.03, 0.03, respectively). In each subgroup, some tumors showed marked modulation of drug effect by verapamil. These results suggest that the mechanisms of acquired in vivo resistance to ADR may be similar to those occurring in cell lines. However, the effect on human tumors was minor as compared to the results with cell lines. The in vivo significance of this finding remains to be determined.","['Goodman, G E', 'Yen, Y P', 'Cox, T C', 'Crowley, J']","['Goodman GE', 'Yen YP', 'Cox TC', 'Crowley J']",['eng'],['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mesothelioma/drug therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Uterine Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Verapamil/*therapeutic use', 'Vinblastine/*therapeutic use']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 May 1;47(9):2295-304.,,,,,,,,,,

NB in situ, sometimes observed in the adrenal glands of autopsied infants, is considered to be a premalignant lesion that may develop into NB. Little is understood about the morphological and biochemical changes that accompany this malignant progression. In this study, a unique monoclonal antibody, KP-NAC8, raised against a human NB cell line is described. This binds to NB cells but not to fetal neuroblasts. The antibody recognizes a Mr 200,000 surface protein on NB cells. KP-NAC8 binds to 15 of 17 human NB cell lines and all 26 fresh NB samples either from tumor tissues or from marrow aspirates involved with tumor. The antibody was found to cross-react with some other tumor cell lines, namely, Ewing's sarcoma (1 of 2), melanoma (1 of 4), lung cancer (3 of 3), and leukemia (2 of 14) cell lines. However, KP-NAC8 did not bind to any rhabdomyosarcoma (0 of 4), Wilms' tumor (0 of 4), retinoblastoma (0 of 2), glioma (0 of 4), and gastric cancer (0 of 2) cell lines examined. Among fetal tissues, KP-NAC8 did not react with normal neuroblasts in the adrenal glands of 5 fetuses. In a further study, the membrane phenotype of fetal adrenal neuroblasts was analyzed by a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies including KP-NAC8. A comparison of the binding of the same panel of antibodies to fresh NB revealed that antibodies UJ13A, UJ127:11, PI153/3, anti-Thy-1, A2B5, BA-1, BA-2, HSAN1.2, and Leu-7 bound to both fetal adrenal neuroblasts and NB cells. Monoclonal antibodies OKIa-1 and J5 did not bind to either tissues. The only antibody that could distinguish fetal adrenal neuroblasts from NB cells was KP-NAC8. KP-NAC8 may, therefore, define a differentiation-related antigen that may prove helpful in understanding the biological nature of NB and NB in situ.","['Matsumura, T', 'Sugimoto, T', 'Sawada, T', 'Amagai, T', 'Negoro, S', 'Kemshead, J T']","['Matsumura T', 'Sugimoto T', 'Sawada T', 'Amagai T', 'Negoro S', 'Kemshead JT']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,"['Adrenal Glands/cytology/embryology/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/immunology', 'Neuroblastoma/*immunology', 'Neurons/*immunology']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jun 1;47(11):2924-30.,,,,,,,,,,

In this work we have tried to characterize the DNA alteration induced by LCA in cells grown in vitro and in nuclei. Confirming previous findings, a clear increase in elution rate was observed at both alkaline and neutral pH. The extent of the increase was very similar at the two pHs. However, an increased elution rate could be observed only when lysing the nuclei at high ionic strength and low detergent concentration (2 M NaCl + 0.2% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt). No effect could be observed when the nuclei were lysed with a high detergent concentration (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate). In addition, a slight effect could be observed using a method for the evaluation of DNA unwinding in alkali. After termination of the incubation with LCA, the DNA alteration observed with DNA elution disappeared very rapidly both in intact cells and nuclei, even when the incubation buffer was totally unsuitable for the repair of the type of DNA damage induced by typical genotoxic agents. The effect of LCA on DNA was apparently not mediated through an inhibition of topoisomerase II. Only the intact chromatin of nuclei was responsive, not the quasinaked DNA of nuclei lysed at high ionic strength. We advance the hypothesis that the increased alkaline and neutral elution rate observed with LCA could be independent of DNA fragmentation and related to changes in chromatin structure.","['Russo, P', 'Taningher, M', 'Pala, M', 'Pisano, V', 'Pedemonte, P', 'De Angeli, M T', 'Carlone, S', 'Santi, L', 'Parodi, S']","['Russo P', 'Taningher M', 'Pala M', 'Pisano V', 'Pedemonte P', 'De Angeli MT', 'Carlone S', 'Santi L', 'Parodi S']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', '5QU0I8393U (Lithocholic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cricetinae', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lithocholic Acid/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters/pharmacology']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jun 1;47(11):2866-74.,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, N1,N4-bis(ethyl)putrescine (BEP) and N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine (BESm) were compared with N1,N8-bis(ethyl)spermidine (BES) in their ability to inhibit cell growth and regulate polyamine biosynthesis. With cultured L1210 murine leukemia cells, the IC50 values at 48 h were approximately 2 mM for BEP, 30 microM for BES, and 1 microM for BESm making the latter the most effective polyamine inhibitor or analogue thus far identified. At concentrations which approximated IC50 values and yielded similar intracellular concentrations at 48 h (1500-2000 pmol/10(6) cells), the effects of the analogues on polyamine biosynthesis generally correlated with their antiproliferative activity. BEP, at 1 mM, exerted relatively minor effects on polyamine biosynthesis. By contrast, 100 microM BES totally eliminated ornithine decarboxylase activity, depleted putrescine and spermidine pools, and decreased spermine pools by 40%. AdoMet decarboxylase activity was lowered slightly. The most impressive effects were obtained with 10 microM BESm which decreased ornithine and AdoMet decarboxylase activities by 99 and 84%, respectively; depleted putrescine and spermidine pools; and decreased spermine pools by 73%. None of the analogues, at 1 or 3 mM, had significant direct inhibitory effects on the decarboxylase activities from untreated cells with the exception of BESm which inhibited ornithine but not AdoMet decarboxylase activity. Thus, the effects of the analogues on these enzymes in treated cells are presumed to be mainly mediated by regulatory mechanisms. In this regard, BESm was superior to BES since both ornithine and AdoMet decarboxylase activities were suppressed. Given its unique activities, BESm would seem to have potential as both an antiproliferative agent and also as an experimental probe for studying regulation of the polyamine pathway, particularly AdoMet decarboxylase.","['Porter, C W', 'McManis, J', 'Casero, R A', 'Bergeron, R J']","['Porter CW', 'McManis J', 'Casero RA', 'Bergeron RJ']",['eng'],"['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '27431-62-5 (N(1),N(4)-diethylputrescine)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '61345-84-4 (N(1), N(12)-diethylspermine)', '97141-40-7 (N(1),N(8)-diethylspermidine)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/*biosynthesis', 'Putrescine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Spermidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jun 1;47(11):2821-5.,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that Urd uptake by isolated murine splenocytes is concentrative, and that the rate of uptake from medium containing 10 to 500 microM [3H]Urd conforms to a process that is saturable with a Km of 38.0 +/- 4.1 (SE) microM and Vmax of 2.70 +/- 0.27 pmol/s/microliter cell water. Other ribosyl and deoxyribosyl pyrimidine nucleosides or their analogues were not concentrated by splenocytes; however, ribosyl and deoxyribosyl purine nucleosides and, to a lesser extent, deoxyuridine did inhibit Urd uptake. In this system Urd uptake was not inhibited by 1 microM nitrobenzylthioinosine or 10 microM dipyridamole but was significantly inhibited by 5 mM NaN3 or 250 microM KCN. Transport of Urd involves Na+ cotransport as evidenced by complete inhibition when Na+ is replaced by Li+ in the incubation medium, and it is also inhibited by 3 mM ouabain. Active Urd transport coexists with the nonspecific, carrier mediated, facilitated diffusion of nucleosides as demonstrated by the inhibition of Urd efflux and thymidine influx in splenocytes by nitrobenzylthioinosine and dipyridamole. Under identical conditions, Urd entry into L1210 leukemia cells was nonconcentrative and non-Na+ dependent but inhibited by nitrobenzylthionosine. That nucleosides enter most cultured neoplastic cell lines by facilitated diffusion and not the active transport mechanism for Urd confirms earlier findings and may represent an exploitable target for chemotherapy.","['Darnowski, J W', 'Holdridge, C', 'Handschumacher, R E']","['Darnowski JW', 'Holdridge C', 'Handschumacher RE']",['eng'],"['CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Spleen/*cytology/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Uridine/*metabolism']",1987/05/15 00:00,1987/05/15 00:01,['1987/05/15 00:00'],"['1987/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 May 15;47(10):2614-9.,,,,,,,,,,

A diagnosis of RA was seen more frequently among patients with 17p-, also. 17p- alone was not related to progression to RA with an excess of blasts (RAEB). The occurrence of 8p- was statistically significantly related to a higher initial frequency of bone marrow myeloblasts (p = 0.05), but not to bone marrow cellularity or initial granulocytopenia. 8p- alone was not related to initial diagnosis, but a statistically significant relation to progression to RAEB was found (p = 0.05). 2p- was related to progression to RAEB, also (p = 0.02), but not to any of the other investigated parameters.

The simultaneous occurrence of 17p- and 8p- was also statistically significantly related to progression to RAEB (p = 0.02).

Analysis of these points suggests that the 5q- alteration can represent an early mutation conferring a slow capacity of expansion to the affected clones, with the possibility of cytogenetic evolution during the progression of the disease (about 30% of the patients).

All the DNA-methylases under study methylate in vitro bacterial and animal DNAs of different base composition; bacterial DNAs are the best (GC content is approximately 70%), while homologous DNAs- the worst acceptors of CH3-groups. Heat-denaturated DNAs are methylated more intensively than initial DNAs. The optimal NaCl concentration in the reaction mixture is approximately 50 mM; EDTA (greater than 10 mM) inhibits the reaction. DNA-methylase I of leukemic and normal lymphocytes show the same pH optimum and specificity of action. In vitro methylation of bacterial DNA by these DNA-methylases in the presence of [3H-methyl]S-adenosylmethionine results in the similar type of label distribution among pyrimidine isopliths in the DNA. DNA-methylase II from leukemic lymphocytes methylates about two times more Pu-C-Pu sequences in th same DNA than does DNA-methylase I from leukemic and normal lymphocytes and thus reveals a different specificity.

Studies on the mechanism of action of 5-FU have been focused on the inhibition of DNA synthesis, and it has been reported that 5-FU inhibits the growth of thymidylate synthesis deleted FM3A Thy 21 cells even in the presence of thymidine, and that the level of TTP is equal to that in control cells. On the other hand, the active metabolite of 5-FU, FdUMP, is known to bind to synthesized thymidylate and 5, 10-methylene-tetrahydrofolic acid to form a ternary complex. Recently, the cytocidal effect of 5-FU was observed in thymidylate synthetase-deficient cells in the presence of a sufficient amount of thymidine, suggesting that the cytocidal effect of 5-FU might be caused by inhibition of the RNA pathway. In this laboratory, the effect of 5-FU on polysomal patterns and the incorporation of 3H-UR into polysomes was studied in L1210 cells, but no significant difference was observed between normal and 5-FU-treated cells. Ribosomal RNA extracted from the polysomes of 5-FU treated cells appeared to contain a smaller 28S rRNA in comparison to 18S rRNA, indicating that the processing might be inhibited. Expression of mouse H-2Dd mRNA was not influenced by 5-FU at 10(-5) M up to 6 h. Methotrexate (MTX) has a chemical structure similar to folic acid, and is known to bind to DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase), and inhibit the synthesis of TMP. The cellular PRPP content is known to be increased by MTX, which inhibits purine synthesis. The level of PRPP content was found to be increased approximately 25 fold at 3 h after 10(-6) M MTX although normal bone marrow cells showed no increase even after MTX. This increased level of PRPP thus obtained in cancer cells was thought to be used for the phosphorylation of 5-FU. Clinically, sequential chemotherapy using MTX and 5-FU was employed successfully for solid tumors on the basis of the experimental evidence. In order to minimize the adverse effects of anti-cancer drugs, a technique involving the incorporation of the drug-resistant gene into normal bone marrow cells has been designed in this laboratory, and the MTX-resistant cells thus obtained are transplanted into the tumor-bearing mice.","['Kanamaru, R', 'Kakuta, H', 'Sato, T', 'Ishioka, C', 'Konishi, Y', 'Wakui, A', 'Dei, T']","['Kanamaru R', 'Kakuta H', 'Sato T', 'Ishioka C', 'Konishi Y', 'Wakui A', 'Dei T']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

It was shown that RCH was actually equal to rubomycin by its selective activity against lymphadenosis NK/Ly and sarcoma 180 on its 4- and 2-fold intravenous administration, respectively. RCH was superior to rubomycin by its selective activity against lymphosarcoma LIO-1 and Ehrlich carcinoma and was more efficient in treatment of hemocytoblastosis La. RCH was inferior to rubomycin by its efficacy in treatment of lymphadenosis NK/Ly on its 2-fold oral administration and against leukemia P-388 on its 2-fold intravenous administration.

The intraventricular route, however, is associated with a higher incidence of infectious complications compared with therapy given by the lumbar route. To characterize the infectious complications associated with such reservoirs, we reviewed the 10-year experience of the Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and Children's Orthopedic Hospital, Seattle, WA, with 61 patients (49 with leukemia, 8 with lymphoma, 4 with solid tumors) who had intraventricular reservoirs placed for administration of chemotherapy. The reservoirs were in place for a median of 36 weeks and were punctured a median of 29.5 times, Infectious complications occurred in 14 of 61 patients (23%) and Propionibacterium acnes was the most common organism recovered from cultures. Twelve patients (19.7%) had 19 episodes of clinically suspected and microbiologically documented meningitis or of positive intraventricular reservoir cerebrospinal fluid cultures without symptoms which were treated successfully. Local cellulitis occurred at the site of intraventricular reservoir placement in 2 patients (3.3%) and removal of the intraventricular reservoir was necessary for successful management. Nine patients had their intraventricular reservoir removed (5 because of associated infection and 4 because of malfunction unassociated with infection).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Browne, M J', 'Dinndorf, P A', 'Perek, D', 'Commers, J', 'Bleyer, W A', 'Poplack, D G', 'Pizzo, P A']","['Browne MJ', 'Dinndorf PA', 'Perek D', 'Commers J', 'Bleyer WA', 'Poplack DG', 'Pizzo PA']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology', 'Cellulitis/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intraventricular/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Meningitis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*complications']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006454-198702000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 1987 Feb;6(2):182-9. doi: 10.1097/00006454-198702000-00008.,,,,,,,,,,

Cytostatic effect of benfluron on human leukemic cells in vitro.,45-54,"Benfluoron (BF), a new cytostatic drug, synthesized at the Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry in Prague, was tested for its cytostatic and cytotoxic effect. The concentrations of BF ranging from 0.1-2 micrograms/ml had a significant cytostatic effect on nine stabilized human leukemic cell lines. This effect was demonstrated by cell counts, cell viability and 3H-thymidine incorporation. The BF concentrations of 2 micrograms/ml and higher were considerably cytostatic causing the cell death and cell degradation. The effect of BF on the cell growth being irreversible could not be eliminated by washing the cells and recultivating them in fresh medium. The BF concentrations halving the total number of viable cells (EC50 value) induced a higher cytotoxicity in lymphoblastoid cell lines then in myeloid ones. BF did not influence the binding of monoclonal antibodies with membrane markers of different cell subpopulations. Prospective application of BF as a cytostatic and immunosuppressive drug is discussed.","['Soucek, J', 'Stockbauer, P', 'Melka, M', 'Koubek, K', 'Chudomel, V', 'Krepelka, J']","['Soucek J', 'Stockbauer P', 'Melka M', 'Koubek K', 'Chudomel V', 'Krepelka J']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '78250-23-4 (VUFB 13468)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Fluorenes/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1987;34(1):45-54.,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated levels of a serum protein in CF homozygotes and obligate heterozygotes have been described. As heterozygotes are clinically unaffected, any consistently observed abnormality in these individuals is a likely pointer to the aetiology of the disease. The gene for this serum protein, called cystic fibrosis (CF) antigen, has been mapped to chromosome 1. It is not the gene that is mutant in CF because this has since been assigned to chromosome 7 by cosegregation of the disease with closely linked DNA markers in CF families. CF antigen is a product of normal and leukaemic granulocytes and is inducible in the promyelocytic cell line HL60 (M.N., J.D., C. Hayward, F. Northrop, D.J.H.B., J. Walker, V. van H. and D.S.S., manuscript in preparation). We have isolated cDNA clones for this protein from a library constructed with messenger RNA from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells. The complete nucleotide sequence was obtained from the cDNA clone and by primer extension of mRNA. We have confirmed that the gene encoding CF antigen is on chromosome 1 and have localized it to a particular region. RNA blot analysis shows a 550-bp major transcript in CML cells and in induced HL60. The amino-acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence shows significant homology with intestinal and brain calcium-binding proteins. Abnormal accumulation of such a protein in CF is a clue which must be pursued now that evidence is gathering that the basic defect in CF is in pathways controlling chloride channel activity.","['Dorin, J R', 'Novak, M', 'Hill, R E', 'Brock, D J', 'Secher, D S', 'van Heyningen, V']","['Dorin JR', 'Novak M', 'Hill RE', 'Brock DJ', 'Secher DS', 'van Heyningen V']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (cystic fibrosis serum factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Calgranulin A', 'Chlorides/metabolism', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Cystic Fibrosis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1987/04/09 00:00,1987/04/09 00:01,['1987/04/09 00:00'],"['1987/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/326614a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1987 Apr 9-15;326(6113):614-7. doi: 10.1038/326614a0.,,,,,['GENBANK/Y00278'],,,,,

An epidemiologic risk assessment.,1044-50,"To assess quantitatively the association between benzene exposure and leukemia, we examined the mortality rate of a cohort with occupational exposure to benzene. Cumulative exposure for each cohort member was estimated from historical air-sampling data and, when no sampling data existed, from interpolation on the basis of existing data. The overall standardized mortality ratio (a measure of relative risk multiplied by 100) for leukemia was 337 (95 percent confidence interval, 154 to 641), and that for multiple myeloma was 409 (95 percent confidence interval, 110 to 1047). With stratification according to levels of cumulative exposure, the standardized mortality ratios for leukemia increased from 109 to 322, 1186, and 6637 with increases in cumulative benzene exposure from less than 40 parts per million-years (ppm-years), to 40 to 199, 200 to 399, and 400 or more, respectively. A cumulative benzene exposure of 400 ppm-years is equivalent to a mean annual exposure of 10 ppm over a 40-year working lifetime; 10 ppm is the currently enforceable standard in the United States for occupational exposure to benzene. To examine the shape of the exposure-response relation, we performed a conditional logistic-regression analysis, in which 10 controls were matched to each cohort member with leukemia. From this model, it can be calculated that protection from benzene-induced leukemia would increase exponentially with any reduction in the permissible exposure limit.","['Rinsky, R A', 'Smith, A B', 'Hornung, R', 'Filloon, T G', 'Young, R J', 'Okun, A H', 'Landrigan, P J']","['Rinsky RA', 'Smith AB', 'Hornung R', 'Filloon TG', 'Young RJ', 'Okun AH', 'Landrigan PJ']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzene/*poisoning', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Ohio', 'Risk', 'Rubber']",1987/04/23 00:00,1987/04/23 00:01,['1987/04/23 00:00'],"['1987/04/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/23 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198704233161702 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1987 Apr 23;316(17):1044-50. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198704233161702.,,,,,,,,,,

Both loci were cloned, and the rearrangement breakpoint of the second EPO locus was located within a 1.1-kilobase region upstream of an otherwise apparently normal EPO gene. There are no viral sequences present in the immediate vicinity of the rearranged EPO gene. DNase I digestion studies suggest that the rearranged gene is in a region where the chromatin is more sensitive to DNase hydrolysis than is the site of the normal gene.

The distance of nucleoid sedimentation increased as a function of exposure temperature and exposure time, and was proportional to an increased protein to DNA ratio in the nucleoids. Studies in which control and hyperthermia-treated cells were mixed prior to nucleoid preparation indicated that the association of protein with the nucleoid occurred during hyperthermia treatment and not during nucleoid preparation. However, double-labelling studies suggested an interaction between control and hyperthermia-treated cells since the presence of control cells during lysis resulted in near normalization of nucleoid sedimentation. Treatment with proteinase K also restored the nucleoid sedimentation. Incubation at 37 degrees C following hyperthermia revealed a rapid restoration of nucleoid sedimentation and a slower restoration of the protein to DNA ratio. Ethidium bromide-induced changes in nucleoid sedimentation were altered by the hyperthermia-associated increased protein content of nucleoids and the alterations were overcome by enzymatic digestion of the protein prior to the ethidium bromide exposure. Thus, hyperthermia caused, and inhibited the repair of, an increased protein content of nucleoids. The restoration of the increased protein possibly occurs by a heat-sensitive proteolytic enzyme. The temporal use of an appropriate chemotherapy agent to inhibit the restoration of hyperthermia-associated changes may be a useful treatment option.","['Simpson, T A Jr', 'LaRussa, P G', 'Mullins, D W Jr', 'Daugherty, J P']","['Simpson TA Jr', 'LaRussa PG', 'Mullins DW Jr', 'Daugherty JP']",['eng'],['CA-13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Hyperthermia,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",8508395,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Nucleoproteins/*metabolism']",1987/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02656738709140372 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hyperthermia. 1987 Jan-Feb;3(1):49-62. doi: 10.3109/02656738709140372.,,,,,,,,,,

Whole blood (0.1 ml) was examined directly and results were obtained within 20 minutes. Phagocytic function of granulocytes can be estimated from the peak CL of whole blood and the number of granulocytes in a specimen, and the opsonin activity from the amount of time the peak CL is shown after the addition of nonopsonized CL inducer (nonopsonized zymosan). Subsequently, whole blood CL was measured to evaluate phagocytic functions in children with disease. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease showed no CL, and one of their mothers (1/3) showed low CL, suggesting she is a carrier. Two patients with hypocomplementemia (SLE and chronic nephritis) showed low serum opsonin activity, and phagocytic function of their granulocytes was enhanced. In cord blood and newborn infants serum opsonin activity was low, and phagocytic function of granulocytes was slightly decreased in cord blood but not in newborn infants. Patients with systemic bacterial infections showed an increased phagocytic function of granulocytes. Anti-cancer drugs decreased serum opsonin activity in children with leukemia or lymphoma. The children treated with L-asparaginase had very low opsonin activity, suggesting the drug inhibits complement synthesis.

The percentage of S-phase cells obtained from the biopsies (mean, 20%) were significantly higher (P = .00003) than those determined from the bone marrow (BM) aspirates (mean, 9%). The post-BrdU infusion BM aspirates from 40 patients were incubated with tritiated thymidine in vitro. These double-labeled slides were utilized to determine the duration of S-phase (Ts) in myeloblasts and their total cell cycle time (Tc). The Ts varied from four to 49 hours (mean, 19 hours; median, 17 hours). Similarly, there were wide variations in Tc of individual patients ranging from 16 to 292 hours (mean, 93 hours; median, 76 hours). There was no relationship between Tc and the percentage of S-phase cells, but there was a good correlation between Tc and Ts (r = .8). Patients with relapsed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) appeared to have a longer Ts and Tc than those studied at initial diagnosis. A subgroup of patients at either extreme of Tc were identified who demonstrated clinically documented resistance in response to multiple courses of chemotherapy. We conclude that Ts and Tc provide additional biologic information that may be valuable in understanding the variations observed in the natural history of ANLL.","['Raza, A', 'Maheshwari, Y', 'Preisler, H D']","['Raza A', 'Maheshwari Y', 'Preisler HD']",['eng'],"['CA 28734-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41285-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Cycle', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78541-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jun;69(6):1647-53.,,,,,,,,,,

Ultrasonography is the method of choice for determination of the position, shape, size and volume of the spleen, and also for the diagnosis of changes within the spleen. Circumscribed lesions cannot be detected by ultrasonography until they have reached a size of 0.5-1.0 cm; the same limit of detection applies for CT, which has approximately the same diagnostic reliability. In the presence of generalized splenic disease (e.g. splenomegaly in myeloid leukaemia) imaging procedures are being used increasingly for staging and for monitoring of the results of treatment. Perhaps in future histochemical determinations made with the aid of core-spin spectroscopy will present a further means of diagnosis without the necessity for biopsy. Angiography was the leading diagnostic technique for spleen conditions for many years, and continues to occupy this place for primary disease of the spleen (aneurysm, arterioportal fistula, haemangioma); it is currently gaining in importance with the advent of therapeutic embolization as an option. For diffuse spleen disease and also for circumscribed lesions, however, it has now been superseded by the non-invasive methods of diagnosis.","['Wenz, W', 'Bodendorfer, G']","['Wenz W', 'Bodendorfer G']",['ger'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Radiologe,Der Radiologe,0401257,,IM,"['Angiography', 'Hematoma/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Spleen/abnormalities', 'Splenic Artery/diagnostic imaging', 'Splenic Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Splenic Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Splenic Rupture/diagnosis', 'Splenic Vein/diagnostic imaging', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiologe. 1987 Jan;27(1):11-9.,Moderne bildgebende Verfahren bei Milzerkrankungen.,,,,,,,,,

Such a factor may be the white blood cell (WBC) count. Epidemiologic studies have shown correlations between the WBC count and the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. The risk of acute myocardial infarction is approximately four times as great in persons with WBC counts high in the normal range (greater than 9000/microL [9 X 10(9)/L]) as in persons with WBC counts low in the normal range (less than 6000/microL [6 X 10(9)/L]); only 50% to 65% of the excess risk of the high-count individuals is explainable by tobacco smoking (which covaries with WBC count). A high WBC count also predicts greater risk of reinfarction and of in-hospital death. Less rigorously studied, the constitutional neutropenia of Yemenite Jews appears to afford protection against atherosclerotic disease. Among WBC types, the strongest epidemiologic association has been with the neutrophil count. Such a predictive value of WBC count is plausible and satisfying, because WBCs make a major contribution to the rheologic properties of blood; alter adhesive properties under stress--including the stress of ischemia, enhancing their rheologic importance; and participate in endothelial injury, both acutely and chronically, by adhering to endothelium and damaging it with toxic oxygen compounds and proteolytic enzymes. Techniques newly developed or under development may allow us to refine the predictive value of the WBC count by combining it with measures of cell activation and/or activatability.","['Ernst, E', 'Hammerschmidt, D E', 'Bagge, U', 'Matrai, A', 'Dormandy, J A']","['Ernst E', 'Hammerschmidt DE', 'Bagge U', 'Matrai A', 'Dormandy JA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Blood Vessels/physiology', 'Brain Ischemia/blood', 'Coronary Disease/blood', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/blood', 'Ischemia/*blood/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/blood', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Risk', 'Smoking', 'Stress, Physiological/blood']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,JAMA. 1987 May 1;257(17):2318-24.,,,,,,,82,,,

Comparison with v-fes and v-fps revealed that all v-fes/fps homologous sequences were dispersed over 11 kilobase pairs in 19 interspersed segments. All segments, numbered exon 1 to exon 19 as in the chicken and human loci, were flanked by consensus splice junctions. The putative promoter region contained a CATT sequence and three CCGCCC motifs which were also found in the human locus at similar positions. About 200 nucleotides downstream of a translational stop codon in exon 19, a putative poly(A) addition signal was identified. Using the putative translation initiation codon in exon 2, a 93,000-molecular-weight protein could be deduced. This protein resembled very well the putative protein of the human c-fes/fps proto-oncogene (94% overall homology) and, although less well, the putative protein of the chicken c-fes/fps proto-oncogene (70% overall homology). As far as the feline c-fes/fps proto-oncogene sequences transduced to the Gardner-Arnstein (GA) and Snyder-Theilen (ST) strains of feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) are concerned, homology in deduced amino acid sequences between the GA- and ST-v-fes viral oncogenes and the proto-oncogene was 99%. Analysis of the recombination junctions between feline leukemia virus and v-fes sequences in GA- and ST-FeSV proviral DNA revealed for the left-hand junction the involvement of homologous recombination, presumably at the DNA level. The right-hand junction, which appeared identical in the GA-FeSV and ST-FeSV genomes, could have been the result of a site-specific recombination at the RNA level.","['Roebroek, A J', 'Schalken, J A', 'Onnekink, C', 'Bloemers, H P', 'Van de Ven, W J']","['Roebroek AJ', 'Schalken JA', 'Onnekink C', 'Bloemers HP', 'Van de Ven WJ']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '110736-90-8 (proto-oncogene protein c-fes-fps)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats/*genetics', 'Chickens/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Genes', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncogenes', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.61.6.2009-2016.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Jun;61(6):2009-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.6.2009-2016.1987.,,,,PMC254210,"['GENBANK/M16665', 'GENBANK/M16666', 'GENBANK/M16667', 'GENBANK/M16668', 'GENBANK/M16669', 'GENBANK/M16670', 'GENBANK/M16671', 'GENBANK/M16672', 'GENBANK/M16673', 'GENBANK/M16674', 'GENBANK/M16698', 'GENBANK/M16699', 'GENBANK/M16700', 'GENBANK/M16701', 'GENBANK/M16702', 'GENBANK/M16703', 'GENBANK/M16704', 'GENBANK/M16705', 'GENBANK/M16706']",,,,,

In the first stage of the trial, patients with unfavorable prognosis (PPR less than .40) received AMSA-OAP for remission induction and patients with favorable prognosis (PPR greater than or equal to .40) received Adriamycin [Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH] plus OAP (Ad-OAP). As AMSA-OAP was found to be promising in patients with unfavorable prognosis, it was administered to relatively more favorable patients (PPR less than .60) in the second stage of the trial and to all patients in the third stage. There were 242 patients entered into study; 134 received AMSA-OAP and 108 received Ad-OAP. Outcomes were compared with 242 paired patients who received Ad-OAP therapy from 1973 to 1977. The estimated complete remission rate in previously untreated adults with acute leukemia is 61% for patients receiving Ad-OAP (95% confidence interval, 59% to 64%). Overall, the survival experience for the 242 patients on DT7995 was significantly better than that in the control series (P = .03), but there was no strong statistical evidence (P = .10) that the 134 patients receiving AMSA-OAP had better survival than control patients receiving Ad-OAP, with a median of 32 v 21 weeks, respectively. It is concluded that AMSA-OAP is equivalent to Ad-OAP in the induction of complete remissions (estimated complete remission rate, 61%) and that assignment of patients to treatment based on predicted prognosis is an ethical and efficient strategy for the evaluation of new therapies in previously untreated patients with acute leukemia.","['Keating, M J', 'Gehan, E A', 'Smith, T L', 'Estey, E H', 'Walters, R S', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'McCredie, K B', 'Freireich, E J']","['Keating MJ', 'Gehan EA', 'Smith TL', 'Estey EH', 'Walters RS', 'Kantarjian HM', 'McCredie KB', 'Freireich EJ']",['eng'],['CA28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'AMSA-OAP protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amsacrine/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.5.710 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 May;5(5):710-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.5.710.,,,,,,,,,,

Any therapy should therefore, include participation in a well designed clinical trial. The MDS include patients with a variety of prognoses. Since most studies show that death from infection and bleeding are more likely than progression to frank leukaemia, attention to supportive care is crucial for all patients with MDS. Some patients with MDS may be successfully supported with transfusions and observation for prolonged periods. Patients with significant comorbid disease or patients without increased marrow myeloblasts are good candidates for this conservative approach. Conversely, young patients have a better likelihood of benefit from aggressive therapy, and intensive chemotherapy or allogenic bone marrow transplantation should be considered. Patients with preleukaemia related to prior cytotoxic therapy are another poor prognosis group for whom aggressive therapy may be the best alternative. Therapy with low-dose ara-C or other differentiating agents should be considered investigational and unproven until comparative trials can demonstrate a definitive survival advantage.

A high percentage of the 2 MDS convert to AL. Survival of either is less than 1 year. A constellation of morphological abnormalities from all three cell lines produces a unique appearance. The 2 AL are difficult to classify by the FAB system. With the exception of cytogenetic analysis, the biology of 2 MDS/AL remains largely unexplored. Alterations of chromosomes 5 and 7 predominate, but other associated cytogenetical abnormalities are increasingly being recognized. A review of the development of 2 MDS/AL in a variety of primary diseases generates the following tentative conclusions: many of the commonly used alkylating agents, and the non-classical alkylating agent procarbazine, are leukaemogens; procarbazine is probably the important leukaemogen in the MOPP programme; cyclophosphamide appears to be a less potent leukaemogen than other alkylating agents; the method in which a drug is administered probably influences its leukaemogenic potential; the duration of therapy with a drug, or the total amount of drug delivered, is probably an important factor in leukaemogenesis; irradiation alone appears to be a weak leukaemogen; irradiation has little or no synergism with chemotherapy in leukaemogenesis; the older patient treated with leukaemogenic drugs is at substantial risk to develop a 2 MDS/AL; most studies show no plateau in the actuarial incidence of developing a 2 MDS/AL, despite lengthy follow-up. Benzene is the only chemical agent for which strong evidence of leukaemogenesis exists. Nonetheless, the similarities in the karyotypic alterations of leukaemic cells between those whose occupations expose them to chemical hazard and those who are exposed to cytotoxic agents lend support to the idea that more environmental leukaemogens have yet to be discovered. Aggressive therapy should be considered for a patient of any age with an adequate performance status and a diagnosis of secondary AL, especially if the karyotype in the malignant cell is predictive of a high response rate. The therapy of 2 MDS remains investigational. To mitigate the development of a leukaemic complication, maintenance therapy should be restricted to diseases in which its efficacy is established or to an investigational setting, and consideration of the leukaemogenic potential of equally effective regimens should be part of the therapeutic planning in the older patient.","['Levine, E G', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Levine EG', 'Bloomfield CD']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkylating Agents/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1986 Nov;15(4):1037-80.,,,,,,,155,,,

In a comparative study, DAPdR and deoxyguanosine gave similar results. A 50% inhibition of cell growth during a 72-h incubation was achieved with 0.14 mM DAPdR or 0.26 mM deoxyguanosine. Deoxycytidine rescued the L1210 cells from DAPdR and deoxyguanosine toxicity to the same extent. DAPdR and deoxyguanosine counteracted the toxic effects of mycophenolic acid with the same efficiency. While DAPdR was not metabolized to its 5'-triphosphate, 2,6-diaminopurine was converted to 2,6-diaminopurineriboside 5'-triphosphate in L1210 cells; accordingly 50% inhibition of cell growth occurred at 0.015 mM 2,6-diaminopurine. Combinations of DAPdR with erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine or deoxycoformycin resulted in antagonism instead of an expected synergism.

In particular, while the former is commonly thought to detect a transferrin receptor present on the cytoplasmic membrane of proliferating cells, the latter recognizes a nuclear antigen, which is expressed in G1, S, G2 and M phase of continuously cycling elements. To further verify their reliability, OKT9 and Ki-67 were applied to seven permanent cell lines (four myeloid and three B-lymphoblastoid) and 100 lymphoid tumours (70 non-Hodgkin's and 30 Hodgkin's lymphomas) phenotypically characterized on frozen sections. The results obtained showed that OKT9 and Ki-67 cannot be employed as equivalent means in assessing the growth fraction. In fact, OKT9 is directed to a transferrin receptor which is not only expressed by proliferating cells, but also by some resting elements. On the other hand, Ki-67 provides a nuclear, easily detectable positivity which is restricted to proliferating cells only. Therefore, it seems to represent the only monoclonal which can confidently be employed in the assessment of the growth fraction. Furthermore, the present study underlines that the immunocytochemical analysis of the proliferation rate in tumours gives similar information to the radionucleide uptake assay, while it represents a more sensitive method than the cytofluorimetric evaluation of the DNA content.","['Pileri, S', 'Gerdes, J', 'Rivano, M', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Magnani, M', 'Gobbi, M', 'Stein, H']","['Pileri S', 'Gerdes J', 'Rivano M', 'Tazzari PL', 'Magnani M', 'Gobbi M', 'Stein H']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06853.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Mar;65(3):271-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06853.x.,,,,,,,,,,

The role of post-induction chemotherapy is still controversial especially with regard to the maintenance chemotherapy. The German AML (acute myeloid leukemia) Cooperative Group started a cooperative multi-center comparative trial to evaluate the validity of maintenance chemotherapy in patients with AML. A complete remission rate of 61% was achieved. The median time to complete remission was 33 days, and a complete remission was obtained in 68% of responders after only 1 course of therapy. Patients in complete remission were eligible for randomization for TAD consolidation with or without monthly maintenance chemotherapy. The up-dated life-table analysis revealed a predicted rate of continuous complete remission at 2 1/2 years of 30% for the maintenance and 17% for the non-maintenance group of patients (p = 0.003). On the basis of these results post-induction myelosuppressive chemotherapy appears to be substantial for achieving long-term remissions in AML. In addition, consolidation chemotherapy together with monthly maintenance seems to be superior to consolidation in prolonging the remission duration. In adult ALL/AUL (acute lymphatic/undifferentiated leukemia) complete remission rates amount to 60-85% and remission durations of 9-25 months have been reported.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Schmidt, C G']",['Schmidt CG'],['ger'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']",Germany,Arzneimittelforschung,Arzneimittel-Forschung,0372660,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arzneimittelforschung. 1987 Feb;37(2A):279-87.,Neuere Aspekte in der Therapie maligner Systemerkrankungen: Hamoblastosen und maligne Lymphome.,,,,,,15,,,

Flow cytometric cell sorting was carried out for Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) and human leukemic bone marrow cells under sterile conditions using a supravital dye for DNA, 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). The fraction sorted for G0/G1 CHO cells was verified to be almost completely free of G2/M cells and partially cleared of S-phase cells. Cells sorted for G0/G1 fraction were successfully grown as colonies in culture for both CHO and human leukemic marrow cells. The plating efficiency of sorted cells was lower than that of unsorted cells, and the relative contribution of cell damage versus cell selection cannot be determined for this reduction of plating efficiency. The purity of sorted cells must still be improved, and the reason for reduced plating efficiency remains to be defined by further studies. Nonetheless this report represents initial data demonstrating the feasibility of combining two technologies: clonogenic assay and flow cytometric cell sorting based on DNA content. As such, it paves the way for a new approach to studying the cell cycle kinetics of clonogenic cell subpopulations of malignant tissues freshly obtained from patients.","['Park, C H', 'Kimler, B F', 'Smith, T K']","['Park CH', 'Kimler BF', 'Smith TK']",['eng'],"['CA 20717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S07 RR05373/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Methods', 'Ovary']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1987 Jan-Feb;7(1):129-32.,,,,,,,,,,

When a sufficient number of THP-1c12(-) cells was seeded in culture, the maximum cell density after 6 days of culture was 1 X 10(6)/ml with a doubling time of 30 hr. Transferrin showed a slight stimulative effect on the growth of THP-1c12(-) cells, but insulin did not. The surface profile of THP-1c12(-) was the same as that of THP-1c12(+), which possessed Mol. Mo5, LeuM3, My9 and Ia-like antigens as well as a large number of Fc receptors. Phagocytic ability with respect to IgG-coated sheep red blood cells was evident in both THP-1c12(+) and THP-1c12(-) cells.

Clearly, the range of essential knowledge extends to other disciplines including respiratory, cardiac, and renal medicine, with important contributions from microbiology, virology, dietetics and parenteral nutrition. The increasing cure rate achieved in haematological malignancy and the ever-widening indications for bone marrow transplantation require a dedicated and experienced group, able to handle all challenges. Integral to managing the complete patient, both through the acute phase and into periods of recovery and long-term rehabilitation, is inclusion of the paramedical specialists--social workers, occupational therapists, physical medicine physicians and physiotherapists.

In particular, the availability of murine monoclonal antibodies and recombinant biological response modifiers by genetic manipulation has made it possible to re-test abandoned concepts of adoptive humoral and cellular immunotherapy and to reconsider the biomodulation of the patient's immune system. Thus, the utilization of monoclonal antibodies to purge ex vivo autologous marrow from residual tumor cells has reached an advanced stage of clinical investigation in the field of autologous bone marrow transplantation for leukemia or lymphoma. Numerous promising clinical trials are being performed by the injection of monoclonal antibodies directed at tumor-associated antigens, coupled with cytotoxic agents (isotopes, drugs, toxins). In the area of recombinant technology, interferon-alpha has become the drug of choice for a particular form of chronic leukemia (hairy-cell leukemia). Interleukin-2 administered in conjunction with autologous activated lymphocytes has been shown to mediate significant anti-tumor activity in metastatic cancer patients.

In 1969, the primary screening on L1210 leukemia allowed to detect doxorubicin which is more active than daunorubicin and has been found clinically active on several human solid tumors. Therefore, L1210 leukemia appeared to be a useful model for evaluating experimental antitumor activity of anthracyclines, indicating a possible correlation between this model and the clinic. Analogs which are equally or more active than doxorubicin in the primary screening are tested in the secondary screening, then eventually in models of cardiotoxicity in order to evaluate their therapeutic index. The secondary screening includes murine solid tumors (B16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, mammary adenocarcinomas, colon adenocarcinomas 26 and 38) and human tumor xenografts into nude mice or under the renal capsule of normal mice (LX1, lung - CX1, colon - MX1, breast). Various tumor localizations (i.p., i.v., s.c., i.m., i.c.), various routes of administration (mainly i.v. and p.o.), various schedules of treatment (early or delayed, repeated or intermittent) and models of polychemotherapy are used to obtain a better evaluation of the compound. P388 leukemia resistant to doxorubicin is useful to test cross resistance in vivo and also to screen compounds able to reverse this phenomenon. Until now, 17 new anthracyclines have been introduced into clinical trials. Aclacinomycin has a different mechanism of action from that of doxorubicin (induction of tumor cell differentiation, inhibition of B and T suppressor lymphocytes); it is less myelotoxic and it is not mutagenic in vitro. THP-doxorubicin is more active than doxorubicin against L1210 leukemia and some solid tumors; it seems less cardiotoxic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fizames, C']",['Fizames C'],['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Pathol Biol (Paris),Pathologie-biologie,0265365,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pathol Biol (Paris). 1987 Jan;35(1):41-8.,Modeles d'etudes precliniques des anthracyclines.,,,,,,,,,

The relevance of these in vitro findings is considered in the in vivo situation. Resistance to anthracyclines is in part related to decrease accumulation and retention.

An eosinophilic subline of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia was the only cell type other than eosinophils to be recognized by the antibody. Because previous reports have described occult eosinophilic degranulation in tissues with a variety of pathological conditions, we immunostained cryostat sections of four consecutive lymph node biopsies of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease with the monoclonal antibody. Our objective was to characterize by immunohistology the eosinophilic infiltration in a lymphoma that frequently contains substantial numbers of eosinophils. In all four cases of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease, there was striking and extensive deposition of EPO in a dendritic pattern throughout the connective tissue and collagen bands. The extent of deposition of EPO in the bands far exceeded the degree of infiltration by intact eosinophils, as determined by examination of routinely stained tissue sections. A similar dendritic pattern was not observed in any of six benign lymph nodes that were immunostained for EPO. We conclude that the monoclonal antibody described in this report is specific for EPO and that eosinophils extensively degranulate and release EPO in the bands of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease.

A therapeutic dose of 100.5 to 150.1 mCi 131I on 9.9 to 16.9 mg of antibody was administered to five patients, with subsequent retreatment following plasmapheresis in three patients at the time of disease progression. All patients responded to their initial therapy and two patients responded to retreatment. Regression of skin lesions and peripheral adenopathy was witnessed. All patients reported resolution of their chronic pruritus. The duration of response ranged from 3 weeks to 3 months. Acute toxicity included fevers, pruritus, and mild dyspnea in two instances. Myelosuppression was seen in patients receiving the 144.7 mCi, 145.0 mCi, and 150.1 mCi 131I-T101 doses. Radioimmunodiagnostic and therapy studies included gamma scintigraphy, plasma, urinary, and wholebody antibody clearances, and biodistribution determined from skin, bone marrow, and liver biopsies. Immunologic studies included immunoperoxidase staining of target tissues, immunofluorescent flow cytometric analysis on peripheral blood and bone marrow, assays for serum blocking factors, determination of a human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response, and quantitation of circulating T101 levels. These preliminary data suggest that 131I-T101 has therapeutic potential in CTCL and that myelosuppression will be the limiting toxicity.","['Rosen, S T', 'Zimmer, A M', 'Goldman-Leikin, R', 'Gordon, L I', 'Kazikiewicz, J M', 'Kaplan, E H', 'Variakojis, D', 'Marder, R J', 'Dykewicz, M S', 'Piergies, A']","['Rosen ST', 'Zimmer AM', 'Goldman-Leikin R', 'Gordon LI', 'Kazikiewicz JM', 'Kaplan EH', 'Variakojis D', 'Marder RJ', 'Dykewicz MS', 'Piergies A', 'et al.']",['eng'],['N01-CM-47667-02/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody Formation', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Half-Life', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnostic imaging/immunology/*radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/immunology/*radiotherapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tissue Distribution']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.4.562 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Apr;5(4):562-73. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.4.562.,,,,,,,,,,

Rationale for the trial was provided by the observed decrease in leukemic blast cell self-renewal in culture following exposure to Ara-C. Compared with a previous trial of 57 patients treated with multidrug therapy, single-drug Ara-C was associated with a significantly improved complete remission rate (P = .010), although the survival time was not increased. All patients with low self-renewal responded to HDAra-C in contrast to the previous trial where some patients with this phenotype failed remission induction. The clinical observations are consistent with the view that the antileukemic effect of Ara-C has some specificity for cellular events required for self-renewal of blast cells. Exposure in vivo to Ara-C was associated with an increase in blast stem cell renewal at relapse, indicating that maintenance with other drugs should be tested.

Although lymphocyte proliferation was significantly increased in the group of patients with skin test reactivity to nickel, positive LTT were also frequently found in skin test-negative subjects: in 63% of subjects with and in 30% of subjects without a history of metal allergy. This would limit the value of the LTT as an in vitro correlate of skin test reactivity. However, in certain patients positive lymphocyte transformation may reveal nickel sensitization at a time of undetectable skin reactivity. Data obtained with the macrophage migration inhibition test (MMIT) showed a good correlation with nickel patch test reactions. Accurate determination of MIF became feasible by using cells from the human monocytoid cell line U937 as target cells in a microdroplet agarose assay. Using this MMIT, positive reactions occurred in 13% of the healthy controls and false-negative reactions were found in 26% of patients with positive skin test reactivity to nickel. As LTT and MMIT data appeared to be only weakly correlated in the individuals tested, a dual parameter analysis was performed. An excellent correlation [p = 1.8 (10(-8]] was found between skin test and in vitro reactivity for individuals with matching in vitro results (60% of all individuals tested).

The Hh-1b determinant of the H-2b haplotype maps to the D region of H-2. We have tested the hypothesis that gene(s) at or near H-2D of the H-2d haplotype down-regulate the expression of Hh-1b in the trans configuration. We used Abelson leukemia virus-transformed pre-B lymphoma cells (ACCb) of BALB/c X BALB.B (H-2d X H-2b) origin, as well as variant lines of ACCb, which were selected for resistance to monoclonal anti-H-2 antibodies plus complement. B6D2F1 (H-2b X H-2d), C3B6F1 (H-2k X H-2b), or B6 (H-2b) mice were infused with inocula of 5 X 10(6) B6 bone marrow cells (BMC). Proliferation of donor-derived marrow cells was judged in terms of DNA synthesis by measuring the splenic incorporation of 5-iodo(125I)-2'-deoxyuridine (IUdR) 5 days after cell transfer. B6 BMC grew much better in B6 than in F1 hybrid host mice, an expression of ""hybrid resistance"". As observed previously, the injection of EL-4 (H-2b, Hh-1b) tumor cells prior to infusion of B6 (H-2b, Hh-1b) BMC enhanced the growth of B6 BMC in F1 hybrid mice. Therefore, this in vivo ""cold target cell competition"" type of assay can be used to detect the expression of Hh-1b antigens. Unlike EL-4 (H-2b) cells, hybrid resistance was not affected by prior infusion of (H-2b X H-2d) heterozygous ACCb cells. In contrast, three ACCb variant cell lines, H-2d-, Ld-Dd-, and Dd-, enhanced the growth of B6 BMC in F1 hosts. The ACCb H-2b- cell line did not affect hybrid resistance to B6 BMC. The loss of gene expression on the H-2d chromosome at or very near the H-2Dd locus is correlated with the appearance Hh-1b, as determined by the in vivo cold target competition assay. These results support the hypothesis that heterozygous cells possess trans-acting, dominant, down-regulatory genes mapping near H-2D that control the Hh-1 phenotype of lymphoid tumor cells.","['Rembecki, R M', 'Bennett, M', 'Kumar, V', 'Potter, T A']","['Rembecki RM', 'Bennett M', 'Kumar V', 'Potter TA']",['eng'],"['CA09082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36921/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Crosses, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genes, Regulator', 'H-2 Antigens/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1987/04/15 00:00,1987/04/15 00:01,['1987/04/15 00:00'],"['1987/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Apr 15;138(8):2734-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Only recently has it become possible to propose a unifying mechanism of retinoid action, which involves the protein kinase-C cascade system. This system may mediate retinoids' many diverse actions, including their effects on enzyme synthesis, membrane properties, growth factors, binding proteins, genomic and postgenomic expression, the extracellular matrix, and immunologic responses. Ongoing in vitro studies of retinoid structure-activity relationships, effects on oncogene expression, reversal of drug-resistance, and, especially, the protein kinase-C cascade system should help clarify the precise mechanism of their anticancer action. Many in vitro and in vivo assay systems are available for testing the 2000 + synthetic retinoids. These assays indicate specific drug sensitivities, which may help focus future clinical trials. In human cancer prevention, retinoids have been most effective for skin diseases, including actinic keratosis, keratoacanthoma, and basal cell carcinoma; however, nondermatologic premalignancies, such as oral leukoplakia, bronchial metaplasia, laryngeal papillomatosis, cervical dysplasia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and the urinary bladder, also respond to retinoid therapy. Significant therapeutic advances are also occurring with this class of drugs in refractory malignancies, including advanced cutaneous squamous and basal cell cancer, mycosis fungoides, and acute promyelocytic leukemia. Newer third-generation retinoids, such as the highly potent retinoidal benzoic acid derivatives, are demonstrating therapeutic indexes far higher than earlier-generation retinoids. Current in vitro testing is also demonstrating that retinoids have synergistic activity in combination with other agents (eg, biologic modifiers, hormones, and DNA synthesis inhibitors) and treatment modalities (eg, irradiation).

From the clinical perspective, aside from performance status, age, prior history of toxic exposure, and grossly abnormal organ function, there are essentially no reliable indicators of the likelihood of a patient surviving remission induction therapy. The absence of such indicators might reflect the fact that without grossly abnormal organ function, all patients generally begin with an equal possibility of survival and that events which occur during therapy determine survival. One thing is certain, death directly attributable to leukemic cell overgrowth despite chemotherapy is an extremely rare event. Hence, therapeutic inadequacy in this sense, at the time of initial diagnosis, is not a common cause of treatment failure. Studies aimed at the prediction of leukemic cell responsiveness to therapy have been plagued by two general problems. The first is that the drug sensitivity assays have been quite primitive. For example, the ability of a cell to take up a drug is not synonymous with sensitivity to that drug. Additionally, tests which are dependent upon assays capable of making measurements in only a small subpopulation of cells, such as in vitro clonogenic assays, are likely to have only limited applicability. On the other hand, assays which measure the properties of the leukemic cell population as a whole are incapable of recognizing arabinoside therapy have provided data which suggest that in addition to patient survival three conditions must be satisfied if a complete remission is to occur: the pretherapy leukemic cell mass must be moderate or low, an adequate number of cells must be synthesizing DNA, and cytosine arabinoside must produce significant inhibition of DNA synthesis in vitro. Each factor is consistent with what is known about cytosine arabinoside: it is an S-phase-specific agent which must be incorporated into DNA in order to kill leukemic cells. When the relationship between these same factors and response to combination chemotherapy were studied, not unexpectedly, no relationship was discerned. Finally, in this setting pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that the amount of araCTP formed in leukemic cells in vivo when doses of 2 g and 3 g/m2 are administered are indistinguishable, thereby explaining the clinical equivalence of these two dosage levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Preisler, H D', 'Raza, A']","['Preisler HD', 'Raza A']",['eng'],"['CA-28734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07357908609039836 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1986;4(6):575-90. doi: 10.3109/07357908609039836.,,,,,,,73,,,

To gain a better understanding of the genetic basis for GpIIb and GpIIIa synthesis, we studied their synthesis by two human leukemia cell lines, HEL and K562. HEL cells contained complexes of GpIIb and GpIIIa, and K562 cells expressed GpIIIa, but not GpIIb, when stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). RNA from HEL cells directed the in vitro synthesis of a 110,000-Mr precursor for GpIIb and a 92,000-Mr precursor for GpIIIa, which indicates that the synthesis of GpIIb and GpIIIa by HEL cells is directed by separate mRNAs. In contrast, RNA from PMA-stimulated K562 cells only directed the synthesis of a 92,000-Mr precursor for GpIIIa. The dissociation of GpIIb and GpIIIa synthesis in K562 cells suggests that GpIIb and GpIIIa may be the products of separate genes.","['Silver, S M', 'McDonough, M M', 'Vilaire, G', 'Bennett, J S']","['Silver SM', 'McDonough MM', 'Vilaire G', 'Bennett JS']",['eng'],"['HL06990/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL23809/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80614-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Apr;69(4):1031-7.,,,,,,,,,,

The recovery pattern of TL-CFU differed from that of the other haemopoietic progenitor cells. TL-CFU showed a fast recovery, i.e. within 1 month after autologous bone marrow transplantation which was much more rapid than that of BFU-E and CFU-GM. After allografting, however, TL-CFU regenerated at a slower rate and reached normal levels between 2 and 6 months after transplantation. We suggest that the delayed restoration of myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells after autologous transplantation is related to a proliferative defect of the graft as a result of the preceding cytotoxic chemotherapy, the underlying malignant disease and/or cryopreservation. The slower recovery of the T lymphocyte precursors after allografting might be due to the immunological interactions between graft and host, the immuno-suppressive therapy and/or the in vitro T cell depletion of the graft.","['Vellenga, E', 'Sizoo, W', 'Hagenbeek, A', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Vellenga E', 'Sizoo W', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02255.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Feb;65(2):137-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02255.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Main problems of further research are the high-risk patients. Approaches to reach complete remissions and thus long-term palliations or healing, consist in increase of combination, dose escalation with Cisplatinum, introduction of novel substances (Etoposide, Ifosfamide etc.). The latter field is scientifically underdeveloped, as is the field of second- and third-order therapy.

The Kaplan Meier estimate of surviving disease free at 4 years post BMT was 49.9% and the probability of continued remission at 4 years was 63.3%. Fourteen patients relapsed between 90 and 690 days (mean: 240 +/- 88) post BMT. The other causes of BMP failure included: graft versus host disease, veno-occlusive disease and sepsis. No interstitial pneumonitis has been reported. Patients who had a relapse while on chemotherapy had a higher probability of relapse than those who had a relapse while off therapy (p less than 0.01). We conclude that allogeneic BMT is the treatment of choice for children with ALL in second hematologic remission, the interval between diagnosis and first relapse being the most significant prognostic factor.

Fifty-six patients receiving induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia, autologous bone marrow transplant for refractory nonhematopoietic malignant neoplasms, multidrug chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma, or corticosteroids for brain metastases were randomized to receive either oral ketoconazole, 400 mg/d, or placebo and observed until leukopenia resolved or corticosteroid therapy was stopped. Oral candidiasis developed in eight (28%) of 29 patients receiving placebo compared with none of 27 receiving ketoconazole. However, ketoconazole failed to prevent Candida esophagitis and vulvovaginitis in two patients and one patient, respectively. Furthermore, prophylactic use of ketoconazole did not significantly alter the total number of hospital days, febrile days, or antibiotic days or the requirement for amphotericin B in patients with acute leukemia and autologous bone marrow transplant. Since oral candidiasis can be successfully managed by several different treatment modalities when it does occur, we do not think that the routine prophylactic use of ketoconazole is justified.","['Hansen, R M', 'Reinerio, N', 'Sohnle, P G', 'Abrams, R A', 'Ritch, P S', 'Libnoch, J A', 'Anderson, T']","['Hansen RM', 'Reinerio N', 'Sohnle PG', 'Abrams RA', 'Ritch PS', 'Libnoch JA', 'Anderson T']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,['R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)'],IM,"['Candidiasis/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Candidiasis, Oral/prevention & control', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Ketoconazole/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 1987 Apr;147(4):710-2.,,,,,,,,,,

They were exchanged with the use of glass slides with adherent snap-frozen sections. The method involved immunohistochemistry using a common battery of 20 antibodies directed at B- and T-cell antigens. Using similar, but not identical, methods and reagents, cases were assayed before and after transport. Results were generated as paired determinations in a double-blind fashion (1,338 total determinations, 669 paired determinations/669 antigens). Using ""pretransport"" values as the baseline, there was subsequent agreement with baseline in 624 of 669 antigenic determinations (93.3%) and disagreement in 45 (6.7%). Interinstitutional agreement was 94% for T-antigens (Leu-1-7,9) and 93% for B-antigens (K, lambda; IgM, G, A, D; B1, B2, B4, L14; J5, common acute lymphocyte leukemia antigen [CALLA]; Ia). In spite of 6.7% disagreement, there was agreement of overall phenotypic profile (e.g., B vs. T and subset stage) in all 39 cases. This is because discrepancies were isolated and the battery offset undue reliance on a single antigen. The disagreements relate mainly to certain B-antigens: CALLA/J5 (eight disagreements) and B1 and B2 (six and five disagreements, respectively). T-antigen disagreements were more sporadic (e.g., Leu-5 [three disagreements]). These discrepancies may relate to antigen loss with transport, variable antigen density or antibody avidity, methodologic differences, quality of reagents, or differences of phenotype interpretation. A further exchange of the 45 disagreement slides indicated that difference of observer interpretation was a minor factor (3 of 45). In conclusion, the authors' study demonstrates a high degree of immunotype reproducibility (approximately 93%), suggesting promise for institutions doing collaborative lymphoma studies.","['Grogan, T M', 'Tubbs, R R']","['Grogan TM', 'Tubbs RR']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens/analysis', 'Arizona', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', '*Laboratories', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Ohio', 'Phenotype', '*Specimen Handling', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transportation']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/87.4.478 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1987 Apr;87(4):478-84. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/87.4.478.,,,,,,,,,,

Those poor risk features are: age over 30 years, a white blood cell count over 25,000/microliter, certain translocations of chromosomes, and requirement for more than six weeks of induction chemotherapy to attain a complete remission. We have used high-dose radiochemotherapy to prepare 39 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission (1 infant and 38 adults; median age 23 years) for bone marrow transplantation from histocompatible sibling donors. Thirty-one of the 39 patients in this study had one (n = 23) or more (n = 8) poor risk features: age (n = 7); high white blood cell count (n = 19); translocations (n = 4), or resistance to initial induction therapy (n = 11). Currently, 26 patients are surviving for 4-72 months (median 18 months) following marrow grafting and are in complete remission. One of the surviving patients had two marrow transplant procedures because of recurrent leukemia. Actuarial survival in complete remission is 63% for the entire group of 39 patients and is 60% if the eight patients who had no poor risk features are excluded from analysis. The following causes for failure were observed: leukemic relapse was encountered in four patients between 3 and 17 months after BMT for an actuarial relapse rate of 16%; bacterial sepsis was the cause of death in two patients; graft-versus-host disease and/or interstitial pneumonia led to the demise of seven patients, and one patient died with leukoencephalopathy. It appears that high-dose radiochemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation from a histocompatible sibling donor during first complete remission can result in a high disease-free survival rate for younger adults with poor-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This concept needs to be tested in prospective trials comparing bone marrow transplantation with chemotherapy.","['Blume, K G', 'Forman, S J', 'Snyder, D S', 'Nademanee, A P', ""O'Donnell, M R"", 'Fahey, J L', 'Krance, R A', 'Sniecinski, I J', 'Stock, A D', 'Findley, D O']","['Blume KG', 'Forman SJ', 'Snyder DS', 'Nademanee AP', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Fahey JL', 'Krance RA', 'Sniecinski IJ', 'Stock AD', 'Findley DO', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Risk', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-198703000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1987 Mar;43(3):389-92. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198703000-00014.,,,,,,,,,,

The alkylformamides are 1 group of experimental compounds which have been shown to induce terminal differentiation in human HL-60 leukemia and murine Friend erythroleukemia cells in vitro. Their mechanism of action is unknown. Dimethylformamide has been used as a model inducer in carcinoma and fibroblastic models. Analysis of the relationship between structure and inducing activity of the alkylformamides in vitro reveals that no specificity of structure exists and that their properties as inducers of terminal differentiation extend to related compounds, e.g. the alkylacetamides and alkylureas. This is in contrast to the marked specificity of N-methylformamide (NMF) as an in vivo antitumour agent. The potency of these compounds as inducers of differentiation is predictable and correlated with their molecular weight. High concentrations of NMF are required to induce differentiation in vitro and these concentrations are not achievable in vivo. However, while NMF is unlikely to be a useful inducer in vivo many of its higher MW analogues are very much more potent as inducers in vitro and yet no more toxic (to the host) in vivo. Some of these (e.g. tetramethylurea or 1,3-dimethylurea) may be capable of achieving inducing concentrations in vivo.","['Langdon, S P', 'Hickman, J A']","['Langdon SP', 'Hickman JA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Formamides)', '627-45-2 (N-ethylformamide)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Dimethylformamide/toxicity', 'Formamides/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Temperature']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0300-483X(87)90083-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0300-483x(87)90083-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 1987 Mar;43(3):239-49. doi: 10.1016/0300-483x(87)90083-7.,,,,,,,51,,,

High-dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is a more effective antileukemic treatment than chemotherapy. This approach is limited, however, by a relatively high risk of transplant-related complications, particularly graft rejection, GVHD, and interstitial pneumonitis. Autologous bone marrow transplantation avoids the problems of graft rejection and GVHD. It does, however, introduce a risk of reinfusing residual leukemia cells with the autologous bone marrow and absence of a possible graft-versus-leukemia effect associated with allogeneic transplants. Bone marrow transplantation is useful in AML. Syngeneic or allogeneic HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation is the preferred treatment for patients under age 45 to 50 who fail chemotherapy. Transplantation is also likely to be superior or comparable to chemotherapy for patients less than 20 to 30 years of age in first remission. Transplantation in older individuals in first remission is controversial; results are comparable to those achieved with postremission chemotherapy. Transplants from donors other than HLA-identical siblings must be considered investigational but may be a reasonable alternative in young individuals in first relapse or second remission. Autotransplants are difficult to evaluate critically but may be considered as investigational therapy for individuals in second or later remission for whom a suitable allogeneic donor is unavailable. Autotransplants in first remission should be restricted to controlled clinical trials because it is otherwise impossible to determine their efficacy. It is uncertain whether ex vivo treatment of the bone marrow to remove leukemia cells is necessary in the context of autotransplantation; again, controlled trials are required. Bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling is effective in individuals with ALL who relapse despite chemotherapy. Patients undergoing transplantation while in second or later remission or in relapse have a survival rate superior to those treated with chemotherapy. One important and unresolved issue is whether patients with high-risk ALL should receive bone marrow transplants or intensive postremission chemotherapy while in first remission; controlled clinical trials are needed. Bone marrow transplants from donors other than HLA-identical siblings and autologous bone marrow transplants are investigational approaches that should be considered in selected young patients who fail despite chemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Champlin, R', 'Gale, R P']","['Champlin R', 'Gale RP']",['eng'],"['CA 23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR0065/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0037-1963(87)90031-X [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1987 Jan;24(1):55-67.,,,,,,,92,,,

Intensive induction chemotherapy using 7-day courses of cytarabine and daunorubicin or amsacrine produce remission in 60% to 85% of patients. Median remission duration is 9 to 16 months. In some series, 20% to 40% of patients are in continuous remission for 2 years or more; many of these patients remain in remission for 5 years or longer and some may be cured. Bone marrow transplantation has evolved as a useful therapeutic modality capable of achieving long-term survival in some circumstances in which chemotherapy is relatively ineffective. Its precise role in the initial therapy of AML remains to be defined, but it is likely to be beneficial in selected patients. These data indicate substantial recent progress in the treatment of this disease, which was almost uniformly fatal 30 years ago. The fact that most patients relapse within 1 to 2 years reflects a lack of progress in developing effective postremission therapy. Maintenance chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and CNS prophylaxis have little role in AML. It is unclear whether consolidation or intensification extend remissions or increase the proportion of long-term survivors; controlled randomized trials should answer this question within the next few years. Future progress in the treatment of AML awaits the development of more sensitive methods for detecting residual leukemia, more effective use of current therapeutic modalities and the introduction of new effective drugs. Most data suggest that early intensive treatment is of key importance for achieving cures. However, we cannot presently distinguish between patients cured by initial treatment and those who required further chemotherapy.","['Gale, R P', 'Foon, K A']","['Gale RP', 'Foon KA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*drug therapy']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0037-1963(87)90030-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1987 Jan;24(1):40-54.,,,,,,,154,,,

Most patients, greater than 70% to 80%, will achieve a remission following induction chemotherapy with vincristine, prednisone, and an anthracycline. Additional drugs do not convincingly increase the remission rate; their effect on remission duration is unknown. Although continuation therapy has not been critically evaluated in randomized trials, the longest remissions have been reported in individuals receiving consolidation/intensification, particularly in the immediate postremission period. Presently, a disease-free survival is 35% to 45% at greater than 5 years when this type of consolidation/intensification therapy is used. The precise value of conventional maintenance chemotherapy in adult ALL is unknown. CNS prophylaxis is necessary; the standard of treatment remains cranial radiation and intrathecal methotrexate. Alternative approaches are currently being studied such as systemic treatment with high doses of methotrexate or cytarabine. Recently, prognostic factors have been better defined. In recent studies with intensive treatment, time to response, age, WBC, immunologic subtype and cytogenetic data can be used to divide patients into a low-risk group with a projected disease-free survival of 60% or more and a high-risk group with a disease-free survival of 20% to 25%. The definition of risk groups in adult ALL may be useful in determining future further optimal therapeutic approaches.","['Hoelzer, D', 'Gale, R P']","['Hoelzer D', 'Gale RP']",['eng'],['CA23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/classification', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0037-1963(87)90029-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1987 Jan;24(1):27-39.,,,,,,,139,,,

Finally, treatment of HL-60 with TPA in the presence of retinal, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, drastically reduced the induction of c-fos mRNA but had no effect on the terminal macrophage differentiation that is induced in this cell line by TPA.

These include developments in the molecular biology of IL-2 and its receptors. Human IL-2 was cloned and sequenced by Taniguchi et al. in 1983. The gene for human IL-2 is located on the long arm of chromosome 4. The secondary structure of the gene is predominantly alpha helix. The mature gene product is a 133 amino acid glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 15,420 Daltons. The IL-2 receptor was revealed to be a glycoprotein of 272 amino acids. The mature receptor has a molecular weight of 55,000 Daltons. A more precise understanding of the mechanism of action IL-2, in particular its role in the induction of the IL-2 receptor, and aspects of the control of IL-2 production was also achieved. Metabolic and morphologic studies have revealed that activation of the T-cell antigen receptor renders the cells responsive to IL-2, but does not move them through the cell cycle. Rather, it appears that IL-2 stimulates G1 progression to S phase ie. blastic transformation. During this progression the cellular proto-oncogene c-myb is induced transiently to 6 to 7 times basal levels. The role of IL-2 as a growth factor for several subsets of T cells has been confirmed, and a new role as a growth factor for B cells was defined. Most importantly, IL-2 was shown to be directly mitogenic for and to expand subpopulations of peripheral blood cells, termed lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). A number of pathologies of IL-2 production or activity have been defined, including Hodgkin's disease, graft versus host disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, lepromatous leprosy, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and adult T cell leukemia. Murine and human in vivo studies reviewed here have revealed significant parameters of the therapeutic potential as well as the toxicity of this growth factor. Finally, the modulation of IL-2 receptors on human PBL's by thymosin fraction 5 and thymosin alpha 1 suggests that it might be possible to up-regulate IL-2 receptor expression in certain disease states and thus increase the efficacy of IL-2.","['Fletcher, M', 'Goldstein, A L']","['Fletcher M', 'Goldstein AL']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Lymphokine Res,Lymphokine research,8308208,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-2/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lymphokine Res. 1987 Winter;6(1):45-57.,,,,,,,95,,,

The data were updated October 1, 1986, and the mean follow-up was 18 +/- 4.3 months. T cells were depleted with a combination of 3-pan-T cell monoclonal antibodies (CD2 ""D66""; CD5 ""A50""; CD7 ""I21"") with a single incubation of rabbit complement (C'). The average number of T cells infused was 0.66 X 10(6) +/- 0.56/kg body weight. Twenty-six patients received chemoprophylaxis for GVHD, 16 received methotrexate, and ten received cyclosporin A. Only a single case of severe (greater than grade II) GVHD was observed, yet the incidence of graft failure was 19%. Factors that might have influenced the occurrence of graft failure appear to be the lack of radiotherapy in the conditioning regimen; the conditioning regimen itself (fractionated total body irradiation [TBI], 12 Gy, v single dose is better than TBI, 10 Gy, but still not statistically significant); and the age of the patients (high-risk after 30 years of age). In contrast, neither the number of nucleated cells reinfused nor the level of T cell depletion (provided the T cells were below critical numbers) seemed to have an influence, nor did chemoprophylaxis for GVHD or splenectomy in chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) patients. The survival of graft failure patients was very poor (one of 11; survival at 15 months of the initial graft). Thus, our study demonstrates the reproducibility and high effectiveness in preventing GVHD by immunodepletion of T cells in a large-scale multicentric assay, in which compliance with the protocol of immunodepletion was reasonably good. This study thus provides interesting clues to overcoming graft rejection.","['Racadot, E', 'Herve, P', 'Beaujean, F', 'Vernant, J P', 'Flesch, M', 'Plouvier, E', 'Andreu, G', 'Rio, B', 'Philippe, N', 'Souillet, G']","['Racadot E', 'Herve P', 'Beaujean F', 'Vernant JP', 'Flesch M', 'Plouvier E', 'Andreu G', 'Rio B', 'Philippe N', 'Souillet G', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Complement System Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.3.426 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Mar;5(3):426-35. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.3.426.,,,,,,,,,,

Intuitively, it might be expected that leukemia recurring after BMT would be refractory to further treatment. In an attempt to improve survival in patients with ALL who relapse after BMT, we used standard chemotherapy for reinduction and maintenance. Of 65 patients who relapsed following allogeneic, autologous, or syngeneic BMT, 12 elected to receive no further chemotherapy, and their median survival from relapse was 36 days (range 13 to 167 days). The 53 patients who received therapy had a significantly longer median survival of 168 days (range 18 days to 4.7 years). With multidrug induction regimens there were 29 of 52 (56%) complete remissions. Six patients are currently alive, with two off therapy. In the patients who received therapy, the following factors were independent predictors of prolonged survival: longer time from BMT to relapse; younger age at diagnosis; and the use of a preparative regimen containing fractionated total body irradiation. In conclusion, leukemia recurring after BMT remains sensitive to standard therapy in many patients. We recommend that patients with ALL who relapse after BMT receive reinduction and maintenance therapy as additional good quality survival time is achieved in patients who attain a remission.","['Bostrom, B', 'Woods, W G', 'Nesbit, M E', 'Krivit, W', 'Kersey, J', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Haake, R', 'Goldman, A I', 'Ramsay, N K']","['Bostrom B', 'Woods WG', 'Nesbit ME', 'Krivit W', 'Kersey J', 'Weisdorf D', 'Haake R', 'Goldman AI', 'Ramsay NK']",['eng'],"['CA-07306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.3.376 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Mar;5(3):376-81. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.3.376.,,,,,,,,,,

At 4 degrees C 125I-GM-CSF remains on the surface of the cells and can be eluted by washing the cells with acidified isotonic buffer. When the cells are warmed to 37 degrees C, the 125I-GM-CSF is internalized rapidly (t 1/2: 7 min). The internalisation appears to be entirely receptor mediated and is independent of energy sources inhibited by sodium azide. This GM-CSF-mediated internalisation is not due to a general increase in the turnover of cell surface molecules as the specific binding of 125I-transferrin is not affected by incubation of WEHI-3BD+ cells with GM-CSF. The initial 125I released when the cells are warmed to 37 degrees C appears to be intact 125I-GM-CSF; however, after 2 h 80% of the 125I released was not precipitable with trichloroacetic acid and presumably represented degraded 125I-GM-CSF. Ammonium chloride or monensin reduced the release of 125I-GM-CSF from the cells, suggesting that the receptor-bound ligand was processed through the lysosomes. A considerable proportion of the internalised GM-CSF receptors were recycled to the surface and were available for ligand binding. Synthesis of new GM-CSF receptors contributed to the re-expression of GM-CSF receptors after down-regulation and it is possible that the GM-CSF enhances the synthesis of its own receptors.","['Walker, F', 'Burgess, A W']","['Walker F', 'Burgess AW']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041300211 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 Feb;130(2):255-61. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041300211.,,,,,,,,,,

Staining was seen in most tissues of the body and was most pronounced in the epithelial compartments. In normal lymphoid tissue only dendritic reticulum cells, sinus-lining cells, macrophages and endothelial cells stained whereas lymphocytes were unlabelled. Among neoplasms, BLA was expressed strongly in 4/5 Burkitt's lymphomas. Rather weak expression was seen in 8/120 of the other B-cell lymphomas which included cases of pre-B-stage, mid-stage and secretory-stage B-cell maturation.

Incubation of J774 cells with 1.0 micrograms of 25-hydroxycholesterol/ml plus 20 micrograms of cholesterol/ml for 48 h decreased 125I-beta VLDL uptake and immuno- and ligand blotting to the 125,000- and 111,000-Da peptides by only 25%. Taken together, these data demonstrate that uptake of beta VLDL and chylomicron remnants by macrophages is mediated by an LDL receptor that is immunologically related to the LDL receptor of rat liver.","['Ellsworth, J L', 'Kraemer, F B', 'Cooper, A D']","['Ellsworth JL', 'Kraemer FB', 'Cooper AD']",['eng'],"['AM 07294/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 18774/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 32596/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Chylomicrons)', '0 (Lipoproteins, VLDL)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Chylomicrons/*metabolism', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, LDL/immunology/*metabolism']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)61656-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Feb 15;262(5):2316-25.,,,,,,,,,,

Because stem cell assays have not previously been found to predict engraftment after transplantation, the optimal drug(s) and drug concentrations have not been determined. To determine the effectiveness of the podophyllotoxin derivative, VP16, and the value of stem cell assays in chemopurification studies, a murine model using the C57B1/6 mouse and its syngeneic leukemia EL-4 was developed. Kill of committed (CFU-C) and pluripotent (CFU-S) hematopoietic stem cells and tumor (tCFU) stem cells after a 1-h exposure to VP16 was first determined. A marked kill differential of tCFU compared to that of the CFU-C/S populations was found, with no tCFU surviving at VP16 concentrations greater than 30 micrograms/ml. No kill differential of CFU-C versus CFU-S was seen at VP16 doses greater than 10 micrograms/ml. All mice transplanted with a mixture of 25 X 10(6) BM cells and 1 X 10(7) EL-4 cells treated in vitro with 40 micrograms/ml of VP16 died of their tumors. However by reducing the tumor burden to 1 X 10(6) EL-4 and 5 X 10(6) EL-4, nine of ten and four of six of the mice, respectively, survived 90+ days tumor free. On the basis of survival data, it was found that engraftment of VP16-treated BM was directly proportional to the product of the degree of CFU-S inhibition and BM cell inoculum, i.e., the number of viable CFU-S transplanted. The maximum VP16 concentration that led to predictable engraftment at BM doses less than 25 X 10(6) cells was 55 micrograms/ml. Thus, 15 mice were transplanted with 1 X 10(7) BM cells and 1 X 10(7) EL-4 cells, incubated with 55 micrograms/ml of VP16; 13 out of 15 survived tumor free for 90+ days. When VP16 was used as a BM chemopurification agent, up to 50% of contaminating tumor cells were eliminated from BM suspensions without affecting engraftment after transplantation. Because stem cell inhibition predicted engraftment, drug concentrations that maximized tumor cell kill could be chosen.","['Stiff, P J', 'Koester, A R']","['Stiff PJ', 'Koester AR']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Etoposide', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Mar;15(3):263-8.,,,,,,,,,,

An additional band with a MW of 130 kDa could be precipitated with variable intensities from thymocytes, neoplastic T cells, and CD4+- or CD8+ T-cell clones. Based on their reactivity with SPV-L14 and a mAb directed against CD3, four subpopulations of CD2+ lymphocytes could be detected and their existence was confirmed at the clonal level. The majority (95%) of the CD3+ cells were SPV-L14+, whereas 5% were CD3+, SPV-L14-. Among cloned cell lines CD3-,SPV-L14- and CD3-,SPV-L14+ cells were found to exist. The CD3-,SPV-L14- and CD3-,SPV-L14+ clones were shown to have NK cell activity, indicating that the 120- to 130-kDa antigen is expressed heterogeneously on CD3- NK cell clones. In addition, neoplastic T cells representing these four subpopulations were shown to exist. Although the tissue distribution and the MW of the SPV-L14 target antigen strongly suggest that SPV-L14 reacts with an epitope on CD6, the SPV-L14 mAb did not react with resting or activated B cells or with malignant B cells. Blocking studies showed that SPV-L14 inhibited the proliferative response of PBL, induced by anti-CD3 mAb, but that SPV-L14 did not affect the proliferation induced by phytohemagglutinin.

The mechanism of induction, the molecular nature, and the number of the new antigenic specificities have not been completely elucidated. Four clones from murine leukemia L1210 isolated and expanded in vitro were treated in vivo with DTIC and the new sublines were studied in detail. The four drug-treated sublines studied exhibited strong immunogenicity since they were rejected by syngeneic animals. Immunosuppressed animals challenged with 10(7) A/DTIC or P/DTIC cells were reciprocally protected by the adoptive transfer of spleen cells from donors that had rejected a lethal challenge of A/DTIC or P/DTIC clone. In a similar fashion, the adoptive transfer of spleen cells obtained from animals that had rejected the Q/DTIC or the R/DTIC clones protected immunosuppressed mice challenged with Q/DTIC or R/DTIC cells. No antitumor activity was observed in cross-protective schedules other than those indicated. It was been concluded that (a) the L1210 leukemia line does not have antigenic cells, (b) four DTIC-treated clone sublines were rejected by compatible hosts, and (c) two mutually exclusive sets of antigens were expressed in four antigenic clone sublines.","['Canti, G', 'Ricci, L', 'Marelli, O', 'Franco, P', 'Nicolin, A']","['Canti G', 'Ricci L', 'Marelli O', 'Franco P', 'Nicolin A']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,['7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Dacarbazine/*therapeutic use', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00199834 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1987;24(1):64-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00199834.,,,,,,,,,,

Drug resistance, however, may be due to multiple factors. To test whether the activity of daunorubicin reductase or NADPH diaphorase independently influences in vitro daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity, we developed somatic cell hybrid clones to partially isolate these factors. This was accomplished by fusing daunorubicin-resistant myeloblast cells obtained from a patient with monosomy 7 leukemia to a daunorubicin-sensitive Chinese hamster cell line. The in vitro cytotoxicity of daunorubicin was compared in hybrid clones having variable enzyme activities; the concentrations of daunorubicin that inhibited the growth of clones by 50% did not differ by more than 2-fold, whereas daunorubicin reductase activities and NADPH diaphorase isozyme activities differed by more than 100- and 15-fold, respectively. These large differences in enzymatic activity were obtained in part by the suppression of specific hamster genes, indicating a regulatory control mechanism for xenobiotic enzymes. Our findings suggest that in this system substantial intercellular variation in the activity of these xenobiotic enzymes does not independently influence cellular resistance to daunorubicin.","['Goren, M P', 'Ahmed, N K', 'Tereba, A']","['Goren MP', 'Ahmed NK', 'Tereba A']",['eng'],"['CA 34759/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05584/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Aldo-Keto Reductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.21 (Aldehyde Reductase)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.99.1 (NADPH Dehydrogenase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Aldehyde Reductase', 'Aldo-Keto Reductases', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Daunorubicin/*toxicity', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Muscles', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'NADPH Dehydrogenase/*metabolism']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Apr 1;47(7):1924-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Immunocytochemistry using a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies by immunoperoxidase techniques identified the presence of both B-lymphocytic and monocytic-histiocytic cell lines of differentiation. A mechanism of multiple differentiation is proposed to account for the dual cell population observed in this patient. Review of the literature appears to indicate that this phenomenon often may be involved in cases diagnosed as Richter's syndrome.

Phenotype and functions of leukemic cells under in vitro treatment by differentiation inducers.,1296-303,"We reported the morphologic, phenotypic and functional characteristics of leukemic cells with natural killer (NK) properties in a case of T chronic lymphocytic leukemia with large granular lymphocytes. These cells were cytologically and cytochemically characterized as phosphatase acid positive large granular lymphocytes (LGL), and presented parallel tubular arrays at the ultra structural level. They displayed a CD2, CD3, CD8, CD11, Leu 7, and Leu 11 positive phenotype while they lacked B cell markers including surface immunoglobulins. In addition, they expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLA) Class I, but no Class II antigens. These phenotypic studies were also performed after cells were cultured in vitro with 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate, gamma interferon, 5-azacytidine, sodium butyrate, phytohemagglutinin, and interleukin 2 (IL2). The cell surface markers underwent several significant changes. Among them we noted a higher percentage of labeled cells with anti-CD6 and CD7 monoclonal antibodies (moAbs), and a positivity with an anti-CD19 (B4) moAb. The leukemic LGL spontaneously developed a NK activity on K 562 tumor cells, which was not affected under the various T and B cells growth factors because they became more sensitive to IL2; but they were also stimulated by a 50-kilodalton (KD) B cell growth factor (BCGF) factor devoid of any T cell proliferation activity. Together these results gave a better characterization of azurophilic granules containing T chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and enabled the documentation of the differentiation of LGL with NK activity.","['Merle-Beral, H', 'Boucheix, C', 'Karray, S', 'Hercend, T', 'Capron, F', 'Autran, B', 'Vazquez, A', 'Blanc, C', 'Oberling, F', 'Debre, P']","['Merle-Beral H', 'Boucheix C', 'Karray S', 'Hercend T', 'Capron F', 'Autran B', 'Vazquez A', 'Blanc C', 'Oberling F', 'Debre P']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870401)59:7<1296::aid-cncr2820590711>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Apr 1;59(7):1296-303. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870401)59:7<1296::aid-cncr2820590711>3.0.co;2-t.,,,,,,,,,,

Independently derived tertiary subclones displayed concordant patterns of reactivity with 13 monocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies, thus indicating that each recognized an epitope on the product (gp55) of a single human gene. The 55-kilodalton cell surface polypeptide was specifically immunoprecipitated with a representative monoclonal antibody, 26if, from lysates of enzymatically radioiodinated peripheral blood monocytes and tertiary transformants. We conclude that gp55 is highly immunogenic and that a large number of independently derived monoclonal antibodies specific for human monocytes react with epitopes on this one molecule.","['Ashmun, R A', 'Peiper, S C', 'Rebentisch, M B', 'Look, A T']","['Ashmun RA', 'Peiper SC', 'Rebentisch MB', 'Look AT']",['eng'],"['CA 01013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Protein gp140(v-fms))', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'DNA, Recombinant/analysis', 'Fibroblasts/immunology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Oncogene Protein gp140(v-fms)', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Transfection']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69834-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Mar;69(3):886-92.,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we demonstrate that the Mr approximately 52,000-receptor fragments are derived from intact glucocorticoid receptors (Mr approximately 97,000) by the action of a serine protease. Mr approximately 52,000-receptor fragments were present in cytosol from 24 of 52 leukemia cell samples. Only normal size glucocorticoid receptors were present in cytosol samples if diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a potent inhibitor of serine proteases, was added to the hypotonic buffer used for cytosol preparation. Receptor proteolysis was not inhibited by hydrolyzed DFP, benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, aprotinin, iodoacetamide, or mercuric chloride. The leukemia cell protease digests the receptor at a different site than chymotrypsin, which digests the intact receptor to produce a Mr approximately 40,000 receptor fragment. Receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) in S49 mouse lymphoma cells and in human leukemia cells was analyzed by Northern hybridization with a cDNA for the normal glucocorticoid receptor. Mutant S49 mouse lymphoma cells that have abnormally small glucocorticoid receptors (Mr approximately 48,000) make a 5.0-kilobase receptor transcript in addition to the normal size 6.5-kilobase receptor transcript. A normal size receptor transcript of 6.5 kilobases was present in all of the human leukemia cells whether or not Mr approximately 52,000-receptor fragments were present.

The contribution of immunohistologic studies.,276-81,"A 68-year-old man with known hairy cell leukemia (HCL) underwent splenectomy; the spleen weighed only 140 g. Microscopic examination of the spleen revealed no clear diagnostic evidence of HCL, but there was an unusual and suspicious subendothelial lymphoid infiltration of the trabecular veins. Cell suspension studies also were not diagnostic because a monoclonal B-cell population could not be defined. Alternatively, when we focused on the subendothelial infiltrate in the frozen sections prepared for immunohistochemical studies, the findings indicated that the subendothelial cells were monoclonal B-cells (IgG, kappa). Staining with monoclonal antibodies disclosed the phenotype Tac+, Leu-14+, Leu-M5+, B2-, BA-1-, and BA-2-, a phenotype characteristic of HCL. In this case, an unusual but nondiagnostic morphologic finding provided guidance for the correlative immunophenotypic analysis of the same site in frozen sections and thereby allowed a definitive diagnosis.","['Burke, J S', 'Sheibani, K', 'Winberg, C D', 'Rappaport, H']","['Burke JS', 'Sheibani K', 'Winberg CD', 'Rappaport H']",['eng'],"['CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Organ Size', 'Spleen/*pathology', 'Splenectomy']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/87.2.276 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1987 Feb;87(2):276-81. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/87.2.276.,,,,,,,,,,

The correction of genetic defects by these inducers of differentiation does not appear to be required; the critical feature is that the differentiated cells assume a state in which they no longer possess the capability for continued cellular replication. The extrapolation of these advances, accomplished in experimental systems, to clinical practice should yield significant decreases in the neoplastic cell burden without the degree of morbidity produced by aggressive therapy with cytodestructive agents, especially when employed in multidrug combinations.

Radiobiological considerations in the selection of regimes.,241-7,"Total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow rescue is being increasingly used in the systemic treatment of acute leukaemia and some solid tumours such as neuroblastoma. Typically, these neoplasms are radiosensitive with little or no shoulder on the in vitro survival curve (n approximately equal to 1.0, Do approximately equal to 1.0 Gy). In such cases, fractionated or low-dose-rate TBI should allow preferential sparing of normal tissues. With the appropriate choice of dose rate, low-dose-rate TBI should, in principle, be radiobiologically equivalent to fractionated TBI. Calculations based on an extension to the linear quadratic model suggest that extremely low dose rates (e.g., approximately equal to 0.5 Gy h-1) might be required for equivalence to conventionally fractionated schedules. Such low dose rates would require very long treatment times (e.g., approximately equal to 24 h), which renders them impractical.

Perhaps one of the most striking examples of this association occurs in chronic myelogenous leukaemia, where the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation results in substitution of the 5' end of the c-abl proto-oncogene with bcr gene sequences. A unique hybrid bcr-abl message is produced. As the Ph translocation is also present in some patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, we initiated studies to determine if similar genomic events occur in these two different forms of Ph-positive leukaemia. Here we report that the Ph translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia can result in production of a novel aberrant c-abl protein that is distinct from the bcr-abl protein found in Ph-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia.

I have mainly used myeloid cells as a model system. Normal hematopoietic cells require different proteins to induce growth (growth factors) and differentiation (differentiation factors). There is a multigene family for these factors. Identification of these factors and their interaction has shown how growth and differentiation can be normally coupled. The development of leukemia involves the uncoupling of growth and differentiation. This can occur by changing the requirement for growth without blocking cell response to the normal inducers of differentiation. Addition of normal differentiation factors to these malignant cells still induces their normal differentiation, and the mature cells are then no longer malignant. Genetic changes which inhibit differentiation by normal differentiation factors can occur in the progression of leukemia, but even these leukemic cells may still be induced to differentiate by other compounds, including low doses of compounds now being used in cancer therapy, that can induce differentiation by alternative pathways. The differentiation of leukemic to mature cells results in the reversion of malignancy by by-passing genetic changes that produce the malignant phenotype. We have obtained this differentiation of leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo, and by-passing genetic defects by inducing differentiation can be a useful approach to therapy.","['Sachs, L']",['Sachs L'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,['0 (Growth Substances)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Substances/physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Oncogenes']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02934993 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1986;3(3-4):165-76. doi: 10.1007/BF02934993.,,,,,,,86,,,

This antibody (anti-PAA) was produced by the fusion of myeloma cells NS-1 with spleen cells from a BALB/c mouse, which were sensitized with activated human T-cells generated by allogeneic stimulation in mixed-lymphocyte culture (MLC). Resting human peripheral blood T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes demonstrated weak anti-PAA binding. Binding of proliferating T-cells (phytohemagglutinin- and MLC-activated T-cells) and thymocytes to anti-PAA was two to six times greater than that of resting T-cells. A fifteenfold-increased binding was observed with acute lymphocytic leukemia T-cell lines. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines bound anti-PAA up to sixteenfold greater than resting B-cells. Tumor cell lines of various nonlymphoid origins demonstrated marked reactivity with this antibody. Both benign and malignant cells in hyperplastic tissues, of various origins, bound anti-PAA, whereas their normal, nonproliferating counterparts did not. Normal proliferating cells in these tissues, including cells of the placental chorionic villi and trophoblasts, also bound anti-PAA. Of all lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines examined, only chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and some cell lines derived from Burkitt's lymphoma showed weak or no binding. This antibody also failed to react with a variety of nonprimate cell lines. Anti-PAA antibody did not immunoprecipitate any protein from lymphoid tumor cell lines to which it demonstrated a quantitatively high degree of binding, nor did protease treatment of these lines decrease antibody binding. Anti-PAA did, however, bind to glycolipids extracted from these cell lines. Binding of this monoclonal antibody to a minor neutral glycolipid, isolated from the erythroleukemia cell line K562, was about sixfold greater than that of any other K562 neutral glycolipid or ganglioside. Anti-PAA demonstrated weak or undetectable binding to purified, predominant, lymphoid cell membrane's neutral glycolipids and gangliosides. The monoclonal antibody anti-PAA appeared, therefore, to recognize a unique, proliferation-associated, neutral glycolipid present on normal as well as on benign and malignant proliferating cells. The antigen appeared to be universally expressed on proliferating cells from all human tissues with the exception of some Burkitt's cell lines and CLL cells. Nonhuman cell lines, except those for closely related primates, did not express PAA.","['Dubey, D P', 'Staunton, D E', 'Parekh, A C', 'Schwarting, G A', 'Antoniou, D', 'Lazarus, H', 'Yunis, E J']","['Dubey DP', 'Staunton DE', 'Parekh AC', 'Schwarting GA', 'Antoniou D', 'Lazarus H', 'Yunis EJ']",['eng'],"['AI-17120/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Surface', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Glycolipids/metabolism', 'Glycosphingolipids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/metabolism']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Feb;78(2):203-12.,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of peptide bond formation in cell-free systems and of L1210 and bacterial cell growth.,325-33,"The biological activity of 14 analogues of sparsomycin (1) was studied in cell-free systems of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Sulfolobus solfataricus by measuring the inhibition of protein synthesis. The inhibition of L1210 colony formation in soft agar and bacterial cell growth in solid as well as in liquid medium was also examined. Each analogue possesses not more than two structural modifications of the sparsomycin molecule. This enabled us to determine unambiguously several structural and stereochemical features that are required for an optimal biological activity in these assays. Sparsomycin, having the SCRS chirality, is the most potent of the four possible stereoisomers. The results obtained with compounds 5-7 indicate that the presence of an oxygen atom on the S (alpha) atom is essential. Substitution of the bivalent sulfur atom by a CH2 group (10) or of the SCH3 moiety by a Cl atom (12) affects the activity of the molecule partially. Compound 12 is surprisingly active against intact cells. Substitution of the C(6)-CH3 group by a H(14) reduces the activity of the molecule. Isomerization of the trans double bond into the cis double bond yields cis-sparsomycin (15), which is inactive. The hydrophobic derivatives 8, 9, and 11 are considerably more active than sparsomycin; thus the ribosomal binding site for sparsomycin may have a hydrophobic character.","['van den Broek, L A', 'Liskamp, R M', 'Colstee, J H', 'Lelieveld, P', 'Remacha, M', 'Vazquez, D', 'Ballesta, J P', 'Ottenheijm, H C']","['van den Broek LA', 'Liskamp RM', 'Colstee JH', 'Lelieveld P', 'Remacha M', 'Vazquez D', 'Ballesta JP', 'Ottenheijm HC']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Peptides)', '30394-07-1 (polyphenylalanine)', '6C940P63E7 (Sparsomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Peptide Biosynthesis', '*Peptides', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Ribosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Sparsomycin/analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiobacillus/metabolism']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00385a014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1987 Feb;30(2):325-33. doi: 10.1021/jm00385a014.,,,,,,,,,,

The characteristic feature of the lymphoma is massive infiltration of the T-zones of lymph nodes by plasmacytoid cells originally described by Lennert in non-specific lymphadenitis. Two lymphoma cases of this type have recently been published, by Muller-Hermelink et al. who named the cells 'plasmacytoid T-cells' (PTC), and by Prasthofer et al. These three cases have similar clinical and pathological features and appear to form a distinct clinicopathological entity. In contrast to the two previously published cases the present lymphoma also contained irregular lymphoid cells accompanying the PTC in the lymph node lesion and focally infiltrating the bone marrow. An accumulation of polytypic IgG positive plasma cells was observed in the remaining lymph node follicles. Immunohistological analysis with a range of monoclonal antibodies showed the PTC of our case to be CD5(T1)+, CD4(T4)+, CD3(T3)-, CD8(T8)-, CD2(T11)-, and CD25(TAC)-, but HLA-DR+ and transferrin receptor positive.

The lymph nodes showed reduced cellularity of the cortex and paracortex, dilated sinuses and no lymphoid follicles. The majority of leucocytes were T lymphocytes with an inversion of the normal T4:T8 ratio. No cells were detected expressing immature cortical thymocyte antigens, using NA1/34 and OKT10, but an excess of T11 (E rosette receptor)+ cells over the sum of T4+, T8+ and HNK1+ cells raised the possibility of the presence of immature cells. B lymphocytes were extremely rare and present as clusters in only two patients. Despite this, plasma cells were prominent in many cases and their number increased with time post transplant. The predominant immunoglobulin heavy chain class was IgA in seven cases, IgG in three cases, IgM in two cases and IgE in one case with no relationship between dominant class and days post transplant. In patients with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), there was a significantly lower T4:T8 ratio but no increase in expression of lymphocyte activation markers. Pyknotic leucocytes were present in half of the cases with GvHD and none of the other cases. No differences were detected in patients who had received marrow purged with monoclonal antibodies (Campath-I or UCHT1).

In lysates from exponentially growing ML-1, human myeloblastic leukemia cells, the antiserum (""anti-myb"") reacted with five proteins of Mr 58,000, 75,000, 85,000, 90,000 and 105,000. Of these, only p75 and a trace of p85 were detected, by immunoblotting, in extracts derived from ML-1 cell nuclei. The proteins p58, p75 and p90 were present in readily detectable amounts only in the relatively immature myeloid cell lines ML-1 and HL-60, whereas in the more mature myeloid cell line THP-1 and in the lymphoid line BALL-1 only traces of these proteins were found. p85 and p105 were detected in lysates from all cell lines tested, including myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells and mouse 3T3 cells. In lysates from ML-1 cells induced to differentiate to monocyte/macrophages or to granulocytes, the concentrations of p58 and p75 decreased in parallel with the cell population moving to maturity; in completely mature populations these two proteins were no longer detectable. In ML-1 cells arrested in G1 by serum depletion, the amount of p58 and p75 and to a smaller extent that of p90 was decreased, whereas the concentration of p85 and p105 remained unchanged. In nuclei from exponentially growing ML-1 cells, the antiserum or its derived immunoglobulin fraction (""anti-myb IgG"") inhibited mRNA transcriptional activity by 30%. DNA synthesis was not affected. In contrast, in nuclei from differentiated ML-1 cells, the mRNA transcriptional activity was not significantly inhibited by anti-myb IgG. Similarly, in nuclei from ML-1 cells arrested largely in G1 by serum depletion for 2 days, mRNA transcriptional activity was inhibited by only 11%. Upon supplementation with serum, the mRNA transcriptional activity inhibitable by anti-myb IgG increased in parallel with the increasing rate of cell growth.

Specificity screens using live cell radioimmunoassay techniques with 52 well-characterized human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines showed that both Lym-1 and Lym-2 bound to cell lines of B-cell lineage but were unreactive with those of T-cell, myeloid, or erythroid derivation. The B-cell specificity of these reagents was confirmed on 36 lymphoma and 15 leukemia biopsy specimens by using immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence techniques. Additionally, flow cytometric analysis of 22 lymphoma biopsies showed that the majority of B-cell tumors were Lym-1 and/or Lym-2 positive and that within a given biopsy, a high percentage of the malignant cell population was stained. In both the immunoperoxidase and flow cytometric studies, reactive T-cells or T-cell lymphomas were consistently negative with the exception of Hodgkin's disease tissues which, in some instances, showed a higher than expected positivity with Lym-1 and Lym-2. Approximately 40% of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias were found to be positive with Lym-1 while 80% were positive with Lym-2. Immunoperoxidase staining of frozen sections of human lymphoid tissues showed that both Lym-1 and Lym-2 stained germinal center and mantle zone B-lymphocytes as well as interfollicular histiocytes. Flow cytometric analysis of normal peripheral blood demonstrated specific staining of B-cells which comprised approximately 8% of circulating lymphocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining of nonlymphoid human organs and tissues revealed weak reactivity of Lym-1 with surface colonic epithelium only. Consistent with these findings, 35 solid tumor cell lines of diverse nature were found unreactive with both Lym-1 and Lym-2. Although standard techniques have thus far failed to identify the antigen recognized by Lym-2, the membrane antigen which binds Lym-1 has been shown by immunoprecipitation and competitive radioimmunoassay studies to be a polymorphic variant of the HLA-Dr antigen. Solid-phase radioimmunoassay techniques have shown that the antigens recognized by Lym-1 and Lym-2 are not significantly modulated after antibody exposure nor shed into the circulation of lymphoma patients. Finally, using iodine-125 labeled preparations of purified Lym-1 and Lym-2, we have determined that both reagents have a relatively large number of antibody binding sites per tumor cell and increased avidity for lymphoma cells when compared to normal and reactive lymph node B-cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Epstein, A L', 'Marder, R J', 'Winter, J N', 'Stathopoulos, E', 'Chen, F M', 'Parker, J W', 'Taylor, C R']","['Epstein AL', 'Marder RJ', 'Winter JN', 'Stathopoulos E', 'Chen FM', 'Parker JW', 'Taylor CR']",['eng'],"['R01-CA30621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA40608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Radioimmunoassay']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 1;47(3):830-40.,,,,,,,,,,

Studies and future directions.,626-31,"The clinical development of the alpha interferons has now progressed through initial Phase I and II trials into extensive controlled clinical trial designs. Alpha interferon has been a prototype of other biological agents that are now in clinical development. These agents operate through fundamentally different mechanisms of action than conventional chemotherapy and have produced a unique profile of side effects as well as response patterns. Time to response is generally longer than with chemotherapy, and dose-response and schedule-dependency questions continue to be explored for most tumor types. Although response rates have been low against most solid tumors when alpha interferon is used as a single agent, it has demonstrated a surprisingly wide range of efficacy in hematologic malignancies. These include tumors of presumed B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid lineages. In some diseases, e.g., hairy cell leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, alpha interferon is broadly effective; it appears to considerably reduce or occasionally eliminate the malignant clone while normalizing the peripheral blood counts in most patients. In other diseases, alpha interferon appears destined to play a major role as part of combination therapy or in maintenance or consolidation therapy. In other disease settings, alpha interferon's role continues to be explored as part of combination therapy, adjuvant therapy, or as local-regional therapy. The full potential of alpha interferon as an antineoplastic agent will not be determined for many years.

The 212 evaluable subjects in this trial received 2 X 10(6) U/m2 of interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously, on an outpatient basis, three times a week for 1 year. Of this group, 166 had previously undergone splenectomy, and 94 had received chemotherapy; 96% had more than 50% hairy cells in the bone marrow. Objective responses (complete, partial, and minor) were recorded in 89% of the study group and were characterized by a marked reduction in infections as well as in the need for transfusions. Complete response, defined as a normal complete blood count (CBC) and less than 5% hairy cells in the marrow, was achieved in 4% of the subjects. Partial responses (normal CBC) were attained in 74%, and minor responses (normalization of subnormal hematocrits or granulocyte or platelet counts) in 11%. Normalization of CBC usually did not occur until after 2 to 5 months of therapy. Results were comparable in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients.

Induction of HL-60 cells by phorbol esters to undergo monocytic differentiation results in the suppression of c-myc, but the activation of c-fos gene transcription. Chromatin structures of c-myc and c-fos were compared by measuring their sequences in nucleosome-associated DNA fragments. These nucleosomal particles were released from chromatin by micrococcal nuclease digestion and subsequently analyzed with two dimensional gel electrophoresis. C-myc related sequences were detected in nucleosomal DNA fragments of differentiated cells only, while the c-fos related sequences were found in nucleosomal DNAs of noninduced HL-60 cells. Since the enzyme preferentially digests relaxed DNAs, these results suggest that nucleosomal subunits of c-myc and c-fos chromatin are relaxed during the state of active transcription, and reassembled once their transcription is repressed.","['Chou, R H', 'Chen, T A', 'Churchill, J R', 'Thompson, S W', 'Chou, K L']","['Chou RH', 'Chen TA', 'Churchill JR', 'Thompson SW', 'Chou KL']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Protamines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Nucleosomes/*ultrastructure', 'Protamines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/11/26 00:00,1986/11/26 00:01,['1986/11/26 00:00'],"['1986/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(86)80356-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(86)80356-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1986 Nov 26;141(1):213-21. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(86)80356-4.,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-one were transplanted during first remission and 28 during or after first relapse of their disease. An additional six patients were transplanted because their leukemia was refractory to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, and one was transplanted as initial therapy. Actuarial 42 month survival for those transplanted during first remission was 47% and for those transplanted in first relapse or later it was 22% (p = 0.02). There was no difference in either group between those with ANLL and those with ALL. Two of the six patients with refractory leukemia are alive more than 22 and more than 15 months after the transplant. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease and interstitial pneumonitis was 90% and 39%, respectively, for the first remission group, and 96% and 37% for those transplanted in first relapse or later.

The leukemia recurrence rate, however, was 13% for those transplanted in first remission and 67% for those transplanted in first relapse or later (p = 0.0003).

These cells were also found to release a clastogenic factor and an angiogenesis-like factor into the conditioned medium. Similar factors present in the plasma of A-T patients may be the cause of chromosomael breakage and blood vessel proliferation respectively. It is suggested to that continual chromosomal breakage in lymphocytes, induced by the clastogenic factor, leads to a selection of T or B lymphocytes with neoplastic properties. Future studies should be directed towards skin Langerhans cells to determine their role in the immune deficiency and their interaction with other cellular elements in the skin of A-T patients.

The percentage of S-phase cells in the bone marrow (BM) biopsy were 25% compared to 7% from the simultaneously obtained BM aspirate. The duration of S-phase (Ts) was determined to be 4 hr and the total cell cycle time (Tc) was 16 hr. We demonstrated that the actual clinical course of this patient's illness corresponded well with the course predicted on the basis of these cell cycle measurements. Although he achieved aplasia in response to two successive courses of induction chemotherapy, leukemic cells repopulated the marrow, producing a rapidly rising PB white blood cell (WBC) count with a T1/2 of approximately 20 hr each time. It is likely that the resistance of this patient's leukemia to therapy was a result of the rapid proliferative rate of his leukemic cells and not due to the inability of chemotherapeutic agents to kill a large number of cells. Since the measurements can be completed within 48 hr, measuring Ts and Tc will provide a better understanding of the biological differences that exist between patients with ANLL.","['Raza, A', 'Maheshwari, Y', 'Brereton, W', 'Preisler, H D']","['Raza A', 'Maheshwari Y', 'Brereton W', 'Preisler HD']",['eng'],"['CA 28734-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41285-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Autoradiography', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830240109 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1987 Jan;24(1):65-75. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830240109.,,,,,,,,,,

Patterns of differentiation in blast crisis were as follows: myeloblastic 5 cases, lymphoblastic 6 cases, basophil differentiation 4 cases, monoblastic 3 cases, megakaryoblastic 1 case, and mixed 3 cases (myeloblastic and lymphoblastic, monoblastic and lymphoblastic and panmyelosis). Three cases were diagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in early stage. After complete remission was achieved rapidly with vincristine and prednisolone, the hematological findings showed CML features. The immunological phenotype of lymphoblasts in lymphoid crisis was Ia+, CALLA+, surface and intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin negative. It was suggested that the neoplastic cells in two cases had B cell differentiation because of B1 or B4 positive. The terminal deoxynucleodidyl transferase (TdT) activity was examined by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence techniques on 11 cases. All TdT+ cells were the small lymphoid cells in 5 cases of lymphoid crisis and one case in mixed type. Heterogeneity of the terminal phase of CML was recognized. It was thus suggested that blast crisis of CML occurred in the pluripotent stem cell.","['Nemoto, K', 'Honma, K', 'Fukuda, T', 'Ohnishi, Y']","['Nemoto K', 'Honma K', 'Fukuda T', 'Ohnishi Y']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,,IM,"['*Blast Crisis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1986 Oct;36(10):1441-54.,,,,,,,,,,

This paper summarizes some of the observations made on the Connecticut population. Data compiled by the Connecticut Tumor Registry have extended our knowledge about the patterns of multiple primary cancers, especially among long-term survivors of cancer and among patients with relatively rare tumors about which little information currently exists. When compared with the general Connecticut population, cancer patients had a 31 percent (RR = 1.31) increased risk of developing a second cancer and a 23 percent (RR = 1.23) elevated risk of second cancer at a different site from the first. Common environmental exposures seemed responsible for the excess occurrence of many second cancers, particularly those related to cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, or both. For example, persons with epithelial cancers of the lung, larynx, esophagus, buccal cavity, and pharynx were particularly prone to develop new cancers in the same or contiguous tissue throughout their lifetimes. Cancers of the colon, uterine corpus, breast, and ovary frequently occurred together, suggesting underlying hormonal or dietary influences. Only patients with prostate cancer were at significantly low risk for second cancer development; this might be an artifact of case finding, since advanced age at initial diagnosis was generally associated with an underascertainment of second cancers. Radiotherapy may have caused rectal and other cancer among patients with cancers of the female genital tract, and leukemia among patients with uterine corpus cancer. Chemotherapy with alkylating agents probably contributed to the excess of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia following multiple myeloma or cancers of the breast and ovary. Genetic susceptibility seemed to explain some tumor complexes, such as the multiple occurrences of cutaneous melanoma and the excess of bone cancer following retinoblastoma. Research into multiple cancer syndromes should enhance our understanding of carcinogenic factors and mechanisms and the development of strategies for cancer prevention and control.","['Boice, J D Jr', 'Curtis, R E', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Flannery, J T', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Curtis RE', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Flannery JT', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Yale J Biol Med,The Yale journal of biology and medicine,0417414,,IM,"['Alcohol Drinking', 'Connecticut', 'Diet', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*epidemiology/etiology/history', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking']",1986/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Yale J Biol Med. 1986 Sep-Oct;59(5):533-45.,,,,PMC2590194,,,,,,

Activities associated with the interferons include inhibition of viral replication, influence on cellular protein production, direct antiproliferative effects, and a variety of modulatory effects on the immune response. These regulatory functions of interferon underlie the interest in its use as an anticancer agent. alpha-interferon is the most extensively studied interferon species. While antitumor activity has been seen both in vivo and in vitro in some solid malignancies, the most impressive responses have occurred in the hematologic malignancies. For patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) (mycosis fungoides and the Sezary syndrome), a response rate of 45%, with 10% complete responses, was seen in patients treated with recombinant alpha-interferon at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Interferon appears to be one of the most effective single agents for cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Current trials include further phase II trials to determine whether lower doses of alpha-interferon will be as effective as the high doses used in the previously reported studies. Additional trials include phase III trials where interferons are included in combination with chemotherapy agents, as well as using interferon in the adjuvant setting.

Observations in the canine model indicating efficacy of combining a brief course of methotrexate with the cyclosporine regimen are now being confirmed in patients with early results indicating a reduction in GVHD and an improved survival. In both species failure to administer immunosuppression after grafting is associated with a high incidence of acute GVHD and an adverse effect on survival.

Results of studies in canine and human chimeras agree with murine data indicating a principal role for T cells in the pathogenic mechanism of GVHD. Chimera lymphocytes (of donor origin) from dogs and patients with acute GVHD show proliferative responses to previously stored host cells, and lymphocytes cytotoxic to host target cells are seen in patients with GVHD. Observations indicate a direct, rather than an indirect, role for T cells in GVHD. ""Specific"" suppressor cells may be responsible for maintaining stable graft-host tolerance while ""nonspecific"" suppressor cells may play a role in the impaired immune defenses in patients with chronic GVHD. Chronic GVHD, which resembles systemic collagen vascular disease, occurs in approximately 40% of HLA-identical recipients, particularly following acute GVHD and is more frequent in older patients. Efforts to treat both acute and chronic GVHD with prednisone, antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine and azathioprine are only unpredictably effective. Data in dogs pointed out the feasibility of transplants from partially matched related donors or matched unrelated donors, an approach that is now being pursued in human patients. Marrow grafts from HLA-partially matched family members resulted in a higher incidence of acute GVHD. There was no difference in acute GVHD comparing class I to class II antigen differences and long term survival was influenced by patient age and disease status rather than HLA incompatibility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Storb, R']",['Storb R'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dogs', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1986;224:139-57.,,,,,,,,,,

ADR-containing preparations have proteolytic activity, as indicated by their ability to degrade fibrin in a plasminogen-independent and plasminogen-dependent manner. In addition, aprotinin, a nonspecific protease inhibitor, abrogates ADR-induced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion. Preincubation studies demonstrated that the effect of aprotinin is not due to its suppressive effects on the nuclei themselves. Other protease inhibitors such as leupeptin, p-aminobenzamidine, and N-alpha-tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone are also inhibitory, but soybean trypsin inhibitor is without effect. ADR activity can be removed from active extracts by adsorption with aprotinin-conjugated agarose beads and can be recovered by elution with an acetate buffer (pH 5). These findings are consistent with the interpretation that the initiation of DNA synthesis in resting nuclei may be protease dependent and, further, that the cytoplasmic stimulatory factor we have called ADR may be a protease itself.","['Wong, R L', 'Gutowski, J K', 'Katz, M', 'Goldfarb, R H', 'Cohen, S']","['Wong RL', 'Gutowski JK', 'Katz M', 'Goldfarb RH', 'Cohen S']",['eng'],"['AG-05704/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-12477/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/physiology', '*DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Serine Endopeptidases', 'Xenopus']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.84.1.241 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Jan;84(1):241-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.1.241.,,,,PMC304179,,,,,,

The N-terminal sequence of the protein is derived from the BCR gene on chromosome 22. We have isolated overlapping cDNA clones from the K-562 cell line corresponding to approximately 8.5 kilobases of mRNA and have sequenced 2550 nucleotides at the 5' end. Our results indicate that the 5' end of the 8.5-kilobase mRNA consists of greater than 400 nucleotides of noncoding sequence that are greater than 80% G + C rich.

The median age was 32.5 yr and median disease duration of CML at time of BMT was 19.3 months. The pretransplant conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (CTX) (120 mg/kg) and 10.20 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) at 6 doses of 1.7 Gy each, administered in 3 daily fractions over 2 days at a dose rate of 15-20 cGy/min.

In addition to CYA, given until day +365, 10 patients received donor marrow depleted of T cells with CAMPATH-1. The residual marrow lymphocytes were always less than 1%. The rate of engraftment was significantly correlated with the number of nucleated cells infused. Neither GvHD nor graft failure were observed among CAMPATH-1 patients. In this group one cytogenetic and one hematologic relapse occurred. The overall actuarial survival at 24 months is 78%. Of the 10 patients treated with donor marrow depleted of T cells, 9 are alive after a median follow-up of 9 months (range 5-18), with an actuarial survival of 90%. Of the other 8 patients transplanted with untreated marrow, 5 are alive after a median follow-up of 19.3 months (range 3.7-24) and the actuarial survival is 63.8%. This pilot study seems to demonstrate that T-cell depletion of donor bone marrow with CAMPATH-1 is effective to prevent GvHD, while the risk of graft failure can be avoided using a ""standard"" conditioning regimen including a fractionated TBI with a fast dose rate and a prolonged administration of CYA at the maximum tolerable dosage.

The use of a large panel of antibodies detecting differentiation antigens allowed us to sub-classify 57/60 cases as 43 B-lineage ALLs and 14 T-lineage ALLs. The two types of ALL can be accurately distinguished by the expression of the antigens recognized by the antibodies of the clusters of differentiation CD19 (B4) and CD7 (Leu 9). Almost perfect agreement was obtained between the results of the two methods for antigens DR, CD10 (cALLA;J5) and CD7. A number of discordances were observed with other antigens [CD19 (B4), CD20 (B1), CD22 (To15), CD1 (T6), CD2 (T11), CD4 (T4), CD8 (T8), CD3 (T3), T9, T10]. In spite of these discordances, the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method can predict the lineage involved in most ALLs with a high degree of reliability. Nevertheless, for weakly expressed surface antigens (such as B4 and B1) the immunocytological method is less sensitive than flow cytofluorometry and can only approximately determine the stage of differentiation of neoplastic cells. Furthermore, the existence of cases which are at the same time negative with flow cytofluorometry and positive with immunocytology is consistent with the intracytoplasmic expression of certain differentiation antigens. Thus in the course of lymphoid differentiation, intra-cytoplasmic expression of T3, To15 and possibly J5 precedes their expression at the cell surface.","['Chen, Z', 'Sigaux, F', 'Miglierina, R', 'Valensi, F', 'Daniel, M T', 'Ochoa-Noguera, M H', 'Flandrin, G']","['Chen Z', 'Sigaux F', 'Miglierina R', 'Valensi F', 'Daniel MT', 'Ochoa-Noguera MH', 'Flandrin G']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90007-x [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(12):1411-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90007-x.,,,,,,,,,,

A short review.,957-64,"Based on the association of bacterial plaque with the initiation of chronic gingivitis and progression of chronic periodontitis, chemical antiplaque agents have been employed both in prevention of periodontal disease and its treatment. In supragingival plaque control regimens, chlorhexidine has not been superceded as a chemical anti-plaque agent, although other compounds have been shown to be useful. The local side-effects of chlorhexidine and other cationic antiseptics, however, limit their long-term use for prevention. Extrinsic tooth staining in particular remains the greatest problem. Short-term anti-plaque uses for chlorhexidine include as an adjunct to mechanical cleaning in the initial oral hygiene phase of treatment, in situations where mechanical oral hygiene is difficult, including postsurgery, intermaxillary fixation, fixed orthodontic therapy, physically and mentally handicapped individuals, systemic diseases with oral manifestations such as leukaemia. More recent interest in chlorhexidine has resulted from the delivery of compounds subgingivally in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Such methods have extended the use of chlorhexidine into areas inaccessible to the action of antimicrobial drugs delivered locally by conventional means, such as tooth brushing or mouth rinsing. Available evidence suggests that chlorhexidine may not be as effective as some antimicrobial drugs whose activity is more specific for those organisms considered particularly pathogenic to the periodontal tissues.","['Addy, M']",['Addy M'],['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Periodontol,Journal of clinical periodontology,0425123,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents, Local)', 'R4KO0DY52L (Chlorhexidine)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local/therapeutic use', 'Chlorhexidine/*therapeutic use', 'Dental Plaque/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Humans']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-051x.1986.tb01434.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Periodontol. 1986 Nov;13(10):957-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051x.1986.tb01434.x.,,,,,,,116,,,

These sublines were 28-, 70- and 162-fold more resistant than sensitive (ML1/S) cells to the cytotoxicity of D1 and were cross-resistant to adriamycin, epiadriamycin, actinomycin D, VP-16, VM26, and mitoxantrone. Steady-state levels of D1 in resistant sublines I and II, in the presence or absence of azide, were not significantly different from those of sensitive cells. However, the steady-state level of D1 in subline III was significantly increased in the presence of sodium azide. D1 efflux was minimal in ML1/S and resistant cells in the absenced of glucose. Addition of glucose enhanced D1 efflux only in subline III. Verapamil increased the cellular levels of D1 and inhibited its efflux from resistant III cells but not from ML1/S cells. Verapamil also greatly enhanced the cytotoxicity of D1 for sublines I, II, and III. The differences between sensitive and resistant cells in D1 uptake and retention seemed inadequate to cause 162-fold resistance and suggested other factors may be contributing to the development of resistance. In support of this hypothesis, daunorubicin reductase activity was significantly lower in resistant cells than in ML1/S cells. The greatest decrease in activity occurred at pH 8.5 which represents aldehyde reductases. Currently, we are investigating other possibilities for D1 metabolism, such as aglycone and free radical formation.","['Vasanthakumar, G', 'Ahmed, N K']","['Vasanthakumar G', 'Ahmed NK']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Aldo-Keto Reductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.21 (Aldehyde Reductase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases/*analysis', 'Aldehyde Reductase', 'Aldo-Keto Reductases', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00262277 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1986;18(2):105-10. doi: 10.1007/BF00262277.,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleolar antigen p145 in HL-60 cells was undetectable after 132 h of treatment with retinoic acid.

To repair this adduct, cells contain a limited amount of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (alkyltransferase), a protein which removes the alkyl group in a stoichiometric reaction. To prevent mutations, repair must occur before DNA replication takes place. Consequently, formation of point mutations is related inversely to the number of alkyltransferase molecules and directly to the rate of DNA synthesis. Bone marrow hematopoietic precursors, the target for nitrosourea-induced leukemia, are deficient in alkyltransferase activity. We questioned whether regenerating bone marrow is more susceptible to nitrosoureas than other organs due to persistently low levels of alkyltransferase activity during periods of increased cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. Following syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, murine hematopoietic cells underwent rapid cell proliferation but alkyltransferase activity remained well below the activity in liver. After N-nitrosomethylurea exposure, [3H]thymidine incorporation in rat bone marrow increased 3-fold and stem cell proliferation over 10-fold within 2 days of exposure, but alkyltransferase activity remained low. The relative susceptibility of bone marrow to mutagenic damage from O6-alkylguanine adducts was determined by comparing the ratio of alkyltransferase activity to [3H]thymidine incorporation in marrow, kidney, and liver. In untreated animals, the ratio was lowest in bone marrow and decreased further 48 h after N-nitrosomethylurea exposure to only 21% that of kidney and 1% that of liver. Thus, proliferating hematopoietic precursors appear more likely to form point mutations following nitrosourea exposure than other rodent tissues because they undergo rapid proliferation soon after DNA damage and before O6-alkylguanine adducts can be repaired. The combination of rapid cell proliferation and low DNA repair capacity may be the mechanism of nitrosourea induced leukemic transformation of the bone marrow.","['Gerson, S L', 'Trey, J E', 'Miller, K', 'Benjamin, E']","['Gerson SL', 'Trey JE', 'Miller K', 'Benjamin E']",['eng'],"['CA 07912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 00134/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9B710FV2AE (O-(6)-methylguanine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', '*DNA Repair', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylnitrosourea/toxicity', 'Methyltransferases/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mutation', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jan 1;47(1):89-95.,,,,,,,,,,

The carcinomas were frequently multiple, recurrent, and clinically aggressive. The tumors showed unusually poor differentiation histologically. Actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinomas were frequently associated with SCC. Fifty percent metastasized to cervical lymph nodes replaced by WDLL. Lymphadenopathy due to metastatic SCC may be mistaken for malignant lymphoma alone. In two of five patients (40%), death was directly attributable to SCC.

Immunosuppression due to WDLL and/or to chemotherapy is likely an important predisposing factor in combination with sun exposure.","['Perez-Reyes, N', 'Farhi, D C']","['Perez-Reyes N', 'Farhi DC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cheek/pathology', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Scalp/pathology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870201)59:3<540::aid-cncr2820590330>3.0.co;2-u [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Feb 1;59(3):540-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870201)59:3<540::aid-cncr2820590330>3.0.co;2-u.,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) study of initial therapy, investigators were free to use TS prophylaxis or not. Analysis of those data seemed to favor TS for duration of continuous complete remission. In the study reported here, of 126 randomized patients with ALL, 63 received TS. There was no effect of TS on disease-free survival after 3 years follow-up. Overall severe toxicity did not differ. However, granulocytopenia was somewhat more severe in the TS group. Hepatic toxicity, measured by enzyme elevation approached significance in the TS group versus controls. Some institutions declined randomization and treated with or without TS as a routine. Outcome and toxicities did not differ from randomized patients. There was no statistically significant effect on severe, life-threatening or fatal infection between the randomized TS versus control groups. Children not receiving TS developed varicella more often, a disease for which one would not expect TS to show a preventative effect. Pneumocystis pneumonias were not reported. The authors conclude that TS prophylaxis did not increase the continuous complete remission rate in children with ALL or decrease the incidence of infection. Toxicity is somewhat higher on TS.","['van Eys, J', 'Berry, D M', 'Crist, W', 'Doering, E J', 'Fernbach, D J', 'Pullen, J', 'Shuster, J']","['van Eys J', 'Berry DM', 'Crist W', 'Doering EJ', 'Fernbach DJ', 'Pullen J', 'Shuster J']",['eng'],"['CA 03713/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['AN164J8Y0X (Trimethoprim)', 'JE42381TNV (Sulfamethoxazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Infections/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Random Allocation', 'Sulfamethoxazole/administration & dosage', 'Trimethoprim/administration & dosage']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870101)59:1<19::aid-cncr2820590108>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Jan 1;59(1):19-23. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870101)59:1<19::aid-cncr2820590108>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,,,

Consideration must be given to the significantly increased risk of postoperative infectious morbidity in patients with chronic leukemia when evaluating the usefulness of splenectomy.","['Mower, W R', 'Hawkins, J A', 'Nelson, E W']","['Mower WR', 'Hawkins JA', 'Nelson EW']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Surg,American journal of surgery,0370473,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/*etiology', 'Splenectomy']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9610(86)90430-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9610(86)90430-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Surg. 1986 Dec;152(6):583-6. doi: 10.1016/0002-9610(86)90430-7.,,,,,,,13,,,

A cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB) study.,533-6,"Many adjuvant chemotherapy regimens used for breast cancer include prednisone, which has the potential to cause hyperglycemia. We reviewed the results of three CALGB studies employing prednisone as part of adjuvant therapy to determine the incidence and severity of hyperglycemic complications. All treatment regimens included cyclophosphamide, methotrexate or doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine in addition to prednisone. Among 1,237 evaluable patients receiving a five-drug regimen including prednisone, there were 98 patients (7.9%) who experienced any degree of hyperglycemia. Thirty patients (2.4% overall; 30.6% of those having any hyperglycemia) had severe or life-threatening degrees of hyperglycemia, including two patients whose hyperglycemia contributed directly to death. We conclude that prednisone administration as part of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in breast cancer produces an appreciable incidence of hyperglycemia. Serum glucose levels should be monitored during therapy to help prevent the occasional severe or life-threatening episode of hyperglycemia in these patients.","['Ellis, M E', 'Weiss, R B', 'Korzun, A H', 'Rice, M A', 'Norton, L', 'Perloff, M', 'Lesnick, G J', 'Wood, W C']","['Ellis ME', 'Weiss RB', 'Korzun AH', 'Rice MA', 'Norton L', 'Perloff M', 'Lesnick GJ', 'Wood WC']",['eng'],"['CA-26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CMF protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-198612000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1986 Dec;9(6):533-6. doi: 10.1097/00000421-198612000-00013.,,,,,,,,,,

Vital capacity (VC) was lowered in patients with leukaemia before transplantation. VC and FEV1 fell significantly after transplantation. Residual volume (RV) and RV as a percentage of total lung capacity (RV % TLC) were already increased and rose significantly after transplantation. Patients with severe aplastic anaemia had noticeably increased RV and RV % TLC, values that did not change after transplantation. In contrast to the patients with aplastic anaemia, the patients with leukaemia had significantly reduced VC, RV, RV % TLC, and FEV1 before and after transplantation. The specific airway resistance (sRaw) was raised significantly before and after transplantation in the leukaemic patients. In addition, transfer coefficient (Kco) fell significantly more after transplantation in the patients with leukaemia than in those with severe aplastic anaemia. In three patients with histologically established obstructive bronchiolitis in conjunction with chronic graft versus host disease after transplantation, VC, FEV1 and FEV1 % VC fell, while RV, RV % TLC, and sRaw rose; Kco was far below normal. On the basis of these findings it is concluded that in patients with leukaemia obstructive disorders of ventilation develop or, if they are already present, worsen. In patients with severe aplastic anaemia lung function was not impaired in the early phase after transplantation. These differences are probably due to the more intensive immunosuppressive and cytotoxic preparatory regimen before transplantation in the leukaemic patients. Obstructive bronchiolitis, a complication of graft versus host disease, first manifests itself in a typical rise in specific airway resistance and must be treated early.","['Link, H', 'Reinhard, U', 'Blaurock, M', 'Ostendorf, P']","['Link H', 'Reinhard U', 'Blaurock M', 'Ostendorf P']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Thorax,Thorax,0417353,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/physiopathology/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/therapy', 'Lung/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology/immunology', 'Lung Diseases, Obstructive/etiology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Respiratory Function Tests']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/thx.41.7.508 [doi]'],ppublish,Thorax. 1986 Jul;41(7):508-12. doi: 10.1136/thx.41.7.508.,,,,PMC460382,,,,,,

Except for mucositis all other symptoms of acute toxicity such as fever, vomiting, parotitis, headache and abdominal pain were usually of short duration. Fractionated TBI did not produce less acute side effects than single dose irradiation. Irradiation, and particularly the maximum lung dose, plays an important role in the multifactorial pathogenesis of IP. Delayed complications may appear several months or years after TBI. The majority of men suffer definitive sterility caused by azoospermia. In women primary ovarian failure and permanent sterility is a common sequela of BMT with TBI. The risk of developing cataracts after single dose TBI is about 80%, and surgical repair was necessary in 43% of these cases. Secondary tumors after TBI have been reported.

Recently its reliability has been put in question because of false positive and false negative results. In our study, B2m was measured in 574 CSF samples collected from 74 patients affected by ALL, ANLL or lymphomas; 20 of these patients had CNS-involvement while they were under observation.

A possible model for cancer.,79-84,"Several steps in the clinical evolution of human neoplasia are associated with a variety of recurrent chromosomal defects that could prove essential to the understanding of cancer. We found 15 types of nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities in a study of 71 patients with follicular lymphoma; 10 of the types appeared to influence the histopathological findings, clinical course, or response to treatment. A translocation, t(14;18), observed in 85 percent of all patients appeared to be the main determinant of a follicular pattern. Ten patients with a t(14;18) as a single defect had the histologic features of follicular small cleaved-cell lymphoma. Most did not require treatment for one to four years, because their tumors had an initial indolent course. In contrast, patients with follicular small cleaved-cell lymphoma with t(14;18) and deletion 13q32 acquired the hematologic features of leukemia and had an acceleration of the disease. A deletion 6q together with a complete or partial trisomy 7 or trisomy 12 (or both) was associated with the clinically more aggressive follicular mixed small- and large-cell or large-cell histologic type, which often evolves from follicular small-cell lymphoma. A complete or partial trisomy 3, 18, or 21 correlated almost exclusively with follicular large-cell lymphoma. In all follicular stages, a trisomy 2 or duplication 2p often accompanied an accelerated clinical course and a poor response to treatment. This study suggests that several discrete genomic defects may govern the evolution of a patient's malignant disease.","['Yunis, J J', 'Frizzera, G', 'Oken, M M', 'McKenna, J', 'Theologides, A', 'Arnesen, M']","['Yunis JJ', 'Frizzera G', 'Oken MM', 'McKenna J', 'Theologides A', 'Arnesen M']",['eng'],['CA-33314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1987/01/08 00:00,1987/01/08 00:01,['1987/01/08 00:00'],"['1987/01/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/08 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198701083160204 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1987 Jan 8;316(2):79-84. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198701083160204.,,,,,,,,,,

Multivariate analysis of pretreatment characteristics has shown that lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are independently associated with increased risk of T.R. during maintenance and off therapy, respectively. Sequential biopsy studies have demonstrated that testicular biopsies are unable to detect scanty infiltrates and have no practical utility. Prophylactic gonadal irradiation produced equivocal results and should not be used because of its sterilizing effect. Intensive multi-drug regimens or prolonged maintenance were unable to substantially reduce T.R. rate. On the contrary, intermediate-dose methotrexate (IDM) early in remission has almost abolished T.R. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that testicular interstitium is a very peculiar site where blasts are partially protected from the drug action; high drug concentrations are required for the optimal cytocidal effect. There are sufficient clues of a link between the excess of late marrow relapse in male sex and the capacity of testes of harboring blasts. Therefore IDM early in remission should be routinely adopted for prevention of testicular leukemia and its potential of late spread.","['Russo, A', ""Schiliro', G""]","['Russo A', ""Schiliro' G""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/prevention & control', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Prognosis', 'Rats', 'Research Design', 'Sex Factors', 'Testicular Neoplasms/pathology/*prevention & control']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950140603 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1986;14(6):300-5. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950140603.,,,,,,,,,,

Of 507 patients evaluable for response, complete remission (CR) rates varied from 32% for patients with primary acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (1 degree ANLL) to 16% for patients with hematologic malignancies secondary to previous chemotherapy or following a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (2 degrees ANLL), and 16% for MDS. Median duration of CR was 9.5 months for 1 degree ANLL, and 10.5 months for both 2 degrees ANLL and MDS. Based on limited available survival data, overall median survival for these groups was 9 months, 3 months, and 15 months, respectively. Only three CRs were reported of 31 evaluable patients treated for a variety of other hematologic malignancies. CR rates for patients with 1 degree ANLL greater than or equal to 50 years old was 56%, compared with 29% less than 50 years old (P = .10). While prior chemotherapy was more common in 1 degree ANLL patients less than 50 years of age (86% v 21%; P less than .001), it did not influence response rates in those greater than 50 years of age, suggesting other biases. Hematologic toxicity was mentioned in only 33 of 53 publications, affecting 254 of 289 patients (88%), with at least 15% treatment-related deaths. LoDAC hypothetically acts as a differentiating agent; however, correlative laboratory studies were rarely performed. Cytogenetic data were available for only 15%, and in vitro studies for 10% of all patients with marked discrepancies in the interpretation of results. LoDAC is clearly cytotoxic for both malignant and normal hematopoietic cells. While large numbers of patients have been reported, the lack of well-designed clinical trials prohibits definitive conclusions as to its role as a differentiating agent. Future LoDAC studies should determine optimal dose and schedule, with clinical laboratory correlates to assess differentiation. Trials in ANLL comparing LoDAC with conventional chemotherapy, and in MDS with supportive care alone, may help identify the role of LoDAC. Until appropriate indications can be identified, LoDAC should not be routinely used in clinical practice.","['Cheson, B D', 'Jasperse, D M', 'Simon, R', 'Friedman, M A']","['Cheson BD', 'Jasperse DM', 'Simon R', 'Friedman MA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Platelet Count']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1986.4.12.1857 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1986 Dec;4(12):1857-64. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1986.4.12.1857.,,,,,,,73,,,

Report to the Council by the Working Party on Leukaemia in Childhood.,1758-64,"The Medical Research Council UKALL V trial for children with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (aged 1 to 14 years, leucocyte count less than 20 X 10(9)/L) was designed to determine whether the immunosuppressive effects of treatment could be reduced without sacrifice of antileukemic effect by alterations in the type of continuing therapy or in fractionation of cranial irradiation. Remission was achieved in 496 children on standard induction therapy, and 309 children received 24 Gy of cranial irradiation in ten to 16 fractions over 21 days, and 174 received 21 Gy in five to nine fractions over 21 days. The type of radiotherapy administered had no influence on relapse at any site or rate of death in remission. All 496 children were randomized to receive chemotherapy for 2 or 3 years with 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate either as a continuous (group C) or a semicontinuous (group G) regimen or as a five-day pulse every 3 weeks (group I). All groups also received vincristine and prednisolone every 6 weeks. With a minimum follow-up of almost 7 years, patients in group I had significantly fewer remission deaths (P = .025) but a much higher rate of bone marrow relapse than those in group C or G (P = .002). There was an overall benefit for 3 years of chemotherapy compared with 2 years, which in contrast to previous studies, was more apparent in girls and in patients in groups C and G. Testicular relapse occurred in 37 boys, including 19 patients off therapy, with a previously negative biopsy. The overall results confirmed the prognostic significance of initial leucocyte count, even among these standard-risk patients, while girls had a superior rate of disease-free survival, but not of hematologic remission. It is concluded that, even among standard-risk patients, the prognosis is influenced by the height of the initial leukocyte count. While alterations in the fractionation of cranial irradiation do not appear to have influenced disease-free survival, intermittent continuing chemotherapy, although less immunosuppressive, is less effective than conventional continuous therapy in the treatment of ALL. In this study, 3 years of chemotherapy appeared superior to 2 years.","['Chessells, J M', 'Durrant, J', 'Hardy, R M', 'Richards, S']","['Chessells JM', 'Durrant J', 'Hardy RM', 'Richards S']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'England', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Random Allocation', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1986.4.12.1758 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1986 Dec;4(12):1758-64. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1986.4.12.1758.,,,,,,,,,,

When donor and recipient are less than identical at the MHC the incidence and severity of acute graft versus host disease are correspondingly higher. The morbidity and mortality associated with acute GvHD has limited the application of bone marrow transplantation in two ways: first by restricting the procedure to patients with serious haematological disease and second by excluding individuals who might benefit from BMT but who lack an MHC identical sibling.

Peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were generally normal, and all had morphologic evidence of engraftment without leukemia at the time of study. Both peripheral-blood- and bone-marrow-derived CFU-TL were markedly reduced after transplantation as compared to normal controls, which included bone marrow donors (14.2 +/- 5/4 X 10(4) vs 313 +/- 100/4 X 10(4) [p less than 0.001] and 26 +/- 4/2 X 10(5) vs 1004 +/- 60/2 X 10(5) [p less than 0.001]). Among the patients, four had no detectable bone-marrow-derived CFU-TL when tested less than six months after transplantation. Peripheral blood CFU-TL, while present in all patients, was markedly decreased for more than 12 months after transplantation. After two years, the number of CFU-TL returned to normal in several patients. The abnormalities in CFU-TL were unrelated to diagnosis, age, sex, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pretransplant conditioning, or posttransplant immunosuppressive treatment. Patients receiving autologous bone marrow transplants also had decreased CFU-TL. Cocultures of normal peripheral-blood- or bone-marrow-derived mononuclear cells with recipients' mononuclear cells or sera did not inhibit normal CFU-TL growth. Furthermore, the addition of mononuclear cells or sera from normal individuals, or of exogenous interleukin 1 or interleukin 2, did not correct the deficiency of CFU-TL growth by recipient cells. Depletion of T-lymphocytes from bone marrow or peripheral blood in transplant recipients by physical techniques or with a monoclonal antibody (CT-2) and complement had no effect on CFU-TL recovery. Similarly, addition of recipients' T cells to normal peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells did not suppress CFU-TL. These data indicate that most transplant recipients have a marked reduction in CFU-TL which persists for up to two years after transplantation. This reduction in the growth of T-cell colonies appears to be due to deficient numbers of these cells or an intrinsic defect in their responsiveness to T-cell lymphokines, rather than a result of growth suppression by inhibitory cells or serum factors. This observed defect in CFU-TL may have implications for therapeutic attempts to facilitate immune reconstitution after bone marrow transplantation.","['Mitsuyasu, R T', 'Li, S N', 'Champlin, R E', 'Gale, R P']","['Mitsuyasu RT', 'Li SN', 'Champlin RE', 'Gale RP']",['eng'],"['CA-23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO8CA932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Dec;14(11):1049-55.,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that the anti-ets serum specifically identifies in chicken cells a second set of proteins of 60 kd (p60), 62 kd (p62) and 64 kd (p64) which appear to be highly related to each other but display only a limited domain of homology with p54c-ets and p135gag-myb-ets and are thus probably encoded by a gene(s) partially related to, but different from c-ets. In contrast to p54c-ets which is expressed at high levels in chicken lymphoid tissues, prominent syntheses of p62 and p64 were found in both normal and transformed chicken macrophages but not in avian cells corresponding to immature stages of the myeloid differentiation pathway. These observations together with the fact that differentiation of avian myeloblastosis virus-transformed myeloblasts into macrophage-like cells after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate is accompanied by the synthesis of p62 and p64 suggest a role for these proteins in chicken macrophage differentiation or function.

Results of chemotherapy and transplantation are compared in Table 4. Transplantation is the preferred treatment in individuals who fail chemotherapy. Transplantation is also likely to be superior or comparable to chemotherapy in individuals less than 30 years of age in first remission. Transplantation in older individuals in first remission is controversial, but it is unlikely that these results are inferior to results with chemotherapy. Transplants from donors other than HLA-identical siblings are less well investigated but may be a reasonable alternative in young individuals in first relapse or second remission, particularly if recipient and donor share most HLA antigens. Autotransplants are difficult to evaluate critically and should be considered investigational in individuals in second or later remission for whom a suitable donor is unavailable. Autotransplants in first remission should be restricted to controlled clinical trials, since their efficacy is otherwise inevaluable. It is uncertain whether in vitro treatment of the bone marrow is necessary in the context of autotransplantation; again, controlled trials are required. Bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling is a useful therapy in individuals with ALL who relapse despite chemotherapy. Individuals undergoing transplantation in second or later remission or in relapse have a survival rate superior to those treated with chemotherapy; these data are summarized in Table 5. One important unresolved issue in ALL is whether children with high-risk ALL and adults should receive transplants in first remission. This answer will, to a considerable extent, depend on results achieved with chemotherapy alone. If intensive chemotherapy produces 50-70% disease-free survival in these individuals, it is unlikely that transplantation will be superior. If, however, alternative chemotherapy results are inferior, transplantation may be useful. Clearly, controlled clinical trials are needed. Results of transplants from donors other than HLA-identical siblings are less certain but this approach may be considered in selected young individuals who fail chemotherapy. Autotransplants should also be considered in this setting but not in individuals in first remission. It is likewise uncertain if in vitro treatment of the bone marrow is useful; this must be addressed in controlled trials.

Our data indicate that this theory is too restrictive. If leukaemogenesis occurs in pluripotent progenitors in a relatively high percentage of cases, we would propose a model in which lymphoid and myeloid differentiation antigens are expressed simultaneously until the progenitor cell commits to a single lineage. Lineage commitment could involve external factors, e.g. growth factors (Sherr et al, 1985), that cause genes specific for the opposite lineage to be 'switched off'. The control of gene expression in mammalian cells and the specific chromosomal sites of genes coding for the various lineage-associated markers remain uncertain. However, recent studies indicate that most, if not all, leukaemic cells contain chromosomal abnormalities, many involving rearrangements of DNA (Williams et al, 1986). Since the control of eukaryotic gene expression is known to involve numerous sequence elements, some acting at a distance from the site of transcription (Dynan and Tjian, 1985), genetic perturbations within the cell (e.g. a reciprocal translocation) could be expected to deregulate certain genes, leading to their under- or overexpression analogous to activation of the c-myc oncogene by the 8;14 translocation in Burkitt's lymphoma. Thus, an almost infinite variety of cell lineage-related phenotypes could be expected from this mechanism alone, even if the transforming event did not involve a pluripotent stem cell. Also, we have hypothesized that enzymes such as TdT, a DNA polymerase that catalyses polymerization of deoxyribonucleotides without a DNA template, could serve as a modifier of DNA sequences, permitting otherwise inactive genes to be expressed (Stass and Mirro, 1985). It is interesting that most cases of childhood acute mixed-lineage leukaemia are TdT positive, even though this is not true for the chronic leukaemias of adults. It is now clear that unusual combinations of myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages are much more common in acute leukaemia than have been generally recognized or suspected. The traditional division of the acute leukaemias into ALL and AML may not be the most accurate way to represent this class of haematological malignancies. That mixed-lineage leukaemia may require alternative therapy is a clinically important observation and underscores the need for comprehensive testing of blast cells at diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Stass, S A', 'Mirro, J Jr']","['Stass SA', 'Mirro J Jr']",['eng'],"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1986/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1986 Aug;15(3):811-27.,,,,,,,92,,,

Intensive induction chemotherapy using seven-day courses of cytarabine and daunorubicin or amsacrine produce remission in 60-85% of patients. Median remission duration is 9-16 months. In some series, 20-40% of patients are in continuous remission for two years or more; many of these patients remain in remission for five years or longer and some may be cured. Bone marrow transplantation has evolved as a useful therapeutic modality capable of achieving long-term survival in some circumstances in which chemotherapy is relatively ineffective. Its precise role in the initial therapy of AML remains to be defined but it is likely to be beneficial in selected patients. These data indicate substantial recent progress in the treatment of this disease which was almost uniformly fatal 30 years ago. The fact that most patients relapse within 1-2 years reflects a lack of progress in developing effective postremission therapy. Maintenance chemotherapy, immunotherapy and CNS prophylaxis have little role in AML. It is unclear whether consolidation or intensification extend remissions or increase the proportion of long-term survivors; controlled randomized trials should answer this question within the next few years. Future progress in the treatment of AML awaits the development of more sensitive methods for detecting residual leukaemia, more effective use of current therapeutic modalities and the introduction of new effective drugs. Most data suggest that early intensive treatment is of key importance for achieving cures. We cannot presently distinguish, however, between patients cured by initial treatment and those who require further chemotherapy.","['Gale, R P', 'Foon, K A']","['Gale RP', 'Foon KA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1986 Aug;15(3):781-810.,,,,,,,203,,,

Specific growth patterns rather than the frequency of blast colonies, appear to be of prognostic value for the clinical outcome. In particular, blast cells with high self-renewal ability were associated with poor prognosis. A similar degree of heterogeneity among leukaemic blast cell populations can be identified by studies with monoclonal antibodies directed against various cell surface cytoplasmic determinants that are associated with haematopoietic precursors. Some of these reflect properties of pluripotent normal counterparts while others display patterns that are associated with precursors restricted to a single myeloid lineage. Blast cells examined after culture may differ in their marker expression from the original blast cell population. Usually, properties of more mature cells are acquired during the culture period. These changes reflect events of aberrant differentiation without leading to the full development of a morphologically normal phenotype and functional capability. The use of both technologies has provided considerable insight into the biology of leukaemic blast cell populations and it is anticipated that their future use will provide further information about the control mechanisms involved in their proliferation and their potential to differentiate normally.","['Messner, H A', 'Griffin, J D']","['Messner HA', 'Griffin JD']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Phenotype']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1986 Aug;15(3):641-67.,,,,,,,163,,,

Table 3 shows that most patients with AML, MDS and ALL can be placed into one of three major prognostic categories. When chromosome analysis is combined with a cytological study in AML and MDS and with a cytological and immunophenotypic study in ALL, the clinical value of such analysis is further enhanced. Because of critical prognostic information that may be obtained primarily from refined chromosome analysis, we recommend that a major effort be undertaken to develop capability for such analysis in all large institutions so that the information derived can be used routinely in the assessment of haematological malignancies. In particular, it is now necessary to reassess the value of current treatments taking into consideration refined chromosome studies. We believe that patients within specific chromosomal categories should be treated with specific types of therapy in an attempt to improve overall survival.","['Yunis, J J', 'Brunning, R D']","['Yunis JJ', 'Brunning RD']",['eng'],['CA31024/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1986 Aug;15(3):597-620.,,,,,,,87,,,

The speed of this method facilitates the investigation of fresh leukemic cells from individual patients and assesses the cytolytic efficacy of the relevant MoAbs in the presence of complement (C'). Lymphoblasts (TdT+) are mixed in equal proportions with known numbers of ""inert"" cells, eg, RBC or nonleukemic bone marrow (BM). Following incubation with MoAbs and C' the ratio of residual TdT+ cells and inert cells is determined on cytospin preparations. Initially, percentages of TdT+ cells are counted in a unit volume of 5,000 inert cells, followed by the scanning of greater than 2 X 10(4) inert cells on entire slides. With this method more than 4 log cytoreduction of TdT + cells is detected. The method is also applicable for studying the cytolysis of malignant B cells by using mostly monoclonal lg expression rather than TdT for the identification of residual B cells. Ten representative patients selected from a group of greater than 100 are reported. In some cases cytoreduction of greater than 4 log with no identifiable residual TdT + cells is achieved by a single C'-fixing MoAb: anti-CD10 (RFAL3) in common acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and anti-CD7 (RFT2) in T cell ALL (T-ALL). Other cases require cocktails of anti-CD10, anti-CD19, and anti-CD24 in common ALL or anti-CD7 and anti-CD8 in T-ALL. In T-ALL a few TdT + cells remain that exhibit the features of normal TdT + BM cells (CD7-, HLA-DR+).

Activities associated with the interferons include inhibition of viral replication, influence on cellular protein production, direct antiproliferative effects, and a variety of modulatory effects on the immune response. These regulatory functions of interferon underlie the interest in its use as an anticancer agent. Alpha interferon is the most extensively studied interferon species. Although antitumor activity has been seen both in vitro and in vivo in some solid malignancies, the most impressive responses have occurred in the hematologic malignancies. More than 90 percent of patients with hairy cell leukemia have a sustained recovery of their peripheral blood cell counts with alpha interferon therapy. Approximately 50 percent of patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma demonstrate a response to alpha interferon. More than 80 percent of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia have a response to alpha interferon, and in one study, nearly half of the patients with response had complete suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome clone on at least one examination.

Distinct individual variations in the enzymatic activity were observed either in neutral or slightly-acid media in the animal groups studied. In chronic lympholeukosis specific proteolytic activity, calculated per a cell, was decreased, while it was increased in calculation per a mg of protein. The lower content of protein (about 2.4-fold) was found in lysates of lymphocytes in chronic lympholeukosis as compared with normal state. An increase in proteolytic activity in lymphocyte lysates correlated with elevation of blood leukocytosis if chronic lympholeukosis developed in individual animals. Effects of a number of proteinase inhibitors and activators were studied in the cell lysates; the spectrum of proteinases in chronic lympholeukosis was dissimilar to that of normal state. Pepstatin inhibited quite completely the proteolytic activity at pH 4.0 in lymphocytes of healthy animals and hence cathepsin D was responsible for the activity; in chronic lympholeukosis, except of cathepsin D, thiol-dependent proteinase was also detected. Activity of proteinases at neutral pH value in lymphocytes of healthy and impaired animals was inhibited by phenylmethionine fluorosulfate and p-chloromercuribenzoate, thus suggesting that serine and thiol-dependent proteinases were present; the level of these enzymes was distinctly higher in chronic lympholeukosis as compared with normal state.","['Gevorkian, N M', 'Lokshina, L A', 'Nikolaeva, N V', 'Itkin, B Z']","['Gevorkian NM', 'Lokshina LA', 'Nikolaeva NV', 'Itkin BZ']",['rus'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Vopr Med Khim,Voprosy meditsinskoi khimii,0416601,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*enzymology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*veterinary', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*blood', 'Protease Inhibitors/blood']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vopr Med Khim. 1986 Sep-Oct;32(5):72-6.,Sravnitel'naia kharakteristika proteoliticheskikh fermentov limfotsitov v norme i pri khronicheskon leikoze.,,,,,,,,,

These alterations may frequently arise spontaneously as a consequence of the unique developmental and functional programs of lymphoid cells and have as a major phenotypic consequence the stabilization of transitory cellular phenotypes.","['Greaves, M F']",['Greaves MF'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",1986/11/07 00:00,1986/11/07 00:01,['1986/11/07 00:00'],"['1986/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.3535067 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1986 Nov 7;234(4777):697-704. doi: 10.1126/science.3535067.,,,,,,,98,,,

The value of oral prophylactic norfloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours) in preventing bacterial infections was determined for 68 adults with acute leukemia by a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The efficacy of norfloxacin administered prophylactically throughout the course of intensive therapy and deep (less than 100 mm/3), prolonged (median 32 day) granulocytopenia against infections arising from the GI tract was demonstrated by its impact on the clinical manifestations of infection, microbiologically documented gram negative bacterial infections, overall antibiotic management, and GI colonization. Although there was no difference with respect to survival, norfloxacin decreased overall morbidity associated with gram-negative infections, was well tolerated, did not impinge on systemic antibacterial or antitumor therapy, and did not predispose to the development of bacteria resistant either to itself or to multiple other antibiotics. The advantages of norfloxacin relative to other oral agents used for GI prophylaxis and the potential beneficial effects of norfloxacin or overall medical cost are discussed. Oral norfloxacin achieves the goals of GI prophylaxis by effectively suppressing early infection arising from the GI tract and inhibiting GI colonization by multiply resistant pathogens that could give rise to late-onset infections during profound chemotherapy-induced bone marrow aplasia.","['Karp, J E', 'Merz, W G', 'Hendricksen, C', 'Laughon, B', 'Redden, T', 'Bamberger, B J', 'Bartlett, J G', 'Saral, R', 'Burke, P J']","['Karp JE', 'Merz WG', 'Hendricksen C', 'Laughon B', 'Redden T', 'Bamberger BJ', 'Bartlett JG', 'Saral R', 'Burke PJ']",['eng'],['CA-06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Scand J Infect Dis Suppl,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases.

Meanwhile, preleukemia cells arose in the thymus and bone marrow and persisted until the onset of lymphomas. Simultaneously, thymic lymphopoiesis was impaired; thymocyte numbers were subnormal and thymic nurse cells disappeared in a progressive but irreversible fashion. The depletion of these lymphoepithelial complexes, which are normally involved in the early steps of thymic lymphopoiesis, was related to altered prothymocyte activity in bone marrow and to damaged thymic microenvironment, perhaps as a consequence of the presence of preleukemia cells. The grafting of normal bone marrow cells after irradiation prevented the development of lymphomas. However, marrow reconstitution did not inhibit the induction of preleukemia cells. They disappeared from the thymus during the second part of the latent period. At the same time, thymic lymphopoiesis was restored; thymocytes and nurse cell numbers returned to normal as a consequence of the proliferation of grafted marrow-derived cells within the thymus. The results thus demonstrated an intimate relationship between preleukemia cells and an alteration of thymic lymphopoiesis, which particularly involved the nurse cell microenvironment. Some preleukemia cells in marrow-reconstituted, irradiated mice derived from the unirradiated marrow inoculate. Thus these cells acquired neoplastic potential through a factor present in the irradiated tissues. The nature of this indirect mechanism was briefly discussed.","['Defresne, M P', 'Greimers, R', 'Lenaerts, P', 'Boniver, J']","['Defresne MP', 'Greimers R', 'Lenaerts P', 'Boniver J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/physiopathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Preleukemia/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Thymus Gland/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Time Factors']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1986 Nov;77(5):1079-85.,,,,,,,,,,

With a monoclonal anti-HLA-DR antibody as a prototype, it was possible to demonstrate reliably, the presence of positively and negatively stained cells of appropriate morphological types in the peripheral blood of leukemia patients. Although only about one-third of antibodies tested were effective with the technique, we identified monoclonal antibodies capable of demonstrating myelomonocyte, granulocyte, monocyte, pan-leukocyte, transferrin, platelet, pan-T, 'cALLA plus B cell' and other antigens. However, we have not yet found antibodies able to identify T cell subsets, nor to distinguish 'common' acute lymphoblastic leukemia from its rare B-cell counterpart. With these limitations the method is suitable for routine use alongside cytochemistry in the differential diagnosis of leukemias and lymphomas.","['Lowenthal, R M', 'Marsden, K A']","['Lowenthal RM', 'Marsden KA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA-D Antigens/*analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Phenotype']",1986/10/23 00:00,1986/10/23 00:01,['1986/10/23 00:00'],"['1986/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(86)90428-X [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(86)90428-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1986 Oct 23;93(1):19-27. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(86)90428-x.,,,,,,,,,,

All three patients grafted in partial remission (PR) are alive NED including two with initial central nervous system (CNS) disease. Nine patients were grafted in 1st complete remission (CR) either because of long delay to achieve CR or as consolidation in those with initial CNS involvement or leukaemia. Three of these nine are alive including 2/3 with a long delay to CR and 1/5 initial CNS. The overall survival NED for the 28 patients is 46%. The median observation time post ABMT, 22 months. Clear indications for ABMT in BL are in our opinion restricted to about 20% of the patients: non-resistant relapses and PR after initial induction therapy. Massive therapy as consolidation of 1st CR after initial CNS involvement and in resistant relapses should still be considered as experimental.

These people are at risk for complications of the therapy itself. Among these induced acute nonlymphoid leukemia (ANLL) has been both common and often lethal. We reviewed 72 recently reported patients under 30 years of age at the time of initial diagnosis who developed a secondary, karyotypically defined leukemia. Fifty-eight patients contracted ANLL a mean of 4 1/2 years from the initial diagnosis. In 25 patients, this was preceded by a preleukemic phase characterized by a hypercellular bone marrow with abnormal precursors, often accompanied by peripheral pancytopenia, that lasted a mean of 6 months. Three additional patients died in this preleukemic phase. In all 61, the most common chromosomal abnormalities were numerical errors. Twenty-four patients had a hypodiploid karyotype, most often in those in whom the primary diagnosis was lymphoma (22 of 43). The most common chromosomes missing in whole or in part were number 7 (18 patients), number 5 (8 patients), number 17 (5 patients), and number 21 (4 patients). The anomalies were frequently multiple and complex. Monosomy 7 figured particularly strongly and may be similar to a karyotypically identical myeloproliferative disorder characterized by micromegakaryocytes, giant platelets, and abnormal granulocyte function arising de novo in children. These findings are similar to those in older patients with ANLL induced by environmental carcinogens or antineoplastic therapy. They are different from the karyotypic changes seen in de novo ANLL in children and young adults, suggesting a different etiology. Also, they reinforce the need to find less leukemogenic treatment programs.","['Bernstein, M L', 'Vekemans, M J']","['Bernstein ML', 'Vekemans MJ']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/etiology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(86)80002-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(86)80002-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1986;5(4):325-60. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(86)80002-6.,,,,,,,173,,,

WEHI-3B cells grown for more than 12 months in RITC, or for more than 3 months in RITC without Tf and Ins, had a doubling time of 20 h, whereas cells maintained in protein-free RITC showed a 2-fold increase in doubling time then died within 3 months. The IL-3 production by WEHI-3B cells cultured in RITC was higher than the production by cells grown in SCM. When IL-3 was assayed in 32Dcl/H4 cells that had been maintained in RITC for more than 4 months, a lower response to IL-3 was found, an indication that components other than the BSA, Tf and Ins in fetal calf serum are required for optimal cell growth and differentiation.","['Tanno, Y', 'Denburg, J A']","['Tanno Y', 'Denburg JA']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Cell Struct Funct,Cell structure and function,7608465,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (colony promoting activity)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Culture Media', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transferrin/pharmacology']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1247/csf.11.209 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Struct Funct. 1986 Sep;11(3):209-17. doi: 10.1247/csf.11.209.,,,,,,,,,,

The hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematologic, and integumentary systems were also involved. The major route of elimination is the kidneys, with 35%-71% of the infused dose excreted within 24 hours. Three phase I studies suggested the following phase II doses: 700-750 mg/m2 by short infusion, once every 2-3 weeks; 300 mg/m2/day by short infusion for 3 consecutive days, to be repeated every 2 weeks; and 300 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 7 consecutive days, to be repeated every 3-5 weeks. The major organ toxicity reported was renal; however, this can be adequately controlled either by hydration and osmotic diuresis or by use of continuous schedule. (Either maneuver appears to allow delivery of the recommended phase II dose with a less than 30% risk of change in serum creatinine.) In limited phase II evaluation, the drug has shown antitumor activity in patients with either refractory lymphomas or small cell lung carcinoma, with total objective response rates of 28% and 11%, respectively. In addition, it has been effective in the treatment of patients with cancer-related hypercalcemia by having an inhibitory effect on calcium reabsorption from bone.

We have developed a mathematic model and computer program that consider age, prognostic index, and projected survival rate by transplantation to balance the risk of peritransplant mortality against the risk of delaying the transplantation of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML. The computation assesses the risk of delaying transplantation; it does not offer the option of avoiding transplantation, since long-term survival ultimately requires transplantation. Three prognostic groups were considered as described by Sokal and co-workers (Blood 63:789, 1984) (I, best; II, intermediate; III, worst prognosis). The computation used the projected survival rates of transplantation from the Seattle experience and from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. As an example of the model's utility, we have determined the ratio of the calculated life expectancy to the normal life expectancy for hypothetical patients up to 50 years of age in each of the three prognostic categories. A value of 20% is used for patients who successfully receive transplants after the onset of the accelerated phase. The analysis allows assessment of the risk of delaying transplantation for a finite time in patients with CML. The importance of the method rests in its consideration of multiple variables, including the peritransplant mortality, transplant projected survival before and upon entering the accelerated phase, age, prognostic group, and other risk factors. The program permits a change in these parameters as new information or advances in treatment occur. This analysis does not replace the diagnostic deliberations of the clinician. Rather, it provides a numeric framework for prognosis based on the currently available data. The physician in conjunction with the patient, not the algorithm, makes the decisions of whether and when to transplant.","['Segel, G B', 'Simon, W', 'Lichtman, M A']","['Segel GB', 'Simon W', 'Lichtman MA']",['eng'],"['CA12790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Age Factors', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*therapy', 'Life Expectancy', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Software', 'Time Factors']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79434-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Nov;68(5):1055-64.,,,,,,,,,,

In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, both the unilateral chromatid damage in G2 chromosomes, determined by induction of premature condensed chromosome condensation [Maybaum and Mandel, Cancer Res. 43, 3852 (1983)], and incorporation of TG into DNA resulting in DNA strand breakage [Christie et al., Cancer Res. 44, 3665 (1984)] were correlated with cytotoxicity. We have studied the correlation between strand breakage and unilateral chromatid damage in L1210 cells. DNA breaks were detected only when cells were treated with TG (0.25 microM) for one cell cycle time (12 hr) followed by 12 hr in drug-free medium containing [3H]thymidine (TdR) to label the DNA. After simultaneous incubation of cells with drug and label during the first or second 12-hr period, strand breaks were not found. Strand breaks increased with dose, which correlated with greater cytotoxicity (0.01 to 0.25 microM). Treatment of cells with 0.25 microM TG for 12 hr, and transfer to drug-free medium for 12 hr prior to making prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC), resulted in unilateral chromatid damage. Prominent curving of G2 chromosomes with gapping and diffuse staining of one of the sister chromatids occurred. The 4-fold increase in the percentage of cells in G2 compared with control cells suggested G2 arrest. When cells were treated with TG for 12 hr and PCC made immediately, neither the arrest of cells in G2 nor unilateral chromatid damage was observed. These data suggest that strand breaks and unilateral chromatid damage occur in the second cell cycle after TG exposure and that this damage may be important in TG-delayed cytotoxicity.","['Fairchild, C R', 'Maybaum, J', 'Kennedy, K A']","['Fairchild CR', 'Maybaum J', 'Kennedy KA']",['eng'],"['5-T-32-CA09223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatids/*drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/*drug effects', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1986/10/15 00:00,1986/10/15 00:01,['1986/10/15 00:00'],"['1986/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(86)90623-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(86)90623-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1986 Oct 15;35(20):3533-41. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(86)90623-4.,,,,,,,,,,

The RIA was further evaluated in three blinded, controlled clinical trials. In one, sera were collected prospectively from patients with acute leukemia. Antigenemia was detected in four patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) due to A. flavus, appeared early in the course of infection of three patients concurrent with the onset and evolution of lung infiltrates, and remitted with antifungal chemotherapy. Antigenemia was not detected in three patients before the onset of IPA, in eight leukemic controls, or in the 24 normals. In contrast, seven bronchoscopies were performed in five patients with IPA; fungi were not isolated in three. In a second study, antigenemia was found in coded sera from two patients with invasive aspergillosis but not in eight controls. In the third controlled study, 616 sera from 79 hematology patients admitted on 152 occasions were analyzed for circulating fungal antigen.

The intensity of distress display was found to be independent of the physician who performed the punction, the part of the body to which the punction was administered, the number of previously administered BMA'S, whether the child had to undergo a lumbar puncture after the BMA, and whether the child was sedated. The intensity of distress display varied with age and sex of the child. The intensity of distress display was weaker in older children, but this age effect was stronger for boys than for girls. An experimental program was developed and administered in order to reduce distress display during medical treatment. This program consisted of three parts (relaxation, imagination of a pleasant situation and arousal of the concomitant feelings, as well as watching a model). The experimental program was found to be effective in reducing distress display in children. The amount of reduction was dependent of the number of prior BMA'S (the fewer the prior BMA'S, the greater the decrease) and of the level of pretreatment display of distress (the higher the level, the smaller the decrease.","['van Aken, M A', 'Heezen, T J', 'van Lieshout, C F']","['van Aken MA', 'Heezen TJ', 'van Lieshout CF']",['dut'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Tijdschr Kindergeneeskd,Tijdschrift voor kindergeneeskunde,7704039,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy, Needle/*psychology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fear', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Male', 'Pain', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Psychological Tests', '*Psychology, Child', 'Relaxation Therapy', 'Stress, Psychological/*prevention & control']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tijdschr Kindergeneeskd. 1986 Aug;54(4):112-8.,Beenmergpuncties bij kinderen met leukemie.

Their testing raises fundamental questions concerning phase I objectives and strategies for biologicals, eg, study design in an immune model v a cytotoxic model. However, with over 5,000 patients treated with these compounds, some general principles have emerged. There is a suggestion of dose-response relationships, and a clearer picture of schedule dependence. The extent of tumor burden and identification of sensitive subtypes of patients also appear to be critical factors in evaluating the true potential activity of biological compounds. The toxicity profile of the alpha interferons is unusual. Fever and flu-like symptoms occur almost universally in all doses and schedules, and are usually dose-limiting. Somnolence and other CNS effects occur in a small percentage of patients. Hematologic toxicity occurs but is minimal at lower doses and is noncumulative and rapidly reversible at all doses. Gastrointestinal toxicity is mild. No other unusual or unexpected toxicities have been reported, and early reports of cardiovascular toxicity have not been confirmed in large trials. The use of these pioneer recombinant DNA products raised concerns about the potential production of antibodies and serum-neutralizing factors. Reports with small patient numbers confirmed the occasional development of serum-neutralizing activity to some alpha interferons, which may coincide with a loss of detectable serum interferon and loss of clinical activity. A large study with interferon alfa-2b (Intron A) has reported a low overall incidence of neutralizing activity (2.5%) and no association with loss of clinical activity. The significance of the neutralizing activity and the reasons for an apparently higher incidence of this phenomenon with other alpha interferon preparations remain to be determined. The full role of alpha interferon by itself or in combination with other available therapies will be resolved in coming years.

Activities associated with the interferons include inhibition of viral replication, influence on cellular protein production, direct antiproliferative effects, and a variety of modulatory effects on the immune response. These regulatory functions of interferon underlie the interest in its use as an anticancer agent. Interferon alpha is the most extensively studied interferon species. Although antitumor activity has been seen both in vivo and in vitro in some solid malignancies, the most impressive responses have occurred in the hematologic malignancies. For the low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, response rates of 50%, with 10% to 15% complete responses, have been reported. A response rate of 15% has been reported for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in studies outside of the National Cancer Institute (NCI); in our phase II trials at the NCI, only two (11%) of 18 patients had brief partial responses to recombinant interferon alpha. For patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (mycosis fungoides and the Sezary syndrome), a response rate of 45%, with 10% complete responses, was seen in patients treated with recombinant interferon alpha. Based on such findings, interferon appears to be one of the most effective single agents for cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Further phase II trials are being conducted to determine whether lower doses of interferon alpha are as effective as the high doses used in the previously reported studies. Phase III trials will involve the use of interferons in combination with chemotherapeutic agents as well as in the adjuvant setting.","['Foon, K A', 'Roth, M S', 'Bunn, P A Jr']","['Foon KA', 'Roth MS', 'Bunn PA Jr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1986/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(86)90055-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1986 Sep;13(3 Suppl 2):35-42.,,,,,,,43,,,

Prior to the use of interferon in the treatment of this disease, initial therapy most often consisted of splenectomy. Patients with progressive disease after splenectomy often benefited from low-dose chlorambucil, although many other treatment modalities had been tested. Interferon (partially purified) was first reported to be effective in HCL by Quesada et al in 1984, with responses in seven of seven patients. Subsequent studies demonstrated that recombinant interferon was also effective. Major responses (normalization of peripheral blood counts) have been obtained in 50% to 80% of patients treated to date, and virtually all patients show some improvement. There is rapid improvement in the platelet count (1 to 2 months), followed by improvement in absolute neutrophil count (2 to 3 months) and hemoglobin (3 to 6 months). In addition, leukemic patients have a rapid reduction in circulating hairy cells. Interferon alpha also has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of serious infections and the need for transfusions, as compared to the 6-month period prior to therapy. Bone marrow shows improvement as well, with a reduction in hairy cells and an increase in normal precursors. However, bone marrow remains abnormal, with increased reticulin, decreased myeloid precursors, and, usually, discernible hairy cells. Following discontinuation of therapy, a slow increase in hairy cells may occur. The mechanism of interferon's action is unknown. Interferon induces the synthesis of new proteins and the formation of new organelles. Although natural killer cell activity increases with the introduction of interferon, these changes probably do not mediate the response to the agent. Interferon has been demonstrated in vivo to have a direct antiproliferative effect on hairy cells. We conclude that interferon is highly effective in progressive disease following splenectomy. Its exact role in nonsplenectomized patients remains to be determined, as does its optimal use in the long-term management of HCL.","['Ratain, M J', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Golomb, H M']","['Ratain MJ', 'Vardiman JW', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Splenectomy']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(86)90053-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1986 Sep;13(3 Suppl 2):21-8.,,,,,,,46,,,

Following introductory remarks on concomitant and sinecomitant antitumor immunity, various factors/mechanisms that could influence tumor-host-interactions are discussed, in particular properties of neoplastic cell lines, the microenvironment, cellular components of nonspecific resistance, and specific, i.e. antigen-directed, cell-mediated and humoral immune responses against cancer cells. The increased incidence of malignant neoplastic processes in patients with inherited or acquired immunodeficiency raises the question if a lack of antitumoral defense or ineffective antiviral immunity is more important. Available data indicate that once a cancer has reached a certain size, the chances for the host to reject it solely with the help of its immune apparatus are minimal. The possibility remains that immune reactions may be more efficacious against small numbers of immunogenic tumor cells, i.e. in the very earliest phase of a neoplastic process and when the cancer begins to metastasize.","['Cottier, H', 'Hess, M W', 'Walti, E R']","['Cottier H', 'Hess MW', 'Walti ER']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*complications', 'Leukemia/etiology/immunology', 'Lymphoma/etiology/immunology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/immunology']",1986/08/23 00:00,1986/08/23 00:01,['1986/08/23 00:00'],"['1986/08/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/23 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1986 Aug 23;116(34):1119-26.,,,,,,,66,,,

Clinically, rheumatoid-like pain induced by osteolytic skeletal lesions often prevails. Occasionally, foudroyant bacterial infections - the most frequent cause of death in myelomatosis - or acute/subacute renal failure or rarely, acute hemi- or paraparesis precede diagnosis. Establishment of diagnosis early in the course of the disease and improved cytostatic and symptomatic treatment has led to a decrease in episodes of hyperviscosity-syndromes. Severe renal insufficiency due to Bence-Jones proteinuria prevails in 20% of patients already at time of diagnosis. With increasing duration of the disease, frequency of renal insufficiency further increases. Hypercalcemia with consecutive dehydration and renal insufficiency usually is a complication of long-standing disease. Anemia, leukopenia and thrombo-cytopenia are not only side effects of cytostatic treatment, but also consequences of tumor-induced suppression of hematopoiesis. Polyneuropathies are common in myelomatosis. They probably are the result of specific and/or unspecific binding of paraproteins to myelin sheaths. Effective treatment for this complication is not available at present. Thrombohemorrhagic complications are more frequent in patients with myeloma than in the control group of other hospitalized patients. Non-secretory myeloma, osteoblastic myeloma and Takatsuki syndrome are variants of myelomatosis. Solitary and extramedullary plasmocytoma are different, potentially curable entities.

Differential subunit association affects the site-specific glycosylation of the common beta-chain from Mac-1 and LFA-1.,13186-96,"The influence of quaternary structure on glycosylation was evaluated in a macrophage-like cell line, P388D1. This cell line simultaneously synthesizes two structurally related glycoproteins, Mac-1 and LFA-1. Mac-1 and LFA-1 each contain two subunits in noncovalent association in an alpha 1 beta 1 structure. The beta-chain polypeptides of these two glycoproteins have identical primary structures while their alpha-chain polypeptides are distinct. For both Mac-1 and LFA-1, the association of the alpha- and beta-chains occurs prior to any Golgi-mediated processing of the oligosaccharide moieties on either one of the subunits. To evaluate the effects of differential subunit association on the site-specific glycosylation of the beta-chain, [3H]glucosamine-labeled oligosaccharides were isolated from the beta-chain of Mac-1 and LFA-1 and were compared by a variety of enzymatic and chromatographic techniques. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography analyses of tryptic-chymotryptic glycopeptides suggest that each beta-chain has at least five glycosylation sites. Structural analysis of oligosaccharides from each corresponding glycopeptide fraction of the beta-chains of Mac-1 or LFA-1 (comparing their glycosidase sensitivities, behavior on serial lectin affinity chromatography, size heterogeneity, extent of sialylation, and branching) indicates that the LFA-1 beta-chain is glycosylated substantially differently on at least four of its sites, compared to the corresponding sites of the Mac-1 beta-chain, even though they are simultaneously synthesized in the same cells. Thus, these data demonstrate that quaternary structure can influence the site-specific glycosylation of a protein, even when the polypeptide structure and the cellular glycosylation machinery remain constant.","['Dahms, N M', 'Hart, G W']","['Dahms NM', 'Hart GW']",['eng'],"['GM-07445/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-13563/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen', 'Mice', 'Oligosaccharides/analysis']",1986/10/05 00:00,1986/10/05 00:01,['1986/10/05 00:00'],"['1986/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)69289-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Oct 5;261(28):13186-96.,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclosporine concentration-time data were fitted to a two-compartment model with a nonlinear regression program. There was a significant inverse linear correlation between age and both total systemic clearance (CL) (r = 0.42; P less than 0.001) and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) (r = 0.33; P less than 0.01).

We have reported one regimen, combining cytarabine (5 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (90 mg/kg), and total-body irradiation (900 cGy), which is relatively effective in the treatment of leukemia. To assess cardiac effects of this treatment regimen, we performed serial echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography in 28 patients with leukemia (age range, 18-48 years; mean, 31; 21 males) undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. No significant change in left ventricular fractional minor axis shortening or increase in left ventricular diastolic dimension was seen with weekly echocardiography. At an average of 77 days (range, 28-358) after transplant, repeat radionuclide ventriculography in 17 patients revealed no significant change in resting left ventricular ejection fraction compared to that on admission to the hospital (58% +/- 6.8% vs 56% +/- 8.0% SD; P = not significant). In seven of these 17 patients (41%), resting ejection fraction fell between baseline and discharge (from mean of 60% to 50%). Resting ejection fraction in four of these patients (23% of the entire group) fell into the abnormal range (from mean of 56% to 44%; lowest, 41%). Ten patients also had exercise radionuclide ventriculography and all had normal responses (greater than 5% increase with exercise) pre- and post-transplant. We conclude that this effective bone marrow transplantation regimen has little apparent short-term cardiac toxicity in the majority of patients; since a few patients do exhibit a deterioration in left ventricular function, continued cardiac surveillance is probably indicated in posttransplant patients.","['Baello, E B', 'Ensberg, M E', 'Ferguson, D W', 'Kugler, J W', 'Gingrich, R D', 'Armitage, J O', 'Klassen, L W', 'Kirchner, P T', 'Kerber, R E', 'Marcus, M L']","['Baello EB', 'Ensberg ME', 'Ferguson DW', 'Kugler JW', 'Gingrich RD', 'Armitage JO', 'Klassen LW', 'Kirchner PT', 'Kerber RE', 'Marcus ML', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['HL-01290/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00059/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radionuclide Imaging', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1986 Oct;70(10):1187-93.,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven patients were in the accelerated phase of their disease (CGLacc) or in second/secondary chronic phase (CGL-2CP), with a median age of 33 years: four patients died of transplant related complications, and four of recurrent leukemia; three patients are alive and well 19, 31, 33 months from BMT. The actuarial 33-month survival is 27%. The actuarial relapse rate is 50%. Nineteen patients were in their first chronic phase (1CP), with a median age of 32 years: three died of graft versus host disease (GvHD), two of infection, and two of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 12 are alive and well 6 to 29 months post-BMT.

The Ph' chromosome was detected on one occasion in two patients 12, 13 months post-BMT: they both remain hematologically normal and Ph1-negative 3 to 6 months later, after discontinuation of cyclosporin A. This study confirms that survival exceeding 60% can be obtained in CGL in the first chronic phase, whereas less than 30% of patients will survive if grafted in accelerated, second/secondary chronic phase, mainly because of leukemic relapse. The duration of the disease seems to be relevant to the outcome of the transplant.

Analysis for fibronectin and laminin immunoreactivities was limited to the lymph node biopsy specimens. In FCCL, S-100-positive dendritic reticulum cells (DRCs) were found in 23 of the 26 tissue specimens examined, regardless of the involved sites and the growth pattern. Cases with completely or predominantly follicular pattern were usually associated with a spherical meshwork pattern of S-100-positive DRCs; in the FCCL specimens with a diffuse pattern (lymph nodes and bone marrow) as well as in the specimen areas with a minimally follicular tumor pattern, S-100-positive DRCs were consistently fewer in number and composed loosely aggregated nests. No S-100-positive DRCs were found in all the biopsy specimens in SLL. Concerning fibronectin and laminin immunostainings, results showed that no differences were present between areas of follicular and diffuse neoplastic growth and that the neoplastic growth of FCCL maintained for each antiserum the same distribution pattern as that seen in normal follicles. Analysis of the microenvironmental components as revealed with antisera used in the current study--particularly with anti-S-100 protein antiserum--appears to be a useful adjunct for the identification of FCCL in paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens, especially in extranodal sites.","['Carbone, A', 'Manconi, R', 'Poletti, A', 'Colombatti, A', 'Tirelli, U', 'Volpe, R']","['Carbone A', 'Manconi R', 'Poletti A', 'Colombatti A', 'Tirelli U', 'Volpe R']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (S100 Proteins)']",IM,"['Dendritic Cells/pathology', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Laminin/*metabolism', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/*pathology', 'S100 Proteins/*metabolism']",1986/11/15 00:00,1986/11/15 00:01,['1986/11/15 00:00'],"['1986/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19861115)58:10<2169::aid-cncr2820581002>3.0.co;2-m [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Nov 15;58(10):2169-76. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19861115)58:10<2169::aid-cncr2820581002>3.0.co;2-m.,,,,,,,,,,

We tried to distinguish variant and typical hairy cells (HCs) by Northern blot analysis of the oncogenes expressed in vivo. We report that variant HCs contain c-myc transcripts in contrast to typical HCs, whereas c-fos transcripts are detected in both cell types. We also report that the mRNA levels of c-myc are not modified in variant HCs by IFN-alpha treatment, whereas the level of c-fos mRNA is modulated in both types of HCs.

Relapse following second and subsequent remission BMT was predicted by a score based on standard prognostic features or by the pace of the disease: patients with an interval of less than 2 years between diagnosis and first relapse having a 15% actuarial disease-free survival, compared with 81% for patients with an interval greater than 2 years (P less than 0.001).

These cloned cells, which have both phenotypic and functional characteristics of natural killer lymphocytes, were tested in chromium release assays against a panel of 16 uncultured populations of leukemia cells. In addition, their activity was compared with that of cloned and uncloned NK cells from normal individuals. It was found that TC clones induced a much weaker degree of killing against fresh tumor cells compared with conventional NK target cell lines such as K562 or MOLT 4. In addition, there was great heterogeneity in their individual lytic capacity against the various leukemia blasts (TC12, 48, and 50 cells killed in a significant fashion, respectively 7, 1, and 4 of the 16 leukemias), reflecting the functional diversity of normal NK cell populations. Thus, for a fraction of leukemias, there was no correlation between lytic ability of TC cells and that of uncloned lymphokine-activated large granular lymphocytes from normal peripheral blood. Together, these results support the view that direct identification of patients' cytotoxic lymphocytes screened against in vivo relevant tumor cells is necessary to evaluate potentially beneficial immunologic responses in the context of bone marrow transplantation.","['Delmon, L', 'Ythier, A', 'Moingeon, P', 'Nowill, A', 'Bayle, C', 'Pico, J L', 'Hayat, M', 'Ritz, J', 'Hercend, T']","['Delmon L', 'Ythier A', 'Moingeon P', 'Nowill A', 'Bayle C', 'Pico JL', 'Hayat M', 'Ritz J', 'Hercend T']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/therapy']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-198609000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1986 Sep;42(3):252-6. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198609000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,

Early in the course of the disease, clinical profiles of these patients are indistinguishable from those of patients with AIDS-associated opportunistic infections, but rapidly evolving extranodal lesions often signify the establishment of a lymphoproliferative neoplastic process. The frequent involvement of the central nervous system is responsible for the dismal outcome of the disease in a significant number of patients.

Public perception of these risks often is distorted, due in part to lack of familiarity with the actual risk levels involved. There is a need for dissemination to the public of accurate information on radiation risks as well as to patients and volunteer subjects for studies involving radiation exposures. Often such information can be presented meaningfully by comparing the risks of radiation exposure with other, more familiar risks. Natural background radiation is a universally present and generally accepted source of risk, and thus serves as one reference against which to compare the risks of other radiation exposures. Natural background radiation averages about 100 mrem/yr, but much higher levels are encountered in some parts of the US (400 mrem/yr) and worldwide (2,000 mrem/yr). These variations are due primarily to differences in cosmic ray intensity with altitude and in terrestrial radiation originating from soil and rocks. Radiation risks also may be compared with the risks of other human activities, both voluntary and involuntary. The former are useful for comparisons with the risks of voluntary radiation exposures such as occupational exposure and participation in medical or research procedures involving radiation. Involuntary radiation exposure, such as might result from the transportation and disposal of radioactive waste, poses a more complicated issue. Comparisons of such exposures to natural background radiation levels and their variations are helpful. Two other concepts that have been proposed for assessing the relative risk of low-level radiation exposure are ""de minimus risk"" and ""probability of causation."" The former suggests that there is some minimal level of involuntary risk that can be considered acceptable, provided it carries with it some benefit to society or the individual. The latter is a concept that has been introduced in legislation to decide compensation for alleged injuries from radiation exposures.","['Sorenson, J A']",['Sorenson JA'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Nucl Med,Seminars in nuclear medicine,1264464,,IM,"['Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced', 'Background Radiation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology', '*Public Opinion', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Effects', 'Risk', 'United States']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0001-2998(86)80031-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0001-2998(86)80031-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Nucl Med. 1986 Jul;16(3):158-70. doi: 10.1016/s0001-2998(86)80031-9.,,,,,,,28,,,

To determine the position of the gene encoding the alpha chain of the T-cell receptor and of the protooncogene MYC (formerly c-myc) in relation to the breakpoint junction and to evaluate their possible role in the pathogenesis of T-cell neoplasia, we applied the techniques of in situ chromosomal hybridization, Southern blot analysis, and molecular cloning to MOLT-16 cells. Our results indicate that the breakpoint on chromosome 14 at band q11 occurs close to a joining sequence of the gene encoding the alpha chain of the T-cell receptor. The constant region and part of the joining region of this gene are translocated to the 3' side of the MYC exons. The breakpoints on chromosomes 8 and 14 are close to, but distinct from, those found in SKW-3, another T-cell leukemia cell line, which has a t(8;14).

We previously showed that treatment of MEL cells with inducers of differentiation leads to a rapid (less than 2 hr) decrease in the level of c-myc mRNA. c-myc mRNA is then transiently restored to pretreatment levels approximately 12-18 hr later. These events occur prior to the detection of cells that are irreversibly committed to erythroid differentiation. MEL cell transfectants containing the plasmid with myc in the sense orientation express a chimeric MT-myc mRNA, which also decreases shortly after addition of inducer. However, these clones reexpress myc RNA more rapidly than the parental line and they also differentiate more rapidly. On the other hand, transfectants containing the plasmid with myc in the antisense orientation exhibited a delay in the reexpression of c-myc mRNA and were found to differentiate more slowly than parental cells. Thus, we find a correlation between the time at which myc RNA is reexpressed following inducer treatment and the rate of entry of cells into the terminal differentiation program.","['Lachman, H M', 'Cheng, G H', 'Skoultchi, A I']","['Lachman HM', 'Cheng GH', 'Skoultchi AI']",['eng'],"['CA 16368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transfection']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.17.6480 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Sep;83(17):6480-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.17.6480.,,,,PMC386527,,,,,,

F-MEL cells differentiate in vitro in response to various chemical inducers. Concomitantly with induction, a biphasic regulation of c-myc oncogene transcripts is observed. Within one hour of the addition of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or hypoxanthine (Hyp), the levels of c-myc transcripts fall dramatically and remain virtually undetectable for the next few hours. Between 8 and 24 hours after induction, c-myc transcripts return to pre-induction levels and then decline again between 3 and 5 days as most of the cells undergo terminal differentiation. To explore the potential relationship between c-myc expression and F-MEL terminal differentiation, we have investigated here whether reversing the early fluctuations in c-myc transcript levels affects the ability of F-MEL cells to differentiate. We therefore constructed an amplifiable plasmid vector containing a full-length mouse c-myc complementary DNA and introduced it stably into recipient F-MEL cells. The exogenous c-myc sequences are transcribed in F-MEL cells and the transcript levels do not change significantly in response to inducing agents.

As expected, all four categories showed significantly inferior relapse-free survival to the rest, but only in patients with a mediastinal mass and in the under-1-year-olds did a recognisable syndrome emerge clearly associated with other clinical features. These two syndromes, high-count T-ALL and high-count infant null-ALL, are logical candidates for alternative therapy. Established meningeal disease also continues to present a major therapeutic challenge.","['Lilleyman, J S', 'Eden, O B']","['Lilleyman JS', 'Eden OB']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mediastinum/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950140314 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1986;14(3):182-6. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950140314.,,,,,,,,,,

It is proposed that the capacity for self-renewal is not limited to pluripotent stem cells but is shared by committed progenitors and even cells of later compartments. The relative probability of self-replication vs maturation in mitotic cells is controlled by extracellular influences. At the cell population level, the balance between proliferation and maturation and between compartments is regulated by feedback interactions. Inducibility of maturation in response to regulatory signals is smaller at earlier stages; consequently, at steady state primitive cells self-renew while their more differentiated progeny are forced to be transitory. The proposed dynamic linkage between compartments can be destabilized in a number of ways, resulting in defective hemopoiesis or leukemia. At all stages hemopoietic cells are able to change their patterns of gene expression, in an inheritable manner, in response to changes in their microenvironment. In particular, the capacity for self-renewal itself can vary even within a conventionally-defined compartment. On this basis of adaptive differentiation and self-renewal it is possible to account for the progression of chronic myelocytic leukemia and its ""blastic conversion""; to analyse the hemopoietic system's response to various physiological and experimental perturbations; and to re-interpret the excessive phenotypic plasticity and apparent ""lineage infidelity"" manifested by leukemic cells and cell lines.","['Grossman, Z']",['Grossman Z'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mathematics', 'Phenotype']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90246-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(8):937-50. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90246-8.,,,,,,,94,,,

Of 13 patients, 3 died of bacterial pneumonia, all of them during granulocytopenia; 2 of 6 patients died of fungal pneumonia and 2 out of 3 of a mixed bacterial-mycotic infection.

Viral pneumonia led to death in 8 of 9 patients; in each there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.05) with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Patients with repeated episodes of pulmonary illness had significantly more chronic GvHD (P less than 0.05); several of these patients displayed a reduction in helper T cells and an increase in suppressor T cells in the peripheral blood. The natural killer (NK) cells were reduced and the percentage of activated NK cell level lay between 6% and 69%. B-cells were absent or deficient. These findings explain in part the absence of specific antibody reactivity. Five of these patients also contracted GvHD-associated obstructive bronchiolitis, which did not respond to therapy. Pulmonary infiltrates of unknown origin (including idiopathic interstitial pneumonia) occurred in 8 of the patients (11.1%), with a fatal outcome in 3 patients. Significant changes (P less than 0.05) in lung function after BMT appeared in the form of reduced vital capacity (VC) increased residual volume (RV) and an increase in RV expressed as the percentage of total lung capacity.

Preliminary evidence is available that this regulatory system is important in hemopoiesis. In this paper, the biology of the blast cells of acute myeloblastic leukemia is reviewed. Data is presented indicating that genetic control may be exercised in the nucleus to affect self-renewal, at the cell surface, to mediate cell-to-cell interactions and through the environment by the production of growth factors. These findings support the suggestion that the blast population is a suitable model for studying oncogene-based regulation.

Approximately 11,000 transplants have been performed worldwide since 1970. About two-thirds of these transplants have involved donors, including related and unrelated individuals, and in the remaining third the patient's bone marrow has been used in the form of an autotransplant. In some disorders and under carefully defined circumstances, bone marrow transplantation appears to be the preferred therapy; these diseases include aplastic anemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and selected immune and genetic disorders. In other circumstances, the value of bone marrow transplantation is less well defined. Diseases in which bone marrow transplantation may be of benefit include Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, other cancers, thalassemia, hemoglobinopathies, genetic disorders, and possibly multiple myeloma. It has been difficult to precisely identify the role of bone marrow transplantation in many of these diseases. Prospective randomized controlled clinical trials have sometimes shown an advantage for bone marrow transplantation, but in most circumstances a benefit is as yet unproven. In the U.S. the annual incidence of individuals with diseases in which bone marrow transplantation is thought to be of proven benefit is approximately 5,400, and an additional 15,000 individuals annually have diseases in which bone marrow transplantation is thought to be of possible benefit. This study reviews data available from both controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials indicating the potential role of bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of human diseases.","['Gale, R P']",['Gale RP'],['eng'],['CA23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Israel,Isr J Med Sci,Israel journal of medical sciences,0013105,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Isr J Med Sci. 1986 Mar-Apr;22(3-4):260-3.,,,,,,,,,,

An IgM antibody that reacted mainly with the basal aspect of syncytiotrophoblast of chorionic villi, where a putative human endogenous retrovirus p30 antigen is located, was directed by indirect immunofluorescence. This antibody activity, termed anti-basal aspect of syncytiotrophoblast (anti-BAST), was detected in the sera of many patients with acute leukemia (AML, ALL) and malignant lymphoma, and less frequently in sera of pregnant women and normal controls. As shown by immunoblotting analysis, the main reactive antigen recognized by anti-BAST was a non-glycosylated 32-kDa placental protein which was antigenically related to SSAV p30. A non-glycosylated 19-kDa protein was also considered to be one of the anti-BAST-corresponding antigens.

The design of differentiation therapy will depend on the specific tumor cell type, an effective time course, and the synergistic interaction among combinations of two or more inducers. The induction of differentiation may be followed by terminal cell division (TCD) or programmed cell death in several tumor cell systems. This mechanism for the destruction of tumor cells is one goal of differentiation therapy and differs from nonspecific cytotoxic therapy. To evaluate the effect of differentiation therapy, a clear distinction must be made between nonspecific cytotoxicity and the programmed TCD of induced cytodifferentiation.

A review of 28 neuropsychological outcome studies published in the past nine years shows that the preponderance of evidence from the better designed studies suggests that leukemic children who do not suffer overt Central Nervous System (CNS) complications, such as CNS relapse, do not experience significant cognitive deficits as a consequence of their treatment. Also, these studies do not unequivocally suggest that cranial irradiation as a treatment technique results in greater cognitive impairment than treatment without irradiation. Many studies are consistent in finding that leukemic children younger than 8 years of age have a worse outcome than older ones although both groups perform in the average to bright normal range. It is currently difficult to conclude that such differences in intellectual outcome were caused by the CNS treatment alone or other psychosocial aspects of acquiring leukemia. The confusion present in the literature could be greatly reduced by combining the research efforts on the psychosocial aspects of acquiring leukemia with the studies examining neuropsychological outcome.","['Williams, J M', 'Davis, K S']","['Williams JM', 'Davis KS']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Leukemia/*complications/prevention & control/psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*complications/prevention & control/psychology', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0305-7372(86)90016-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0305-7372(86)90016-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 1986 Jun;13(2):113-27. doi: 10.1016/0305-7372(86)90016-2.,,,,,,,72,,,

To address this problem, we used a limiting dilution assay (LDA) to quantitate residual clonable T lymphocytes in human T cell-depleted bone marrow in 31 HLA-identical transplants for leukemia. The number of phytohemagglutinin -interleukin 2-responsive T lymphocytes determined by LDA and expressed as T cell per kilogram recipient weight was found to correlate with the subsequent development of GVHD: no patients who received less than 1 X 10(5) T cell per kilogram developed GVHD (N = 24). Of the seven patients who received 1 X 10(5) to 4.4 X 10(5) T cell per kilogram, four patients developed grade I or II skin GVHD.

Prognostic significance and clinical utility of antibody measurement.,99-104,"By using a modification of the microtiter solid-phase radioimmunoassay, we have measured Escherichia coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) specific IgG, IgG4, and IgE antibodies in children who received L-ASP as part of their chemotherapy for leukemia and lymphoma. In 13 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia induced with vincristine, prednisone, and L-ASP (10,000 IU/M2 i.v. each week for 3 weeks), seven developed high titer specific IgG antibodies. Four of the seven relapsed at the time of their peaking IgG response (6-10 months). None of the six with low or absent L-ASP antibody response have relapsed (followed for 20-35 months). In six children with allergic reactions to L-ASP reinduction, all had high titers of L-ASP specific IgG4 (greater than or equal to 20 U/ml) at the time of their reaction. In 16 other children with low L-ASP IgG4 (less than 13 U/ml), none demonstrated allergic reactions to rechallenge. Specific IgE was not consistently detectable in either group. In 21 patients with leukemia or lymphoma on L-ASP with cyclophosphamide-containing regimens, none developed significant IgG antibody response, compared with seven of 13 not receiving cyclophosphamide (p less than 0.001). We conclude: (a) development of L-ASP antibodies may have prognostic significance; (b) the detection of specific IgG4 can predict L-ASP allergy; and (c) cyclophosphamide-containing regimens reduce antibody formation to L-ASP and may allow repetitive (without anaphylaxis) and more effective (avoiding neutralizing antibodies) use of L-ASP.","['Cheung, N K', 'Chau, I Y', 'Coccia, P F']","['Cheung NK', 'Chau IY', 'Coccia PF']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibody Formation/*drug effects', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Infant', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Radioimmunoassay/methods']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1986 Summer;8(2):99-104.,,,,,,,,,,

At a second lymph node biopsy, nodules of follicular lymphoma were observed in the central zones of the vague neoplastic nodules. At a third biopsy, the central zones were found to expand, revealing FL dominant pattern. The progress of FL from MZL also was suggested by sIg, AIPase, anti-CALLA (common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen) antibody, and anti-DRC (dendritic reticulum cell) antibody findings.

The anti-DRC antibody findings suggest the neoplastic cells of FL induce DRC as the neoplastic stroma.","['Oka, K', 'Mori, N', 'Kojima, M', 'Miyamoto, T']","['Oka K', 'Mori N', 'Kojima M', 'Miyamoto T']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/86.2.220 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1986 Aug;86(2):220-4. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/86.2.220.,,,,,,,,,,

These patients were divided into two groups by year of BMT. Group I included nine acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and nine acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANL) patients who received BMT before 1980. Group II consisted 39 ALL and 44 ANL patients who were treated after 1981. One-year survivals were 11% and 58% in groups I and II, respectively (p less than 0.001). Probabilities of developing interstitial pneumonia at one year were 93% and 37% in groups I and II, respectively (p less than 0.001). Of 14 patients who developed interstitial pneumonia in group I, twelve (86%) died of interstitial pneumonia. Fifteen of 22 (68%) were fatal in group II. Using proportional hazard regression model, year of BMT (p = 0.0001) and selection of platelet donor with negative cytomegalovirus (CMV) titer (p = 0.0215) were found to be significant risk factors associated with interstitial pneumonia. The present analysis indicated that change in the selection of patients, e.g., in remission without infection at the time of BMT, as well as treatment modality, e.g., fractionated TBI, and selection of platelet donor with negative CMV titer, resulted in the significant improvement in the survival and decreased incidence of interstitial pneumonia.","['Inoue, T', 'Masaoka, T', 'Shibata, H']","['Inoue T', 'Masaoka T', 'Shibata H']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Patients with progressive disease usually had CLL cells with a high rate of in vitro synthesis and an increased S-beta 2m. This was not found in patients with non-progressive disease. The in vitro synthesis of beta 2m X the lymphocyte count correlated with S-beta 2m in the total material (r = 0.65). The increased S-beta 2m frequently observed in CLL may therefore originate from the tumour cells.

The polyprotein precursor gP180gag-fms encoded by the McDonough strain of feline sarcoma virus was therefore predicted to contain 34 v-fms-coded amino acids derived from sequences of the c-fms gene that are not ordinarily translated from the proto-oncogene mRNA. The (gP180gag-fms) polyprotein was cotranslationally cleaved near the gag-fms junction to remove its gag gene-coded portion. Determination of the amino-terminal sequence of the resulting v-fms-coded glycoprotein, gp120v-fms, showed that the site of proteolysis corresponded to a predicted signal peptidase cleavage site within the c-fms gene product. Together, these analyses suggested that the linked gag sequences may not be necessary for expression of a biologically active v-fms gene product. The gag-fms sequences of feline sarcoma virus strain McDonough and the v-fms sequences alone were inserted into a murine retroviral vector containing a neomycin resistance gene. Both constructs were biologically active when transfected into NIH 3T3 cells and produced morphologically transformed foci at equivalent efficiencies. When transfected into a cell line (psi 2) expressing complementary viral gene functions, G418-resistant (Neor) cells containing either of these vector DNAs produced high titers of transforming viruses. Analysis of proteins produced in cells containing the vector lacking gag gene sequences showed that gP180gag-fms was not synthesized, whereas normal levels of both immature gp120v-fms and mature gp140v-fms were detected. The glycoprotein was efficiently transported to the cell surface, and it retained wild-type tyrosine kinase activity. We conclude that a cryptic hydrophobic signal peptide sequence in v-fms was unmasked by gag deletion, thereby allowing the correct orientation and transport of the v-fms gene product within membranous organelles. It seems likely that the proteolytic cleavage of gP180gag-fms is mediated by signal peptidase and that the amino termini of gp140v-fms and the c-fms gene product are identical.","['Wheeler, E F', 'Roussel, M F', 'Hampe, A', 'Walker, M H', 'Fried, V A', 'Look, A T', 'Rettenmier, C W', 'Sherr, C J']","['Wheeler EF', 'Roussel MF', 'Hampe A', 'Walker MH', 'Fried VA', 'Look AT', 'Rettenmier CW', 'Sherr CJ']",['eng'],"['CA 09346-6/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/*genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Sorting Signals/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.59.2.224-233.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Aug;59(2):224-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.59.2.224-233.1986.,,,,PMC253070,['GENBANK/M14002'],,,,,

By the survey method, hypersensitivity incidence was 6.5% with the majority of the reactions (82%) occurring in brain tumor or neuroblastoma patients. By the second method, 43 cases of hypersensitivity that were reported to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) between January 1983 and October 1985 were analyzed in detail. Reaction onset was unpredictable according to the number of drug doses. The majority of the patients (65%) experiencing the reaction had neuroblastoma or brain tumors, and these patients also tended to react earlier in the course of drug administration than those with hematologic malignancies. Clinical presentation was not correlated with the patient's diagnosis. All patients recovered. However, only six of 13 were successfully rechallenged with the drug. The third approach, the literature search, provided information on 82 hypersensitivity reactions among 2,250 patients (3.6% incidence). Forty-five percent of these reactions were linked to neuroblastoma or brain tumor patients. The analysis of hypersensitivity to teniposide by these three methods provides insight into the true incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in the general patient population. The frequency of the reactions is substantially higher in patients with neuroblastoma and brain tumors.

This nine-drug intensive-pulsed chemotherapy was based on high-dose cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate (HD MTX), and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) in continuous infusion. CNS prophylaxis was with chemotherapy only. No local irradiation was performed. No debulking surgery was recommended. There were 72 patients with stage III lymphoma and 42 patients with stage IV lymphoma or B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL). Among those 42 patients, seven had CNS involvement alone, 21 had bone marrow alone, and 14 had both; 26 had greater than 25% blast cells in bone marrow, 14 of whom had blast cells in blood. The primary site of involvement was the abdomen in 90 patients, the Waldeyer Ring in nine, and various sites in eight; seven patients presented without tumor. Seventy-seven patients are alive with a median follow-up of 2 years and 8 months. Seven patients died due to initial treatment failure, 11 died from toxicity, and 19 died after relapse. Among the 93 patients without initial CNS involvement, only one isolated relapse in CNS occurred. Survival and disease-free survival rates reached 67% and 64%, respectively, for all patients, 75% and 73% for stage III patients and 54% and 48% for stage IV and B-ALL patients. Bone marrow involvement was not an adverse prognostic factor. Contrary initial CNS involvement indicated a bad prognosis with a disease-free survival rate of 19% compared with 76% without CNS disease. This study showed that CNS prophylaxis and local control of the primary tumor can be achieved by intensive chemotherapy alone, without radiotherapy or debulking surgery.","['Patte, C', 'Philip, T', 'Rodary, C', 'Bernard, A', 'Zucker, J M', 'Bernard, J L', 'Robert, A', 'Rialland, X', 'Benz-Lemoine, E', 'Demeocq, F']","['Patte C', 'Philip T', 'Rodary C', 'Bernard A', 'Zucker JM', 'Bernard JL', 'Robert A', 'Rialland X', 'Benz-Lemoine E', 'Demeocq F', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Virus Diseases/chemically induced']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1986.4.8.1219 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1986 Aug;4(8):1219-26. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1986.4.8.1219.,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-five of 805 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (3.1%) and 27 of 195 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (13.8%) met any two of three requirements for a coagulation disorder: fibrinogen level less than 150 mg/dL; fibrin degradation products greater than 10 micrograms/mL; and prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) greater than 12 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) greater than 45 seconds, or thrombin time (TT) greater than 18 seconds. Patients with ALL complicated by abnormal coagulation were more likely to be boys and to have a T-cell immunophenotype, a high leukocyte count, a mediastinal mass, leukemic involvement of the CNS, hepatosplenomegaly, and L2 blast cell morphology. These features were highly interrelated, with only T-cell markers and CNS involvement achieving independent significance in a multivariate logistic regression model. Hepatomegaly, blast cell morphological subtype (French-American-British [FAB] M3, M4, and M5) and age less than 2 years were each associated with coagulopathy in patients with AML, although age failed to retain importance after logistic regression analysis. The presence of coagulopathy at diagnosis of ALL did not influence the rate of remission induction (P = .55). By contrast, only 14 of 27 children with coagulopathy at diagnosis of AML achieved a complete remission (CR), compared with 129 of 168 other patients who lacked this complication (P = .003). After multivariate analysis, coagulopathy remained independently associated with failure to attain remission in AML (P = .02). Fatal hemorrhagic complications arising in the CNS or lungs accounted for nine of the 13 induction failures in this group. The presence or absence of coagulopathy had no discernible influence on treatment outcome among patients with either ALL or AML who attained a CR. Laboratory evidence of a coagulation defect may be useful in identifying patients with AML who have a greater risk of induction failure and, hence, require close surveillance and intensive replacement therapy to prevent fatal hemorrhagic complications.","['Ribeiro, R C', 'Pui, C H']","['Ribeiro RC', 'Pui CH']",['eng'],"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Blood Coagulation Disorders/blood/*complications/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*complications', 'Male', 'Sex Factors', 'Statistics as Topic']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1986.4.8.1212 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1986 Aug;4(8):1212-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1986.4.8.1212.,,,,,,,,,,

However, some tumor cells were affected cytostatically only. Human diploid cells were not affected cytostatically or cytocidally by rHu-TNF.

Results were disappointing: four patients died during aplasia; seven returned to chronic phase, but three died of hemorrhage, four relapsed, and three did not reverse. The main problem was the very low rate of successful engraftment. Both the collection of bone marrow after treatment with busulfan and a particular sensitivity of CFU-GM to cryoinjury were responsible for the infusion of very low doses of CFU-GM. However, we observed some promising results: In one patient in acute blast crisis, the Ph 1 chromosome disappeared, as well as the cytogenetic marker of transformation; in another patient with acute pure cytogenetic acceleration, the abnormal clone disappeared for 27 months; a third patient was maintained in a second chronic phase for 20 months. Thus we suggest that the results of autografting in chronic myeloid leukemia would be improved by infusing the largest possible dose of stem cells collected before or long after treatment by busulfan, and freezing them following a careful program.","['Lemonnier, M P', 'Gorin, N C', 'Laporte, J P', 'Douay, L', 'Lopez, M', 'van den Akker, J', 'Stachowiak, J', 'David, R', 'Pene, F', 'Kantor, G']","['Lemonnier MP', 'Gorin NC', 'Laporte JP', 'Douay L', 'Lopez M', 'van den Akker J', 'Stachowiak J', 'David R', 'Pene F', 'Kantor G', 'et al.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'TACC protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Aug;14(7):654-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor cell log-kill was dose dependent and greater than 4 for all cell lines but L428KSA (log-kill, 3.73). Median recovery of CFU-GM after purging with 75, 100, and 125 microM etoposide was 3.6%, 1.3%, and 1% of the controls, respectively. After one week of long-term marrow culture (LTMC), recovery increased 10-20 times/10(5) cells plated, reaching median values of 33.6%, 23.5%, and 20.7% of the controls in samples purged with 75, 100, and 125 microM etoposide, respectively. Flow cytometry for cell-cycle analysis and RNA content, and chromosomal studies of one-week-old LTMC from healthy donors detected no significant abnormalities in purged as compared to control cultures. After 3-4 weeks of LTMC, both control and etoposide-treated cells formed confluent monolayers. Using a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies (S3.13, S16.144, S4.7, S8.6, RIB-19, anti-HLA-DR, and VIL-A1), we investigated the expression of early and late differentiation antigens on LTMC after various culture times (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks). None of the early antigens S3.13, S16.144, and S8.6 was significantly reduced following etoposide treatment, either in nonadherent cells collected from the supernatant or in the adherent cell population obtained from trypsinized monolayers. Etoposide treatment dose dependently delayed the expression of RIB-19 (a late myeloid antigen) and, to a lesser extent, of S4.7 (an ""intermediate"" myelomonocytic marker). VIL-A1 expression was not affected by etoposide treatment. We conclude that etoposide purging of bone marrow in the 75-125 microM range spares a sufficient number of functionally intact stem cells to allow adequate in vivo reconstitution following autologous transplantation.","['Ciobanu, N', 'Paietta, E', 'Andreeff, M', 'Papenhausen, P', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Ciobanu N', 'Paietta E', 'Andreeff M', 'Papenhausen P', 'Wiernik PH']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Aug;14(7):626-35.,,,,,,,,,,

Adjuvant chemotherapy given for periods longer than six months after the induction of complete remission does not appear, in comparative trials with a five-year follow-up, to improve the final prognosis either in leukaemia or in solid tumours. It is suggested here that the reason may be that minimal residual tumours may consist of cells in the G-O phase. Breast cancer before the menopause may be an exception, since oestrogens present before, but not during, menopause are promotors. This could explain why premenopausal breast cancer seems to be the only tumour transitorily sensitive to adjuvant chemotherapy. Immunotherapy given during complete remission seems to result in longer remission duration and/or overall survival and/or survival after relapse in some but not in all properly conducted trials. It is well known that large tumour masses are not influenced by immunotherapy. In contrast, it is known that cells in G-O, refractory to chemotherapy, may be sensitive to immunotherapy.","['Mathe, G', 'Reizenstein, P', 'Eriguchi, M']","['Mathe G', 'Reizenstein P', 'Eriguchi M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Drugs Exp Clin Res,Drugs under experimental and clinical research,7802135,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interphase', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drugs Exp Clin Res. 1986;12(1-3):83-98.,,,,,,,216,,,

Preclinical studies suggested that ACM had approximately equivalent antitumour activity but produced substantially less cardiotoxicity compared to other anthracyclines. Because of the recognized importance of these compounds in the treatment of haematological tumours, clinical trials of ACM were initiated in the late 1970s. ACM has been extensively evaluated in patients with relapsed leukaemia and advanced malignant lymphoma. Analysis of results compiled from Europe, Japan, and the United States shows that ACM is probably equivalent to doxorubicin for remission induction of patients with relapsed acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia. Initial studies using ACM alone and in combination with standard cytotoxic drugs in previously untreated patients compare favourably with the best standard treatment for this disease. The antitumour activity of ACM in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or malignant lymphoma who have previously received doxorubicin or daunorubicin is low, and the issue of whether ACM lacks clinical cross-resistance to other anthracyclines is unresolved. Acute cardiac arrhythmias have been observed following administration of ACM, but congestive cardiomyopathy has been uncommon.

The overall mortality due to or associated with pneumonia was 26/130 (20%). Graft-versus-host disease clearly increased the incidence of infectious pneumonia and the mortality due to or associated with pneumonia.

The prognosis predictions achieved from clinical and hematologic status, cytogenetic karyotype, immune phenotype, and cellular proliferative responses in vitro were studied by Cox's multivariate analysis. Indicators of poor survival were high dextran sulphate (DxS)-induced CLL-cell proliferation in vitro (P less than 0.002), older age, low percentage T-cells of blood lymphocytes (P less than 0.01), low hemoglobin count, advanced Binet stage, male sex, and high lymphocyte count (P less than 0.05). A therapy-demanding disease was predicted by cytogenetic data (extra chromosome 12, and complex karyotypes [P less than 0.001]), high DxS-induced CLL-cell proliferation (P less than 0.001), high frequency of cytogenetically abnormal metaphases, and advanced Rai and Binet stages (P less than 0.01). The best combinations of parameters included the cytogenetic variables, the DxS-induced CLL-cell proliferation, the relative T-cell number, and the Binet stage.

There was no difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or survival in the four maintenance arms. For patients reaching complete remission, the median DFS was 40 weeks, and median survival was 22 months with 30% surviving at 4 years. The overall survival was 18% at 4 years.

To apply the test, it is necessary in each case to find DNA probes that display patient-specific and donor-specific bands in Southern transfer hybridization. We have isolated a set of 12 cloned DNAs from highly polymorphic loci by which siblings can usually be distinguished. With just four of these probes, we can expect to distinguish the genotypes of the recipient and a sibling donor in more than 99% of cases (except between identical twins). The availability of many highly polymorphic probes also allows selection of an optimal probe for each case, one that can detect both the patient and donor-specific bands in a single hybridization with maximum resolution and sensitivity. We have applied these probes to the analysis of cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow after transplantation and demonstrated their usefulness in confirming engraftment of donor cells or graft rejection, and in detecting mixed lympho-hematopoietic chimerism.","['Knowlton, R G', 'Brown, V A', 'Braman, J C', 'Barker, D', 'Schumm, J W', 'Murray, C', 'Takvorian, T', 'Ritz, J', 'Donis-Keller, H']","['Knowlton RG', 'Brown VA', 'Braman JC', 'Barker D', 'Schumm JW', 'Murray C', 'Takvorian T', 'Ritz J', 'Donis-Keller H']",['eng'],['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'DNA/*analysis/genetics', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69047-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Aug;68(2):378-85.,,,,,,,,,,

All but one of them were conditioned with a polychemotherapy regimen including 6-thioguanine, Ara-C, CCNU, and cyclophosphamide. The marrow cells were purged by chemical means in 16 cases. Five transplant-related deaths were observed: three cardiac failures, one interstitial pneumonitis and one aspergillus pneumonia. At the time of analysis (October 1984), four patients had relapsed and eight were still in unmaintained CR1 (44+, 46+, 30+, and five between 2.5+ and 8+ months post transplant). Fifteen patients had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: four were autografted in CR1 and 11 children were grafted in CR2; the conditioning regimen was fractionated total body irradiation followed by cyclophosphamide for all but one patient who was conditioned with BACT (Burkitt leukaemia); the marrow was purged by a chemical agent in 11 patients and by monoclonal antibodies and C' in four: four out of 15 patients relapsed (two grafted in CR1 and two grafted in CR2); 10 patients are still in unmaintained CR: two adults grafted in CR1 (26+; 12+ months) and eight children with a mean follow-up of 13.4 months post graft (2 + -45+ months).

After having been induced into complete remission and consolidated, 73 patients were randomized either to maintenance chemotherapy or maintenance chemotherapy plus immunotherapy with N-CWS and irradiated allogeneic AML cells. Thirty-four patients in the chemotherapy group and 32 in the chemoimmunotherapy group were evaluable. Six months after the closure of the study, the immunotherapy showed a borderline beneficial effect on remission duration (p = 0.080) and on survival length (p = 0.098). When the data were analyzed at 42 months after entry, there was a borderline significant difference in remission duration (p = 0.066) between the two groups, prolonging the 50% remission period by 120 days, but no significant differences in survival length (p = 0.306), although the 50% survival was 168 days longer in the chemoimmunotherapy group.

In addition, partial PPO deficiency can be detected in AMKL. The establishment of a large panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against platelet proteins present either on the membrane or within alpha-granules has permitted determination of the phenotype of normal PMKB which differentiate from CFU-MK in the early days of in vitro culture. The immunologic phenotypes of leukemic PMKB are identical to those of their normal counterparts but their maturation is blocked at different levels corresponding to three main different phenotypes; PPO is expressed in all phenotypes. The most immature or PMKB I is HLA-DR+, 80 H 5 or MY 9+ (myeloid-lineage antigens also expressed on stem cells); PMKB II lack this labeling but acquire platelet Gp IIb, IIIa while GpIb identified by monoclonal antibody AN 51 is absent or weak. PMKB III which represent the more frequent phenotype express all Gp and exhibit diffuse cytoplasmic labeling for vWF, PF4, TPS, fibrinogen, in the absence of alpha-granules at EM level. Changes in the phenotype (from III and II to I) can be observed during the evolution of the same patient. In spite of a partial PPO deficiency in blasts and platelets from several cases of AMKL, PPO appears to be the earliest and most sensitive marker.","['Breton-Gorius, J', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Breton-Gorius J', 'Vainchenker W']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Peroxidases/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1986;215:301-17.,,,,,,,60,,,

Immediately after remission was induced with four conventional drugs, a two-week intensification course of teniposide and cytarabine was given to eradicate subclinical leukemia. Patients in remission were then treated for two years with rapid rotation of pairs of drugs that were not cross-resistant and periodic courses of the same agents used to induce remission. A second complete remission was induced in 31 of the 39 patients in whom response to chemotherapy could be assessed. The probability of maintaining bone marrow remission in these patients for one year was 0.38 +/- 0.19 (95 percent confidence interval); the two-year probability was 0.29 +/- 0.17. Seven patients completed the treatment program, five of whom have been in continuous second complete remission 17 to 20 months after the cessation of therapy. Children whose initial bone marrow remission lasted less than 18 months had significantly poorer responses to retreatment than did those with a longer first remission (P = 0.004).

In the subsequent study COALL-82 high-risk patients (initial white blood count greater than or equal to 25/nl or T-cell leukemia and acute undifferentiated leukemia) received additional high-dose methotrexate as fifth drug in the intensive phase and the combination VM-26/arabinosyl-cytosine in the reinduction phase. In all others patients (low-risk group) intermediate-dose methotrexate was substituted for the myelosuppressive agent cyclophosphamide in the intensive phase. Reinduction was no longer given in the low-risk group. In both risk groups cranial irradiation was postponed until after the intensive phase therapy. Radiotherapy was withheld for a group with minimal risk (white blood count less than 3/nl, liver/spleen less than 3 cm). The probability of CCR for the total group of 129 patients is 64% after 3.5 years. The comparative analysis between the studies COALL-82 and COALL-80 shows that low-risk patients have an equally high probability of continuous hematologic remission (91% vs. 85%) despite reduction of therapy in COALL-82. High-risk patients, however, had a significantly higher rate of bone marrow relapses; in this group the probability of continuous hematologic remission is 52% in COALL-82 vs. 73% in COALL-80. Also relapses in the central nervous system in irradiated patients were significantly more frequent in COALL-82 than in COALL-80 (12% vs. 4%) whereas the group of patients without radiotherapy has remained free of relapse.

A lymphoid dendritic-like tumor, P388AD.2, acts as a novel immunogenic carrier for hapten.",777-83,"Hapten-modified spleen cells, peritoneal exudate cells, and certain lymphoid tumors preferentially induce specific tolerance after i.v. administration. In contrast to these tolerogenic carrier cells, we found that a haptenated lymphoid dendritic-like tumor, P388AD.2, acts as a potent immunogen after i.v. injection. The immunogenicity of P388AD.2 was analyzed by measuring the specific augmentation of plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses when spleen cells from mice previously injected with haptenated tumor cells were challenged in vitro with thymus-independent antigens. Optimal immunization was found to be dependent on cell dose and hapten concentrations. Further studies indicated that P388AD.2 elicited a response which was T cell-dependent and which involved both the so-called Lyb-3,5,7- and Lyb-3,5,7+ B cell populations. Injection of haptenated tumor into different mouse strains suggested that H-2 compatibility was required to prime B cells in vivo, although significant augmentation could also be achieved in allogeneic C57B1/6J mice. The enhanced PFC responses elicited in H-2b mice could not be explained by allo-recognition of class I or II MHC determinants. In toto, these results suggest that P388AD.2 acts as a unique accessory cell for the presentation of hapten-modified self.","['Cogswell, J P', 'Phipps, R P', 'Scott, D W']","['Cogswell JP', 'Phipps RP', 'Scott DW']",['eng'],"['5 T32 CA 09058-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42739/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Antigens, Ly/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Haptens/*immunology', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/immunology', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia P388/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Aug 1;137(3):777-83.,,,,,,,,,,

A survey of a variety of natural products, synthetic compounds, and immunoregulating agents has failed thus far to identify compounds capable of competing with CsA for binding to CyP.

The idiotypic specificity of the two anti-HPB-ALL Ti mAb was demonstrated by several criteria. Both mAb bound specifically to HPB-ALL cells as determined by radioimmunoassay or FACS analysis but not with 8 other T cell lines. The anti-HPB-ALL Ti mAb precipitated a disulfide-linked heterodimer of 85 kDa only from 125I-labeled HPB-ALL cells and not from other cell lines tested. Incubation of HPB-ALL cells with anti-T3 abrogated the expression of T3 and induced co-modulation of the idiotypic structures detected by the two anti-HPB-ALL Ti mAb. Conversely, incubation of HPB-ALL cells with either one of the anti-Ti mAb abrogated the expression of T3 and of the idiotypic structures.

In both NK and ADCC, preincubation of the lymphocytes with different antibody concentrations resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of cytotoxicity. In contrast, preincubation of the target cells had no effect indicating that the mAb inhibited cytotoxicity at the effector cell level. When studied at the single-cell level, the mAb did not alter the number of lymphocytes forming conjugates with K562 but significantly reduced the frequency of conjugates containing dead target cells. Addition of the mAb to preformed conjugates resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the proportion of conjugates containing dead target cells. Furthermore, mAb 3192 did not reduce the number of lymphocytes forming rosettes with bovine erythrocytes, indicating that inhibition of ADCC was not due to blocking of the effector cell-target cell interaction mediated by the Fc receptor of the effector cells.

Some T lymphocyte functions are mediated by soluble products called lymphokines. Different lymphokines promote the activation, growth and differentiation of T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and hemopoietic cells. Lymphokine production is associated with, but not limited to, helper T cells, and usually follows antigenic or mitogenic stimulation. The recognition that some lymphokines are produced after stimulation of neoplastic T cells has proved advantageous in the study of these molecules. T cell tumors are monoclonal, grow easily in vitro, and may produce fewer lymphokines than normal T cells. Thus, the purification and biochemical and biological characterization of some lymphokines have been facilitated by the availability of these tumors. More recently, T cell tumors have been used for evaluating the molecular structure of lymphokine-encoding genes.

At one end of the spectrum is the total isolation technology applied to David, the ""Bubble Boy"" who lived his entire life behind sterile plastic barriers. At the other end of the spectrum is the simpler technology applied to patients receiving bone marrow transplants who are maintained in ordinary private hospital rooms and attended by personnel who merely observe handwashing precautions. Most properly performed and controlled studies of the use of special isolation procedures to reduce infections derive from patients receiving bone marrow transplants for conditions of aplastic anemia and leukemia or patients receiving chemotherapy for malignancy. The design of isolation procedures for immunodeficient patients borrows from these studies because of the relatively small number of immunodeficient patients. These studies have shown that laminar airflow rooms produce a significantly lower incidence of infections but may not change the mortality of all patients. Also, protective isolation has clearly reduced the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease in transplanted patients with aplastic anemia. Recently there has been a trend away from strict isolation procedures because careful studies have indicated that host rather than acquired pathogens are responsible for at least 85% of infections in these special patients. Also, the human stress of prolonged isolation is becoming increasingly recognized. The complex and expensive isolation techniques that were used in David's case are no longer being utilized in immunodeficient subjects, partly because new transplantation technology has made it possible to cross histocompatibility barriers, obviating the need for permanent isolation.","['Guerra, I C', 'Shearer, W T']","['Guerra IC', 'Shearer WT']",['eng'],['188/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Child', '*Environment, Controlled', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/complications/economics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Patient Isolation/economics/*methods/psychology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-1229(86)90076-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1986 Jul;40(1):128-35. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(86)90076-0.,,,,,,,28,,,

Unfortunately, treatment with unmodified antibodies has been disappointing. Therapy with unmodified antibodies has been limited by the failure of host effector mechanisms to eliminate antibody-coated tumor cells and by the emergence of variant cells lacking the target antigen. The use of antibodies as carriers of radionuclides has the potential for overcoming both these limitations because the conjugates will be directly cytotoxic and a conjugate bound to a cell surface will deliver radiation to adjacent cells lacking the target antigen. Experimental and clinical therapy trials of radionuclide antibody conjugates have yielded promising results with both tumor-specific antibody and with antibodies against differentiation antigens. Bone marrow toxicity has been dose limiting. Bone marrow support will most likely be required for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma due to the marrow involvement with malignant cells. In the case of solid tumors, bone marrow infusion may allow administration of curative doses of radionuclide conjugates.

The principle causes of transplantation failure are recurrent leukemia and therapeutic toxicities, including idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis and graft versus host disease (GVHD). The likelihood of leukemic relapse is related primarily to the remission status of the patient; patients in first remission have a lower relapse rate than patients in second remission, and the relapse rate of both is less than that of patients in relapse. Interstitial pneumonitis is due, in part, to the total body irradiation (TBI) that is used to cytoreduce the patients. TBI administration has been modified to reduce its toxicity. Acute and chronic GVHD are due to the immuno-aggression of donor T-lymphocytes against recipient non-HLA antigens. The in vitro removal of the T-lymphocytes from the donor bone marrow inoculum reduces the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD but may have the adverse effect of reducing hematopoietic engraftment and increasing leukemic relapse since the graft versus leukemia effect may be eliminated.

Major involvement can be anticipated in areas including: chemotherapeutic treatment, immunization, infection surveillance and treatment, detection of disease recurrence, and late effects of cancer treatment. A CP could decrease the financial burden, and help alleviate the anxieties and emotional stresses placed upon the patients and parents.

In other APL patients who exhibit a 15;17 translocation, we found no genomic changes of the p53, suggesting that the p53 gene, which was recently mapped to the short arm of chromosome 17 in the human, is not structurally related to the typical chromosomal break point found in the long arm of chromosome 17 of APL patients.","['Prokocimer, M', 'Shaklai, M', 'Bassat, H B', 'Wolf, D', 'Goldfinger, N', 'Rotter, V']","['Prokocimer M', 'Shaklai M', 'Bassat HB', 'Wolf D', 'Goldfinger N', 'Rotter V']",['eng'],['IR01CA40002-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69861-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jul;68(1):113-8.,,,,,,,,,,

This red cell anion-exchange system mediates the Cl-(-)HCO3- exchange responsible for most of the bicarbonate transport capacity of the blood. The rapidly expanding knowledge of the molecular biology and the transport kinetics of this specialized transport system is very briefly reviewed in Section III. Exchange diffusion mechanisms for anions are found in many cells other than erythrocytes. The exchange diffusion system in Ehrlich cells has several similarities to that in red cells. In several cell types (subsection IV-B), there is evidence that intracellular pH regulation depends on Cl-(-)HCO3- exchange processes. Anion exchange in other single cells is described in Section IV, and its role in pH regulation is described in Section VII. Anion exchange mechanism operating in parallel with, and only functionally linked to Na+-H+ or K+-H+ exchange mechanisms can also play a role in cell volume regulation as described in Section VII. In the Ehrlich ascites cell and other vertebrate cells, electroneutral anion transfer has been found to occur also by a cotransport system for cations and chloride operating in parallel with the exchange diffusion system. The cotransport system is capable of mediating secondary active chloride influx. In avian red cells, the cotransport system has been shown to be activated by adrenergic agonists and by cyclic AMP, suggesting that the cotransport is involved in regulatory processes (see subsection V-A.). In several cell types, cotransport systems are activated and play a role during volume regulation, as described in Section V and in Section VII. It is also likely that this secondary active cotransport of chloride plays a significant role for the apparently active extrusion of acid equivalents from certain cells. If a continuous influx of chloride against an electrochemical gradient is maintained by a cotransport system, the chloride disequilibrium can drive an influx of bicarbonate through the anion exchange mechanism, as described in Section VII. Finally, even the electrodiffusion of anions is shown to be regulated, and in Ehrlich cells and human lymphocytes an activation of the anion diffusion pathway plays a major role in cell volume regulation as described in Section VI and subsection VII-B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Hoffmann, E K']",['Hoffmann EK'],['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0Y2S3XUQ5H (Bumetanide)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anions/*metabolism', 'Axons/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Birds', 'Bumetanide/metabolism', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Calmodulin/physiology', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/metabolism/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/blood', 'Cations', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Chlorides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Muscles/metabolism', 'Neuroglia/metabolism', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Potassium/blood/pharmacology', 'Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Vertebrates/*metabolism']",1986/06/12 00:00,1986/06/12 00:01,['1986/06/12 00:00'],"['1986/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4157(86)90014-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4157(86)90014-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1986 Jun 12;864(1):1-31. doi: 10.1016/0304-4157(86)90014-6.,,,,,,,231,,,

However, with the introduction of T-lymphocyte depleted BMT, graft rejection is recognized as a new complication. At the Royal Free Hospital (RFH) in London T-depletion is achieved using two monoclonal antibodies with complement mediated lysis. The methodology was extended to other centres and in total 56 patients have received T-depleted, HLA matched BMT. Twelve of 56 patients have had graft rejection. At the RFH three of 41 (7%) patients have had rejection whereas at collaborating centres nine of 15 (60%) patients have had rejection. We have investigated these rejections in order to identify factor(s) responsible. Rejection was not restricted by patient or donor characteristics, nor disease status. Patient management, chemotherapy conditioning, efficiency of T-depletion, graft versus host disease (GvHD), and infection post BMT, were not consistently implicated. The major difference between the RFH and all other centres was in the radiotherapy (RT) conditioning: The RFH prescribed a single fraction of 7.5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) whilst collaborating centres gave 10 or 12 Gy fractionated TBI. We conclude that the different incidence of rejection (7% v. 60%) relates primarily to the RT conditioning although the mechanisms(s) of rejection remain unknown. We conclude that where T-depleted BMT is used, compensation by more intensive RT conditioning is required in order to avert graft rejection.","['Patterson, J', 'Prentice, H G', 'Brenner, M K', 'Gilmore, M', 'Janossy, G', 'Ivory, K', 'Skeggs, D', 'Morgan, H', 'Lord, J', 'Blacklock, H A']","['Patterson J', 'Prentice HG', 'Brenner MK', 'Gilmore M', 'Janossy G', 'Ivory K', 'Skeggs D', 'Morgan H', 'Lord J', 'Blacklock HA', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Graft Rejection', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Male', 'Radiation Dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb05544.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1986 Jun;63(2):221-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb05544.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty patients had splenectomy prior to transplantation. Forty-seven patients were transplanted without splenectomy, 21 of whom had splenic enlargement by physical examination. There were no differences in the proportion of patients with granulocyte recovery, but the recovery of peripheral granulocytes to levels of 200, 500 and 1,000/mm3 occurred more rapidly in the splenectomy group than in the no-splenectomy group. Patients with splenectomy received platelet transfusions for a mean of 10 (2-36) days as compared to 20 (3-82) days for patients without splenectomy (p less than .001). Eighteen (90%) patients with splenectomy became platelet transfusion independent at a median of 16 (2-32) days after transplantation as compared to 40 (85%) patients without splenectomy who became transfusion independent at a median of 28 (15-86) days (p less than .001). The proportion of patients achieving platelet levels of 50 and 100 X 10(3)/mm3 did not differ between the two groups (p = .07), but patients in the splenectomy group achieved these levels more rapidly following transplant (p less than .001). One of 17 evaluable patients in the splenectomy group and 31 of 46 in the no-splenectomy group became refractory to random platelets (p less than .001) and required platelets from family members or unrelated completely or partially HLA matched donors.

In AML the correlation with receptor site content is moot, and in other leukemias the reports are less complete. A model system for childhood ALL is provided by CEM cells, a glucocorticoid sensitive human cell line from a patient with the disease. These cells have glucocorticoid receptors which must be filled by hormone for greater than 24 hr for cell lysis to begin.

The enrichment of clonogenic cells in the one-step procedure appeared superior to the two-step enrichment, first separating buffy coat cells. The recovery of clonogenic cells was 70 and 50%, respectively. Repopulation capacity of the low-density cell fraction containing the clonogenic cells was excellent after autologous reinfusion (6 cases) and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (3 cases).

The detection limit of most techniques, however, is not lower than 1% (i.e. 1 malignant cell in 100 normal cells). Most immunological markers represent differentiation antigens, which are also expressed by normal cells. Nevertheless, it is possible to use these differentiation antigens for the detection of low numbers of malignant cells, since the occurrence of positive cells outside their normal homing areas can be indicative of malignancy. A useful marker for the detection of low numbers of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in the cerebrospinal fluid is terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Although TdT positive cells normally occur in low frequencies in bone marrow and blood, the combined detection of TdT and a T cell marker at the single cell level, allows detection of very low numbers of T-ALL cells. The detection limit of this technique is at least 0.01%.

Neoplastic cells, obtained prior to initiation of therapy, were purified and classified, on the basis of both surface antigen pattern and morphology, into pre-B, B, and T ALL and M1-M5 AML. RNA was extracted and analyzed for expression of cellular oncogenes coding for nuclear proteins (c-myc, c-myb, c-fos), the beta-chain of platelet-derived growth factor (c-sis), growth factor receptors or related proteins (c-src, c-abl, c-fes, c-erbB), or putative intermediate transducers of mitogenic signals (c-Ha-ras, c-Ki-ras, c-N-ras). Quantitative analysis of total RNA was carried out by dot blot hybridization to specific cDNA or genomic probes. Number and size of transcripts were evaluated by blot hybridization of electrophoretically fractionated poly(A)+ RNA. Expression of c-myc and c-myb was detected in all leukemic cells at variable levels and was characterized by well-defined patterns within ALL subtypes. Conversely, significant levels of c-fos transcripts were detected only in myelomonocytic (M4) and monocytic (M5) leukemias. Among the ""src-family,"" c-fes was expressed more in AML than ALL, and c-abl was expressed at variable but not elevated levels in all leukemia types. c-Ha-ras was uniformly expressed at low levels, as in non-neoplastic cells. c-Ki-ras transcription was detected only in T ALL; N-ras expression was barely demonstrable. The structure of these protooncogenes was not grossly modified, as evaluated by Southern analysis, except for c-myc rearrangement in B ALL. These studies indicate that cellular oncogene expression in specific subtypes of leukemic cells may relate to either the proliferative activity (c-myc, c-myb) or the differentiation state (c-fos) of the cells, or possibly to expression of receptors for putative hemopoiesis-related growth factors (c-fes, c-abl).

More than 95% of the clonable cells are concentrated in the spleen 5 days after transplant. The cells possess immune memory as demonstrated by the generation of alloreactive-specific cytotoxicity.

A definitive classification of the T-cell lymphomas still does not exist. Nonetheless, it is now possible to distinguish thymic and prethymic, i.e. lymphoblastic lymphomas, from postthymic, i.e. peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Of the peripheral T-cell lymphomas the following are relatively well defined: chronic lymphocytic leukemia of T type (T-CLL) and prolymphocytic leukemia of T type (T-PLL), mycosis fungoides and Sezary's syndrome, lymphoepithelioid lymphoma (Lennert's lymphoma), T-zone lymphoma T-immunoblastic lymphoma, and large cell anaplastic lymphoma (so-called Ki1 lymphoma). Recently, a T-cell lymphoma termed lymphogranulomatosis X (AILD)-type was defined whose chromosomal abnormalities and rearrangement of the beta-chain of the T-cell receptor appear to distinguish it from cases of non-neoplastic lymphogranulomatosis X. Histological and cytochemical criteria enable the identification of many cases of T-cell lymphoma. By contrast, the large number of available monoclonal antibodies can do little more than confirm the T-cell nature and proliferation rate of the tumor cells. DNA rearrangement techniques now make it possible to distinguish between polyclonal and monoclonal T-cell proliferations. Lymphoepithelioid lymphoma, lymphogranulomatosis X and large cell anaplastic lymphoma (Ki1 lymphoma) are treated in detail.

In children, the common ALL--a precursor B-ALL type--was prognostically more favorable than the T-ALL which differs also in clinical appearance and in prognostic factors. In adults, however, T-ALL had a better prognosis than common ALL in a prospective trial. The heterogeneous Null-ALL which makes up 23% of ALL in adults and 5% in children, was the prognostically most unfavorable form besides the rare B-ALL (1-2%), the immunophenotype being an independent prognostic variable.

Other applications of immunophenotyping of malignant lymphomas in the near future will be the demonstration of receptors for certain lymphokines (e.g. for therapy with interleukin-2 or tumor-necrosis-factor), the detection of specific cell surface antigens (for immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies) and the demonstration of immunological markers for resistance to cytotoxic drugs.

It has been implicated in the control of normal cell growth as well as transformation, but its exact function is unknown. When the human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line HL60 is treated with retinoic acid, the cells differentiate into granulocytes, and there is a reduction in steady state c-myc RNA of more than 10-fold. Nuclear runoff assays show that this reduction is caused by a corresponding decrease in the transcription of exon 2. However, only a minor decrease in exon 1 transcription is observed upon differentiation. In undifferentiated HL60 cells there is an approximately 3-fold molar excess of exon 1 transcription over exon 2, and this excess increases to about 15-fold in differentiated cells. This observation suggests that a major component of c-myc transcriptional down-regulation in HL60 cells is at the level of elongation rather than at the level of initiation. The position of the elongation block was mapped to the region of the boundary between exon 1 and intron 1. During HL60 differentiation, a DNase I hypersensitive site in the chromatin about 300 bases downstream of the 5' end of of intron 1 increases in intensity relative to other sites, possibly reflecting events associated with the termination of transcription. Our runoff analysis also revealed transcription of both strands immediately upstream of exon 1 in HL60 cells.

In the present study, we have identified in B151-CFS another unique lymphokine activity (referred to as B151-TRF2), which induces polyclonal differentiation of unstimulated B cells into IgM-secreting cells without concomitant stimulation of antigen, mitogen, or anti-Ig antibody. The B151-TRF2 activity induced polyclonal IgM PFC responses via the action on surface Ig-positive small resting B cells from normal unprimed mice. This activation was effective across an H-2 barrier, and apparently independent of the presence of T cells and accessory cells. Interestingly, the B151-TRF2 activity notably stimulated B cells of neonatal and mutant DBA/2Ha mice, which are nonresponders to B151-TRF1, whereas it failed to activate the xid B cells from CBA/N mice. To substantiate that B151-TRF1 and B151-TRF2 activities are mediated by mutually distinguishable molecules, an absorption experiment of B151-CFS was performed by utilizing DBA/2Ha B cells which are lacking in B151-TRF1 receptor. It was found that DBA/2Ha B cells could absorb B151-TRF2 activity but not B151-TRF1 activity. In contrast, murine chronic B cell leukemia BCL1 cells, which were shown to differentiate into IgM-secreting cells by stimulation with B151-CFS, selectively removed B151-TRF1 activity but not B151-TRF2 activity. Furthermore, biochemical analysis revealed that the B151-TRF2 was a heat (56 degrees C for 30 min)-sensitive protein with an apparent m.w. of 30,000 by gel filtration, whereas B151-TRF1 was a heat-resistant glycoprotein with m.w. of 50,000. In addition, it was shown that prostaglandin E2 selectively inhibited B151-TRF2-mediated B cell responses. These results demonstrate clearly that B151-TRF1 and B151-TRF2 are distinct B cell differentiation factors involved in the different activation pathways of distinct B cell subpopulations. The immunologic implication of B151-TRF2 activity in B cell differentiation is discussed in comparison with other lymphokines so far reported to activate small resting B cells.","['Ono, S', 'Hayashi, S', 'Takahama, Y', 'Dobashi, K', 'Katoh, Y', 'Nakanishi, K', 'Paul, W E', 'Hamaoka, T']","['Ono S', 'Hayashi S', 'Takahama Y', 'Dobashi K', 'Katoh Y', 'Nakanishi K', 'Paul WE', 'Hamaoka T']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell-Free System', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/genetics', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interphase', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Species Specificity', 'X Chromosome']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jul 1;137(1):187-96.,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies reacting with the different HLA class II determinants, HLA-DR, DRw52(MT), and DQ, were used to study the expression of these antigens on Epstein-Barr virus transformed cell lines, chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells, acute lymphoblastic leukemic blasts, acute myeloblastic leukemic blasts, and established leukemic cell lines by indirect immunofluorescence binding and immunoprecipitations. The results showed that whereas the HLA-DR and HLA-DRw52(MT2) antigens are normally expressed on the majority of the cells tested, there is a different expression of the HLA-DQ antigens on acute leukemic blasts, chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells, and leukemic cell lines indicating that the DQ molecules may be differentiation antigens preferentially expressed on mature cells. Furthermore, when the pre-B cell leukemic line NALM 6 was induced to differentiate with phorbol ester (TPA), normal expression of the HLA-DQ antigen was obtained after 5 days of culture. The absence of HLA-DQ antigens from the acute leukemic blasts suggests that these immature cells ""froze"" in the early stages of cell differentiation. We discuss these findings in relation to the role of these HLA class II antigens in cell differentiation and the immune response.","['Navarrete, C', 'Fernandez, N', 'Alonso, M C', 'Festenstein, H']","['Navarrete C', 'Fernandez N', 'Alonso MC', 'Festenstein H']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immune Sera)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA-DQ Antigens', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0198-8859(86)90035-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(86)90035-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1986 May;16(1):52-68. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(86)90035-2.,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow was treated in vitro with high-dose ASTA Z 7557, individually determined according to CFU-GM sensitivity. The different peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were characterized by means of monoclonal antibodies (indirect immunofluorescence assay) belonging to the following classes of differentiation: OKT11-T11 (CD2), OKT3-T3 (CD3), OKT4-T4 (CD4), OKT8-T8 (CD8), OKIal-I2 (HLA-DR), Leu7 (natural killer/killer) and by means of polyspecific antiimmunoglobulin sera (direct immunofluorescence assay). Data in these ten patients were compared with those of a control group of 21 normal donors and with a control group of 14 patients in CR without ABMT. Our results showed a marked depression of the T4:T8 ratio in patients with AL before ABMT, compared with normal donors who had respective values of 1.02 and 1.33 (p less than 0.01). This depression was increased and prolonged up to day 515 after ABMT, with a value of 0.32 (p less than 0.01 compared with the pregraft situation; p less than 0.001 compared with normal donors). This T4:T8 ratio imbalance was related to the depletion of the T4+ population and to the increase of the T8+ subset. This imbalance was emphasized after ABMT. The Leu 7+ population was also increased in grafted patients compared with normal donors (p less than 0.01). The B-cell population remained unchanged throughout the study. We conclude that patients autografted with marrow treated in vitro by high-dose ASTA Z 7557 may experience a long-term T-cell subset imbalance.","['Le Blanc, G', 'Douay, L', 'Laporte, J P', 'Dominh, A', 'Deloux, J', 'Najman, A', 'Duhamel, G', 'Gorin, N C']","['Le Blanc G', 'Douay L', 'Laporte JP', 'Dominh A', 'Deloux J', 'Najman A', 'Duhamel G', 'Gorin NC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['88746-71-8 (Asta Z 7557)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/classification', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphocytes/*classification', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Jun;14(5):366-71.,,,,,,,,,,

The dose-limiting toxicity which is myelosuppression is believed to be a necessary effect for maximal antitumour effect. The areas in which therapeutic drug monitoring can play a role include: predicting patients at risk of toxicity, e.g. high dose methotrexate therapy; low bioavailability, e.g. oral 6-mercaptopurine; identifying patients at risk of treatment failure, e.g. methotrexate clearance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although therapeutic drug monitoring is not clinically useful at present, the potential role it can play is illustrated for cytosine arabinoside, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. Two problems encountered with drug monitoring of antineoplastic disease are tumour heterogeneity manifested by clonal, nutritional and physical characteristics and the common practice of combination chemotherapy. These problems must be addressed in order to make therapeutic drug monitoring a practical tool in cancer chemotherapy. Future applications of therapeutic drug monitoring will require more studies to define therapeutic ranges for single agents, patient-to-patient variation, course-to-course variation and the effects of drug combinations on pharmacokinetic profiles of the drugs used.","['Erlichman, C']",['Erlichman C'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Risk', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-9120(86)80055-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-9120(86)80055-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 1986 Apr;19(2):101-6. doi: 10.1016/s0009-9120(86)80055-8.,,,,,,,39,,,

A 30-min incubation with TPA led to marked growth arrest in HL60 cells and in cells from most patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and acute myelomonocytic leukemia, whereas cells from most patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and acute undifferentiated leukemia demonstrated a lesser degree of growth arrest. Freezing and thawing, a necessary step in autologous reconstitution, had no effect on the cessation of proliferation induced in HL60 or ANLL cells preincubated with TPA for 30 min. Virtually normal myeloid precursor growth occurred in normal or remission bone marrow cells preincubated with TPA and then frozen and thawed. Based on these observations, two patients with advanced ANLL in remission underwent marrow ablative therapy followed by autologous reconstitution using TPA-treated bone marrow. Limited normal hematopoiesis was reestablished in both patients, although they subsequently experienced leukemic relapse. These studies demonstrate that in ANLL cells, TPA stimulates growth arrest; in contrast, hematopoiesis is able to proceed both in vitro and in vivo.","['Abrahm, J L', 'Gerson, S L', 'Hoxie, J A', 'Tannenbaum, S H', 'Cassileth, P A', 'Cooper, R A']","['Abrahm JL', 'Gerson SL', 'Hoxie JA', 'Tannenbaum SH', 'Cassileth PA', 'Cooper RA']",['eng'],"['AM-15441/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32733/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Freezing', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Preservation, Biological', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jul;46(7):3711-6.,,,,,,,,,,

An important principle that has emerged from the study of lymphoid tumors is that the long-held view that malignant lymphoid cells are ""frozen"" at a fixed point in differentiation is not generally valid. Presentation of immunoregulatory signals to transformed B cells can profoundly influence their proliferation, morphology, differentiation, gene expression, and immunoglobulin synthesis. In addition to their responsiveness to immunoregulatory signals, some tumors of B lineage elaborate immunoregulatory signals. Until quite recently B-cell tumors were used primarily as monoclonal sources of molecules of immunological interest. While they continue to be important sources of receptors, growth and differentiation factors, differentiation antigens, and immunoregulatory factors, they are being used with increasing frequency to define the molecular events that occur in B cells subsequent to receipt of an immunoregulatory signal. While the use of tumor cells as models of normal cells is often viewed with some skepticism, it is difficult to find examples wherein tumors have been misleading. Quite to the contrary, B-cell tumors have regularly provided powerful tools for dissecting the molecular events that underlie B-cell development, function, and regulation.","['Hanley-Hyde, J M', 'Lynch, R G']","['Hanley-Hyde JM', 'Lynch RG']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Immunol,Annual review of immunology,8309206,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.iy.04.040186.003201 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Immunol. 1986;4:621-49. doi: 10.1146/annurev.iy.04.040186.003201.,,,,,,,172,,,

The presence of Fe++ blocked completely the cytotoxic action of HU alone and a combination with iron-chelator, and partially reversed the inhibition induced by HU and bipyridyl.

Advantages of this method include its applicability to routinely prepared blood and bone marrow smears and cytocentrifuge preparations, lack of endogenous peroxidase background staining, and a permanent record.","['Neumann, M P', 'de Solas, I', 'Parkin, J L', 'Gajl-Peczalska, K', 'McKenna, R W', 'Berkley, C K', 'Nichols, W L', 'Brunning, R D']","['Neumann MP', 'de Solas I', 'Parkin JL', 'Gajl-Peczalska K', 'McKenna RW', 'Berkley CK', 'Nichols WL', 'Brunning RD']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/immunology', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/85.5.564 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1986 May;85(5):564-72. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/85.5.564.,,,,,,,,,,

Cytology and cytochemistry].,1-241,"Imprints of lymph nodes and tumor specimens from 442 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were evaluated cytologically and cytochemically. With the exception of hairy cell leukemia, special forms of peripheral pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma, and lymph node plasmacytoma, all types of NHL of the Kiel classification were included in this study. The investigations were performed on slides stained with Pappenheim (May-Grunwald-Giemsa) or conventional cytochemical techniques for substrate and enzyme demonstration, such as periodic acid Schiff (PAS), neutral and acid non-specific alphanaphthyl acetate esterase, and acid and alkaline phosphatase. In certain cases further techniques for substrate and enzyme demonstration, including myeloperoxidase and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase, were used. We combined the cytologic and cytochemical evaluation with an attempt to diagnose the type of lymphoma on imprints without prior knowledge of the histologic findings or clinical data, in other words, blind. At the same time, we attempted to distinguish the NHL from reactive lymph node lesions, nonlymphoid malignant tumors, and systemic diseases. For this purpose, 75 cases of lymphadenitis and 33 cases of nonlymphoid neoplasia were mixed with the NHL for a blind test. In the following we will summarize the results pertaining to the NHL only. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B type (B-CLL; n = 75) was cytologically characterized by the presence of so-called prolymphocytes and paraimmunoblasts and a predominance of lymphocytes. In our opinion, there are four main variants of B-CLL: small-cell (""mature"") CLL, a type in which prolymphocytes are plentiful (""immature"" CLL), LP immunocytoma-like (""basophilic"") CLL, and a type of CLL with centrocyte-like lymphocytes (""B2-CLL""). B-CLL had no cytochemical profile of its own. The reproducibility of the diagnosis on imprints was 80%. In prolymphocytic leukemia of B type (B-PLL; n = 1) prolymphocytes and blast cells were plentiful. In the case studied, acid phosphatase activity was moderately strong (evident as granules distributed in a semicircular fashion and focally accumulated). In the blind test we diagnosed it only descriptively as an ""acid phosphatase-rich lymphoma of low-grade malignancy with a high prolymphocyte and blast cell content"". Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of T type (T-CLL) and prolymphocytic leukemia of T type (T-PLL) could not be distinguished with certainty in sections or imprints. There was also no strict delineation between T-CLL and T-PLL in blood smears. The T-CLL and T-PLL cases we evaluated (n = 4) belonged to the so-called helper cell type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Schwarze, E W']",['Schwarze EW'],['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Veroff Pathol,Veroffentlichungen aus der Pathologie,7504167,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/pathology', 'Sezary Syndrome/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Veroff Pathol. 1986;123:1-241.,Non-Hodgkin-Lymphome.

Presently, they are being applied in various in vitro diagnostic assays. They have contributed to the knowledge of cancer biology to a large extent. The understanding of cell surface characteristics and antigenic phenotype of tumours has in particular influenced the approach in the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. From successful tumour localization in patients by gamma-emitting radio-labelled MoAbs it became clear, that these proteins offer a unique possibility to target therapeutic agents to tumour sites. The mere administration of MoAbs did not result in sufficient clinical benefit, but with proper precautions high doses of murine antibody were well tolerated. In order to use MoAbs as a carrier system, various toxins, cytostatic drugs, or radionuclides have been conjugated to these proteins. Thus far, specific problems were encountered not only associated with the immunoconjugate itself, but also to its fate in the patient. With regard to the substantial knowledge on the use of MoAbs in vivo obtained from animal tumour models, immunoscintigraphy in patients, and phase I serotherapy trials, we will undoubtedly determine the optimal conditions required for a conjugated anti-tumour agent to achieve enhanced cytotoxicity without increased side-effects. Preliminary results with high doses of 131I-labelled MoAbs in patients having tumour lesions expressing relevant antigens encourage further studies with immunoconjugates in cancer treatment. While much work needs to be done to further define the role of MoAbs as a new treatment modality in malignancies, this area of immunotherapy deserves great emphasis for the development of effective conjugates for future patients.","['Boven, E', 'Pinedo, H M']","['Boven E', 'Pinedo HM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Toxins/immunology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-8140(86)80165-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-8140(86)80165-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 1986 Feb;5(2):109-17. doi: 10.1016/s0167-8140(86)80165-7.,,,,,,,74,,,

To determine the position of the gene encoding the alpha chain of the T-cell receptor and of the human protooncogene myc (c-myc) in relation to the breakpoint junctions and to evaluate their possible role in the pathogenesis of T-cell neoplasia, we applied the techniques of in situ chromosomal hybridization and Southern blot analysis to SKW-3 cells. Our results indicate that the breakpoint on chromosome 14 at band q11 occurs close to a joining sequence of the gene encoding the alpha chain of the T-cell receptor. Additional rearrangements within the alpha-chain locus appear to split the variable region cluster. As a result of the rearrangements, the constant region of this gene, as well as some variable region segments, are translocated to chromosome 8, to the 3' side of the c-myc-coding exons. The identification of a breakpoint to the 3' side of c-myc suggests that this translocation is analogous to the variant (2;8) and t(8;22) translocations observed in the B-cell malignancies.","['Shima, E A', 'Le Beau, M M', 'McKeithan, T W', 'Minowada, J', 'Showe, L C', 'Mak, T W', 'Minden, M D', 'Rowley, J D', 'Diaz, M O']","['Shima EA', 'Le Beau MM', 'McKeithan TW', 'Minowada J', 'Showe LC', 'Mak TW', 'Minden MD', 'Rowley JD', 'Diaz MO']",['eng'],['GM-32583/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.10.3439 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 May;83(10):3439-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.10.3439.,,,,PMC323530,,,,,,

The percentage of wells with anti-idiotype activity rose to 16-52% in tolerant male mice. The percentage of anti-idiotype hybrids generated was significantly lower in tolerant female mice. To accelerate the process of anti-idiotype development, a single intrasplenic immunization with soluble idiotype IgM was also evaluated. No anti-idiotype or anti-IgM secreting heterohybrids were formed out of nearly 1400 wells seeded in 3 separate fusions using soluble IgM.

A preliminary overview of preclinical and clinical studies.,85-105,"4-Demethoxydaunorubicin (4-DMDR, IMI 30, Idarubicin, NSC 256439) is a new analog of daunorubicin (DNR) with antileukemic activity in experimental systems that is superior to that of daunorubicin (DNR) or doxorubicin (DX). The drug is more potent than DNR and DX and is active by both the intravenous and the oral routes of administration. After i.v. and oral administration in humans, Idarubicin is rapidly metabolized to its 13-dihydroderivative (Idarubicinol) and the plasma levels of this metabolite are consistently higher than those of the unchanged drug. Idarubicinol has been shown to be an active metabolite in experimental models, being as potent and as active as the parent compound. Phase II clinical trials of Idarubicin have indicated that: By I.V. route Idarubicin is a potent antileukemic agent active in relapsed or refractory, ANLL, ALL (adult and pediatric) either as single agent or in combination with Ara-C at doses of 8-12 mg/m2 by i.v. day 1, 2 and 3 or 7-8 mg/m2 i.v. daily X 5 days (adults). There is evidence of lack of cross-resistance with parent drugs and other antileukemic agents. Phase III studies in previously untreated acute leukemias have been initiated. By oral route Idarubicin has antitumor activity in breast cancer at the doses of 35-45 mg/m2 q 3-4 weeks or 15 mg/m2 daily X 3 days q 3-4 weeks. Idarubicin has activity as a single agent in adult leukemias at the doses of 20-30 mg/m2/day X 3 days. The safety of administration (no risk of extravasation), the good tolerability and the reduced potential for cardiac toxicity, make oral Idarubicin particular attractive for further clinical development. Whether Idarubicin proves to be more effective and/or less cardiotoxic in clinical therapy than DNR or DX remains to be seen through prospective randomized studies which have been already initiated both in leukemias and solid tumors.","['Ganzina, F', 'Pacciarini, M A', 'Di Pietro, N']","['Ganzina F', 'Pacciarini MA', 'Di Pietro N']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00172021 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1986;4(1):85-105. doi: 10.1007/BF00172021.,,,,,,,64,,,

Each had received marrow from a haploidentical mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reactive donor after pretransplant conditioning with total body irradiation and high-dose cyclophosphamide. To minimize graft-vs-host disease, the marrow was depleted of T cells in vitro by treatment with a monoclonal anti-T-cell antibody and complement. Two weeks after each transplant, reactive lymphocytes were noted transiently in the blood of each patient. Analysis of karyotype, HLA type, and in vitro MLC responsiveness proved the lymphocytes to be of host, not donor, origin. MLC studies showed rapid proliferative responses specifically to stimulating cells from the BMT donor, indicating in vivo sensitization to donor antigens. Return of hematopoietic function was markedly delayed, but it eventually normalized after several months, without evidence of chimerism. These studies confirm that some immune and hematopoietic stem cells of host origin survive the high-dose chemoradiotherapy used as transplant conditioning. Because these immune cells are specifically reactive to donor alloantigens, more potent suppression of host immunity may be needed to prevent nonengraftment of T-cell-depleted, HLA-mismatched bone marrow.","['Sondel, P M', 'Hank, J A', 'Trigg, M E', 'Kohler, P C', 'Finlay, J L', 'Blank, J', 'Meisner, L', 'Borcherding, W', 'Hong, R', 'Steeves, R']","['Sondel PM', 'Hank JA', 'Trigg ME', 'Kohler PC', 'Finlay JL', 'Blank J', 'Meisner L', 'Borcherding W', 'Hong R', 'Steeves R', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['GM 07131/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA32685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*therapy', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 May;14(4):278-86.,,,,,,,,,,

There were no obvious differences in the morphologic, ultrastructural, and cytochemical characteristics of the CFU-F between the normals and the patients who received transplants. The number of stromal CFU-F cells in S phase was increased during the early period after transplantation, as demonstrated by a significant reduction of CFU-F growth after short exposure to hydroxyurea. However, the return to normal was rapid, within six weeks. The presence of graft-vs-host disease (greater than or equal to grade II) and the choice of immunosuppressive drug, i.e., methotrexate or cyclosporine, did not affect the CFU-F recovery.

The automatic interaction detector approach was used to determine the patient characteristics that correlated with MTX clearance. Characteristics examined were sex, age, estimated creatinine clearance, SGPT, and body surface area. The initial splits were based on creatinine clearance, and mean MTX clearances in three subgroups (50 to 100, 100 to 150, and greater than 150 ml/min/m2) were 73.1, 78.3, and 90.5 ml/min/m2, respectively.

In the latter subgroup, boys had faster clearance than girls (77.4 vs. 60.9 ml/min/m2). These results demonstrate that for children with normal serum creatinine concentrations, interpatient variability in MTX clearance can partly be explained by measures of renal and hepatic function, which indicates that the observed variability in MTX clearance is not totally random.","['Crom, W R', 'Glynn, A M', 'Abromowitch, M', 'Pui, C H', 'Dodge, R', 'Evans, W E']","['Crom WR', 'Glynn AM', 'Abromowitch M', 'Pui CH', 'Dodge R', 'Evans WE']",['eng'],"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,"['AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Computers', 'Creatinine/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/blood/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Sex Factors']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/clpt.1986.102 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 1986 May;39(5):592-7. doi: 10.1038/clpt.1986.102.,,,,,,,,,,

Control sera included immune sheep sera absorbed with the peptide, preimmune sheep sera and a goat polyclonal antibody to Rauscher leukemia virus p30. Neonatal BALB/c mice were injected with HaSV/Moloney leukemia virus (MoLV), MoLV alone or buffer. Short-term fixation in Bouin's fixative was found to be the most effective method for demonstrating p21 in fixed tissue sections. RasHa p21 was found in 5-80% of the induced sarcoma cells, depending on the tissue fixative and antibody dilution. The antigen was localized to the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. Tumors induced by NIH 3T3 cells transformed with cellular Ha-ras oncogenes had less than 1% immunoreactive tumor cells. Splenic erythroblasts in HaSV-induced erythroblastosis contained membrane antigen as did some reticular cells in lymph nodes draining the sarcomas. Normal tissues of virus-inoculated mice, uninoculated controls or fetuses and selected naturally occurring or induced liver tumors of mice, chemically induced skin tumors of mice, N-nitrosomethylurea-induced mammary tumors of rats, and naturally occurring tumors of F344/NCr rats did not contain immunoreactive p21. Thus, with the use of affinity purified IgG sheep polyclonal antibody to a peptide in RasHa p21, we were able to demonstrate RasHa p21 in tumors and other cells. The degree of immunoreactivity was related to the expected level of p21 expression.","['Ward, J M', 'Pardue, R L', 'Junker, J L', 'Takahashi, K', 'Shih, T Y', 'Weislow, O S']","['Ward JM', 'Pardue RL', 'Junker JL', 'Takahashi K', 'Shih TY', 'Weislow OS']",['eng'],['N01-CO-23910/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '1405-69-2 (Avidin)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Avidin', 'Biotin', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Harvey murine sarcoma virus', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/analysis', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/analysis/chemically induced', 'Methylnitrosourea', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*analysis', 'Sheep', 'Skin Neoplasms/analysis']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/7.4.645 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1986 Apr;7(4):645-51. doi: 10.1093/carcin/7.4.645.,,,,,,,,,,

Establishment of the dose-response curves for CFU-GM (n = 37), BFUe (n = 11), and myeloblastic CFU-L (n = 9) demonstrated a wide range of sensitivity from patient to patient for all three progenitors. Whereas CFU-L, CFU-GM, and BFU-e grown in semisolid cultures disclosed similar sensitivities to Asta Z 7557, long-term culture (LTC) studies (n = 41) indicated a higher resistance of early progenitors. In an effort to achieve a maximum tumor cell kill and yet spare a sufficient amount of normal stem cells to ensure consistent engraftment, we defined the optimal dose for marrow cleansing as the dose sparing 5% CFU-GM (LD95). This dose was established from a preincubation test (PIT) realized on a 10-mL marrow aspirate taken 15 days before marrow collection in each individual patient. Twenty-four adult patients while in remission of AL (20 in complete remission, four in partial remission) were consolidated by cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg X 2 and total body irradiation at 10 Gy followed by ABMT with marrow cleansed by Asta Z 7557 according to the specification described above. Patients were divided in two groups: group 1, unfavorable prognosis (11 patients); group 2, standard prognosis [13 patients in first complete remission (CR)]. All patients engrafted on leukocytes (median day for recovery to 10(9)/L: day 30), patients with ALL recovered faster than patients with ANL (median day 19 v 34). Similarly, recovery of platelets to 50.10(9)/L occurred sooner in patients with ALL (median day 67, range day 23 through 90) whereas three patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) in group 2 had to be supported with platelet transfusions for more than one year. In group 1, six patients had recurrent tumor within six months; three patients died from toxicity with no evidence of tumor. Two patients are still disease-free with a short follow-up (nine and ten months). In group 2, two patients died from toxicity with no evidence of leukemia three and 16 months post-ABMT. One patient with a M5 ANLL and one patient with ALL relapsed at six and 15 months, respectively.

Even with the marrow suppressive influence of methotrexate (MTX), the viability of the hematopoietic stem cells was not affected, as indicated by the normal repopulation after grafting in the evaluable patients. One patient (UPN 9) showed a primary graft failure, possibly resulting from persisting septicemia and long-term antibiotic therapy. Two patients have persistent host lymphocytes, one of whom was examined during relapse; the other remains in remission. Two patients did not receive immunosuppression after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) developed in both. Nine patients received MTX as immunosuppression following BMT. GVHD did not develop in any of them, but fatal infections in the immediate posttransplant period developed in five patients. Eleven patients received cyclosporine (CsA) after transplantation. Beginning in week 5 after BMT, CsA was gradually replaced by MTX. Acute GVHD, substantial chronic GVHD, or fatal infections did not develop in any of these patients. Removal of 98% of the lymphocytes by counterflow centrifugation prevents development of acute GVHD, provided that immunosuppression is administered after BMT.

Mitoses were identified as being of erythroid lineage by immunofluorescent staining for surface glycophorin A and as being of granulocytic lineage by cytoplasmic staining for Sudan black B. On direct marrow examination without prior culture, the great majority of mitoses (74% to 90%) were of erythroid lineage; only a few (0% to 10%) were granulocytic. After 24-hour culture, the percentage of erythroid mitoses (15% to 40%) decreased, while the percentage of granulocytic mitoses (58% to 87%) increased strikingly. These data indicate that mitotic cells of different hematopoietic cell lineages predominate in marrow at different culture times and offer a plausible explanation for the high frequency of normal karyotypes in acute myeloid leukemia after direct marrow cytogenetic evaluation.","['Keinanen, M', 'Knuutila, S', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Elonen, E', 'de la Chapelle, A']","['Keinanen M', 'Knuutila S', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Elonen E', 'de la Chapelle A']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '9YDL1Q990E (Sudan Black B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Azo Compounds', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glycophorins/analysis', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', '*Mitosis', 'Naphthalenes', 'Time Factors']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79840-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 May;67(5):1240-3.,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological studies of leukemia in occupational groups and in the general populations are reviewed. The results are inconsistent. In the few studies showing an association between exposure to electromagnetic fields and the risk of leukemia, the temporal relationship between exposure and effect was not established, the observed associations were weak, the dose-response relationships were based on qualitative levels of exposure without regard to the duration of exposure or secondary sources of exposure, and the risk ratios were probably biased due to the population selection procedures used and misclassification of exposure.

The corresponding one-year probabilities of developing interstitial pneumonia were 93%, 45% and 27%, respectively. Survivals after BMT in the first remission in ALL and ANL patients as well as in the chronic phase in CML were better than in the remaining conditions. On the basis of the high relapse rate in syngeneic BMT for acute leukemia, it was indicated that a more aggressive treatment schedule would be necessary before and after transplantation. Despite extensive disease in cases of malignant lymphoma (all clinical stages III and IV), 5-year survival was 36%. The present analysis indicated that changes in the selection of patients, e.g., those in the first remission without infection at the time of BMT, as well as low dose-rate fractionated TBI and selection of platelet donors with negative CMV titer, had resulted in a significant improvement of survival and a decreased incidence of interstitial pneumonia after BMT for leukemia in Japan.","['Inoue, T', 'Masaoka, T']","['Inoue T', 'Masaoka T']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

In both protocols, preventive therapy on the CNS consisted of cranial irradiation (24 Gy) and 5 doses of methotrexate i.t. (MTX). For the maintenance phase in protocol C2-72, three combinations: mercaptopurine (MP)-MTX, MP-Ara.C and MTX-cyclophosphamide, were sequentially administered for 3 years, with reinductions of PRED-VCR every three months. In protocol D-74, only MP-MTX was used for 3 years; the random half of the patients also received ""reinductions"".

Study variables included the recipients' current self-reported health status, mood state, social role function, self esteem, life satisfaction, and relationships with their BMT donors and other family members.

The subjects' current quality of relationship with their donors was highly correlated with many measures of their psychosocial status.

At low dose levels, such as those encountered in medical diagnosis, the magnitude of the effect is more difficult to quantify. Three reasons for this difficulty are (1) the effects in human populations are small compared with the natural incidence of cancer in the populations; (2) it is difficult to transfer results obtained in animal studies to the human experience; and (3) the effects of latency period and plateau increase the complexity of population studies. In spite of these difficulties, epidemiologic studies of human populations exposed to low levels of radiation still play a valuable role in the determination of radiation carcinogenecity. They serve to provide upper estimates of risk and to rule out the appearance of new effects that may be masked by the effects of high doses. While there is evidence for mutagenic effects of radiation in experimental animals, no conclusive human data exist at the present. It is not possible to rule out the presence of genetic effects of radiation in humans, however, because many problems exist with regard to the epidemiologic detection of small effects when the natural incidence is relatively large. In animals, subtle effects (eg, a decrease in the probability of survival from egg to adult) may occur with greater frequency than more dramatic disorders in irradiated populations. However, these types of genetic abnormalities are difficult to quantitate. Current risk estimates are based primarily upon data pertaining to dominant mutations in rodents. Some specific locus studies also permit identification of recessive mutation rates. The embryo and fetus are considered to be at greater risk for adverse effects of radiation than is the adult. This sensitivity was predicted in 1906 by the law of Bergonie and Tribondeau and has been demonstrated in human and animal populations. At high dose levels (above 15 rem), the effects of radiation depend upon the gestational stage at which irradiation occurs. Prior to the second week, the predominant effect is preimplantation death, while during the period of major organogenesis (second to sixth week), growth retardation and CNS abnormalities may be produced. These effects have not been demonstrated with a high degree of statistical significance at low dose levels (below 15 rem) and are not considered to present a serious hazard for patients undergoing radiologic exams.","['Ritenour, E R']",['Ritenour ER'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Nucl Med,Seminars in nuclear medicine,1264464,,IM,"['Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Fetus/radiation effects', 'Fluoroscopy/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mutation/*radiation effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0001-2998(86)80024-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0001-2998(86)80024-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Nucl Med. 1986 Apr;16(2):106-17. doi: 10.1016/s0001-2998(86)80024-1.,,,,,,,74,,,

With one exception, no acute infections (pneumonitis), as commonly seen before, were observed during the observation time of 24 to 68 weeks, and the pre-existing chronic infections (bronchitis, sinusitis etc.) remained compensated without antibiotics. In all four patients tolerance of the preparation was good. In all cases of hypogammaglobulinemia a dose-dependent increase in the serum IgG concentration was observed immediately after the infusion. However, persistence of the serum IgG increase showed considerable interindividual differences. The half life of the tetanus and HBs antibodies (21.7 to 34.4 and 19.7 to 25.7 days respectively) found in 4 healthy volunteers is within the biological range.

For analytical purposes, irradiated dogs were segregated into groups according to their clinical status: clinically normal, hypocellular, or with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. Since unirradiated control animals exhibited a wide range of NK responses, the data from each irradiated animal were compared to its own age-matched or litter-matched unirradiated control. Of the eight clinically normal irradiated dogs (median = 146% activity of control) only one animal had a NK activity lower than that of its control. The hypocellular group (n = 5, median = 21.8% of control) and the leukemic group (n = 4, median = 52.5% of control) each contained one responder with higher activity than its control.

These involve the administration of leukocyte-poor platelets and red cells or reducing a recipient's exposure to incompatible donor antigens by using single-donor pheresis products. The application of these approaches is limited by practical considerations of achieving sufficiently leukocyte-poor blood products to produce the desired effect, and by the availability and costs of pheresis products compared to pooled random donor platelet concentrates. Furthermore, in chronically transfused aplastic patients who are not receiving concurrent immunosuppressive chemotherapy, there is reason to believe that these transfusion programs may be less effective then in leukemic patients. Fortunately, newer insights into the pathways of antigen recognition have suggested other possible ways to prevent recipient recognition of transfused or transplanted donor tissues. Cyclosporin A specifically inhibits T cells that are central to immune recognition of foreign antigens, and thereby is a very effective immunosuppressive agent. Furthermore, a major pathway of immune recognition may involve direct stimulation of the recipient's T cells by APC in donor tissue; methods to eliminate these cells by physical removal, treatment with anti-Ia antisera, or inactivation with U-V light may represent major advances in preventing alloimmunization. In addition, there is evidence that HLA and B antigens may not be intrinsic to the platelet membrane, suggesting it may be possible to remove them before transfusion, thereby eliminating a major source of incompatability. Finally, as platelets do not express Class II MHC antigens on their surface, ""pure"" platelet transfusions may be not only non-immunogenic, but may actually induce tolerance to subsequent transfusions or transplants.","['Slichter, S J']",['Slichter SJ'],['eng'],"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dogs', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunization', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Isoantibodies/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/therapy', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Rabbits', 'Splenectomy', '*Transfusion Reaction']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1986;211:83-116.,,,,,,,91,,,

However, the effectiveness of conventional therapy regimens for most lymphomas and the high incidence of severe transplant-related complications usually limit allogeneic transplantation to lymphoma patients in situations other than consolidation of first remission. Initial partial remission, early relapse from an initial remission, and perhaps second remission are situations in which conventional therapy is often ineffective, but the adverse features of very advanced lymphoma are not present; marrow transplantation may be considered in eligible patients.

We have previously described a mutant mouse cell line which had been selected for loss of the class I thymus leukemia (TL) antigen and had concomitantly lost surface expression of H-2k antigens. Expression of class I antigens on the cell surface was restored by fusion to an antigenically distinct mouse lymphoma line, and the defect in the mutant was shown to be the loss of a functional beta 2-microglobulin gene. We now describe three additional mutants with the same phenotype, all selected for loss of TL but after different types of mutagenesis. All of these mutants have genomic rearrangements resulting in the absence of a functional beta 2-microglobulin gene. These data provide strong evidence for the requirement of beta 2-microglobulin for cell surface expression of the heavy chain of class I major histocompatibility complex proteins. We further show that the defects in at least one beta 2-microglobulin gene in each mutant cell line map to the same small DNA segment within the first intron.

Not surprisingly, chemical mechanisms have been evolved by many organisms that permit them to solubilize and acquire iron while at the same time depriving their competitors or their pathogens of this element. Proteins such as transferrin and lactoferrin that are employed by vertebrate hosts for iron transport and acquisition can, to some extent, withhold the metal from the siderophores of invading bacteria and fungi. Attempts also are made by animal hosts to withhold iron from protozoa and neoplastic cells. Unfortunately, pathogenic microorganisms have developed a variety of counter measures that are especially dangerous in hosts stressed by iron overload in specific fluids, tissues, or cells. In recent years, however, a number of possible methods and agents for strengthening iron-withholding defense have become apparent.

During the past 14 years, 135 adults (greater than 15 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been treated with one of three successive multidrug-intensive treatment protocols (L2, L10/10M, and L17/17M), each calling for 2.5 to 3 years of systemic chemotherapy and prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate without cranial irradiation. The complete remission (CR) rates were L2 (n = 22) = 77%; L10/10M (n = 69) = 86%; L17/17M (n = 44) = 77%. The median durations of survival and remission were, respectively, L2 = 33 and 30 months; L10/10M = 62 months and not reached; and L17/17M = not reached. Almost all relapses occurred within the first 3 years while still continuing treatment, and there were only rate late relapses after stopping treatment. It appears that approximately half of the patients may have been cured with the latest two protocols. During the last 17 years, 494 adults aged 15 to greater than 70 with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) were treated with one of five successive multiple drug treatment protocols of varying intensity (arabinosylcytosine + 6-thioguanine [n = 36]; L6 [n = 101]; L12 [n = 104]; L14/14M [n = 121]; and L16/16M [n = 132]). Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes generally were not treated until they developed acute leukemia, but were then entered and included in the results. Secondary leukemias following treatment of other neoplastic diseases were not included. The complete remission rates were fairly constant between 47 and 64% and the median durations of remissions were between 9 and 21 months. The intensive treatment L14 and L16 protocols were associated with more early deaths and did not result in a significantly improved remission incidence or duration or survival. With all protocols, the majority of relapses occurred within the first 2 years, but relapses continued to occur at a decreasing rate for 4 years and occasionally even later. Whereas a small fraction (approximately 10 to 15%) of adults with ANLL are now apparently being cured with combination chemotherapy, despite intensive efforts there has been little improvement during the last decade and more selective and effective forms of treatment are urgently needed.","['Clarkson, B D', 'Gee, T', 'Arlin, Z A', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Kempin, S J', 'Dinsmore, R E', ""O'Reilly, R J"", 'Andreeff, M', 'Berman, E', 'Little, C']","['Clarkson BD', 'Gee T', 'Arlin ZA', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Kempin SJ', 'Dinsmore RE', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Andreeff M', 'Berman E', 'Little C', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(86)80013-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(86)80013-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1986;4(3):221-48. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(86)80013-0.,,,,,,,68,,,

This ""preleukemic"" hemopathy was increasingly reported anecdotally and through careful retrospective analyses. In more recent prospective studies, this syndrome has been relatively well defined. Indeed, it is widely accepted that there exists a hematopoietic abnormality not recognizable as classical, overt, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, which, nonetheless, can represent an early phase of leukemia. In this manuscript, the author reviews the original case reports, the initial retrospective studies, and the prospective studies which have clarified some of the clinical and laboratory features of the preleukemic syndrome. The notion that the preleukemic syndrome represents an established neoplastic process will be reviewed with special attention to assessment of clonal hematopoiesis, cytogenetic studies, and clonal evolution. Studies on induced leukemia and preleukemia in experimental animals and humans will be reviewed as will be the semantic issues which have complicated our ability to compare interinstitutional studies. A simple classification scheme of the myelodysplastic syndromes will be presented as will be a framework agenda for future studies on the pathophysiology of these syndromes.","['Bagby, G C Jr']",['Bagby GC Jr'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dogs', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification', 'Preleukemia/blood/etiology/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Semantics']",1986/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(86)80012-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(86)80012-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1986;4(3):203-20. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(86)80012-9.,,,,,,,123,,,

RNA was extracted from the cell supernatants of Ehrlich ascites tumor and sarcoma 180 cells (nonleukemic) that had been treated or not treated with pronase (1 microgram/ml, 37 degrees C, 20 min) followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. It was clearly demonstrated that the amounts of ribosomal RNA (18S and 28S) released after pronase treatment were approximately 80% greater than that of nonpronase-treated cells. Ehrlich ascites tumor cells that had been treated with actinomycin D (100 micrograms/kg body weight of mouse, 16 h) in vivo released an amount of ribosomal RNA after pronase treatment only 20% greater than the value for untreated cells. Actinomycin D treatment greatly reduced both the cell surface negative charge and the cell surface immunofluorescence when rabbit anti-RNA antibody was used. Under the same experimental conditions with actinomycin D, only ribosomal RNA synthesis showed preferential inhibition, not the syntheses of poly A-containing messenger RNA, 4S or other small-size RNAs. In contrast, L1210 and C1498 cells (leukemic) showed no change in the amounts of ribosomal RNA released after pronase treatment.

The effect X-irradiation with 4 Gy was mainly a cytostatic one leading to an altered distribution of the cells throughout the cycle due to radiation induced mitotic delay. The cytocidal effect is negligible. As is known from previous studies (Fietkau, Friede & Maurer-Schultze, 1984) the effect of 200 mg/kg Ara-C consists of an inhibition of DNA synthesis and of killing a considerable portion of the L 1210 cells, predominantly of S phase cells. With respect to the importance for potential therapeutic regimens, the influence of the sequence and the time interval between the two therapeutic steps on the survival of tumour-bearing mice was studied. Most combination therapies significantly increase the survival of tumour-bearing mice compared to the single therapeutic steps; however, no significant differences between the various combined therapies were found. Whole-body X-irradiation with 4 Gy followed by the application of 200 mg/kg Ara-C 10 hr later resulted in the greatest increase of the mean survival time of tumour-bearing animals, from 13.2 to 17.4 days. It was shown that apart from the cytocidal effect on S-phase cells, Ara-C also kills cells sublethally damaged by a preceding X-irradiation.","['Fietkau, R', 'Maurer-Schultze, B']","['Fietkau R', 'Maurer-Schultze B']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Tissue Kinet,Cell and tissue kinetics,0174107,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Division/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interphase/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Mitotic Index', 'Necrosis', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1986.tb00718.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Kinet. 1986 Jan;19(1):93-107. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1986.tb00718.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Patients did not receive posttransplant immunosuppression and were followed a median of nine months (range, 5-17). Prompt engraftment was sustained in 12 patients with a median time of 16 days (range, 10 to 63) to achieve 500 neutrophils/mm3.

At the cell surface in many cases of B cell malignant disease, products of the different class II subregion genes are non-coordinately expressed. The most commonly occurring pattern of non-coordinate expression of class II molecules is of expression of DP and DR antigens in the absence of detectable DQ expression. These findings are in contrast to normal B lymphocytes where DP, DQ and DR antigens are expressed together at the cell surface. There is considerable heterogeneity among cases comprising individual histopathological categories of B cell malignancy, and in many instances heterogeneous class II phenotypes are also found on cells from the same tumour. In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, class II antigen expression is inducible in vitro by treating the cells with the phorbol ester TPA. CLL cells treated with TPA have much increased levels of class II antigen expression at the cell surface and much increased steady state levels of class II specific mRNA transcripts detectable with complementary DNA probes. Aberrant class II antigen expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of B cell malignant disease.","['Guy, K', 'Krajewski, A S', 'Dewar, A E']","['Guy K', 'Krajewski AS', 'Dewar AE']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1986.31 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1986 Feb;53(2):161-73. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1986.31.,,,,PMC2001345,,,67,,,

The findings were compared with those in samples from normal individuals and from conventionally treated leukemic patients. The thymuses were hyperinvoluted in all grafted and nongrafted subjects. The remnants were composed of subcapsular and medullary epithelium which expressed the same phenotype as the normal thymus controls. Most samples also contained small remnants of cortical epithelium which lacked normal expression of HLA-DR antigens. The intraepithelial and stromal thymic lymphocytes were virtually all mature T cells, and no immature cortical thymocytes were seen. With the use of HLA-typing methods in 2 recipients of one-haplotype-matched grafts no donor cells could be identified in any of the thymic components.

We studied whether abnormalities in peripheral blood T cell parameters were present in 15 untreated early stage CLL patients (ie, Rai stage 0, 1, 2). Seven of the nine patients showed decreased T helper support as compared to control T cells for pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced control B cell proliferation (ie, patient 6,063 +/- 1,434 cpm vs control 14,894 +/- 121 cpm). All stage 0 and 1 patients showed a marked impairment of T helper activity for control B cell proliferation (patient T = 7,752 +/- 1,137 cpm vs control T = 14,894 +/- 121 cpm). In a separate assay system, six of nine CLL patients showed T suppressor activity for control B cell proliferation greater than control T cell suppressor activity. Four patients were stage 0 and 1. CLL patients demonstrated markedly impaired T cell support for control B cell immunoglobulin synthesis compared to control T cells (188 +/- 28 vs 869 +/- 56 hemolytic plaque-forming cells (HePFC)/culture, respectively). Control T cells showed increasing support for control B cell immunoglobulin synthesis with increasing T:B cell ratios (869 +/- 56 vs 1,265 +/- 48 HePFC/culture, at 1:1 and 2:1 T:B cell ratios, respectively). In contrast, five of eight CLL patients' T cells showed no improvement in control B cell immunoglobulin synthesis with increasing T:B cell ratios (795 +/- 56 vs 569 +/- 48 HePFC/culture, at 1:1 and 2:1 T:B cell ratios, respectively). There was no direct correlation with CLL T cell-mediated suppression of B cell proliferation and suppression of B cell immunoglobulin synthesis. These studies suggest there is a complex array of abnormal immunoregulatory T cell function in early stage CLL. These include a prominent T helper dysfunction and more variable excessive suppressor activity. The relationship of these findings to the basic disease process remains to be elucidated.","['Perri, R T', 'Kay, N E']","['Perri RT', 'Kay NE']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Antibody-Producing Cells', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/physiopathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830220109 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1986 May;22(1):55-61. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830220109.,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to improve results obtained with HU alone, from 1978 to 1981, 47 new patients entered a second trial (Study II), which consisted of a continuous treatment with a combination of HU and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), at doses adjusted so as to maintain the leukocyte counts between 4 and 12 X 10(9)/L. The aim of this second study was to prolong the duration of chronic phase (CP) by the addition of 6-MP to HU and by a stricter continuous control of the size of the total granulocytic mass (TGM). Both regimens were well tolerated. Median duration of CP was 43 months in Study I and 41 months in Study II. Median survival was 51.5 months and 45 months respectively.

In this report, we used bacteria-free AKR (H-2k) mice bearing advanced spontaneous T cell leukemia/lymphoma as a moel to evaluate the GVH and GVL effects of bone marrow transplantation using fully incompatible SJL (H-2s) donors. A therapeutic GVL effect, accompanied by increased leukemia-free survival, was obtained only when 0.5 X 10(6) allogeneic lymphocytes (lymph node cells) were added to the marrow inoculum. Transplantation of allogeneic bone marrow without added lymph node cells (or use of syngeneic cells) resulted in a significant increase in leukemia relapse; increasing the dose of allogeneic lymph node cells to 2.0 X 10(6) resulted in significantly higher GVH-associated mortality. Survival and therapeutic benefits were obtained only when the intensity of the GVH reaction was carefully controlled by manipulation of alloreactive lymphocytes present in the marrow. These results suggest, indirectly, that T cell depletion may abolish any GVL effect of marrow transplantation, even if the donor is mismatched with the host at the major histocompatibility complex. The frequency in the spleen of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) reactive against host alloantigens was estimated using limiting-dilution microcytotoxicity assays at various times after transplantation of allogeneic bone marrow with and without added lymph node cells. The average frequency of CTL was highest in mice that were given marrow plus lymph node cells and tested within the first four weeks after transplantation. The level of CTL activity measured in vitro was dependent on the dose of lymphocytes injected and correlated with both the GVL and GVH effects in vivo. Down-regulation of CTL activity against host, but not third-party, alloantigens in vitro was observed under limiting dilution assay conditions, leading to the suggestion that host-specific regulatory cells may be present in these allogeneic bone marrow chimeras.","['Truitt, R L', 'Shih, C C', 'LeFever, A V']","['Truitt RL', 'Shih CC', 'LeFever AV']",['eng'],"['CA-18440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26245/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology/prevention & control', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-198603000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1986 Mar;41(3):301-10. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198603000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,
