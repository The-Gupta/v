In this study, we observed an unexpected cross-resistance between the podophyllotoxine derivative etoposide (VP) and the nucleoside analogue cladribine (CdA) in CCRF-CEM cells developed for resistance to VP. The resistant cells also displayed 14- and twofold resistance to cytarabine (ara-C) and gemcitabine respectively. Closer analysis of these cells showed that they contained lower amounts of topoisomerase (topo) IIalpha (P < 0.001) and beta protein (P < 0.026), formed substantially lower amounts of the topo II-DNA complex, and had a markedly decreased level of Fas (CD95/APO-1)-ligand mRNA expression. Interestingly, Fas expression in the resistant cells did not differ from that in the parental cell line. No differences were observed in the accumulation/efflux of daunorubicin or in the gene expressions of P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein and the lung resistance-related protein. The activity of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), responsible for activation of CdA and ara-C, was the same for resistant and wild-type cells. However, there was an increase in the activity of the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidases (5'-NT), responsible for deactivation of nucleotides, amounting to 206% (P < 0.001) for the high Km and 134% (P < 0.331) for the low Km 5'-NT in resistant cells. The high Km 5'-NT is probably responsible for the decreased amount of the active metabolite CdA 5'-triphosphate [40% decreased (P < 0.045)], as well as for other purine ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides triphosphates in the resistant cells. In contrast, a significantly higher deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) level (167%, P < 0.001) was observed in the resistant cells. Thus, this study suggests that the major cause of resistance to the nucleoside analogues CdA and ara-C in cells selected for resistance to VP is a result of metabolic alterations producing increased activity of 5'-NT and higher dCTP levels. Furthermore, these results indicate that there is a common factor in the regulation of nucleotide-degrading enzymes and DNA topoisomerases, which may be altered in cross-resistant cells.","['Lotfi, K', 'Mansson, E', 'Chandra, J', 'Wang, Y', 'Xu, D', 'Knaust, E', 'Spasokoukotskaja, T', 'Liliemark, E', 'Eriksson, S', 'Albertioni, F']","['Lotfi K', 'Mansson E', 'Chandra J', 'Wang Y', 'Xu D', 'Knaust E', 'Spasokoukotskaja T', 'Liliemark E', 'Eriksson S', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Medicine and Care, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping, Sweden. koulo@imv.liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/metabolism"", 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', '*Cladribine', 'Cytarabine', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Microbial', '*Etoposide', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics']",2001/06/14 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/06/14 10:00'],"['2001/06/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/06/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2751 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02751.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 May;113(2):339-46. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02751.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also investigated the possible relationship between CALC1 methylation status and expression of the cell cycle inhibitor gene p57KIP2. We observed CALC1 hypermethylation in bone marrow cells from 43% (45 out of 105) of ALL patients. Clinical, molecular and laboratory features did not differ significantly between hypermethylated and hypomethylated patients, only T-cell lineage was associated with hypermethylation (14% vs. 47%, P = 0025). Complete remission rate was similar in both groups although hypermethylated patients had a higher relapse rate (68% vs. 19%, P < 0.00001) and mortality rate (55% vs. 36%, P = 0.06) than hypomethylated patients. Estimated disease-free survival (DFS) at 6 years was 66.1% for hypomethylated patients and 5.3% for hypermethylated patients (P < 0,00001). Multivariate analysis from potential prognostic factors demonstrated that CALC1 methylation status was an independent prognostic factor in predicting DFS (P = 0.0001). Separate analysis of adult and childhood ALL patients showed similar results to the whole series. In addition, hypermethylated patients showed downregulation of p57KIP2 expression. Our results suggest that CALC1 gene hypermethylation is associated with an enhanced risk of relapse independently of known poor-prognostic factors and we describe, for the first time, a possible implication of the p57KIP2 gene in the genesis and prognosis of ALL.","['Roman, J', 'Castillejo, J A', 'Jimenez, A', 'Bornstein, R', 'Gonzalez, M G', 'del Carmen Rodriguez, M', 'Barrios, M', 'Maldonado, J', 'Torres, A']","['Roman J', 'Castillejo JA', 'Jimenez A', 'Bornstein R', 'Gonzalez MG', 'del Carmen Rodriguez M', 'Barrios M', 'Maldonado J', 'Torres A']","['Department of Haematology, Reina Sofia Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CDKN1C protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Calcitonin/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2764 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02764.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 May;113(2):329-38. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02764.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median time to relapse for the group was 27 months. At diagnosis, the incidence of p16 homozygous and hemizygous deletion in this group was 32% and 20% respectively. The incidence of homozygous p16 deletion at relapse was 64%. A large number of patients, eight of 16 (50%), developed p16 homozygous deletion at relapse. Of those eight patients, four were hemizygous and four were germline at diagnosis.

By applying a previously described multiplex polymerase chain reaction, the overall incidence of non-deleted TCR-delta gene rearrangements in ALL was 47% (206/438), 52% in initial ALL (58/112) and 45% in relapsed ALL (148/326). As expected, the majority of B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL had incomplete Vdelta2-Ddelta3 or Ddelta2-Ddelta3 TCR-delta gene rearrangements, whereas most T-ALL showed complete rearrangements of the TCR-delta gene locus (Vdelta1-Jdelta1, Vdelta2-Jdelta1, Vdelta3-Jdelta1). However, unexpectedly, 5/206 rearranged TCR-delta alleles in BCP-ALL showed a complete Vdelta-(Ddelta)-Jdelta gene rearrangement pattern, and 3/31 T-ALL had an incomplete recombination. Theoretically, complete TCR-delta gene rearrangements should not occur in cells other than T-lymphocytes and have only been reported once previously in BCP-ALL.

However, aberrations are detected in only two thirds of AML cases at diagnosis and recurrent balanced translocations in only 50%. Spectral karyotyping (SKY) enables simultaneous visualization of all human chromosomes in different colours, facilitating the comprehensive evaluation of chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, SKY was used to characterize 37 cases of newly diagnosed AML-M2, previously analysed using G-banding. In 15/23 patients it was possible to obtain metaphases from viably frozen cells; in 22 additional cases, fixed-cell suspensions were used. Of the 70 chromosomal aberrations identified by SKY, 30 aberrations were detected for the first time, 18 aberrations were redefined and 22 were confirmed. SKY detected two reciprocal translocations, t(X;3) and t(11;19). In five cases, eight structural aberrations resulted in partial gains of chromosome 21, six of which were undetected by G-banding. In 4/5 cases, these resulted in copy number increases for AML1. Amplification of MYC was detected in three cases. Using SKY and FISH, clonal aberrations were identified in 5/18 cases with a presumed normal karyotype; 3/5 aberrations were of known unfavourable prognostic significance.

The in vitro angiogenic potential of culture supernatant of AML cells was assessed using endothelial cell (EC) migration and proliferation assays. Increased EC migration and EC proliferation was induced in 7/20 and 19/20 AML supernatents respectively. The degree of in vivo neovascularization did not correlate with the ability of AML cells to stimulate in vitro endothelial cell migration and/or proliferation. This might be in part a result of the heterogeneous pattern of angiogenic factors produced by AML cells. The expression of different angiogenic factors was studied using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cells from 17/20 AML patients showed wide variation in spontaneous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, 4/19 expressed varied spontaneous blastic fibroblast growth factor mRNA levels and all patient samples showed spontaneous interleukin 8 mRNA expression. All AML samples expressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and/or MMP-9. VEGF mRNA expression correlated well with protein level (P = 0.006). A correlation was found between the degree of VEGF expression and neoangiogenesis (correlation coefficient = 0.448, P = 0.05).

Phospholipases are stimulated following the activation of the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) in mast cells. To study the biochemical sequelae that lead to degranulation, broken cell systems were employed. We demonstrate that the addition of three distinct types of exogenous phospholipases (i.e., bcPLC, scPLD, and tfPLA(2)), all of which hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine (PC), trigger degranulation in permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells, a mucosal mast cell line. Production of bioactive lipids by these phospholipases promotes release of granule contents through the plasma membrane and acts downstream of PKC, PIP(2), and Rho subfamily GTPases in regulated secretion. These exogenous phospholipase-induced degranulation pathways circumvent specific factors activated following stimulation of the IgE receptor as well as in ATP- and GTP-dependent intracellular pathways. Taken together, these results suggest that regulated secretion may be achieved in vitro in the absence of cytosolic factors via phospholipase activation and that products of PC hydrolysis can promote exocytosis in mast cells.","['Cohen, J S', 'Brown, H A']","['Cohen JS', 'Brown HA']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Veterinary Medical Center, and Field of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853-6401, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (toxB protein, Clostridium difficile)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacillus cereus/enzymology', '*Bacterial Proteins', 'Bacterial Toxins/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/metabolism', 'Clostridioides difficile/physiology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Phospholipase D/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Streptomyces/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['bi0103011 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0103011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2001 Jun 5;40(22):6589-97. doi: 10.1021/bi0103011.,['GM58516/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of its localization within a region that is commonly deleted in patients with myeloid malignancies and because of the implication of its protein product in cell cycle control (DNA replication) and regulation of gene expression (transcriptional silencing), ORC5L appeared to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene for myeloid disorders associated with 7q22 deletions. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing analysis of the coding region of the remaining ORC5L allele has not revealed any mutations in nine patients with AML or MDS exhibiting 7q22 deletions. Allelic expression analysis indicates that ORC5L is not imprinted. These data suggest that ORC5L does not function as a tumor suppressor in patients with myeloid neoplasms.","['Frohling, S', 'Nakabayashi, K', 'Scherer, S W', 'Dohner, H', 'Dohner, K']","['Frohling S', 'Nakabayashi K', 'Scherer SW', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K']","['Abteilung Innere Medizin III, Medizinische Universitatsklinik und Poliklinik, Universitat, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ORC5 protein, human)', '0 (Origin Recognition Complex)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Origin Recognition Complex']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004390100498 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genet. 2001 Apr;108(4):304-9. doi: 10.1007/s004390100498.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this work was to study the effect of hydrogen peroxide in DOX-sensitive mouse P388/S leukemia cells and in the DOX-resistant cell line. Hydrogen peroxide induced a significant increase in dose- and time-response cell death in cultured P388/S cells. The degree of cell death in P388/DOX cells induced by hydrogen peroxide was less than that in P388/S cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. Parent cells exposed to 3 mM of hydrogen peroxide showed a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential correlated with cell death. Hydrogen peroxide at a concentration greater than 0.3 mM increased the intracellular Ca2+ of P388/S cells dose-dependently; however, no change following addition of hydrogen peroxide (0.3-1 mM) was observed in the resistant cells. Hydrogen peroxide (0.1 and 1 mM) treatment also induced the production of intracellular ROS in P388/S cells, while no such increase was produced by this substance in P388/DOX cells. Resistant cells also showed a significant level of glutathione (GSH) compared with the parent cells. In addition, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and reduced GSH antioxidants abolished death of P388/S cells caused by hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, it is believed that the reduced effect of oxidative stress towards the resistant cells may be related to an increase in intracellular GSH level.","['Furusawa, S', 'Kimura, E', 'Kisara, S', 'Nakano, S', 'Murata, R', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Sakaguchi, S', 'Takayanagi, M', 'Takayanagi, Y', 'Sasaki, K']","['Furusawa S', 'Kimura E', 'Kisara S', 'Nakano S', 'Murata R', 'Tanaka Y', 'Sakaguchi S', 'Takayanagi M', 'Takayanagi Y', 'Sasaki K']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Cancer Research Institute, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan. furusawa@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutathione/physiology', 'Mice', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.24.474 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2001 May;24(5):474-9. doi: 10.1248/bpb.24.474.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The symptoms were life-threatening in seven patients: acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage from oesophageal varices in four, an acute abdominal catastrophy owing to mesenteric vein thrombosis with intestinal gangrene in two, and a large cerebral infarction, which was lethal, in one. The same patient also suffered a thrombosis of the axillary and subclavian veins. Neurological symptoms, with headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, and impaired memory, were initial cardinal symptoms. In two patients, explorative laparotomy was performed with intestinal resection owing to gangrene. One patient had a toe amputation. DISCUSSION: The above symptoms are explained by thrombosis in the microcirculation because of thrombocytosis and circulating platelet aggregates. In patients with polycythaemia vera, the elevated haematocrit contributes significantly to the impaired microcirculation. Early diagnosis and management of these disorders are of utmost importance to prevent the potentially life-threatening complications described above.","['Hasselbalch, H C', 'Mourits-Andersen, H T', 'Jensen, B A', 'Jensen, M K', 'Nielsen, O J']","['Hasselbalch HC', 'Mourits-Andersen HT', 'Jensen BA', 'Jensen MK', 'Nielsen OJ']","['H:S Rigshospitalet, haematologisk afdeling L.']",['dan'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Critical Illness', 'Emergencies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/blood/*complications/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation', 'Middle Aged', 'Venous Thrombosis/blood/*etiology/physiopathology']",2001/05/31 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/05/31 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/31 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2001 Apr 30;163(18):2478-81.,,,,,Akut trombotisk komplikation ved debut af det Philadelphia-kromosom-negative myeloproliferative syndrom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The progenitors are hypersensitive to various growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor 1, which inhibits apoptosis in erythroid and myeloid progenitor cells. No change has been found in the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor. Thrombopoietin (Tpo) regulates the production of haematopoietic progenitor cells, particularly of platelets. By inhibiting apoptosis, this growth factor may be responsible for the autonomous proliferation of the megakaryocyte cell lineage in PV and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), which are featured by highly elevated circulating Tpo levels. Thrombopoietin may also be involved in the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis and development of extramedullary haematopoiesis. Both fibrogenesis and angiogenesis in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver develop secondary to the release of various growth-promoting factors from the megakaryocyte cell lineage. The lesion of the pluripotent stem cell in PV and IMF seems to imply several defects, including lack of or decreased expression of the Tpo receptor, alterations in the sensitivity of progenitor cells to various growth factors, and alterations in important gene systems (Bcl-2), which govern cell survival.

As PCR primers were chosen annealing in the introns flanking the exon region, following sequencing of the encompassing introns identified 5 base substitutions at various sites in intron 7. Two of them have been described previously [1] and 3 novel polymorphisms could be identified. To determine whether these polymorphisms are linked to the pathogenesis of AML, we screened peripheral blood specimens of 26 healthy controls. We found identical base substitutions in 6 out of 26 controls. Our data suggest that these polymorphisms are not related to the pathogenesis of AML.","['Graf, J', 'Merk, B', 'Maurer, U', 'Muller, E', 'Bergmann, L']","['Graf J', 'Merk B', 'Maurer U', 'Muller E', 'Bergmann L']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2001/05/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001211 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190109060356 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 May;41(5-6):655-8. doi: 10.3109/10428190109060356.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Triple labeling method to measure ROS, DeltaPsim and glutathione coupled with multilaser excitation flow cytometry showed that induction of ROS took place before the loss of mitochondrial permeability transition and depletion of glutathione. Correlated two parameter plots of glutathione content versus DeltaPsim showed that loss of DeltaPsim and depletion of glutathione closely follows each other. Translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane was the final step in the process before the cells became apoptotic.

Here we characterized splenic lymphomas in an human T lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) endemic area of Japan. To assess the pattern of splenic involvement and evaluate prognosis, we reviewed 27 specimens consisting of 26 splenectomies and one necropsy, which were classified using REAL classification. Cases were divided into primary splenic lymphoma in 11 patients and secondary in 16 patients. The incidence of primary splenic lymphoma was 0.3% (11 of approximately 4,000 malignant lymphomas). Primary splenic lymphomas included 7 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBL), 2 follicular lymphomas (FL), and 1 each of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Secondary splenic lymphomas included 6 DLBL, 4 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 2 FL, 2 Hodgkin's disease (HD), 1 each of hairy cell leukemia and ALCL. Gross examination showed two patterns of splenic involvement; solid type (formation of large nodular mass, n=16) and disseminated type (multiple nodules with diffuse infiltration but no large nodular formation, n=10). The type could not be determined in one case. Most solid types were DLBL or FL, while MCL was of the disseminated type. Immunohistochemistry showed all but each 2 cases of ALCL and HD were of B lineage. Follow-up of 26 patients indicated that all but one patient with primary lymphoma were still alive (range, 1-89 months) and 8 of 15 patients with secondary lymphomas died due to the progression of malignant lymphoma; the survival rate at 2 years was 50% in these patients. No elevation of anti-HTLV-I antibody was found. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) showed no reactivity of lymphoma cells, although a few small lymphocytes were positive for EBV. Hepatitis C virus was observed in 6 of 20 (30%) patients examined and 4 of 11 (36%) cases of primary splenic lymphoma.

Despite the high response rate, their influence on survival is still uncertain. The aim of this study was a retrospective analysis and comparison of the response rate and survival of CLL patients treated with high dose chlorambucil (HDChl) as first and 2-CdA as second line, with an historical group of patients never treated with purine analogs who received standard doses of chlorambucil (SDChl). We analyzed 347 patients with CLL treated between January 1985 and January 2000. Group A (190 patients) received HDChl (12 mg/m(2) ) with prednisone (P) 30 mg/m(2) daily for 7 days monthly as first line and in refractory or early relapsed patients 2-CdA (0.12 mg/kg/day) for 5 days with or without P (30mg/m(2) ) as second line. Group B (157 patients) received continuous SDChl (4-8 mg/m(2) /day) and P as first line and COP or CHOP as second line. The overall response rate (OR) for the first line was 48,4% in group A and 38,9% in group B (p=0.09). 148 patients in group A and 52 in group B received the second line treatment and the second OR was 19.6% and 13.5%, respectively (p=0.4). At the time of analysis, 124 patients died in group A and 139 in group B. Median survival was 65 months and 50 months, respectively.

Following transduction of the mutant c-kit cDNAs, MO7e cells acquire a growth advantage and resistance to apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation, in addition to cytokine-independent survival. Although stimulation of mutant c-kit-bearing MO7e cells with stem cell factor (SCF), a ligand for c-Kit, does not have a significant effect on cell proliferation, SCF further inhibits apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents.

Forty-five adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) received a total of 68 courses of sequential continuous infusion of fludarabine for 2 days (total dose 71.5 mg/m(2) ) followed by 3 days of ara-C (total dose 7590 mg/m(2) ). Thirty-nine patients had refractory or recurrent disease, and six had other adverse prognostic features. Thirty-six patients had AML, seven had ALL, and two had CML in blastic phase. Complete remission was seen in 20 patients (44%), and partial remission in 5 patients (11%), giving a total response rate of 56%, similar for both AML and ALL. Duration of response to prior therapy did not affect the response rate. All 3 patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL obtained complete remission. Median remission duration was 4.7 months (range 0.6-36.6), and median overall survival was 5.0 months (0.7-40+). Median overall survival was 10.1 months in responders. Pulmonary toxicity was seen in 8 patients, of whom 2 died from adult respiratory distress syndrome. No cardiac toxicity was observed, but 3 patients had transient cerebellar toxicity. Profound myelosuppression was seen in all patients. We conclude that the sequential infusion of fludarabine and ara-C is an effective non-cardiotoxic regimen for adults with refractory, recurrent or poor prognosis acute leukemia, may be particularly useful for resistant Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL, and may warrant further investigation in this subset. Pulmonary rather than neurological toxicity may be a unique side effect of the regimen.","['Vidarsson, B', 'Abonour, R', 'Williams, E C', 'Woodson, R D', 'Turman, N J', 'Kim, K', 'Mosher, D F', 'Wiersma, S R', 'Longo, W L']","['Vidarsson B', 'Abonour R', 'Williams EC', 'Woodson RD', 'Turman NJ', 'Kim K', 'Mosher DF', 'Wiersma SR', 'Longo WL']","['University of Wisconsin Hospital & Clinics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Madison, Wisconsin 53792, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Infusion Pumps', 'Leukemia/*complications/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Lung Diseases/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001181 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190109057986 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Apr;41(3-4):321-31. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057986.,['CA 14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients in early chronic phase CML were treated with IFN-alpha at 5MU/m(2) daily. Patients who did not achieve cytogenetic response after 6 months of IFN-alpha therapy, or Ph-suppression to less than 35% Ph-positive cells (partial cytogenetic response) after 12 months of therapy were offered cyclic intensive chemotherapy every 6 months, with IFN-alpha maintenance between cycles. The initial 3 cycles included daunorubicin, vincristine, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and prednisone (DOAP). Later cycles were given with cyclophosphamide replacing daunorubicin (COAP). Of 74 patients treated, 61 (82%) achieved complete hematologic response (CHR): 51 (69%) had a cytogenetic response, which was major (Ph < 35%) in 31 (42%), and complete in 23 (31%). Fifty-five patients (74%) achieved CHR by 6 months of therapy, 38 (69%; 51% of total) with a cytogenetic response - 13 (24%) had a major cytogenetic response. Seventeen patients received at least 1 course of DOAP therapy. Median survival of the overall cohort of patients was 120 months. With a median follow-up of 145 months (103+ to 155+ months), 40 patients (54%) have died. The median duration of cytogenetic response was 35 months (range 3 to 149+ months) and the estimated 10-year cytogenetic response rate was 37%. A durable complete cytogenetic response was observed in 16 patients (20%) with a median duration of 139+ months (range 12+ to 149+ months), 11 of them (15%) are now off IFN-alpha therapy for a median of 57+ months (range 12+ to 128+ months). The projected 10-year survival was 50% for the study group versus 35% for 208 patients who received other IFN-alpha based regimens at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (p<.01). In conclusion, the addition of intensive chemotherapy may improve survival in patients with CML who have not obtained an adequate cytogenetic response on an IFN-alpha-based regimen.","['Giles, F J', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Rios, M B', 'Cortes, J', 'Beran, M', 'Koller, C', 'Keating, M', 'Talpaz, M']","['Giles FJ', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Rios MB', 'Cortes J', 'Beran M', 'Koller C', 'Keating M', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia; University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'COAP protocol', 'CROP protocol']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/toxicity']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001185 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190109057985 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Apr;41(3-4):309-19. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057985.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following a 5-drug induction therapy (course A), patients received sequential courses (B and C) of high-dose antimetabolite therapies, in part to replace cranial irradiation for CNS prophylaxis. All patients achieved a complete remission. The regimen was designed with a goal of administering all post-remission therapy in the outpatient setting. With the exception of the initial induction course (A), 3(1/3)8 total patient courses were administered in the outpatient clinic. As expected, the induction and consolidation courses (A and B) of this regimen were associated with grade 4 hematologic toxicity and significant but manageable infectious toxicity. Another novel aspect of the regimen included a combined intravenous and oral dosing schedule designed to sustain methotrexate levels > or = 1.0 microM for 30 hours (course C). There was minimal toxicity with the CNS prophylaxis/high-dose methotrexate course (C). Methotrexate levels at 30 hours ranged from 0.31-4.0 microM, with a median of 1.0 microM (n=37). This study demonstrates that this novel post-remission regimen is feasible in adults and that high concentrations of methotrexate can be sustained in the outpatient setting.

However, its use in advanced leukemia patients is a subject of some debate especially when donors are not HLA-identical siblings because of the toxicity and cost of the procedure. We reviewed retrospectively the outcome of patients (pts) who received allogeneic transplantation for advanced acute leukemia in our center between 09/86 and 11/97. Thirty-six pts (study group) who lacked a matched sibling donor received partially matched related donor (n=14: PMRD group) or matched unrelated donor transplantation (n=22: MUD group). Fifteen pts had AML and 21 ALL. Seventeen pts (47%) were in CR>1, 13 pts (36%) had refractory disease and six pts (17.7%) were in untreated relapse. The outcome was compared to that of 56 patients (AML: 45.5 %, ALL: 55.5 %, CR>1: 49.9 %, refractory disease: 37.5 %, untreated relapse 19.6 %) who received allogeneic transplantation from a matched sibling donor (control group). Various conditioning regimens and GVHD prophylaxis were used. The actuarial incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD was significantly higher in the study group (57%) than in the control group (34%) (p=0.047). The actuarial risk of relapse at three years was 21% +/- 22% in the study group versus 65% +/- 16% in the control group (p= 0.04). The actuarial probability of transplant-related mortality at 3 years is 64 +/- 16% for the study group and 25 +/- 11% for the control group (p=0.001). The leading cause of death in the study group was infection (30%) followed by acute GVHD and relapse. Relapse was the major cause of death in the control group (54%), followed by infection, interstitial pneumonia, veno-occlusive disease and GVHD. The OS and probability of leukemia-free survival at 3 years were 28 % +/- 15% (95% CI) and 27% +/- 15% (95% CI) in the study group. The overall survival and probability of LFS at 3 years were respectively 28 +/- 12% (95% CI) and 23 +/- 12% (95% CI) in the control group (p = 0.08 and p=0.11 respectively). In multivariate analysis, transplant-related mortality was higher in the study group (p=0.04) and lower if both donor and recipient were seronegative for CMV (p=0.007). OS was significantly higher for seronegative couples (p=0.0001), and when CR was achieved before BMT (p=0.0022). These results suggest that all efforts in this field should be directed on lowering the transplant related mortality for non geno-identical transplants and the relapse rate in geno-identical transplants.","['Boiron, J M', 'Lerner, D', 'Pigneux, A', 'Faberes, C', 'Bordessoule, D', 'Turlure, P', 'Cony-Makhoul, P', 'Hau, F', 'Dazey, B', 'Agape, P', 'Reiffers, J', 'Marit, G']","['Boiron JM', 'Lerner D', 'Pigneux A', 'Faberes C', 'Bordessoule D', 'Turlure P', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Hau F', 'Dazey B', 'Agape P', 'Reiffers J', 'Marit G']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Avenue de Magellan, 33604 Pessac. jean-michel.boiron@chu-aquitaine.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/standards', 'Histocompatibility/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality/*standards', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001193 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190109057983 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Apr;41(3-4):285-96. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057983.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Together with the increasing use of chemo- and radiotherapy, individual predisposing factors play a key role. Most of secondary leukemias can be divided in two well-defined groups: those secondary to the use of alkylating agents and those associated to topoisomerase inhibitors. Leukemias induced by alkylating agents usually follow a long period of latency from the primary tumour and present as myelodysplasia with unbalanced chromosomal aberrations. These frequently include deletions of chromosome 13 and loss of the entire or of part of chomosomes 5 or 7. The loss of the coding regions for tumor suppressor genes from hematopoietic progenitor cells is a particularly unfavourable event, since the remaining allele becomes susceptible to inactivating mutations leading to the leukemic transformation. The tumorigenic action of topoisomerase inhibitors is on the other hand due to the formation of multiple DNA strand breaks, resolved by chromosomal translocations. Among these, chromosome 11, band q23, where the myeloid-lymphoid leukemia (MLL) gene is located, is often involved. Frequent partners are chromosomes 9, 19 and 4 in the t(9;11), t(19;11) and t(4;11) translocations. Younger age, a mean period of latency of 2 years and monocytic subtypes are characteristic features of this type of leukemia. Among patients at risk for secondary leukemia, those with Hodgkin's disease are the most extensively studied, with the major impact of alkylating agents included in the chemotherapy schedule. The same is true for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, while in multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia determinants are the dose of melphalan and of epypodophyllotoxin, respectively. Patients with breast, ovarian and testicular neoplasms are also at risk, in particular if trated with the association of alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors. According to the EBMT registry, in patients with lymphoma treated with high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation the cumulative risk of inducing leukemia at 5 years is 2.6%. Among treatment options, supportive therapy is indicated in older patients, while allogeneic stem cell transplantation, related or matched-unrelated, is feasible in younger patients. These data indicate the need for the identification of predisposing factors for secondary leukemia.

Using these leukemia-derived dendritic cells, we investigated leukemia cell-associated T-cell anergy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leukemia cells of 30 patients with AML were cultured with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-4, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Cultured leukemia cells were evaluated for antigen-presenting ability by mixed leukocyte culture (MLC). Normal lymphocytes, which were cocultured with leukemia blasts in the first MLC, were cultured with leukemia-derived dendritic cells in the second MLC. RESULTS: In cultures of leukemia cells from 21 of 30 patients examined, cells with stellate morphology and cell fractions with CD1a(+) and/or CD83(+) were present. Autologous MLC using lymphocytes obtained in remission phase as responders as well as allogeneic MLC demonstrated antigen-presenting ability in leukemia-derived dendritic cells. Leukemia cells of FAB-M0, M1, M2, M3, or M6 morphology/phenotype gave rise to dendritic cells as well as leukemia cells of M5. The leukemic origin of dendritic cells was suggested by in situ hybridization. By coculture with CD80(-) leukemia blasts, the response of normal lymphocytes to leukemia-derived dendritic cells cultured from the same individual as that of leukemia blasts was markedly reduced, compared with the lymphocytes cultured with leukemia blasts from a different individual as leukemia blasts. CONCLUSIONS: Escape of leukemia cells from anti-leukemia immunity may be associated with T-cell anergy caused by leukemia blasts. The results of the present study suggest that leukemia-derived dendritic cells can be applied efficiently in anti-leukemia immunotherapy.","['Narita, M', 'Takahashi, M', 'Liu, A', 'Nikkuni, K', 'Furukawa, T', 'Toba, K', 'Koyama, S', 'Takai, K', 'Sanada, M', 'Aizawa, Y']","['Narita M', 'Takahashi M', 'Liu A', 'Nikkuni K', 'Furukawa T', 'Toba K', 'Koyama S', 'Takai K', 'Sanada M', 'Aizawa Y']","['School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan. naritami@clg.niigara-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology', 'Clonal Anergy/*immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00636-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00636-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Jun;29(6):709-19. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00636-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to study the in vitro activity of UCN-01 against human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and potential mechanisms of action for inducing this cytotoxicity. METHODS: Detailed in vitro studies were performed from tumor cells derived from patients with CLL cells following attainment of written informed consent. RESULTS: The 50% loss of viability (LC(50)) in mononuclear cells from CLL patients (n = 10) following exposure to UCN-01 for 4 days was 0.4 microM (95% CI +/- 0.21; range 0.09-1.16). Loss of viability in human CLL cells correlated with early induction of apoptosis. Exposure of CLL cells to 0.4 and 5.0 microM of UCN-01 resulted in decreased expression of p53 protein. We therefore investigated the dependence of UCN-01 on intact p53 by exposing splenocytes from wild-type (p53(+/+)) and p53 null (p53(-/-)) mice, which demonstrated no preferential cytotoxicity when compared to the marked differential induced by F-Ara-A and radiation. CONCLUSIONS: UCN-01 has significant in vitro activity against human CLL cells that appears to occur independent of p53 status. While demonstration of in vitro cytotoxicity does not establish in vivo efficacy, the findings described support the early introduction of UCN-01 into clinical trials for patients with B-CLL.","['Byrd, J C', 'Shinn, C', 'Willis, C R', 'Flinn, I W', 'Lehman, T', 'Sausville, E', 'Lucas, D', 'Grever, M R']","['Byrd JC', 'Shinn C', 'Willis CR', 'Flinn IW', 'Lehman T', 'Sausville E', 'Lucas D', 'Grever MR']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA. byrd-3@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Prednisone/toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00649-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00649-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Jun;29(6):703-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00649-x.,['P01 CA81534-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using various animal models, allogeneic BMT has been found to be useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In MRL/lpr mice, which are radiosensitive (<8.5 Gy) and are an animal model for autoimmune disorders, conventional BMT resulted in only transient effects; the manifestations of the autoimmune diseases recurred 3 months after BMT. However, the combination of BMT plus bone grafts (to recruit donor stromal cells) was capable of preventing the recurrence of autoimmune diseases in MRL/lpr mice. This strategy was found to be ineffective in the treatment of MRL/lpr mice that had developed autoimmune diseases, because these mice were more sensitive to the effects of radiation after the onset of lupus nephritis due to uremic enterocolitis. We have recently discovered a safer strategy for treatment of autoimmune diseases, which includes fractionated irradiation (5.5 Gy x 2) (day -1) followed by portal venous injection (day 0) plus intravenous injection (day 5) of donor unfractionated bone marrow cells. We successfully treated autoimmune diseases in MRL/lpr mice using this strategy; 100% of MRL/lpr mice treated in this fashion survive >1 year after treatment. We identified the mechanisms underlying the components of this approach and have found that stromal cells play a crucial role in successful BMT. In this review, the conditions essential for successful allogeneic BMT are discussed.","['Ikehara, S']",['Ikehara S'],"['First Department of Pathology, Transplantation Center, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan. ikehara@takii.kmu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/radiotherapy/*therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mice']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00645-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00645-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Jun;29(6):661-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00645-2.,,,,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each job or task in the industry was assigned a Base Estimate (BE) of exposure derived from task-based personal exposure assessments carried out by the company occupational hygienists. The BEs corresponded to the estimated arithmetic mean exposure to benzene for each job or task and were used in a deterministic algorithm to estimate the exposure of subjects in the study. Nearly all of the data sets underlying the BEs were found to contain some values below the limit of detection (LOD) of the sampling and analytical methods and some were very heavily censored; up to 95% of the data were below the LOD in some data sets. It was necessary, therefore, to use a method of calculating the arithmetic mean exposures that took into account the censored data. Three different methods were employed in an attempt to select the most appropriate method for the particular data in the study. A common method is to replace the missing (censored) values with half the detection limit. This method has been recommended for data sets where much of the data are below the limit of detection or where the data are highly skewed; with a geometric standard deviation of 3 or more. Another method, involving replacing the censored data with the limit of detection divided by the square root of 2, has been recommended when relatively few data are below the detection limit or where data are not highly skewed. A third method that was examined is Cohen's method. This involves mathematical extrapolation of the left-hand tail of the distribution, based on the distribution of the uncensored data, and calculation of the maximum likelihood estimate of the arithmetic mean. When these three methods were applied to the data in this study it was found that the first two simple methods give similar results in most cases. Cohen's method on the other hand, gave results that were generally, but not always, higher than simpler methods and in some cases gave extremely high and even implausible estimates of the mean. It appears that if the data deviate substantially from a simple log-normal distribution, particularly if high outliers are present, then Cohen's method produces erratic and unreliable estimates. After examining these results, and both the distributions and proportions of censored data, it was decided that the half limit of detection method was most suitable in this particular study.","['Glass, D C', 'Gray, C N']","['Glass DC', 'Gray CN']","['Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Occup Hyg,The Annals of occupational hygiene,0203526,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Australia/epidemiology', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', '*Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Petroleum', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['S0003-4878(01)00022-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Occup Hyg. 2001 Jun;45(4):275-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last 20 years, there has been an evolution in accepted classification systems for this disease. In light of such developments and novel useful markers, it seems appropriate now to re-evaluate and update the classification of mastocytosis. Here, we propose criteria to delineate categories of mastocytosis together with an updated consensus classification system. In this proposal, the diagnosis cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is based on typical clinical and histological skin lesions and absence of definitive signs (criteria) of systemic involvement. Most patients with CM are children and present with maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (=urticaria pigmentosa, UP). Other less frequent forms of CM are diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) and mastocytoma of skin. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is commonly seen in adults and defined by multifocal histological lesions in the bone marrow (affected almost invariably) or other extracutaneous organs (major criteria) together with cytological and biochemical signs (minor criteria) of systemic disease (SM-criteria). SM is further divided into the following categories: indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), SM with an associated clonal hematologic non-mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD), aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), and mast cell leukemia (MCL). Patients with ISM usually have maculopapular skin lesions and a good prognosis. In the group with associated hematologic disease, the AHNMD should be classified according to FAB/WHO criteria. ASM is characterized by impaired organ-function due to infiltration of the bone marrow, liver, spleen, GI-tract, or skeletal system, by pathologic MC. MCL is a 'high-grade' leukemic disease defined by increased numbers of MC in bone marrow smears (>or=20%) and peripheral blood, absence of skin lesions, multiorgan failure, and a short survival. In typical cases, circulating MC amount to >or=10% of leukocytes (classical form of MCL). Mast cell sarcoma is a unifocal tumor that consists of atypical MC and shows a destructive growth without (primary) systemic involvement. This high-grade malignant MC disease has to be distinguished from a localized benign mastocytoma in either extracutaneous organs (=extracutaneous mastocytoma) or skin. Depending on the clinical course of mastocytosis and development of an AHNMD, patients can shift from one category of MC disease into another. In all categories, mediator-related symptoms may occur and may represent a serious clinical problem. All categories of mastocytosis should be distinctively separated from reactive MC hyperplasia, MC activation syndromes, and a more or less pronounced increase in MC in myelogenous malignancies other than mastocytosis. Criteria proposed in this article should be helpful in this regard.","['Valent, P', 'Horny, H P', 'Escribano, L', 'Longley, B J', 'Li, C Y', 'Schwartz, L B', 'Marone, G', 'Nunez, R', 'Akin, C', 'Sotlar, K', 'Sperr, W R', 'Wolff, K', 'Brunning, R D', 'Parwaresch, R M', 'Austen, K F', 'Lennert, K', 'Metcalfe, D D', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Bennett, J M']","['Valent P', 'Horny HP', 'Escribano L', 'Longley BJ', 'Li CY', 'Schwartz LB', 'Marone G', 'Nunez R', 'Akin C', 'Sotlar K', 'Sperr WR', 'Wolff K', 'Brunning RD', 'Parwaresch RM', 'Austen KF', 'Lennert K', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Vardiman JW', 'Bennett JM']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology, University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@akh-wien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Consensus Development Conference', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'CD2 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/physiology', 'Isoenzymes/blood', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Mast Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/classification/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Mutation', 'North America/epidemiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serine Endopeptidases/blood', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Skin/pathology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Tryptases', 'Viscera/pathology']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(01)00038-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00038-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Jul;25(7):603-25. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00038-8.,,['Leuk Res. 2002 May;26(5):483-4; author reply 485-6.

Based on clonal evolution, biology of afflicted cells, and disease criteria, three major groups of patients have been recognized: The first meets criteria for both diagnoses 'systemic mastocytosis' and 'associated hematologic clonal non-mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD)'. In such patients, myeloproliferative (MPS) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is diagnosed apart from mastocytosis. In a second group of patients, large numbers of very immature MC-lineage cells (metachromatically granulated blast-like cells) are detectable, but the criteria to diagnose mastocytosis are not met. These patients have advanced myeloid neoplasms (MDS or MPS with blast cell increase, or AML) and variably suffer from mediator-related symptoms (flush, GI-tract ulcer, diarrhoea, coagulopathy). In some cases, the disease mimics mast cell- or basophilic leukemia. In contrast to basophilic leukemia, however, the metachromatic cells are strongly KIT+ and tryptase+. In contrast to true mast cell leukemia (MCL), MC do not form multifocal dense infiltrates in the bone marrow. Also, MC lack CD2 and CD25, and the C-KIT mutation Asp-816-Val.

However, the histologic discrimination between hyperplastic states and neoplastic MC proliferative disorders is sometimes very difficult. MC hyperplasia is characterized by a diffuse increase in mature, round or spindle-shaped, metachromatic MC that are loosely scattered throughout the tissue and do not form dense focal infiltrates, even in states of marked hyperplasia. However, loosely scattered MC are also a prominent feature of many cases of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemia involving the MC lineage. In contrast, the demonstration of dense, focal and/or diffuse MC infiltrates can be regarded as indicative of primary MC disease/mastocytosis. In addition to the highly diagnostic focal MC infiltrates, mastocytosis may also present with a predominantly diffuse or a mixed (diffuse and focal) infiltration pattern. The relatively rare diffuse pattern is usually dominated by atypical, often hypogranulated or even non-metachromatic MC and is associated with the aggressive or frankly malignant subtypes of systemic mastocytosis and MC leukemia. Although the demonstration of MC infiltrates in Giemsa-stained tissue sections is still very important for the diagnosis of mastocytosis, immunohistochemical techniques using antibodies against MC-associated antigens such as tryptase or c-kit (CD117) are essential for the identification of highly atypical, hypogranulated MC, especially in MC leukemia, and for the detection of small and even minute MC infiltrates.","['Horny, H P', 'Valent, P']","['Horny HP', 'Valent P']","['Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Lubeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany. horny@patho.mu-luebeck.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (chloroacetate esterase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chymases', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Digestive System/pathology', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', 'Mast Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Mastocytosis/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tryptases']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(01)00021-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00021-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Jul;25(7):543-51. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00021-2.,,,,,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the majority of cases with SM, the percentage of MC in bone marrow (bm) smears was less than 5% (of all nucleated bm cells), and the predominant types were typical MC or atypical MC type I. In a smaller group of patients, the percentage of MC was greater than 5% and a significant subset of MC (>or=10%) were classified as 'metachromatic blasts' and/or atypical MC type II. These patients had a significantly shorter survival (P<0.05) and most of them were found to lack UP-like skin lesions. A percentage of MC>or=20% was invariably associated with the diagnosis 'mast cell leukemia'. Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic value of the cytology in SM and identified the percentage of MC (of all nucleated bm cells) as an independent prognostic variable.

We extended these observations in the present study to provide insights into various mechanisms by which these anticancer drugs affect DNA replication and induce genomic instability in human CEM leukemia cells. Neither araC nor FaraA induced a detectable amount of re-replicated DNA in S-phase cells, which indicated that drug-induced alterations in Okazaki fragment synthesis were not accompanied by DNA re-replication. Synthesis on both leading and lagging DNA strands within the c-myc locus was measured in cells incubated with equitoxic concentrations of araC or FaraA. In araC-treated cells, nascent DNA from the lagging strand was enriched about 5-fold compared with the leading strand. In contrast, FaraA did not induce any replication imbalance. AraC- and FaraA induced changes in the frequency of N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA) resistance and the extent of CAD gene amplification were monitored as markers of drug-induced genomic instability. At concentrations that reduced cloning efficiency by 50% (IC(50)), araC increased the frequency of PALA resistance about 4-fold, while FaraA did not have a significant effect on the frequency of PALA resistance. Pretreatment with araC also increased the extent of CAD gene amplification.

The agents acted as competitive inhibitors of this isoform, yet when tested against human Type I at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 500 microM, Type I was not inhibited. This study focuses on the antineoplastic activity and cellular effects of one of these agents and two new derivatives containing ethoxycarbonyl substitution at position C6. Agents were studied for antiproliferative activity in human Tmolt4 leukemia (EC(50) 3.3 to 9.2 microM) and alterations in the levels of enzymes involved with cellular metabolism, including DNA and RNA syntheses due to IMPDH inhibition. Results reported here demonstrate that 6-ethoxycarbonyl-3,3-disubstituted-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-diones are effective inhibitors of DNA synthesis (30-66% inhibition) due to reductions in dGTP pool levels. Collectively, the three agents proved to be selective inhibitors of human IMPDH Type II activity (K(i) 11-33 microM), leading to cytotoxicity in a number of suspended and solid tumor lines, notably MCF-7 (EC(50) 0.7 to 6.0 microM). In addition, negative cytotoxic actions of these agents on WI-38 cell growth, a normal rapidly growing human line, suggest that specific targeting of Type II IMPDH would help to eliminate cell killing in lines where Type I predominates. Furthermore, effects of agents on DNA synthesis and cell death could be reversed by the addition of exogenous guanosine to the medium. Results from in vitro studies suggest that the 6-ethoxycarbonyl-3,3-disubstituted-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-diones may be used as effective isozyme-selective chemotherapeutic agents.","['Barnes, B J', 'Eakin, A E', 'Izydore, R A', 'Hall, I H']","['Barnes BJ', 'Eakin AE', 'Izydore RA', 'Hall IH']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7360, USA. barnebe@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (1,5-diazabicyclo(3.1.0)hexane-2,4-dione)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/antagonists & inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Guanosine/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(01)00649-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00649-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Jul 1;62(1):91-100. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00649-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Formation of CNDAC 5'-mono-, di-, and triphosphate (CNDACTP) was concentration-dependent; nucleotide accumulation was greater in the lymphoid cells than in the myeloid cells. The nucleotides were eliminated with linear kinetics from both lines, but were retained more effectively by the ML-1 cells. DNA synthesis was selectively inhibited by a 4-hr treatment with CNDAC in CCRF-CEM and ML-1 cells; the IC(50) values were 1 and 0.8 microM, respectively. Evaluation of the polymerization reaction of a primer on an M13mp19(+) template by human DNA polymerase alpha indicated that CNDACTP was incorporated effectively (K(m) = 0.22 microM) opposite a complementary dGMP in the template strand. CNDACTP competed with the normal substrate, dCTP, for incorporation, and the two nucleotides showed similar substrate efficiencies (V(max)/K(m): dCTP = 0.91; CNDACTP = 0.77). Primer extension was potently inhibited by CNDAC triphosphate (K(i) = 23 nM); once the analog had been incorporated, further extension was not observed in vitro, suggesting that primers containing a 3'-terminal nucleotide analog were high K(m) substrates for polymerase alpha. Thus, the ability of human leukemia cells to effectively accumulate and retain CNDACTP, coupled with the favorable kinetics of competition for incorporation into DNA, and the relatively strong ability of the analog to terminate further extension, are likely to contribute to the cytotoxic action of CNDAC.","['Azuma, A', 'Huang, P', 'Matsuda, A', 'Plunkett, W']","['Azuma A', 'Huang P', 'Matsuda A', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Box 71, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""134665-72-8 (2'-cyano-2'-deoxyarabinofuranosylcytosine)"", ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'RNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295201006177 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00617-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Jun 15;61(12):1497-507. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00617-7.,['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to other amines, the 2-aminopyrrole precursors (13a-d) also exhibited potent activity against CMV. Unfortunately, most of these compounds displayed significant cytotoxicity against human fibroblasts, the cells supporting CMV and VZV replication, and thus selectivity indices were low.

RR is the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, and its activity is significantly increased in tumor cells in proportion to the proliferation rate. Therefore, RR is a target for antitumor therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL-60 and K562 leukemia cells were treated with increasing doses of amidox and didox. Thereafter, the mode of cytotoxic drug action was determined by Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide (HO/PI) double staining, annexin binding, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation. This was correlated to the decrease in dNTP levels. Staining with HO/PI and binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V to externalized phosphatidylserine were used to quantify apoptosis. RESULTS: Low doses of amidox or didox resulted in an increase of apoptotic HL-60 cells within 48 hours. Higher doses (50 microM amidox or 250 microM didox) led to rapid induction of apoptosis, which could be detected as early as 4 hours after treatment. After 48 hours with these concentrations, almost 100% of the HL-60 cells died by apoptosis without an increase in necrosis. K562 cells were found to be resistant to amidox but not to didox. In HL-60 cells, upstream caspase 8 is processed in response to didox, whereas caspases 8 and 9 are processed upon amidox treatment. Didox-induced apoptosis, but not amidox-induced apoptosis, can be correlated with the decrease in dNTP levels. The results suggests that amidox induces several apoptosis mechanisms in HL-60 cells. In contrast, only caspase 9 is activated by didox in K562 cells, and because amidox hardly induces apoptosis in this cell line, no caspase cleavage is observed. CONCLUSIONS: Didox triggers distinct apoptosis pathways in HL-60 and K562 cells.","['Grusch, M', 'Fritzer-Szekeres, M', 'Fuhrmann, G', 'Rosenberger, G', 'Luxbacher, C', 'Elford, H L', 'Smid, K', 'Peters, G J', 'Szekeres, T', 'Krupitza, G']","['Grusch M', 'Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Fuhrmann G', 'Rosenberger G', 'Luxbacher C', 'Elford HL', 'Smid K', 'Peters GJ', 'Szekeres T', 'Krupitza G']","['Institute of Clinical Pathology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '95933-72-5 (Amidox)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'L106XFV0RQ (3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gelsolin/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oximes/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Pilot Projects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00624-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00624-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 May;29(5):623-32. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00624-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cultured endothelial cells secrete CNP, and its secretion rate from the endothelial cells is augmented by lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which participate in the pathophysiology of inflammation. In this study, we investigated the regulation of CNP secretion from monocytes and macrophages to estimate its contribution to the progression of inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CNP secretion rates from two human leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and HL-60), human peripheral blood lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and mouse peritoneal macrophages were measured under conditions with or without stimulation. Immunoreactive CNP levels in the culture media of these cells were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: The secretion rates of CNP from THP-1 and HL-60 cells were augmented according to the degree of their differentiation into macrophage-like cells under the stimulation with phorbol ester. Peripheral blood monocytes also increased the CNP secretion rate after their differentiation into macrophages. Retinoic acid elicited synergistic effects on the CNP secretion rate from HL-60 cells when administered with lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or phorbol ester. In contrast, the phorbol ester-stimulated CNP secretion rate from THP-1 cells was suppressed with dexamethasone, which inhibits monocyte differentiation into macrophage. CONCLUSIONS: The secretion rate of CNP from monocytes was shown to be regulated based on the degree of their differentiation. This study provides evidence that the monocyte/macrophage system is one of the sources of CNP, especially under inflammatory conditions.","['Kubo, A', 'Isumi, Y', 'Ishizaka, Y', 'Tomoda, Y', 'Kangawa, K', 'Dohi, K', 'Matsuo, H', 'Minamino, N']","['Kubo A', 'Isumi Y', 'Ishizaka Y', 'Tomoda Y', 'Kangawa K', 'Dohi K', 'Matsuo H', 'Minamino N']","['National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '127869-51-6 (Natriuretic Peptide, C-Type)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Natriuretic Peptide, C-Type/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00625-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00625-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 May;29(5):609-15. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00625-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether TGF-beta(1) interferes directly with TPO-induced signal transduction in hematopoietic cells, we compared the regulatory effects in the TPO-responsive cell lines Mo-7e and HEL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cells were stimulated by 100 ng/mL TPO and/or 100 ng/mL TGF-beta1 and analyzed for proliferation (3H thymidine incorporation), viability (trypan blue exclusion), and protein expression and phosphorylation (Western blot). RESULTS: TPO enhanced the proliferation of Mo-7e cells as determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation, whereas TGF-beta1 suppressed baseline cell growth and antagonized the proliferative effect of TPO. TPO-induced proliferation also was reduced by a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PD098059), which inhibits activation of the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) ERK1 and ERK2, and AG490, an inhibitor of Janus kinase-2, which completely blocked TPO-induced proliferation. As demonstrated by Western blotting, TGF-beta1 reduced the TPO-stimulated ERK1/ERK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation in Mo-7e and HEL cells. This effect was completely reversed by preincubation with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (Na3VO4), which suggests that TGF-beta1 activated a phosphatase. Although STAT3 also was activated by TPO, STAT3 activation remained unaltered by TGF-beta1. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest that TGF-beta1 modulates TPO-mediated effects on megakaryocytic proliferation by interfering with TPO-induced signal transduction, particularly by reducing the activities of MAPK ERK1/ERK2 and STAT5.","['Kalina, U', 'Koschmieder, S', 'Hofmann, W K', 'Wagner, S', 'Kauschat, D', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Ottmann, O G']","['Kalina U', 'Koschmieder S', 'Hofmann WK', 'Wagner S', 'Kauschat D', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG']","['Department of Hematology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of these immunosuppressants on differentiation of several human myeloid leukemic cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid leukemic cell lines were cultured with each immunosuppressant, and several differentiation markers were assayed. RESULTS: Rapamycin effectively induced granulocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemic HL-60 and ML-1 cells. In addition to morphologic differentiation, it also induced nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, lysozyme activity, and expression of CD11b in HL-60 cells. The commitment to differentiation was observed after treatment with rapamycin for 1 day, indicating that the effect of rapamycin was irreversible. FK506 and ascomycin induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, but at higher concentrations than rapamycin. A calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) was copurified with FKBP52 immunophilin, a binding protein of immunosuppressants. We also found that the CaMK inhibitors KN62 and KN93 induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Rapamycin and CaMK inhibitors induced differentiation of human myeloid leukemia ML-1 and K562, but not of other cell lines such as NB4, U937, or HEL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two variants of Friend erythroleukemia cells were treated with hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) to induce differentiation: 1) MEL, which exhibit the normal phenotype and are susceptible to differentiation; and 2) the resistant R1 cells. The cells were analyzed by spectral imaging along with transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins was analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Spectral imaging of HMBA-treated MEL and R1 cells stained by May-Grunwald-Giemsa and subjected to spectral similarity mapping revealed five morphologic cell types: proerythroblast-like cells, normoblast-like cells, reticulocyte-like cells, megakaryocytes, and apoptotic cells. In MEL cells, both megakaryocytic differentiation characterized by nuclear lobes and erythroid differentiation characterized by accumulation of hemoglobin were detected; R1 cells were not committed to terminal differentiation. HMBA-induced cell cycle arrest at G(1) affected the expression of regulatory proteins in a similar manner in both types of cells. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 decreased and expression of p21(WAF1) increased. The level of the underphosphorylated form of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein increased, inducing a decrease in the level of c-myc. In addition, we detected a decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic regulator, Bcl-2, and an increased expression of the pro-apoptotic regulator, Bax. CONCLUSIONS: Spectral imaging provides new insight for the morphologic characterization of erythroid and megakaryocytic cell differentiation as well as apoptosis. Image analysis was well correlated to cell cycle arrest and the expression of regulatory proteins.","['Hyman, T', 'Rothmann, C', 'Heller, A', 'Malik, Z', 'Salzberg, S']","['Hyman T', 'Rothmann C', 'Heller A', 'Malik Z', 'Salzberg S']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*pathology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00616-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00616-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 May;29(5):563-71. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00616-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with successful cytogenetics and a diagnosis of AML were categorized into four mutually exclusive karyotype groups: normal, translocation, deletion and trisomy. Patients with more than one chromosomal abnormality were classified using the hierarchy: established translocation>established deletion>established trisomy>non-established translocation>non-established deletion>non-established trisomy. A total of 593 AML patients from a large population-based case-control study of acute leukemia were classified according to their diagnostic karyotype. The four karyotype groups showed different age distributions. Overall the frequency of patients increased with age as did the frequency of patients with a deletion, trisomy or normal karyotype. Although the increase of patients with age was much sharper for patients with a deletion. In contrast, the distribution of patients with a translocation was roughly constant with age. We concluded that there was a link between karyotype and the age of the patient at diagnosis. Furthermore, two karyotype groups, translocations and deletions, may define disease entities with different etiologies. This novel cytogenetic classification will allow other studies to examine whether AML cases with very different types of chromosomal abnormality have the same etiology.","['Moorman, A V', 'Roman, E', 'Willett, E V', 'Dovey, G J', 'Cartwright, R A', 'Morgan, G J']","['Moorman AV', 'Roman E', 'Willett EV', 'Dovey GJ', 'Cartwright RA', 'Morgan GJ']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology at Leeds University, Leeds, UK. anthonym@ lrf.leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(00)00414-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00414-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Apr 15;126(2):155-61. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00414-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amplification of 11q23 region was associated with complex karyotypes at the time of diagnosis or following treatment in secondary leukemias. Three were AML cases belonging to either AML-M5a or AML-1 subtypes and one was a myeloproliferative disorder. These cases were resistant to treatment. Conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using MLL, 11 painting, or 11 centromere probes ascertained the segmental amplification.

Conversely, there was substantial heterogeneity in methylation patterns in patients with lymphoid crisis. All lymphoid-crisis patients studied in blastic phase showed a pattern distinct from that of the chronic phase in the same patient, as well as from the myeloid pattern, suggesting cell lineage-specific M-BCR methylation. Moreover, in four of six patients with lymphoid crisis, the chronic-phase patterns were different from those of cases with myeloid crisis. Ph-positive and -negative acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) showed methylation patterns different from those of lymphoid crisis in CML. Although the number of patients with lymphoid crisis studied has been limited, these results suggest that analysis of M-BCR methylation status may be of clinical use in distinguishing lymphoid from myeloid crises and predicting the cell lineage of a crisis when the disease is still in the chronic phase.","['Ge, X Q', 'Tanaka, K', 'Mansyur, A', 'Tazawa, H', 'Iwato, K', 'Kyo, T', 'Dohy, H', 'Kamada, N']","['Ge XQ', 'Tanaka K', 'Mansyur A', 'Tazawa H', 'Iwato K', 'Kyo T', 'Dohy H', 'Kamada N']","['Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, Research Insitute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, 734-8553, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['*Chromosome Fragility', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Restriction Mapping']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(00)00394-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00394-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Apr 15;126(2):102-10. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00394-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ara-C therapy may be optimal if it is directed by the clinical pharmacokinetics of the intracellular active metabolite of ara-C, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP). However, ara-CTP has seldom been monitored during low- and conventional-dose ara-C therapies because detection methods were insufficiently sensitive. Here, with the use of our newly established method (Cancer Res., 56, 1800 -- 1804 (1996)), ara-CTP was monitored in leukemic cells from acute myelogenous leukemia patients receiving low- or conventional-dose ara-C [subcutaneous ara-C administration (10 mg / m(2) ) (3 patients), continuous ara-C infusion (20 or 70 mg / m(2) / 24 h) (7 patients), 2-h ara-C infusion (70 mg / m(2) ) (4 patients), and 2-h infusion of N(4)-behenoyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, a deaminase-resistant ara-C derivative (70 mg / m(2) ) (6 patients)]. Ara-CTP could be determined at levels under 1 microM. There was a close correlation between the elimination half-life values of the plasma ara-C and the intracellular ara-CTP. The presence of ara-C in the plasma was important to maintain ara-CTP. The continuous ara-C and the 2-h N(4)-behenoyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine infusions maintained ara-CTP and the plasma ara-C longer than the subcutaneous ara-C or the 2-h ara-C infusion. They also afforded relatively higher ara-CTP concentrations, and consequently produced ara-CTP more efficiently than the 2-h ara-C infusion. Different administration methods produced different quantities of ara-CTP even at the same dose.","['Yamauchi, T', 'Kawai, Y', 'Kishi, S', 'Goto, N', 'Urasaki, Y', 'Imamura, S', 'Fukushima, T', 'Yoshida, A', 'Iwasaki, H', 'Tsutani, H', 'Masada, M', 'Ueda, T']","['Yamauchi T', 'Kawai Y', 'Kishi S', 'Goto N', 'Urasaki Y', 'Imamura S', 'Fukushima T', 'Yoshida A', 'Iwasaki H', 'Tsutani H', 'Masada M', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Fukui 910-1193, Japan. tyamauch@wt.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*analysis', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01128.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2001 May;92(5):546-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01128.x.,,,,,,,PMC5926735,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have a synergistic effect with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in vitro to induce differentiation. Here we report in vitro and in vivo effects of a HDACI, FK228 (formerly FR901228 or depsipeptide), on the human APL cell line NB4. FK228 had a strong and irreversible cytotoxicity compared with another HDACI, trichostatin A. In vivo administration of ATRA or FK228 alone partly inhibited the growth of established tumors of NB4 subcutaneously transplanted in NOD / Shi-scid / scid mice, and the combination was synergistically effective. Histopathological examination revealed that the combination induced apoptosis and differentiation as well as histone acetylation. Intravenous injection of NB4 in NOD / Shi-scid / scid mice followed by combination treatment significantly prevented leukemia death, whereas single administration did not. These findings suggest that FK228 is a promising agent to enhance ATRA-sensitivity in the treatment of APL.","['Kosugi, H', 'Ito, M', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Towatari, M', 'Ito, M', 'Ueda, R', 'Saito, H', 'Naoe, T']","['Kosugi H', 'Ito M', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Towatari M', 'Ito M', 'Ueda R', 'Saito H', 'Naoe T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Showa-ku, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Depsipeptides', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/30 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/05/30 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01126.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2001 May;92(5):529-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01126.x.,,,,,,,PMC5926744,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale of using broad spectrum antibiotics prophylactically has led to a great change in the causative organisms. The aim of the present study is to review retrospectively the type and sequence of infectious complications among Saudi children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: A total of 233 febrile episodes were observed in 137 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under induction therapy using modified BFM protocol were studied. RESULTS: Profound neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil count < 100/mm3) was encountered in 72 episodes (31%). Clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of infection were evident in 39% of the neutropenic episodes. The respiratory system was the most frequently affected site encountered in 17% of the episodes. Microbiologically documented infection was recorded in 59% (n=137) of the fever and granulocytopenia episodes. In 96 episodes (41%), there was neither clinical nor microbiological evidence of infection fever of unknown origin. Out of the 932 cultures, positive isolates were detected in 346 cultures (37%). Gram positive cocci were the most frequently organisms (54%) followed by gram negative bacilli (39%). In the current study, 7 patients (3%) died because of direct or indirect consequences of infection. CONCLUSION: The current study stresses the importance of frequent reviewing of the type, frequency, severity and outcome of infection complications over years to detect changing epidemiological patterns.","['Meir, H M', 'Balawi, I A', 'Meer, H M', 'Nayel, H', 'Al-Mobarak, M F']","['Meir HM', 'Balawi IA', 'Meer HM', 'Nayel H', 'Al-Mobarak MF']","['Department of Oncology, King Abdulaziz Hospital and Oncology Center, PO Box 31467, Jeddah 21497, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. hadirmeir@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neutropenia/blood/*etiology', 'Neutrophils', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2001/05/29 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/05/29 10:00'],"['2001/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2001 May;22(5):423-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The identity of isolates was confirmed by DNAse production and reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Susceptibility testing and B-lactamase production was carried out for each isolate. RESULTS: Twenty three of the patients were adults and 9 were children. Twelve (37%) of the isolates were from the sputum of patients aged more than 50 years with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiactesis. Six (18%) had M. catarrhalis isolated from sputum and had underlying cardiac, liver diseases or diabetes mellitus. The organism was isolated from the blood of one patient with pneumonia and one with leukaemia. It was also isolated from patients with sinusitis, conjunctivitis or otitis media. Twenty seven (84%) of the 32 strains produced B-lactamase, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was detected in 13% of the isolates. All isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazle, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, polymyxin B and neomycin. CONCLUSION: This study showed that M. catarrhalis can be an important respiratory tract pathogen in adults and children, able to invade the blood stream of patients with predisposing respiratory conditions and underlying systemic illnesses, as well as immunocompetent patients. Since most strains produce B-lactamase, antibiotic therapy should be guided by in-vitro susceptibility tests.","['Babay, H A']",['Babay HA'],"['Dept. of Pathology/Microbiology, College of Medicine, King Khalid University Hospital, PO Box 2925, Riyadh 11461, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. hahabib@ksu.edu.sa']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Moraxella catarrhalis/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Neisseriaceae Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology']",2001/05/29 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/29 10:00'],"['2001/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2000 Sep;21(9):860-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analysed survival on an unselected population based cohort of patients using both the Hasford and the Sokal scores. In the group overall, neither score was predictive of survival, but in younger patients (< 60 years) treated with interferon, the Hasford score was highly predictive of survival, dividing patients into groups with a five year survival of 77% (45 patients) v 33% (six patients) v 14% (31 patients) (p = 0.01).","['Thomas, M J', 'Irving, J A', 'Lennard, A L', 'Proctor, S J', 'Taylor, P R']","['Thomas MJ', 'Irving JA', 'Lennard AL', 'Proctor SJ', 'Taylor PR']","['University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/05/29 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/29 10:00'],"['2001/05/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.54.6.491 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2001 Jun;54(6):491-3. doi: 10.1136/jcp.54.6.491.,,,,,,,PMC1731441,['On behlaf of the Northern Region Haematology Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children from ethnic minority groups may benefit most from cord blood transplantation. Cohort controlled retrospective data indicate that there is significantly less acute and chronic graft versus host disease associated with the transplantation of human major histocompatibility complex (HLA) identical sibling cord blood compared with HLA identical sibling marrow. Controlled data are not yet available to confirm this observation in unrelated donor cord blood transplantation. The difference in leukaemic relapse seen after cord blood compared with bone marrow transplantation is also unknown. Tentative recommendations for the use of umbilical cord blood for transplantation are as follows. Collection is indicated from healthy newborn siblings when urgent transplantation is required for an older child in a family. The haematologist responsible for the older child, with the approval of the family and the obstetric team, should contact the medical director of the nearest cord blood bank to discuss arrangements for the UCB to be collected and HLA typed. Antenatal blood sampling to HLA type the fetus is not recommended. Umbilical cord blood should be considered when allogeneic transplantation is the treatment of choice for a child who does not have an HLA identical sibling, or a well matched unrelated adult volunteer donor. The potential advantages and disadvantages of using an HLA haplotype matched peripheral blood stem cell family donor rather than an unrelated cord blood donation should be discussed. There are no comparative data available as yet. At present, UCB transplantation should only be considered if a suitably matched donation contains at least 2 x 10(7)/kg nucleated cells.

They are prepared with a variety of sizes: small (5+/-1 nm), medium (63+/-4 nm), and large (400+/-10 nm), which shows the efficiency of the microemulsion technique for the synthesis of uniform nanoparticles. All these nanoparticles are suitable for biomarker application since they are much smaller than cellular dimension. These nanoparticles are highly photostable in comparison to most commonly used organic dyes. These nanoparticles have been characterized by various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The amount of dye content in these nanoparticles has been optimized to eliminate self-quenching. It has been observed that maximum luminescence intensity is achieved when the dye content is around 20 wt%.

Recently, the expression and action of two other members of this family, IL-11 and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), on different cell lines has also been demonstrated. We studied the expression of the specific receptor subunits for CNTF in mammotropic, non-functioning and somatotropic tumors and the action of CNTF and IL-11 in the regulation of hormone secretion in these and normal pituitary cells. The mRNA for the alpha chain specific for the CNTF receptor was detected by Northern blot in tumors secreting prolactin (PRL) and GH and in non-functioning tumors. We found that both IL-11 and CNTF exerted a similar stimulatory effect on GH mRNA expression in somatotropic monolayer cell cultures from acromegalic tumors, but these cytokines had no significant influence on GH secretion. CNTF stimulates prolactin secretion in lactotropic monolayer cell cultures from patients with prolactinoma. In monolayer cell cultures from normal rat anterior pituitary, IL-11 and CNTF had no significant effect on the release of either GH or PRL, or on GH mRNA. However, when the cells were cultured in aggregate cultures, in which the three-dimensional structure of the cells is reconstituted, both cytokines, in doses at which they had no effect on monolayer cultures, significantly stimulated both PRL and GH secretion. These data show that IL-11 and CNTF may act as regulatory factors in anterior pituitary cells, in which the three-dimensional structure of the gland is of critical importance.","['Perez Castro, C', 'Carbia Nagashima, A', 'Paez Pereda, M', 'Goldberg, V', 'Chervin, A', 'Carrizo, G', 'Molina, H', 'Renner, U', 'Stalla, G K', 'Arzt, E']","['Perez Castro C', 'Carbia Nagashima A', 'Paez Pereda M', 'Goldberg V', 'Chervin A', 'Carrizo G', 'Molina H', 'Renner U', 'Stalla GK', 'Arzt E']","['Laboratorio de Fisiologia y Biologia Molecular, Departamento de Biologia, FCEN, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",IM,"['Adenoma/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Human Growth Hormone/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/cytology/*drug effects', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Prolactin/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/26 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/26 10:00'],"['2001/05/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['JOE04023 [pii]', '10.1677/joe.0.1690539 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2001 Jun;169(3):539-47. doi: 10.1677/joe.0.1690539.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This characterization allowed us to propose a structure of the type [Au CG(O) CG(N,O) Cl] for the neutral complex, which has the composition C522H84N2O12AuCl and is very soluble in water, methanol, ethanol and DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide). The study in aqueous solution suggested a redox process for its transformation, which is accompanied by the appearance of colloidal gold phase. The behavior in 4 mM NaCl water (in order to mimic the cytoplasmatic fluid) was similar to that observed in water, while in a 150 mM NaCl (similar to extracellular fluid and serum), the apparition of a dark blue precipitate was observed. This complex displays fluorescence, which does not change when incubated with DNA obtained from E. coli. Bamet-A1 was found to inhibit the growth of a variety of cell lines. The cytostatic effect was mild against human hepatoma HepG2, mouse hepatoma Hepa 1-6, rat hepatoma McA RH-7777 and human colon adenocarcinoma LS-174T, and stronger against mouse sarcoma S180-II and mouse leukemia L-1210 cells.

Previous studies have shown that T cells specific for the junctional region peptides of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein can be detected in healthy individuals as well as in patients with CML in chronic phase. We assessed whether BCR-ABL- specific T cells could be found in a patient achieving a complete cytogenetic remission after CD4+ donor lymphocyte infusion. METHODS: Using dendritic cells pulsed with BCR-ABL breakpoint peptides as antigen-presenting cells, we stimulated patient peripheral blood lymphocytes to isolate peptide-specific T cell clones present at the time of the cytogenetic response. T cell clones were isolated and the cellular specificity of these cells was examined. RESULTS: A CD3+ CD4+ T cell clone (1F7) that recognizes overlapping p210 junctional peptides presented by HLA-DR molecules was identified and expanded in vitro. Clone 1F7 failed to recognize autologous tumor cells as well as dendritic cells derived from patient CML cells. Clone 1F7 did not inhibit the growth and differentiation of CML precursor cells in a standard colony formation assay. Finally, using a clone-specific probe, 1F7 cells could not be detected in patient peripheral blood at the time of the donor lymphocyte infusion response. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that clone 1F7 was selected in vitro using highly potent peptide pulsed dendritic cells but was not representative of the anti-leukemia immune response in vivo. Based on these findings, CD4+ T cells with BCR-ABL specificity do not appear to be mediators of the anti-leukemia response in vivo after donor lymphocyte infusion.","['Zorn, E', 'Orsini, E', 'Wu, C J', 'Stein, B', 'Chillemi, A', 'Canning, C', 'Alyea, E P', 'Soiffer, R J', 'Ritz, J']","['Zorn E', 'Orsini E', 'Wu CJ', 'Stein B', 'Chillemi A', 'Canning C', 'Alyea EP', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ritz J']","['Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology']",2001/05/26 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/26 10:00'],"['2001/05/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-200104270-00021 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2001 Apr 27;71(8):1131-7. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200104270-00021.,['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the changes of function and morphology were observed after transfection of cationic liposome. RESULTS: HL-60 cells incubated with c-myc AS-ODN/lipofectin complex were about 50% decreased in the 4th day as compared with control cells (P < 0.05). About 56% of HL-60 cells exposed to c-myc AS-ODN/lipofectin complex were NBT-positive and showed morphological changes with differentiated phenotype compared with 29% of untreated cells.

Three years after her initial consultation monocytosis appeared in most but not all of her hemograms. Soon after her spleen was palpable and became very large.

Those complications were considered to be probably due to vasculitis or immune phenomena. After a long follow up it was clear that her disease was better classified as diffuse plane xanthoma (DPX) related to a myeloproliferative syndrome and vasculitis.

However, recent studies have found that outcomes of critically ill cancer patients have been improving over the years and that classic predictors of high mortality have lost their relevance. DESIGN: We retrospectively determined outcomes and predictors of 30-day mortality in 237 mechanically-ventilated cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS: The 132 (55.7%) patients who were admitted between 1990 and 1995 were compared with 105 (44.3%) patients who were admitted between 1996 and 1998. The malignancy was leukemia/lymphoma in 119 (50.3%) patients, myeloma in 50 (21%), and a solid tumor in 68 (28.7%). Forty-two (17.7%) patients had bone marrow transplantation, and 91 (38.4%) were neutropenic. Median Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) was 58 (range, 40-75). Reasons for MV were acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in 148 (62.5%) patients, coma in 54 (22.8%), and cardiogenic pulmonary edema in 35 (14.7%). Conventional MV was used first in 189 (79.8%) patients, and noninvasive MV (NIMV) was used in 48 (20.2%). Overall mortality rate was 72.5% (172 deaths). RESULTS: Logistic regression identified three variables associated with mortality: ICU admission between 1996 and 1998 (odds ratio [OR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.50) and the use of NIMV (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.73) were protective, and the SAPS II was aggravating (OR, 1.04 per point; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06). To better define the impact of NIMV, we performed a pairwise-matched exposed-unexposed analysis. Forty-eight patients who did and 48 who did not receive NIMV as the first ventilation method were matched for SAPS II, type of malignancy, and period of ICU admission. Crude ICU mortality rates from exposed patients and controls were 43.7% and 70.8%, respectively. NIMV remained protective from mortality after adjustment for matching variables (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.82). CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that mortality has improved over the past decade in critically ill cancer patients, even those who require MV, and suggest that this may be, in part, because of a protective effect of NIMV.","['Azoulay , E', 'Alberti , C', 'Bornstain , C', 'Leleu , G', 'Moreau , D', 'Recher , C', 'Chevret , S', 'Le Gall , J R', 'Brochard, L', 'Schlemmer , B']","['Azoulay E', 'Alberti C', 'Bornstain C', 'Leleu G', 'Moreau D', 'Recher C', 'Chevret S', 'Le Gall JR', 'Brochard L', 'Schlemmer B']","['Medical Intensive Care Unit, Saint Louis University Hospital and University Paris 7, France. elie.azoulay@sls.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,,IM,"['APACHE', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Coma/etiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Critical Illness', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality/*trends', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Paris/epidemiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Pulmonary Edema/etiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Respiration, Artificial/*methods', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/05/25 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/25 10:00'],"['2001/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003246-200103000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2001 Mar;29(3):519-25. doi: 10.1097/00003246-200103000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme, which we have shown to be critical for normal bone development in mice, is also characteristic of monohistiocytes, including alveolar macrophages, and is associated with diverse pathological conditions such as Gaucher's disease and hairy cell leukemia. TRAP activity is enhanced in serum when bone resorption is increased, and the activity is used routinely to monitor treatment responses in Gaucher's disease. We have lately shown widespread expression of the enzyme in murine tissues with particular reference to the skin, thymus, gut epithelia, and isolated dendritic cells, suggesting a possible role in immunity. To further clarify the significance of TRAP in human physiology, we have examined its distribution in non-skeletal human tissues and in CD34+ -derived human dendritic cells. TRAP mRNA determined by Northern blotting analysis was expressed abundantly in spleen, liver, colon, lung, small intestine, kidney, stomach, testis, placenta, lymph node, thymus, peripheral blood leukocyte, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Expression of TRAP protein was investigated by immunohistochemistry, with which the enzyme was identified in multiple tissues. Histochemical staining detected enzymatically active protein in spleen, lung, skin, colon, stomach, and ileum. Active TRAP was identified in CD34+ -derived immature dendritic cells and co-localized to intracellular CD63 positive organelles. When these cells were matured by induction with LPS, the TRAP activity increased fivefold and remained within the cell during the phase associated with CD63 surface expression. Our findings demonstrate widespread expression of TRAP in human tissues. Its abundant expression in epithelia and dendritic cells suggests a potential role in antigen processing and in immune responses.","['Hayman, A R', 'Macary, P', 'Lehner, P J', 'Cox, T M']","['Hayman AR', 'Macary P', 'Lehner PJ', 'Cox TM']","[""Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD63 protein, human)', '0 (Cd63 protein, mouse)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetraspanin 30)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acp5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Dendritic Cells/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*enzymology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase', 'Tetraspanin 30', 'Tissue Distribution']",2001/05/25 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/25 10:00'],"['2001/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/002215540104900601 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 2001 Jun;49(6):675-84. doi: 10.1177/002215540104900601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LARG possesses a tandem Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domain structure and, consequently, may function as an activator of Rho GTPases. In this study, we demonstrate that LARG is a functional Dbl protein. Expression of LARG in cells caused activation of the serum response factor, a known downstream target of Rho-mediated signaling pathways. Transient overexpression of LARG did not activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, suggesting LARG is not an activator of Ras, Rac, or Cdc42. We performed in vitro exchange assays where the isolated Dbl homology (DH) or DH/pleckstrin homology domains of LARG functioned as a strong activator of RhoA, but exhibited no activity toward Rac1 or Cdc42. We found that LARG could complex with RhoA, but not Rac or Cdc42, in vitro, and that expression of LARG caused an increase in the levels of the activated GTP-bound form of RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42, in vivo. Thus, we conclude that LARG is a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Finally, like activated RhoA, we determined that LARG cooperated with activated Raf-1 to transform NIH3T3 cells. These data demonstrate that LARG is the first functional Dbl protein mutated in cancer and indicate LARG-mediated activation of RhoA may play a role in the development of human leukemias.","['Reuther, G W', 'Lambert, Q T', 'Booden, M A', 'Wennerberg, K', 'Becknell, B', 'Marcucci, G', 'Sondek, J', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Der, C J']","['Reuther GW', 'Lambert QT', 'Booden MA', 'Wennerberg K', 'Becknell B', 'Marcucci G', 'Sondek J', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Der CJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7295, USA. greuther@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Serum Response Factor', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",2001/05/25 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/05/25 10:00'],"['2001/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M103565200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)89835-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jul 20;276(29):27145-51. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M103565200.

CONCLUSION: In patients in our study, the clinical and radiologic manifestations of granulocytic sarcoma were variable and occurred most commonly as disease progression in acute myeloid leukemia (73% of the patients). Granulocytic sarcoma lesions were multiple soft-tissue masses with variable enhancement, recurring in nearly 50% of patients at different sites and points of time during the course of the disease. Lesions in the central nervous system, subcutaneous tissues, and genitourinary system accounted for nearly 52% of all lesions. In general, granulocytic sarcoma masses were isodense to muscle on CT scans, and isointense and hyperintense (mild to moderate) on T1- and T2-weighted MR images, respectively. The presence of peripheral rim enhancement with hypodense or hypointense centers on T1-weighted images may, however, mimic an abscess.","['Ooi, G C', 'Chim, C S', 'Khong, P L', 'Au, W Y', 'Lie, A K', 'Tsang, K W', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Ooi GC', 'Chim CS', 'Khong PL', 'Au WY', 'Lie AK', 'Tsang KW', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Rm. 405, Block K, Pokfulam Rd., Pokfulam, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

The potent Ah receptor ligand, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), the low acute toxicity compound, 1,2,3,4,6,7,9-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HCDD), and one of the major contaminants in human milk, 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCBP), increased the activation level of caspase-3, each in a dose-dependent manner.

The rate of diagnostic concordance between each institute and the Committee on Morphological Diagnosis ranged from 76% to 80%. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes were as follows: AML M0, 27 (2%); M1, 179 (13%); M2, 472 (34%); M3, 358 (25%); M4, 265 (19%); M5, 57 (4%); M6, 39 (3%); and M7, 11 (1%). The reason for the high number of patients with AML M3 is that many M3 patients were enrolled in the AML-92 protocol, which contained all-trans-retinoic acid. AML M0, M6 and M7 belonged to the poor prognostic groups. Auer bodies were found in 284 (53%) of 538 patients who survived significantly longer than those without Auer bodies in AML-87/-89. In AML-92 except for AML M3, 259 (43%) of 602 cases were Auer+ and also showed better survival rates. The survival of patients with >50% myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive blast cells was better than those with < or =50% MPO+ blast cells in AML-87/-89. This trend was also seen in AML-92 excluding M3. AML with trilineage dysplasia (AML/TLD) is characterized as a subtype of de novo AML that shows morphological dysplasia of mature hematopoietic cells on a background of leukemic blast cells The number of patients with AML/TLD was 89 (16.5%) of 545 patients reviewed in AML-87/-89. AML-92, except for M3, showed a higher rate of patients with TLD (161 cases; 27.6%) because there were no patients with TLD in the AML M3 group. Survival rates for AML/TLD were worse than those for AML/non-TLD in both the AML-87/-89 and -92 protocols. Eighty percent of all cases (793/986) entered in AML-92 were analyzed cytogenetically. Fifty-one cases were not available for karyotyping because of a lack of mitoses or inappropriate preparations. The most frequent karyotype was normal, which accounted for 34.2%.

In this study, we examined the roles of 2 members of the MAP kinase family, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (Erk1) and Erk2, in erythropoietin (EPO)-induced erythroid differentiation and thrombopoietin (TPO)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. UT-7/GM was used as a model system because this cell line is an erythroid/megakaryocytic bipotent cell line that can be induced to differentiate into the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages by EPO and TPO, respectively. The kinetics of activation of Erk1 and Erk2 were examined during erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation of UT-7/GM cells. EPO induced a transient activation of these kinases, peaking after 1 minute of stimulation and then declining quickly almost to the basal level. In contrast, TPO-induced activation of the kinases peaked at 10 minutes and persisted for up to 60 minutes, similar to the activation by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The percentage of EPO-induced hemoglobin-positive cells was elevated by the addition of PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1 (MAP kinase/ERK kinase 1). In contrast, PD98059 clearly reduced the amount of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antigens induced by TPO on UT-7/GM cells. Thus, inactivation of Erk1 and Erk2 kinases promoted EPO-induced erythroid differentiation and suppressed TPO-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of UT-7/GM cells. In conclusion, the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 kinases may be a critical event in the determination of cell fate and the differentiation processes of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.","['Uchida, M', 'Kirito, K', 'Shimizu, R', 'Miura, Y', 'Ozawa, K', 'Komatsu, N']","['Uchida M', 'Kirito K', 'Shimizu R', 'Miura Y', 'Ozawa K', 'Komatsu N']","['Department of Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/drug effects/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/05/25 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/05/25 10:00'],"['2001/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02981906 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jan;73(1):78-83. doi: 10.1007/BF02981906.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, evidence has shown that WT1 functions during hematopoiesis and regulates the proliferation and differentiation of blood cells. Second, specific expression patterns of this gene correlate with the malignant phenotype of leukemia compared with the physiological situation. Third, mutations of WT1 can be detected, though not frequently, in human leukemia but not in normal hematopoietic cells. Thus, a possible role of WT1 in human leukemogenesis has been proposed. Because the expression of this gene is relatively high during the so-called myelodysplastic stages and in all subtypes of human leukemia compared with normal blood cells, the notion has been raised that WT1 can be used as a ""panleukemic marker"" for the diagnosis of leukemia at the molecular level. The expression level of WT1 may have significance in predicting prognosis and monitoring relapse. Moreover, with a deeper understanding of its role in leukemogenesis, WT1 may serve as a target molecule in the strategy of gene therapy for leukemia.","['Chen, Z']",['Chen Z'],"['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Suzhou University, China. szchenzx@263.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*physiology', 'WT1 Proteins']",2001/05/25 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/05/25 10:00'],"['2001/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02981901 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jan;73(1):39-46. doi: 10.1007/BF02981901.,,,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until 10 years ago, the basic medical approach to this disease was expectative and palliative. Chemotherapy with alkylating agents such as chlorambucil used to be the main therapeutic option, and only patients at advanced stages of B-CLL were treated. With the advent of new treatments such as purine analogs, high-dose therapy followed by hematopoietic progenitor support, monoclonal antibodies, and further immunotherapies, this paradigm is about to change. By using these combinations, younger patients with active disease are now treated with the goal of a long-lasting remission. More sophisticated techniques allow characterization of some of the underlying molecular genetic aberrations and (together with new serum parameters) more accurate prediction of individual prognoses than with the clinical staging systems. With the help of these developments, patients with B-CLL will be managed according to their individual risk with a watch-and-wait strategy in patients with the most indolent form of the disease, conventional chemotherapy with alkylating agents and/or purine analogs in patients at intermediate risk, and aggressive high-dose chemotherapy (followed by immunotherapy) in patients with the most aggressive form of the disease.","['Wendtner, C M', 'Schmitt, B', 'Bergmann, M', 'Rohnisch, T', 'Buhmann, R', 'Hallek, M']","['Wendtner CM', 'Schmitt B', 'Bergmann M', 'Rohnisch T', 'Buhmann R', 'Hallek M']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autoantibodies)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Autoantibodies/adverse effects', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/etiology/therapy']",2001/05/25 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/05/25 10:00'],"['2001/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02981900 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jan;73(1):32-8. doi: 10.1007/BF02981900.,,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p140-200, p110, p60, p44, and p42 frequently, and that of p95 and p55 less frequently, in primary myeloid leukemic cells, whereas M-CSF-induced phosphorylation of proteins was not detected in the normal human hematopoietic cells tested. Of these phosphoproteins, p140-200 was phosphorylated in all patients who responded to M-CSF and was considered to be almost identical to Fms, a product of the c-fms proto-oncogene. M-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was observed frequently (89%) in AML of French-American-British class M4 and infrequently in all other subtypes of AML, including M5. In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, M-CSF-induced protein phosphorylation was prominent in blast crisis but was not detected in the chronic phase. Both bone marrow immature cells and mature monocytes showed low responsiveness to M-CSF. These findings for responsiveness to M-CSF were correlated with the amount of Fms in each type of cell. We also identified tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav, Shc, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase by M-CSF in some cases. These findings clarified an M-CSF-specific pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the responsiveness to M-CSF of primary human myeloid cells. Particularly, enhanced phosphorylation responses to M-CSF and increased amounts of Fms protein were observed in restricted human hematopoietic cells with a premature myelomonocytic character.","['Hagiwara, S', 'Yagisawa, M', 'Saeki, K', 'Iki, S', 'Urabe, A', 'Mimura, T', 'Miwa, A', 'Togawa, A', 'Higashihara, M', 'Takaku, F', 'Yuo, A']","['Hagiwara S', 'Yagisawa M', 'Saeki K', 'Iki S', 'Urabe A', 'Mimura T', 'Miwa A', 'Togawa A', 'Higashihara M', 'Takaku F', 'Yuo A']","['Department of Hematology, Research Institute and Hospital, International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.88 (peptide deformylase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Amidohydrolases', 'Aminopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",2001/05/25 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/05/25 10:00'],"['2001/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02981910 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jan;73(1):100-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02981910.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part 7: Dermatoglyphic peculiarities of females with cervical and endometrial carcinoma.,75-108,"This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of neoplastic diseases like carcinoma of the cervix and endometrial carcinoma, and was based on dermatoglyphic traits and their indices of intraindividual diversity (Div), fluctuating asymmetry (FIA) and directional asymmetry (DA). The results were compared with control groups of women and men, whose data have been detailed in our previous publications (Kobyliansky et al., 1999 a-d), and with analogous data of additional cancer groups available in the literature, like acute leukemia, bronchial cancer and breast cancer. The general aims of the study were as follows: (a) to obtain a dermatoglyphic characterization of discrete and quantitative traits and their Div, DA, FIA values in cancer patients, compared to healthy control groups, both female and male; (b) to test the hypothesis that in cancer patients there is an increased level of FIA as a result of an impaired developmental homeostasis; (c) to explore the possibility of using DT (dermatoglyphic traits) data of CW (women with cancer) to predict the probability of the appearance of cervical and endometrial carcinoma in apparently healthy females at a young age. The sample consisted of 94 Israeli-Jewish women of various groups, of which 54 had endometrial carcinoma and 40 had cervical carcinoma. The prints were collected in the Tel-Hashomer Hospital. The control group was a sample of 874 healthy subjects, half of them male and the other female, all from Jewish communities of European extractions (50%) as well as from Africa (50%). All controls were adults (over 18 years of age). Interpretation of prints was performed according to Cummins & Midlo (1961) and Penrose (1968) and included identification of patterns, ridge counts and the measurement of distances and angles in the palms, 79 DT for every individual were assessed. Significant differences were found for some of the studied traits between cancer patients and their healthy control groups. We encountered merely a low sexual dimorphism between the CW and the control males as compared to that between control males and females (with significant differences in 18% of the quantitative traits vs 64% in the control). The indices of diversity and asymmetry proved more suitable for discrimination, yielding the highest discrimination level between CW and control females. This finding suggested other data in the present study which points to a similarity between CW and control males.","['Bejerano, M', 'Yakovenko, K', 'Katznelson, M B', 'Kobyliansky, E']","['Bejerano M', 'Yakovenko K', 'Katznelson MB', 'Kobyliansky E']","['Department of Anatomy and Anthropology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Z Morphol Anthropol,Zeitschrift fur Morphologie und Anthropologie,0413640,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Dermatoglyphics', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*genetics']",2001/05/25 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/05/25 10:00'],"['2001/05/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/25 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Z Morphol Anthropol. 2001;83(1):75-108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This enzyme is specifically activated in most malignant tumors but is usually inactive in normal somatic cells, suggesting that telomerase plays an important role in cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis. Terminal maturation of tumor cells has been associated with the repression of telomerase activity. Using maturation-sensitive and -resistant NB4 cell lines, we analyzed the pattern of telomerase expression during the therapeutic treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by retinoids. Two pathways leading to the down-regulation of hTERT and telomerase activity were identified. The first pathway results in a rapid down-regulation of telomerase that is associated with retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-dependent maturation of NB4 cells. Furthermore, during NB4 cell maturation, obtained independently of RAR by retinoic X receptor (RXR)-specific agonists (rexinoids), no change in telomerase activity was observed, suggesting that hTERT regulation requires a specific signaling and occurs autonomously. A second pathway of hTERT regulation, identified in the RAR-responsive, maturation-resistant NB4-R1 cell line, results in a down-regulation of telomerase that develops slowly during two weeks of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. This pathway leads to telomere shortening, growth arrest, and cell death, all events that are overcome by ectopic expression of hTERT. These findings demonstrate a clear and full dissociation between the process of tumor cell maturation and the regulation of hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity by retinoids. We propose telomerase expression as an efficient and selective target of retinoids in the therapy of tumors.","['Pendino, F', 'Flexor, M', 'Delhommeau, F', 'Buet, D', 'Lanotte, M', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, E']","['Pendino F', 'Flexor M', 'Delhommeau F', 'Buet D', 'Lanotte M', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U496, Centre G.

OBJECTIVES: To study the distribution of CD5 immunoreactivity in tissue sections of a variety of benign and malignant breast lesions using the antibody CD5-4C7 and to compare the results with those obtained with 2 other commercially available CD5 antibodies (CD5/54/F6, Dako, Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK, and CD5/54/B4, Novocastra). DESIGN: Paraffin sections of 102 breast biopsy specimens with various diagnoses were examined using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex technique. SETTING: The histopathology department of a tertiary referral teaching hospital. RESULTS: The staining results obtained with CD5-4C7 were different from those obtained with the other 2 antibodies. With 4C7, the normal and benign biopsy specimens showed varying numbers of positive epithelial cells and lymphocytes. Heterogeneous positive staining was also present in 47 (78%) of 60 invasive female breast carcinomas and in all 3 male breast carcinomas examined. A statistically significant correlation was found between CD5 positivity and tumor grade, with grade 3 tumors being less likely to be CD5 positive than grades 1 and 2 (P =.0035). No correlation was found between CD5 positivity and patient's age, tumor histologic type, axillary lymph node status, or progesterone receptors. On the other hand, the CD5/54/F6 and CD5/54/B4 antibodies only stained lymphocytes and occasional normal breast ducts, mostly those showing apocrine metaplasia. All other normal benign and malignant epithelial cells were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Positive staining for CD5 using the antibody 4C7 is seen in normal and benign breast tissue and 78% of invasive breast carcinomas. The positivity is more common in low-grade tumors. No significant staining was seen with the 2 other CD5 clones used in this study. The significance of the positive staining obtained with CD5-4C7 is not obvious, but this clone may be more sensitive than the others, or it may be recognizing an epitope shared by another antigen.","['Walsh, R', 'Peston, D', 'Shousha, S']","['Walsh R', 'Peston D', 'Shousha S']","['Department of Histopathology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Charing Cross Hospital, London, England.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Breast/anatomy & histology/immunology', 'Breast Diseases/*immunology/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male/immunology/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibrocystic Breast Disease/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques/*methods', 'Male', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",2001/05/24 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/05/24 10:00'],"['2001/05/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/2001-125-0781-COISOD [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2001 Jun;125(6):781-4. doi: 10.5858/2001-125-0781-COISOD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied whether gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs could prevent the early onset of ovarian insufficiency postchemotherapy and protect fertility. METHODS: The patients were divided into three groups: Control group 1 (Group A), premenarchal patients aged 3 to 7.5 years (n = 5), were not given GnRH analogs administered prior to PCT. Postmenarchal patients (Group B), aged 14.7 to 20 years (n = 12) with normal menstrual rhythm and ovulatory cycles, received treatment with GnRH analogs prior to PCT. Control group 2 (Group C), postmenarchal patients aged 15.9 to 20 years (n = 4), received PCT but no GnRH analog protection. All groups received the PCT regimens CAVPE, CVPP, ABVD, TAMO, ARA-C, and MTT. In group B, leuprolide acetate inhibition was obtained with a depot injection administered each month before and during treatment with PCT. To accelerate the timing of ovarian regression, a subcutaneous injection (0.2 mg) was administered simultaneously. RESULTS: In Group A, patients had spontaneous menarche between the ages of 12 and 17.9 years, followed by normal menstruation and ovulatory cycles. Three patients became pregnant. After GnRH analog withdrawal, Group B patients continued with normal ovulatory cycles. Two patients became pregnant. Group C patients presented hypergonadotrophic hypoestrogenic amenorrhea. CONCLUSION: GnRH analog treatment before and during PCT enhances ovarian function and preserves adolescent fertility. The results must be confirmed in a larger study.","['Pereyra Pacheco, B', 'Mendez Ribas, J M', 'Milone, G', 'Fernandez, I', 'Kvicala, R', 'Mila, T', 'Di Noto, A', 'Contreras Ortiz, O', 'Pavlovsky, S']","['Pereyra Pacheco B', 'Mendez Ribas JM', 'Milone G', 'Fernandez I', 'Kvicala R', 'Mila T', 'Di Noto A', 'Contreras Ortiz O', 'Pavlovsky S']","['Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology Section, Hospital de Clinicas, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. pereyrapachecob@vianetworks.com.ar']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gynecol Oncol,Gynecologic oncology,0365304,"['0 (Fertility Agents, Female)', 'EFY6W0M8TG (Leuprolide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fertility/*drug effects', 'Fertility Agents, Female/*therapeutic use', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infertility/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Leuprolide/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Menstrual Cycle/drug effects', 'Ovary/*drug effects/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Thymoma/drug therapy']",2001/05/24 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/24 10:00'],"['2001/05/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/gyno.2001.6181 [doi]', 'S0090825801961815 [pii]']",ppublish,Gynecol Oncol. 2001 Jun;81(3):391-7. doi: 10.1006/gyno.2001.6181.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the selectivity of melittin effect on the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from L1210 cells using various inhibitors. A systemic lipid analysis by HPLC and GLC revealed that melittin induced release of various FFAs including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FFAs. Various PLA2 inhibitors examined exerted only minimal effects on the melittin-induced arachidonic acid (AA) and palmitic acid (PAL) releases. Specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (U73122) and diacylglycerol lipase (RHC80267) exerted significant inhibitory effects on both AA and PAL releases. These results suggest that melittin-induced FFA release is most likely due to multiple participations of various types of lipases. Since BAPTA/AM, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, did not influence the FFA release, the Ca2+ influxed by melittin appeared not to be a key factor for the FFA release. The mimicking of the melittin-induced FFA release by digitonin, a membrane-permeabilizing agent, implies that the membrane-perturbing action of melittin is likely the cause of the FFA release. Melittin also induced release of multiple FFAs from other cell lines including P388D1 and HL60. The rapid melittin-stimulated phospholipase D (PLD) observed in L1210 cells appeared not directly related to the steady release of FFA, as indicated by the fact that the PLD was not blocked by RHC80267. In view of melittin's multiple effects on the composition of cellular lipids, we conclude that melittin does neither exclusively release any single FFA nor selectively activate PLA2 in L1210 cells. The problem of using melittin as a PLA2 activator is discussed.","['Lee, S Y', 'Park, H S', 'Lee, S J', 'Choi, M U']","['Lee SY', 'Park HS', 'Lee SJ', 'Choi MU']","['School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering and Center for Molecular Catalysis, Seoul National University, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Estrenes)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '112648-68-7', '(1-(6-((3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', '83654-05-1 (1,6-bis(cyclohexyloximinocarbonyl)hexane)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cyclohexanones/pharmacology', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Estrenes/pharmacology', 'Ethidium', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Melitten/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Palmitic Acid/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2001/05/24 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/24 10:00'],"['2001/05/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(01)92314-8 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.2001.2314 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2001 May 1;389(1):57-67. doi: 10.1006/abbi.2001.2314.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) resulted in several transient, early-onset, temporally integrated events that were detected immunohistochemically. Macrophages infiltrated the olfactory epithelium (OE) by 16 hours post-OBX. LIF expression was up-regulated transiently at 2 days post-OBX, when up-regulated expression of LIFR also was detected on globose basal cells (GBCs), a subpopulation of which are immediate progenitors of olfactory receptor neurons. GBC proliferation peaked at 3--4 days post-OBX. In the olfactory nerve (ON), LIF-positive and IL-6-positive macrophage infiltration was followed by the transient up-regulation of expression of LIFR, IL-6, and IL-6R in ensheathing cells by 3 days post-OBX. The mRNAs for LIF/LIFR, IL-6/IL-6R, and their common signal-transduction molecule, gp130, in olfactory-nasal mucosa from control mice and from 3-day post-OBX mice were detected with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Analysis of Northern blot and relative quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated similar temporal patterns of changes in relative mRNA levels for both LIF and IL-6, which were up-regulated by 16 hours post-OBX and peaked at 2--3 days post-OBX. These data indicate that LIF from infiltrating macrophages acts as a mitogen for GBCs and that LIF from infiltrating macrophages and IL-6 from infiltrating macrophages and ensheathing cells act as repair factors in the ON.","['Nan, B', 'Getchell, M L', 'Partin, J V', 'Getchell, T V']","['Nan B', 'Getchell ML', 'Partin JV', 'Getchell TV']","['Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Comp Neurol,The Journal of comparative neurology,0406041,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Denervation', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/analysis/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*genetics', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/*physiology', 'Nerve Regeneration/immunology', 'Olfactory Bulb/chemistry/physiology/surgery', 'Olfactory Mucosa/chemistry/cytology/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/analysis/*genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/cytology/physiology']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cne.1193 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comp Neurol. 2001 Jun 18;435(1):60-77. doi: 10.1002/cne.1193.,['R01 AG-16824-19/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ouhammouch & Brody (Nucleic Acids Research 20, 5443-5450, 1992) suggested that retroviral recombination rates should increase as temperature increases.

(Biotechniques 19, 806-812, 814-815, 1985) found that at low temperature the tightly folded structure of RNAs may hinder reverse transcription proceeding along the RNA template, which increases its chance of dissociating from the template; therefore, raising the reaction temperature was the simplest way to overcome template secondary structure and prevent premature termination of cDNA synthesis. In this report, two vectors based on murine leukaemia virus (MLV) were constructed. The first contained two mutated gfp genes in tandem positions. The upstream gfp gene encoded a mutation at its 3' end, while the downstream gfp gene encoded a mutation at its 5' end. The recombination that occurred between the two mutated gfp genes restored a functional gfp gene. The cells that contained the functional gfp gene were green when observed under a fluorescence microscope. The second MLV vector contained a functional gfp gene with two identical sequences flanking either end. A recombination that occurred between the two identical sequences resulted in deletion of the gfp gene. Cells containing the vector with the gfp deletion were colourless or clear when observed under the microscope. Using these two vectors, we have demonstrated that retroviral recombination is temperature dependent and the rate of recombination decreases as temperature is raised from 31 to 43 degrees C.","['Li, Ting', 'Zhang, Jiayou']","['Li T', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Combs Research Bldg Room 206, 800 Rose Street, KY 40536-0096, Lexington, USA1.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Combs Research Bldg Room 206, 800 Rose Street, KY 40536-0096, Lexington, USA1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Genes, Viral/*genetics', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Helper Viruses/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic/*genetics', 'Temperature']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-82-6-1359 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2001 Jun;82(Pt 6):1359-1364. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-82-6-1359.,['CA70407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-82-6-1359 [doi],,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of the B-cell stimulating cytokines IL-5 and IL-6, and the immuno-suppressive cytokine IL-10, during primary and secondary immune responses in mice against infection with Friend retrovirus (FV) (Murine leukaemia virus). IL-5(-/-) mice were comparable to C57BL/6 wild-type mice in their ability to control acute FV infection. In contrast, IL-6(-/-) and IL-10(-/-) mice showed significantly enhanced virus loads in spleen cells. However, this impaired control of acute FV replication did not alter the long-term control over persistent FV in IL-6(-/-) and IL-10(-/-) mice. Immunization with a live attenuated vaccine virus prior to challenge protected all three types of cytokine-deficient mice from high levels of spleen virus, despite the finding that the vaccinated IL-5- and IL-6-deficient mice had significantly reduced titres of virus-neutralizing IgG class antibodies. The results indicate that IL-6 and IL-10 contribute to primary immune responses against FV, but are dispensable during persistent infection and vaccine-primed secondary responses.","['Strestik, Beatrice D', 'Olbrich, Anke R M', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Strestik BD', 'Olbrich ARM', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Dittmer U']","['Institut fur Virologie der Universitat Wurzburg, Versbacher Str.7, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany1.', 'Institut fur Virologie der Universitat Wurzburg, Versbacher Str.7, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany1.', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, MT 59840, Hamilton, USA2.', 'Institut fur Virologie der Universitat Wurzburg, Versbacher Str.7, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-5/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-6/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/virology', 'Spleen/immunology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/virology', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/immunology', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-82-6-1349 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2001 Jun;82(Pt 6):1349-1354. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-82-6-1349.,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-82-6-1349 [doi],,,,,,,,,,

The DNA-binding specificity of many of these Hox proteins is modulated by the heterodimerization with partners, such as the Pbx proteins. This cooperative heterodimerization is accomplished through a conserved hexapeptide motif found N-terminal to the Hox DNA-binding homeodomain. Several human leukemias have been associated with a chromosomal translocation involving either the Hox gene (i.e., NUP98/HOXA9) or the gene encoding Pbx1 (E2A/PBX1). The transforming ability of these fusion oncoproteins relies at least partially on the ability to interact with one another through this hexapeptide motif. Herein we describe NMR structural calculations of the hexapeptide of HoxB1 (Nalpha-acetyl-Thr-Phe-Asp-Trp-Met-Lys-amide) that has been shown to mediate binding between HoxB1 and Pbx1 and a hexapeptide consensus sequence (Nalpha-acetyl-Leu-Phe-Pro-Trp-Met-Arg-amide). The consensus peptide exists in two conformations caused by cis-trans isomerization of the Phe-Pro peptide bond. The structures of the HoxB1 peptide and the trans form of the consensus peptide reveal a turn very similar to that found as part of the HoxB1/Pbx1/DNA complex in the X-ray crystal structure. This observation implies that this region is at least partially 'preformed' and thus ready to interact with Pbx1 and stabilize binding of Pbx1 and HoxB1 to DNA. The structural results presented here provide a starting point for synthesizing potential nonpeptide or cyclical peptide antagonists that mimic the interaction of these transcriptional cofactors resulting in a potential chemotherapeutic for certain types of leukemias.","['Slupsky, C M', 'Sykes, D B', 'Gay, G L', 'Sykes, B D']","['Slupsky CM', 'Sykes DB', 'Gay GL', 'Sykes BD']","['Protein Engineering Network of Centres of Excellence, Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2H7, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Peptides/*chemistry', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Software', 'Temperature', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1110/ps.50901 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 2001 Jun;10(6):1244-53. doi: 10.1110/ps.50901.,,,,,,,PMC2374006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated this association in a population-based case-control study carried out in the province of Quebec, CANADA: METHODS: A total of 491 incident cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1993 and aged 0-9 years were included in the study. Healthy controls (n = 491) matched on age, sex, and region of residence at the time of diagnosis were selected from government family allowance files. Using a structured questionnaire and the International Classification of Diseases (Ninth Revision) list of congenital anomalies, presence of an anomaly was determined by interviewing the parents of the study subjects; mothers gave information on anomalies in the study subject, their siblings and her family, whereas fathers provided information on anomalies in their family. RESULTS: The adjusted risk for ALL was not increased in children who had any anomaly (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07 [95% CI : 0.70-1.65]) whereas compared to control siblings, case siblings had a higher risk of anomalies (OR = 1.54, 95% CI : 0.99- 2.42). This increase was likely due to excesses in anomalies of the heart (OR = 2.49, 95% CI : 1.23-5.04). Risk for ALL was elevated in children with a history of a congenital anomaly in their mother (OR = 1.61, 95% CI : 0.80-3.22) or her family (OR = 1.45, 95% CI : 0.94-2.25).

However, the cytogenetic and clinical significance of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is still unclear. To address this point, cytogenetic findings in 50 cases of ATLL were correlated with clinical characteristics. Karyotypes showed a high degree of diversity and complexity. Aneuploidy and multiple breaks (at least 6) were observed frequently in acute and lymphoma subtypes of ATLL. Breakpoints tended to cluster at specific chromosomal regions, although characteristic cytogenetic subgroups of abnormalities were not found. Of these, aberrations of chromosomes 1p, 1q, 1q10-21, 10p, 10p13, 12q, 14q, and 14q32 correlated with one or more of the following clinical features: hepatosplenomegaly, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, hypercalcemia, and unusual immunophenotype, all indicators of clinical severity of ATLL.

This study also indicates that one model of an oncogenic mechanism, activation of a proto-oncogene by translocation of a T-cell-receptor gene, may not be applicable to the main pathway of development of ATLL and that a multistep process of leukemogenesis is required for the development of ATLL.

Little is known about MDR1 expression during the development of disease. The present study investigated whether MDR1 gene- related clonal selection occurs in the development from diagnosis to relapsed AML, using a genetic polymorphism of the MDR1 gene at position 2677. Expression and function of P-gp were studied using monoclonal antibodies MRK16 and UIC2 and the Rhodamine 123 retention assay with or without PSC 833. No difference was found in the levels of P-gp function and expression between diagnosis and relapse in purified paired blast samples from 30 patients with AML. Thirteen patients were homozygous for the genetic polymorphism of MDR1 (n = 7 for guanine, n = 6 for thymidine), whereas 17 patients were heterozygous (GT). In the heterozygous patients, no selective loss of one allele was observed at relapse. Homozygosity for the MDR1 gene (GG or TT) was associated with shorter relapse-free intervals (P =.002) and poor survival rates (P =.02), compared with heterozygous patients. No difference was found in P-gp expression or function in patients with AML with either of the allelic variants of the MDR1 gene. It was concluded that P-gp function or expression is not upregulated at relapse/refractory disease and expression of one of the allelic variants is not associated with altered P-gp expression or function in AML, consistent with the fact that MDR1 gene-related clonal selection does not occur when AML evolves to recurrent disease.

Polymerase chain reactions and single-stranded conformational polymorphism analyses were used to examine 140 elderly AML patients enrolled in the Southwest Oncology Group study 9031 for FLT3, RAS, and TP53 mutations, which were found in 34%, 19%, and 9% of patients, respectively. All but one of the FLT3 (46 of 47) mutations were internal tandem duplications (ITDs) within exons 11 and 12. In the remaining case, a novel internal tandem triplication was found in exon 11. FLT3 ITDs were associated with higher white blood cell counts, higher peripheral blast percentages, normal cytogenetics, and less disease resistance. All RAS mutations (28 of 28) were missense point mutations in codons 12, 13, or 61. RAS mutations were associated with lower peripheral blast and bone marrow blast percentages. Only 2 of 47 patients with FLT3 ITDs also had a RAS mutation, indicating a significant negative association between FLT3 and RAS mutations (P =.0013). Most TP53 mutations (11 of 12) were missense point mutations in exons 5 to 8 and were associated with abnormal cytogenetics, especially abnormalities in both chromosomes 5 and 7. FLT3 and RAS mutations were not associated with inferior clinical outcomes, but TP53 mutations were associated with a worse overall survival (median 1 versus 8 months, P =.0007). These results indicate that mutations in FLT3, RAS, or TP53 are common in older patients with AML and are associated with specific AML phenotypes as defined by laboratory values, cytogenetics, and clinical outcomes.

The CML patients with deletions had a shorter survival time and a high relapse rate following bone marrow transplant. Since deletions are associated with both Ph(+) CML and ALL, it seemed probable that other leukemia-associated genomic rearrangements may also have submicroscopic deletions. This hypothesis was confirmed by the detection of deletions of the 3' regions of the CBFB and the MLL genes in AML M4 patients with inv(16) and in patients with ALL and AML associated with MLL gene translocations, respectively. In contrast, analysis of the AML M3 group of patients and AML M2 showed that similar large deletions were not frequently associated with the t(15;17) or t(8;21) translocations. Analysis of sequence data from each of the breakpoint regions suggested that large submicroscopic deletions occur in regions with a high overall density of Alu sequence repeats. These findings are the first to show that the process of deletion formation is not disease specific in leukemia and also implicate that the presence of repetitive DNA in the vicinity of breakpoint regions may facilitate the generation of submicroscopic deletions. Such deletions could lead to the loss of one or more genes, and the associated haploinsufficiency may result in the observed differences in clinical behavior.

The use of MFC for RD monitoring assumes that AML cells identified by their immunophenotype at diagnosis can be detected during remission and at relapse. AML cells from 136 patients were immunophenotyped by MFC at diagnosis and at first relapse using 9 panels of 3 monoclonal antibodies. Immunophenotype changes occurred in 124 patients (91%); they consisted of gains or losses of discrete leukemia cell populations resolved by MFC (42 patients) and gains or losses of antigens on leukemia cell populations present at both time points (108 patients). Antigen expression defining unusual phenotypes changed frequently: CD13, CD33, and CD34, absent at diagnosis in 3, 33, and 47 cases, respectively, were gained at relapse in 2 (67%), 15 (45%), and 17 (36%); CD56, CD19, and CD14, present at diagnosis in 5, 16, and 20 cases, were lost at relapse in 2 (40%), 6 (38%), and 8 (40%). Leukemia cell gates created in pretreatment samples using each 3-antibody panel allowed identification of relapse AML cells in only 68% to 91% of cases, but use of 8 3-antibody panels, which included antibodies to a total of 16 antigens, allowed identification of relapse AML cells in all cases. Thus, the immunophenotype of AML cells is markedly unstable; nevertheless, despite this instability, MFC has the potential to identify RD in AML if multiple antibody panels are used at all time points.

In this study, the levels of expression of both BCR-ABL and subunit 2c of IFN-alpha receptor (IFN-alphaR2c) genes were analyzed at diagnosis in 74 patients with chronic phase CML treated with an IFN-alpha monotherapy. By using blood samples, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BCR-ABL, IFN-alphaR2c, and G6PDH mRNA as external control. The results were compared with hematologic and cytogenetic responses to IFN-alpha. A wide variation in the BCR-ABL/G6PDH ratio was observed at diagnosis (median, 6.68%; range, 0.18%-41.31%), but no significant association with response to IFN-alpha was observed. In contrast, the variation of IFN-alphaR2c/G6PDH ratio at diagnosis was significantly associated with the achievement of major cytogenetic response (MCR; 34% or lower Ph(+) metaphases). Median values of IFN-alphaR2c/G6PDH ratio for patients achieving MCR and for those who did not achieve it were 110.75% (range, 9.47%-612.30%) and 64.42% (range, 5.96%-425.40%), respectively (P =.037). In addition, this novel molecular factor, combined with the achievement of complete hematologic response at 3 months, makes it possible to predict MCR achievement with high probability by Kaplan-Meier analysis (91% +/- 17% at 24 months; P =.0001).

The mutant c-Kit receptor confers cytokine-independent survival of leukemia cells and induces tumorigenicity. Changes in the signal transduction pathways responsible for Asp(816) mutant c-Kit-mediated biologic effects are largely undefined. The results of this study show that Asp(816) mutant c-Kit induces constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT1, and up-regulates STAT3 downstream targets, Bcl-x(L) and c-myc. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway, but not the Ras-mediated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, is also constitutively activated by Asp(816) mutant c-Kit. Suppression of STAT3 activation by a dominant negative molecule in MO7e leukemia cells transduced with mutant c-kit inhibits stem cell factor (SCF)-independent survival and proliferation, accompanied by the down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) and c-myc. However, activated STAT3 does not appear to be the sole mediator that is responsible for the phenotypic changes induced by Asp(816) mutant c-Kit, because expression of constitutively activated STAT3 in MO7e cells does not completely reconstitute cytokine independence. Activation of other signaling components by mutant c-Kit, such as those in the PI-3K/Akt pathway, is demonstrated and may also be needed for the mutant c-Kit-mediated biologic effects. The investigation of altered signal transduction pathways and the resulting functional consequences mediated by Asp(816) mutant c-Kit should provide important information for the characterization of subsets of leukemia and potential molecular pathways for therapeutic targeting.

Flow cytometric experiments have shown that imexon treatment is associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) in imexon-sensitive myeloma cell lines and NB-4 cells. In contrast, reduction of Deltapsi(m) and increased levels of ROS were not observed in imexon-resistant U266 cells. Treatment of imexon-sensitive RPMI 8226 cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) protects cells against these effects of imexon. Mitochondrial swelling was observed by electron microscopy in RPMI 8226 myeloma cells treated with 180 microM imexon as early as 4 hours. Damage to mitochondrial DNA was detected by a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assay in imexon-treated RPMI 8226 cells; however, nuclear DNA was not affected. Finally, partial protection of RPMI 8226 cells against the imexon effects was achieved by treatment with theonyltrifluoroacetone, an inhibitor of superoxide production at mitochondrial complex II. These changes are consistent with mitochondrial oxidation and apoptotic signaling as mediators of the growth inhibitory effects of imexon. Interestingly, oxidative damage and decrease of Deltapsi(m) induced by imexon highly correlates with sensitivity to imexon in several myeloma cell lines and an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line.

Ly-9 belongs to the CD2 subset of the immunoglobulin superfamily, an emerging family of cell signaling receptors. Recently, a partial human Ly-9 complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence has been described. Full-length cDNA clones were isolated that included the initiation codon, the sequence encoding the full signal peptide, and 14 amino acids more in the cytoplasmic domain than in the previously reported clone. The predicted extracellular domain of human Ly-9 contains 4 immunoglobulinlike domains, similar to those in mouse Ly-9. Northern blot analysis revealed that the human Ly-9 messenger RNA (2.6 kb) is expressed predominantly in lymph node, spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were raised against human Ly-9 by immunizing mice with the pre-B-cell line 300.19 stably transfected with human Ly-9 full-length cDNA. These mAbs strongly stained the surfaces of cells transfected with human Ly-9 cDNA but not of untransfected cells. Human Ly-9 expression was restricted to T and B lymphocytes and thymocytes, with the highest levels of expression on CD4(+)CD8(-) and CD4(-)CD8(+) thymocytes. Monocytes, granulocytes, platelets, and red blood cells were uniformly negative for Ly-9. These mAbs immunoprecipitated major polypeptides of 120 kd from the transfected cells and 120 kd and 100 kd from B-cell line Daudi, probably because of the cell-surface-expressed isoforms. These data demonstrate that human Ly-9 is a new marker for the study of normal and malignant leukocytes.

A novel gene-transfer approach was used by which rapid induction of pure apoptosis can be selectively achieved in a transfected tumor cell population following exposure to a semisynthetic dimerizing ligand, AP20187. Inoculation of BALB/c mice with apoptotic and viable 12B1-D1 leukemia cells, at a 12:1 ratio subcutaneously, led to early tumor growth. Heat stress up-regulated the expression of membrane heat shock proteins (HSP72 and HSP60) on apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells, and stressed apoptotic cells were capable of generating a T-cell-mediated specific antitumor response. Pulsing of stressed apoptotic leukemia cells onto syngeneic dendritic cells resulted largely in rejection of coinjected viable 12B1-D1 cells. Mice rejecting the primary 12B1-D1 inoculum were immune to the same but not to a different leukemia challenge. Our findings indicate that tumor immunogenicity is dependent on whether cells are stressed before apoptosis induction and suggest that the immune system is capable of distinguishing between stressed and nonstressed cells undergoing programmed cell death.

To determine whether further stimulation with filgrastim after transplantation would affect hematopoietic recovery, a prospective, randomized, controlled study was performed. Forty-two adult recipients of allogeneic blood stem cells from human leukocyte antigen-matched related donors were randomized to receive 10 microg/kg per day filgrastim subcutaneously from day 1 through neutrophil recovery or no growth factor support after transplantation. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the number of CD34(+) cells infused (median, 4.8 vs 4.3 x 10(6)/kg). Graft-versus-host (GVHD) disease prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and steroids for 9 patients and tacrolimus and minimethotrexate for 33 patients. The group receiving filgrastim had a shorter time to neutrophil levels greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L (day 12 vs day 15, P =.002) and to neutrophil levels greater than 1.0 x 10(9)/L (day 12 vs day 16, P =.01).

There was no significant difference between the groups in time to platelet recovery, number of transfusions, regimen-related toxicity, infection, incidence of GVHD, relapse, survival, or hospital charges.

In a canine HCT model, a combination of postgrafting mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and cyclosporine (CSP) allowed stable allogeneic engraftment after minimally toxic conditioning with low-dose (200 cGy) total-body irradiation (TBI). These findings, together with the known antitumor effects of donor leukocyte infusions (DLIs), led to the design of this trial. Forty-five patients (median age 56 years) with hematologic malignancies, HLA-identical sibling donors, and relative contraindications to conventional HCT were treated. Immunosuppression involved TBI of 200 cGy before and CSP/MMF after HCT. DLIs were given after HCT for persistent malignancy, mixed chimerism, or both. Regimen toxicities and myelosuppression were mild, allowing 53% of eligible patients to have entirely outpatient transplantations. Nonfatal graft rejection occurred in 20% of patients. Grades II to III acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 47% of patients with sustained engraftment. With median follow-up of 417 days, survival was 66.7%, nonrelapse mortality 6.7%, and relapse mortality 26.7%. Fifty-three percent of patients with sustained engraftment were in complete remission, including 8 with molecular remissions. This novel allografting approach, based on the use of postgrafting immunosuppression to control graft rejection and GVHD, has dramatically reduced the acute toxicities of allografting. HCT with the induction of potent graft-versus-tumor effects can be performed in previously ineligible patients, largely in an outpatient setting. Future protocol modifications should reduce rejection and GVHD, thereby facilitating studies of allogeneic immunotherapy for a variety of malignancies.

Patients were classified into 3 risk groups. Group A (resected stage I and abdominal stage II) received 2 courses of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone. Group B (patients not eligible for groups A or C) received 5 courses of chemotherapy with, in addition, high-dose methotrexate, 3 g/m(2) over 3 hours; infusional cytarabine; and intrathecal (IT) methotrexate.

This study was a phase 1 trial of orally administered R115777 in 35 adults with poor-risk acute leukemias. Cohorts of patients received R115777 at doses ranging from 100 mg twice daily (bid) to 1200 mg bid for up to 21 days. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 1200 mg bid, with central neurotoxicity evidenced by ataxia, confusion, and dysarthria. Non-dose-limiting toxicities included reversible nausea, renal insufficiency, polydipsia, paresthesias, and myelosuppression. R115777 inhibited FT activity at 300 mg bid and farnesylation of FT substrates lamin A and HDJ-2 at 600 mg bid. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), an effector enzyme of Ras-mediated signaling, was detected in its phosphorylated (activated) form in 8 (36.4%) of 22 pretreatment marrows and became undetectable in 4 of those 8 after one cycle of treatment. Pharmacokinetics revealed a linear relationship between dose and maximum plasma concentration or area under the curve over 12 hours at all dose levels. Weekly marrow samples demonstrated that R115777 accumulated in bone marrow in a dose-dependent fashion, with large increases in marrow drug levels beginning at 600 mg bid and with sustained levels throughout drug administration. Clinical responses occurred in 10 (29%) of the 34 evaluable patients, including 2 complete remissions. Genomic analyses failed to detect N-ras gene mutations in any of the 35 leukemias. The results of this first clinical trial of a signal transduction inhibitor in patients with acute leukemias suggest that inhibitors of FT may have important clinical antileukemic activity.

METHODS: Eighty four children with cancer were tested for susceptibility to the circulating strains of influenza virus in autumn 1995 and 1996. Non-immunised children were reassessed the following spring for serological evidence of natural infection. Forty two patients received two doses of influenza vaccine. These children were receiving continuing chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or were within six months of completing chemotherapy. RESULTS: Among the 84 children tested for influenza virus susceptibility only 8% of patients were fully protected (antibody titres >/= 40) against all three of the prevalent influenza virus strains; 33% were susceptible to all three viruses. Evidence of acquired natural infection was seen in 30% of unimmunised patients. Among immunised susceptible patients, 66% made some protective response to the vaccine and 55% showed protective antibody titres to all three viral strains following vaccination. Older age was associated with increased response to the H1N1 and H3N2 vaccine components, but total white cell count or neutrophil count at immunisation, type of cancer, or length of time on treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia did not affect response. CONCLUSIONS: Most children with cancer studied were at risk of influenza infection. A significant response to immunisation was seen, supporting annual influenza vaccination for children being treated for cancer.","['Chisholm, J C', 'Devine, T', 'Charlett, A', 'Pinkerton, C R', 'Zambon, M']","['Chisholm JC', 'Devine T', 'Charlett A', 'Pinkerton CR', 'Zambon M']","[""Children's Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Down's Rd, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5PT, UK. julia.chisholm@gosh-tr.nthames.nhs.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Influenza Vaccines)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/immunology', 'Influenza B virus/immunology', 'Influenza Vaccines/*immunology', 'Influenza, Human/complications/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Linear Models', 'Normal Distribution', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*immunology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.84.6.496 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2001 Jun;84(6):496-500. doi: 10.1136/adc.84.6.496.,,,,,,,PMC1718812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report evidence for an enhanced activity of DNA polymerase beta, one of the repair enzymes, concomitant to the activation of the pathway phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT-1 (PI-3-kinase/AKT-1), which delivers a survival signal in Friend erythroleukemia cells exposed to 15 Gy. Significantly, the preincubation of the cellls with PI-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002, disactivating this pathway, sensitizes the cells to ionizing radiation by further reducing the rate of proliferation without substantial variations of the number of dead cells. Thus, we suggest a role for these enzymes in maintaining survival programs upon exposure to ionizing radiation and in giving to these cells a chance to recover from this stress.","['Cataldi, A', 'Zauli, G', 'Di Pietro, R', 'Castorina, S', 'Rana, R']","['Cataldi A', 'Zauli G', 'Di Pietro R', 'Castorina S', 'Rana R']","['Dipartimento di Biomorfologia, Facolta di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita di Chieti, Via dei Vestini, 6, 66100, Chieti, Italy. a.cataldi@morpho.unich.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/physiology/radiation effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'DNA Repair/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Signal Transduction/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(01)00147-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0898-6568(01)00147-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2001 May;13(5):369-75. doi: 10.1016/s0898-6568(01)00147-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plasma parameters were measured by ELISA or chromogenic studies. The TF transcription was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. The results indicated that the blast cell procoagulant activity (PCA), TF antigen of APL cell lysate, as well as the transcription of APL TF mRNA elevated at diagnosis, were reduced after ATRA or As(2)O(3) therapy. The plasma level of P-selectin, TF, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), soluble fibrinmonomer complex, thrombomodulin (TM), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), plasmin-antiplasmin complex, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) and its receptor (u-PAR), and D-dimer (D-D) significantly increased. Fibrinogen (Fg), antigen level of protein C (PC), plasminogen (PLG) activity, alpha(2)-plasminogen inhibitor activity (alpha(2)-PI), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity were decreased at diagnosis. The protein C activity (PC:A) and protein S (PS) remained unchanged. All the parameters were restored to normal ranges after complete remission (CR) except elevation of TF and TAT in both groups, as well as PC:A, PS, and t-PA in the ATRA group. In conclusion, there existed activation of platelets and consumption of anticoagulants as well as activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic system before treatment. Both ATRA and As(2)O(3) therapy downregulated the expression of TF mRNA, decreased the PCA and TF level in APL cells, significantly inhibited coagulation activation, corrected secondary hyperfibrinolysis and the other hemostatic abnormalities, and thus greatly improved the bleeding symptom in early stage of the treatment.","['Zhao, W', 'Wang, H', 'Wang, X', 'Wu, F', 'Guo, W', 'Qu, B', 'Shen, Z', 'Wang, Z']","['Zhao W', 'Wang H', 'Wang X', 'Wu F', 'Guo W', 'Qu B', 'Shen Z', 'Wang Z']","[""Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, 197 Rui Jin Road II, 200025, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Hemostatics)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control', 'Hemostasis/*drug effects', 'Hemostatics/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-3848(01)00233-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-3848(01)00233-x [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2001 May 1;102(3):197-204. doi: 10.1016/s0049-3848(01)00233-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study group included three subgroups: (1) 15 CLL patients, (2) 4 CLL patients with trisomy 12, (3) 3 CLL patients with deletions in 13q14. Five healthy individuals served as a control group. Monocolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for c-myc, HER-2/neu, and p53 was applied to lymphocyte nuclei for the evaluation of replication timing. Asynchronous replication (SD) rate was significantly higher in all CLL patients (P < 0.01) when compared to the control group and was even higher in the group of CLL patients with trisomy 12 and 13q14 deletion (P < 0.01).

The high correlation between cells with trisomy 12 and SD pattern could reflect direct influence of the aberration on gene replication and cell cycle control.","['Amiel, A', 'Elis, A', 'Sherker, S', 'Gaber, E', 'Manor, Y', 'Fejgin, M D']","['Amiel A', 'Elis A', 'Sherker S', 'Gaber E', 'Manor Y', 'Fejgin MD']","['Genetic Institute and the Department of Medicine, Meir Hospital and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Kfar-Saba 44281, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Cycle', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics/ultrastructure', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genes, erbB-2', 'Genes, myc', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Trisomy']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(00)00373-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00373-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Mar;125(2):81-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00373-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and the oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH) ratio together with the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in lymphocytes of CLL patients and compared them with those of normal subjects of the same age. SOD and CAT activity decreased in CLL lymphocytes while GPx activity increased. GSH content of CLL lymphocytes also increased, and GSSG concentration remained constant. Thus, a reduced GSSG/GSH ratio was obtained. The oxidation product MDA, and the damaged DNA base 8-oxo-dG were also increased in CLL. The observed changes in enzyme activities, GSSG/GSH ratio, and MDA were significantly enhanced as the duration of the disease increased in years. The results support a predominant oxidative stress status in CLL lymphocytes and emphasize the role of the examined parameters as markers of the disease evolution.","['Oltra, A M', 'Carbonell, F', 'Tormos, C', 'Iradi, A', 'Saez, G T']","['Oltra AM', 'Carbonell F', 'Tormos C', 'Iradi A', 'Saez GT']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Aged', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism']",2001/05/23 10:00,2002/07/31 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0891584901005214 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00521-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2001 Jun 1;30(11):1286-92. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00521-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which cytokines regulate expression of Bcl-2 family members was examined in the haemopoietic cell line TF-1. Cytokine-induced Mcl-1 protein expression was shown to be controlled through a pathway dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). The cytokine-induced increase in mRNA transcription was not dependent upon PI 3-kinase, thus dissociating the immediate-early transcription factors responsible for Mcl-1 transcription from the PI 3-kinase signalling pathway. In contrast, Mcl-1 mRNA levels were dependent upon MEK [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase kinase] activation, suggesting a role for the Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway in Mcl-1 transcription. Activation of PI 3-kinase was shown to be necessary to stimulate Mcl-1 protein translation. This was not due to any effect on prolonging the half-life of the protein. Finally, the lipid second messenger ceramide was shown to cause a reduction in Mcl-1 protein translation, probably via its ability to inhibit protein kinase B activation, providing further clues regarding the death-inducing effect of this lipid.","['Schubert, K M', 'Duronio, V']","['Schubert KM', 'Duronio V']","['Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia and Vancouver Hospital, Jack Bell Research Centre, 2660 Oak St. Vancouver, BC, Canada V6H 3Z6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/0264-6021:3560473 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Jun 1;356(Pt 2):473-80. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3560473.,,,,,,,PMC1221858,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An overwhelming amount of information about their molecular mechanisms is available. In stark contrast, very little is known about how these processes are integrated into the structural framework of the cell nucleus and how they are spatially and temporally co-ordinated within the three-dimensional confines of the nucleus. It is also largely unknown how nuclear architecture affects gene expression. In order to understand how genomes are organized, and how they function, the basic principles that govern nuclear architecture and function must be uncovered. Recent work combining molecular, biochemical and cell biological methods is beginning to shed light on how the nucleus functions and how genes are expressed in vivo. It has become clear that the nucleus contains distinct compartments and that many nuclear components are highly dynamic. Here we describe the major structural compartments of the cell nucleus and discuss their established and proposed functions. We summarize recent observations regarding the dynamic properties of chromatin, mRNA and nuclear proteins, and we consider the implications these findings have for the organization of nuclear processes and gene expression. Finally, we speculate that self-organization might play a substantial role in establishing and maintaining nuclear organization.","['Dundr, M', 'Misteli, T']","['Dundr M', 'Misteli T']","['National Cancer Institute, NIH, 41 Library Drive, Building 41, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromosomes/genetics/metabolism', 'Coiled Bodies/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/0264-6021:3560297 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Jun 1;356(Pt 2):297-310. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3560297.,,,,,,190,PMC1221839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine phosphatase PTP-U2S is also associated with PMA-induced differentiation of myeloid cells and has been shown to enhance differentiation and the onset of apoptosis. PTP-U2S contains a Pim-1 phosphorylation consensus sequence, KKRKLTN, which is efficiently phosphorylated by Pim-1. Immunoprecipitated PTP-U2S from U937 cells was phosphorylated by recombinant Pim-1, resulting in a decrease in its phosphatase activity. During PMA-induced differentiation, U937 cells transfected with the dominant negative Pim-1 underwent rapid differentiation and accelerated apoptosis. The opposite effect was observed for wild-type Pim-1. Our results, therefore, provide compelling evidence that Pim-1 functions to negatively regulate PMA-induced differentiation in part through the phosphorylation of PTP-U2S. Together these data suggest that Pim-1 phosphorylates PTP-U2S in vivo to decrease the phosphatase activity that may be necessary to prevent the premature onset of apoptosis following differentiation.","['Wang, Z', 'Bhattacharya, N', 'Meyer, M K', 'Seimiya, H', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Tonani, J A', 'Magnuson, N S']","['Wang Z', 'Bhattacharya N', 'Meyer MK', 'Seimiya H', 'Tsuruo T', 'Tonani JA', 'Magnuson NS']","['School of Molecular Biosciences, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington 99164, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/abbi.2001.2370 [doi]', 'S0003-9861(01)92370-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2001 Jun 1;390(1):9-18. doi: 10.1006/abbi.2001.2370.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgene expression measured 48 h after plasma cell infection with an IL-2 expressing adenovirus averaged 2.95 ng/ml/10(6) cells. Vaccine production was successful for 88% of patients. Two months after high-dose therapy, six patients received from one to five injections of 3.5-9.0 x 10(7) cells/vaccine. Vaccines were well tolerated with only minor systemic symptoms reported. Injection with tumor cells induced a local inflammatory response consisting predominantly of CD8+ and/or TIA-1+ T-lymphocytes. Myeloma specific anti-tumor responses, assessed by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release and cytotoxic T cell killing of autologous tumor cells, were not enhanced after vaccination in one evaluable patient. Clinical response, manifested as a decrease in serum paraprotein, was not observed in the one patient who had measurable disease at the time of vaccination.

However, a wider choice of therapeutic modalities has become recently available, including immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Accordingly, a sensitive prognostic indicator is required to identify high-risk patients and to help design new therapeutic approaches for them. We previously reported that the serum nm23-H1 protein level was an independent prognostic factor for aggressive lymphoma. The present study was performed to assess the clinical implications of this protein on indolent lymphoma and whether it can be used to classify the aggressiveness of the disease in order to assist in the individualization of therapy. A total of 130 patients with indolent lymphoma were enrolled in this multicenter study. The serum nm23-H1 protein level was significantly higher in patients with indolent lymphoma than in a normal control group. In addition, indolent lymphoma patients with higher nm23-H1 levels had worse overall and progression-free survival rate than those with lower nm23-H1 levels. Therefore, nm23-H1 in serum may be useful for identifying a distinct group of patients at high risk.","['Niitsu, N', 'Okamoto, M', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Takagi, T', 'Yoshida, T', 'Aoki, S', 'Honma, Y', 'Hirano, M']","['Niitsu N', 'Okamoto M', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Takagi T', 'Yoshida T', 'Aoki S', 'Honma Y', 'Hirano M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*blood', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases', '*Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/*blood']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402105 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):832-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human T cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV1) is endemic in this island. We determined the incidence and epidemiological features of hematological malignancies from the 715 new cases diagnosed between 1990 and 1998 among the adult population. Incidence rates per year were steady during this period. The most frequent hematological malignancies were multiple myeloma (MM) (34%), followed by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (23%). Among the cases of NHL with an immunohistological study, 57% had a T cell phenotype. Among these 61% were adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma. Epidemiological data on hematological malignancies in the West Indies has not been previously reported. There are two striking differences with other population-based registries: a high incidence of MM (5/100000) and a high proportion of T cell NHL among NHL (57%). The high proportion of T cell NHL is probably due to the high incidence of ATL. A low incidence of B cell NHL might also contribute to this effect. The increased incidence of MM in West Indies had not been previously reported.

To investigate events in tumorigenesis, immunofluorescence labeling, flow cytometry and a short-term culture assay were used to quantitate precursor B cells and their apoptotic rates in bone marrow of p190bcr/abl transgenic mice over a wide age range. Malignancies appeared rapidly at 8-12 weeks of age, followed by slower tumor onset. At 8-12 weeks in normal mice, the apoptotic rate fell among pro-B cells but increased steeply among pre-B cells, while the total number of B lineage cells declined. In contrast, in p190bcr/abl transgenic mice over the same time period, while pro-B cells remained normal in apoptotic rate and number, apoptosis of pre-B cells was markedly inhibited and the number of B lymphocytes increased. At later ages (14-30 weeks), B cell precursors in control mice remained constant in apoptotic activity and number, while in the few surviving transgenic mice B cell populations were expanded. The results reveal characteristic changes in apoptotic activity among B cell precursors in bone marrow during early life, severely perturbed in preleukemic p190bcr/abl transgenic mice by a preferential suppression of pre-B cell apoptosis. p190bcr/abl may thus promote leukemogenesis by permitting aberrant cells generated during early B cell development to evade a normal quality checkpoint and negative selection.","['Yu, Q', 'Brain, J', 'Laneuville, P', 'Osmond, D G']","['Yu Q', 'Brain J', 'Laneuville P', 'Osmond DG']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Preleukemia/*pathology']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402079 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):819-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402079.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of differentiation, but not of proliferation, involved the selective activation of diverse members of the NF-kappaB family of proteins. In differentiation-induced cells, NF-kappaB (p65) was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, whereas NF-kappaB (p75) remained localized to the cytoplasm. In contrast, NF-kappaB (p52) was present in the nuclei of proliferation- as well as of differentiation-induced ML-1 cells. The differentiation-specific translocation of NF-kappaB (p65) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was mediated by an increase in the level of NIK, the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase which, through phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase alpha (Ikappakalpha), causes a decrease in the level of IkappaBalpha, allowing p65 to move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The p52/p65 heterodimer formed in the nucleus, bound specifically to the promoter of the tumor suppressor protein p53, effecting a 25 to 30-fold increase in the level of this protein. As we reported previously (Li et al, Cancer Res 1998; 58: 4282-4287), that increase led to the decreased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and to the loss of proliferation-associated DNA synthesis.

In general, cells that were converted to a cytokine-independent phenotype displayed a higher level of MAP kinase activity in response to deltaMEK1:ER activation than those that remained cytokine-dependent. deltaMEK1:ER-responsive cells could be maintained long-term in the presence of beta-estradiol, as well as the estrogen-receptor antagonist 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. Removal of hormone led to the rapid cessation of cell growth in a manner similar to that observed when cytokine is withdrawn from the parental cells. GM-CSF mRNA transcripts were detected in the MEK1-responsive cells indicating that activated deltaMEK1:ER may induce a pathway leading to autocrine proliferation. Cytokine-dependent deltaMEK1:ER cells were found to increase the expression of GM-CSF receptor alpha (GM-CSFRalpha) in response to beta-estradiol. In contrast, MEK1-responsive cells were found to express constitutively lower levels of GM-CSFRalpha and beta common (betac) chains indicating that constitutive GM-CSF expression resulted in a decrease in GM-CSFR expression. Treatment of parental cells with supernatant from MEK1-responsive FL5.12 cells was sufficient to promote [3H]-thymidine incorporation. GM-CSF was found to enhance the viability of FL5.12 cells. The cell lines described here will be useful for elaborating the ability of the MAP kinase pathway to regulate cell proliferation in hematopoietic cells.","['Blalock, W L', 'Pearce, M', 'Chang, F', 'Lee, J T', 'Pohnert, S C', 'Burrows, C', 'Steelman, L S', 'Franklin, R A', 'McMahon, M', 'McCubrey, J A']","['Blalock WL', 'Pearce M', 'Chang F', 'Lee JT', 'Pohnert SC', 'Burrows C', 'Steelman LS', 'Franklin RA', 'McMahon M', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/physiology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402109 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):794-807. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402109.,['R01CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-2Ralpha expression is restricted to T cells which have recently encountered antigen, and in healthy individuals the majority (>95%) of peripheral T cells are IL-2Ralpha negative. An aberrant expression of IL-2Ralpha has recently been described in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Here, we study the regulation of IL-2Ralpha expression and STATs in a tumor cell line obtained from peripheral blood from a patient with Sezary syndrome (SS), a leukemic variant of CTCL. We show that (1) STAT3 (a transcription factor known to regulate IL-2Ralpha transcription) is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in SS tumor cells, but not in non-malignant T cells; (2) STAT3 binds constitutively to a STAT-binding sequence in the promotor of the IL-2Ralpha gene; (3) the Janus kinase inhibitor, tyrphostine AG490, inhibits STAT3 activation, STAT3 DNA binding, and IL-2Ralpha mRNA and protein expression in parallel; and (4) tyrphostine AG490 inhibits IL-2 driven mitogenesis and triggers apoptosis in SS tumor cells. In conclusion, we provide the first example of a constitutive STAT3 activation in SS tumor cells. Moreover, our findings suggest that STAT3 activation might play an important role in the constitutive IL-2Ralpha expression, survival, and growth of malignant SS cells.","['Eriksen, K W', 'Kaltoft, K', 'Mikkelsen, G', 'Nielsen, M', 'Zhang, Q', 'Geisler, C', 'Nissen, M H', 'Ropke, C', 'Wasik, M A', 'Odum, N']","['Eriksen KW', 'Kaltoft K', 'Mikkelsen G', 'Nielsen M', 'Zhang Q', 'Geisler C', 'Nissen MH', 'Ropke C', 'Wasik MA', 'Odum N']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sezary Syndrome/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402093 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):787-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402093.,['CA89194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G-CSF alone did not induce the MPO, NE, LF, or PU.1 RNAs, and C/EBPalphaWT-ER alone stimulated low-level MPO and high-level PU.1 expression. Simultaneous activation of the GCSFR and C/EBPalphaWT-ER markedly increased MPO and NE induction at 24 h, and LF mRNA was detected at 48 h. G-CSF did not increase endogenous GCSFR, endogenous C/EBPalpha or exogenous C/EBPalphaWT-ER levels, and C/EBPalphaWT-ER did not induce endogenous or exogenous GCSFR. Several GCSFR mutants were also co-expressed with C/EBPalphaYWT-ER. Mutation of all four cytoplasmic tyrosines prevented NE induction but enhanced MPO induction. Mutation of Y704 was required for increased MPO induction. Consistent with this finding, removing IL-3 without G-CSF addition enabled MPO, but not NE, induction by C/EBPalphaWT-ER. GCSFR signals or related signals from other receptors may cooperate with C/EBPalpha to direct differentiation of normal myeloid stem cells.","['Wang, W', 'Wang, X', 'Ward, A C', 'Touw, I P', 'Friedman, A D']","['Wang W', 'Wang X', 'Ward AC', 'Touw IP', 'Friedman AD']","['The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Division of Pediatric Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Transgenes']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402094 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):779-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402094.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) lowers Bcr-Abl protein levels and induces apoptosis of the Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic blasts (Blood 2000; 95: 1014). Here, we demonstrate that compared to treatment with STI-571 (0.25 to 1.0 microM) or As2O3 (0.5 to 2.0 microM) alone, combined treatment with As2O3 and STI-571 induced significantly more apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 but not HL-60/neo cells (P < 0.05). Combined treatment with As2O3 and STI-571 also resulted in greater reductions in the levels of Bcl-x(L), XIAP and Akt, and inhibition of Akt kinase activity. Co-treatment with As2O3 inhibited STI-571-induced hemoglobin, which was associated with the cleavage and downregulation of GATA-1 transcription factor involved in erythroid differentiation. These data demonstrate that a treatment strategy which combines an agent that lowers Bcr-Abl levels, eg As2O3, with an agent that inhibits Bcr-Abl TK activity, eg STI-571, can potently induce apoptosis and differentiation of Bcr-Abl-positive human leukemic cells.","['Porosnicu, M', 'Nimmanapalli, R', 'Nguyen, D', 'Worthington, E', 'Perkins, C', 'Bhalla, K N']","['Porosnicu M', 'Nimmanapalli R', 'Nguyen D', 'Worthington E', 'Perkins C', 'Bhalla KN']","['Interdisciplinary Oncology Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida, Tampa 33612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402104 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):772-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase I, dose-finding study was initiated to define a safe and effective regimen of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) when administered with PSC 833 to patients with early relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Poor-prognosis AML patients refractory to first-line induction therapy or relapsing within 9 months of attaining complete remission (CR) were treated with cytarabine (1.0 g/m2/day), etoposide (30 mg/m2/day), and mitoxantrone at a dose of either 3.0 mg/m2/day (cohort 1) or 4.5 mg/m2/day (cohorts 2 and 3) for 6 days plus continuous-infusion PSC 833 (10 mg/kg/24 h with a 2.0 mg/kg loading dose) for 6 or 7 days each 21-day cycle.

The maximum tolerated dose of mitoxantrone was defined as 4.5 mg/m2/day. Clinically significant grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia, possibly related to PSC 833, occurred in four patients.

Mild to moderate cerebellar ataxia and paresthesia occurred in six (26%) and five (22%) patients, respectively, but were not dose limiting. Overall, six of 23 (26%) patients achieved CR, including five patients with demonstrated P-glycoprotein expression and/or function. The median overall survival was 4 months. All six patients with a CR were alive and four (17%) patients were disease free at 12 months. Blood levels of PSC 833 were well above the target level of 1000 ng/ml, a concentration that is known to reverse MDR in vitro. PSC 833 reduced the clearance of etoposide by approximately two-fold.

In particular, we found that CXCR4 is strongly expressed on immature ALL blasts whereas no surface immunoreactivity for CXCR5, CCR5 and CCR6 was observed. By contrast, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) corresponding to more mature peripheral B cell subsets (ie B-CLL and MCL) exhibited high expression levels of CXCR4 and CXCR5. Analysis of terminally differentiated myeloma cells revealed a down-regulation of CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR6. CCR5, which is not expressed in normal B cells, was also absent from the majority of NHLs.

In CD34-selected normal cells, G-CSF induced myeloid colony growth, and an overall small decrease in the number of erythroid colonies. By contrast, G-CSF induced a 33-263% increase of erythroid colony formation in CD34+ cells from four of five RARS patients with severely reduced erythroid growth, while the normal or slightly reduced erythroid growth of three other patients was not influenced by G-CSF. This study suggests that G-CSF may reduce the pathologically increased caspase activity and concomitant apoptotic changes, and promote erythroid growth and differentiation of stem cells from RARS patients. Our data support the clinical benefit of G-CSF in this subgroup of myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Schmidt-Mende, J', 'Tehranchi, R', 'Forsblom, A M', 'Joseph, B', 'Christensson, B', 'Fadeel, B', 'Zhivotovsky, B', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, E']","['Schmidt-Mende J', 'Tehranchi R', 'Forsblom AM', 'Joseph B', 'Christensson B', 'Fadeel B', 'Zhivotovsky B', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/therapeutic use', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/pathology', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402110 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):742-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402110.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As2O3 was given at a daily dose of 0.08 mg/kg intravenously for 28 days. Pharmacokinetic study was carried out in eight patients. 16/20 (80%) patients achieved CR. The occurrence of some toxic events including gastrointestinal disturbance, facial edema and cardiac toxicity seemed reduced in the low-dose group than those in the standard-dose group. Differentiation changes were observed in peripheral blood, as well as in bone marrow (BM). Pharmacokinetic study showed that the plasma concentration increased soon after administration of As2O3 with the peak values of 1.535-3.424 micromol/l. After infusion, the plasma concentration was around 0.1-0.5 micromol/l. The arsenic concentration of the plasma of BM aspirates 24 h after administration in five patients was close to the level needed for differentiation-inducing effect. The estimated 2-year OS and RFS were 61.55+/-15.79% and 49.11+/-15.09% respectively, with no difference as compared with those in patients treated with conventional dose (P = 0.2865 and 0.7146, respectively).

Using quantitative computed tomography, we determined the frequency of low BMD (defined as >1.645 standard deviations (SD) below the mean) in leukemia survivors treated with multiagent chemotherapy including prednisone and antimetabolite. All participants had completed therapy at least 4 years earlier, remained in continuous complete remission, and had no second malignancies. We statistically correlated BMD results with patient characteristics and treatment histories. Among 141 survivors (median age, 15.9 years; median time after diagnosis, 11.5 years), median BMD z score was -0.78 SD (range, -3.23 to 3.61 SDs). Thirty participants (21%; 95% confidence interval, 15% to 29%) had abnormally low BMD, a proportion significantly (P < 0.0001) greater than the expected 5% in normal populations. Risk factors for BMD decrements included male sex (P = 0.038), Caucasian race (P < 0.0001), and cranial irradiation (P= 0.0087). BMD inversely correlated with cranial irradiation dose. BMD z scores of patients who received higher doses of antimetabolites were lower than those of other patients. Childhood ALL survivors are at risk to have low BMD, especially males, Caucasians, and those who received cranial irradiation.","['Kaste, S C', 'Jones-Wallace, D', 'Rose, S R', 'Boyett, J M', 'Lustig, R H', 'Rivera, G K', 'Pui, C H', 'Hudson, M M']","['Kaste SC', 'Jones-Wallace D', 'Rose SR', 'Boyett JM', 'Lustig RH', 'Rivera GK', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM']","[""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Body Height', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402078 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):728-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402078.,"['P01 CA-23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The comparison of results obtained in 89 follow-up samples from 23 patients showed significantly consistent results in 70 samples (78%); (P < 0.001). Bone marrow samples taken during the first phase of treatment (during or immediately after induction) showed a lower level of consistency when compared to samples taken during later phases of treatment (69% vs 85% consistent results, respectively). Some of the discrepant results were due to low cellularity of the samples obtained for FC and some due to the presence of PCR inhibitors. Of 29 patients evaluated at the end of the induction treatment, 18 (62%) had detectable levels of MRD and six of these patients suffered relapse.

The tolerance of this procedure allows treatment of poor candidates to conventional allogeneic transplantation with persisting or relapsing myeloma patients. Twelve patients previously treated with at least VAD regimen and autologous transplantation were included. All patients had a serum beta2 microglobuline >3 mg/l at diagnosis. The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 25 mg/m/day x 5, antithymoglobulin 2.5 mg/kg/day x 5, busulphan 2 mg/kg/day x 2; the transplant was peripheral stem cells (except one) from an HLA-matched sibling and was followed by cyclosporin for 45 to 90 days. This treatment results in a well-tolerated procedure (no mucositis, duration of aplasia <7 days). A dramatic graft anti-myeloma effect is documented even in progressive disease (11/12 PR + CR, 4/12 CR). However, five patients underwent CMV disease, one died of CMV encephalitis (UPN 3) and delayed severe GVHD occurred in four patients. Our data suggest that a better survival could be achieved when patients are transplanted with a controlled disease.

Initial biopsy specimens were reclassified according to the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms (REAL). All patients surviving 28 days engrafted. Twenty-eight of them (93%) attained clinical remission. At the last follow-up 14 patients were alive and disease-free at a median of 5.0 (range, 2.3-12.9) years after allogeneic SCT. The actuarial overall survival is 35%. Five patients relapsed 1.8 to 27.6 months after transplant, the probability of relapse is 23%. Of the 21 deaths following SCT, seven were due to relapse/refractory disease and 14 due to transplant-related causes. The probability of treatment-related mortality is 48%. After SCT, minimal residual disease (MRD) was monitored by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seven patients with a BCL-2/IgH translocation and in 13 with a clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) rearrangement. All 20 patients attained clinical remission rapidly and converted to PCR negativity. In the follow-up nine of these patients are in long-term clinical and molecular remission, six PCR-negative patients died of transplant-related causes and five patients relapsed. In summary, allogeneic stem cell transplantation has a curative potential for patients with refractory and recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In our series long-term disease-free survival was associated with molecular disease eradication after SCT. Treatment-related mortality rate was high, thus earlier referral of selected patients to allogeneic SCT should be considered.","['Mitterbauer, M', 'Neumeister, P', 'Kalhs, P', 'Brugger, S', 'Fischer, G', 'Dieckmann, K', 'Hoecker, P', 'Hinterberger, W', 'Linkesch, W', 'Simonitsch, I', 'Jaeger, U', 'Lechner, K', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Mitterbauer, G', 'Greinix, H T']","['Mitterbauer M', 'Neumeister P', 'Kalhs P', 'Brugger S', 'Fischer G', 'Dieckmann K', 'Hoecker P', 'Hinterberger W', 'Linkesch W', 'Simonitsch I', 'Jaeger U', 'Lechner K', 'Mannhalter C', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Greinix HT']","['Department of Medicine I, University Hospital of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402053 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Apr;15(4):635-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402053.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of this, the borders of the entity, the homogeneity of the cases and the presumably cell origin of SMZL remain controversial issues. The frequency of mutation in the 5' non-coding region of the bcl-6 gene has been used as a marker of germinal center derivation, which may be used to establish the molecular heterogeneity of different non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) types. This roughly parallels the characteristics and frequency of the somatic hypermutations found in the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) genes. This study analyzed mutations of bcl-6 in the 5' non-coding region in 22 SMZL cases and, for the purpose of comparison with different B cell subsets, in microdissected germinal centers, mantle zones and marginal zone subpopulations from reactive splenic lymphoid follicles. A majority of the SMZL cases studied, 19/22 (87%), bear unmutated bcl-6 gene, while mutation was only observed in 3/22 (13%) cases. Analysis of normal B cell subpopulations showed bcl-6 hypermutation in 3/10 (30%) germinal center clones, 5/14 (35%) marginal zone clones; and unmutated sequences in all clones derived from mantle cells. The frequency of these mutations in normal spleen confirms previous findings on the hypermutation IgVH process in normal B cell populations. The data presented here support the existence of molecular heterogeneity in this entity, and give additional results in favor of the hypothesis that, in spite of initial morphological observations, a significant proportion of SMZL cases could derive from an unmutated naive precursor, different from the marginal zone, and possibly located in the mantle zone of splenic lymphoid follicles. Thus the marginal zone differentiation of these tumors could be related more with the splenic microenvironment than it is to the histogenetic characteristics of the tumor.","['Mateo, M S', 'Mollejo, M', 'Villuendas, R', 'Algara, P', 'Sanchez-Beato, M', 'Martinez, P', 'Piris, M A']","['Mateo MS', 'Mollejo M', 'Villuendas R', 'Algara P', 'Sanchez-Beato M', 'Martinez P', 'Piris MA']","['Department of Genetics, Virgen de la Salud Hospital, Toledo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Mutation', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402073 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Apr;15(4):628-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402073.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five somatostatin receptor subtypes, sst1-5, have been identified. We have recently established that somatostatin acts as a chemoattractant on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Here, we studied the expression of somatostatin receptors (sst) on leukemic cells from 16 AML patients. Using fluorescent somatostatin (Fluo-SS) in flow cytometry, we found that sst are expressed in variable amounts on primary AML cells. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and immunochemistry revealed that only sst subtype 2 is expressed by AML cells. Using a two-chamber in vitro migration assay, we show that AML cells migrated towards a gradient of octreotide, a stable synthetic analogue of somatostatin. The degree of migration correlated with the cell surface density of sst2 as measured by Fluo-SS binding. These findings indicate that somatostatin influences trafficking of AML cells, which may have implications for the distribution of AML cells in the body and for clinical applications of somatostatin and analogues thereof in the context of AML.","['Oomen, S P', 'Lichtenauer-Kaligis, E G', 'Verplanke, N', 'Hofland, J', 'Lamberts, S W', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Touw, I P']","['Oomen SP', 'Lichtenauer-Kaligis EG', 'Verplanke N', 'Hofland J', 'Lamberts SW', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw IP']","['Institute of Hematology, Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Somatostatin)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', 'D73QL0OMU2 (somatostatin receptor 2)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Octreotide/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Somatostatin/analysis/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Somatostatin/analysis/*physiology']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402061 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Apr;15(4):621-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402061.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with IL-12 or 5-FU given alone produced moderate anti-leukemic effects. However, combination of both drugs resulted in a significant prolongation of mouse survival time. Importantly, there were 70% of long-term (>60 days) survivors among mice treated with both agents simultaneously. Moreover, we observed 100% of long-term survivors when mice were treated with a minimally increased dose of IL-12 (170 ng) in combination with 5-FU (50 mg/kg). The antileukemic effects were completely abrogated in scid/scid mice and in mice depleted of peritoneal macrophages and significantly decreased after administration of anti-CD3+, anti-CD4+ or anti-CD8+ monoclonal antibodies.

In the course of screening for transcription factors which interact with the human myeloperoxidase (MPO) promoter we, for the first time, identified and cloned the cDNA and genomic DNA for human HBP1 (HMG-Box containing protein 1), a member of the high mobility group of non-histone chromosomal proteins. HBP1 cDNA was initially cloned from rat brain in 1994, but its presence in human cells or in myeloid tissue had not been described previously. The sequence of human HBP1 cDNA shows 84% overall homology with the rat HBP1 cDNA sequence. We have subsequently cloned the gene, which is present as a single copy, 25 kbp in length. Northern blotting reveals a single 2.6 kb mRNA transcript which is expressed at higher levels in human myeloid and B lymphoid cell lines than in T cell lines tested and is present in several non-myeloid human cell lines. Comparison of the mRNA and genomic sequences reveals the gene to contain 10 exons and 9 introns. The sequence of human HBP1 mRNA contains a single open reading frame, which codes for a protein 514 amino acids in length. The amino acid sequence specified by the coding region shows 95% homology with the rat HBP1 protein. The human protein sequence exhibits a putative DNA-binding domain similar to that seen in rat HBP1 and shows homology with the activation and repressor domains previously demonstrated in the rat protein. We have expressed human HBP1 protein both in vitro and in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The expressed fusion protein binds to a sequence in a functionally important region within the basal human MPO promoter. In transient co-transfection experiments HBP1 enhances MPO promoter activity. Human HBP1 appears to be a novel transcription factor which is likely to play an important role in regulating transcription in developing myeloid cells.","['Lin, K M', 'Zhao, W G', 'Bhatnagar, J', 'Zhao, W D', 'Lu, J P', 'Simko, S', 'Schueneman, A', 'Austin, G E']","['Lin KM', 'Zhao WG', 'Bhatnagar J', 'Zhao WD', 'Lu JP', 'Simko S', 'Schueneman A', 'Austin GE']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Decatur, GA 30033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (HBP1 protein, human)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402071 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Apr;15(4):601-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402071.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation fuses the MLL gene on chromosome band 11q23 and the AF4 gene on 4q21, resulting in the expression of fusion transcripts from both translocated chromosomes. The MLL-AF4 chimeric transcript is thought to mediate the leukemic transformation. The MLL genomic disruption detected by Southern blot and the RT-PCR for the MLL-AF4 chimeric transcript expression are molecular evidence of this chromosomal translocation. However, similar molecular rearrangements have also been identified in cases without the cytogenetic t(4;11). We report a 30-year-old patient with high risk ALL, a normal karyotype, and molecular evidence of MLL-AF4 fusion. Using a double color FISH assay with MLL specific PAC probes, a cryptic t(4;11) due to insertion of 5' MLL sequences in chromosome 4q21 was demonstrated. Consequently the MLL-AF4 was encoded by der(4). This insertion mechanism precludes the genomic recombination of AF4-MLL and supports the crucial role played by MLL-AF4 in leukemogenesis.

In this study of 198 DNA samples from 186 patients with a wide range of lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD), the methylation status of Myf-3 was assessed to evaluate its significance in the diagnosis of malignant LPD. DNA was digested with the restriction endonucleases HpaII and MspI, and using the Southern blot (SB) technique, the size and density of fragments that hybridized with a Myf-3 probe were used to assign the methylation status. None of the samples from 45 patients from a wide age range with benign LPDs had evidence of altered Myf-3 methylation and there was no age-related methylation change. By contrast, 115/123 (93%) of samples from patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or lymphoid leukemia had increased Myf-3 methylation. There was no methylation alteration in 22/24 (92%) of samples from patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), nor in five of six samples from LPDs that had atypical histopathologic features which were not diagnostic of lymphoma, while the remaining sample of atypical LPD had hypermethylated Myf-3 fragments. There was an association between increasing Myf-3 methylation and higher histopathologic grade of malignancy within specific lymphoma categories. It is concluded that the detection of increased Myf-3 methylation is a sensitive and specific test of malignancy which may complement other molecular methods that are currently used for the assessment of clonality. It may be of particular diagnostic use in natural killer (NK) and null cell malignancies for which other indicators of clonality are lacking.

In contrast, the P210 form is observed both in CML and 50% of Ph-positive ALL. Methylation of the proximal promoter of the ABL1 gene has been shown to be a nearly universal event associated with clinical progression of CML. This raises the question of whether methylation of the ABL1 promoter is an epigenetic modification also associated with Ph-positive ALL. To study this issue, we used methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing to determine the methylation status of the ABL1 promoter in 18 Ph-positive ALL samples. We report here that gene-specific ABL1 promoter methylation is associated mainly with the P210 form of BCR-ABL and not the P190 form. While six out of the seven P210-positive ALL samples had ABL1 promoter methylation, none of the 11 P190-positive ALL samples demonstrated ABL1 promoter methylation. In addition, we estimated the extent and relative abundance of ABL1 promoter methylation in several Ph-positive ALL samples and compared it to the methylation pattern in chronic, accelerated and blastic crisis phases of CML.

To this end, we examined components of apoptotic cascades including Bax expression and its intracellular localization, changes of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activation of caspases. Bax protein levels did not increase despite an up-regulation of bax at mRNA level. However, Bax translocation from cytosol towards mitochondria was observed. In addition, we observed a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and the localization changes of both Bax and cytochrome c were found already at the early, annexin V-negative stage of HHT-induced apoptosis.

We analyzed the expression of the major G1 cell cycle regulators (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, cyclins D, cyclin E and pRb) in 41 fresh AML cell samples. The level of p27 expression was the only factor correlated with the response to chemotherapy, a high level of p27 expression being predictive of complete remission. There was a close relation between expression of pRb, cyclin D2 and FAB subtype, illustrated by the absence of both proteins in most samples having a monocytic component (M4, M5). We also assessed the expressions of pRb, cyclin E, p21 and p27 and the activity of cdk2, the major regulator of S-phase entry, after exposure to cytosine-arabinoside (AraC) and daunorubicin (DNR), and found these proteins could characterize time- and dose-dependent cellular response to each drug. We observed hyperphosphorylated pRb, increased levels of cyclin E and a high cdk2 activity, but no p21 induction, in AML cells exposed to 10(-6) M AraC. After exposure to 10(-5) M AraC, corresponding to the serum concentration reached in high-dose AraC regimens (HDAraC), a strong p21 induction was observed, associated with similarly overexpressed cyclin E and even higher cdk2 activity than after 10(-6) M AraC, while apoptosis was significantly increased. These data suggest that cdk2 activity is likely to play a role in AraC-induced apoptosis in AML cells. This mechanism may account for high efficacy of HDAraC in cells showing little sensitivity to conventional AraC doses.","['Radosevic, N', 'Delmer, A', 'Tang, R', 'Marie, J P', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, F']","['Radosevic N', 'Delmer A', 'Tang R', 'Marie JP', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F']","['Hematology Department, INSERM E9912/EA1529, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin D', 'Cyclin E/*analysis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/analysis', 'Cyclins/*analysis', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*analysis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/analysis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*analysis', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402092 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Apr;15(4):559-66. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402092.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ex vivo strategies include gene delivery into tumor cells and into cellular components of the immune system, including cytotoxic T cells and dendritic cells (DC). The nature of the transferred genetic material as well as the gene transfer method has varied widely depending on the application. Several of these approaches have already been translated into clinical gene therapy trials. In this review, we will focus on the rationale and types of ex vivo gene-based immunotherapy of cancer.

The last 10 years have witnessed an explosion of interest in this approach to treat human disease, both inherited and acquired, with the initiation of multiple clinical protocols. All gene therapy strategies have two essential technical requirements. These are: (1) the efficient introduction of the relevant genetic material into the target cell and (2) the expression of the transgene at therapeutic levels. Conceptual and technical hurdles involved with these requirements are still the objects of active research. To date, the most widely used and best understood vectors for gene transfer in hematopoietic cells are derived from retroviruses, although they suffer from several limitations. However, as gene transfer mechanisms become more efficient and long-term gene expression is enhanced, the variety of diseases that can be tackled by gene therapy will continue to expand. However, until the problem of delivery and subsequent expression is adequately resolved, gene therapy will not realize its full potential. The first part of this review gives an overview of the gene delivery technology available at present to transfer genetic sequences in human somatic cells.

While the mechanism(s) of Bcl2's anti-apoptotic function is not yet clear, introduction of Bcl2 into most eukaryotic cell types will protect the recipient cell from a wide variety of stress applications that lead to cell death. There are, however, physiologic situations in which Bcl2 expression apparently fails to protect cells from apoptosis (eg negative selection of thymocytes). Further, Bcl2 expression in patient tumor samples does not consistently correlate with a worse outcome or resistance to anticancer therapies. For example, patient response and survival following chemotherapy is independent of Bcl2 expression at least for pediatric patients with ALL. These findings indicate that simple expression of Bcl2 may not be enough to functionally protect cells from apoptosis. The finding that Bcl2 is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation suggests another level of regulation of function. Recent studies have shown that agonist-activated phosphorylation of Bcl2 at serine 70 (single site phosphorylation), a site within the flexible loop domain (FLD), is required for Bcl2's full and potent anti-apoptotic function, at least in murine IL-3-dependent myeloid cell lines. Several protein kinases have now been demonstrated to be physiologic Bcl2 kinases indicating the importance of this post-translational modification. Since Bcl2 phosphorylation has been found to be a dynamic process involving both a Bcl2 kinase(s) and phosphatase(s), a mechanism exists to rapidly and reversibly regulate Bcl2's activity and affect cell viability. In addition, multisite Bcl2 phosphorylation induced by anti-mitotic drugs like paclitaxel may inhibit Bcl2 indicating the potential wide range of functional consequences that this post-translational modification may have on function. While post-translational mechanisms other than phosphorylation may also regulate Bcl2's function (eg ubiquitination), this review will focus on the regulatory role for phosphorylation and discuss its potential clinical ramifications.","['Ruvolo, P P', 'Deng, X', 'May, W S']","['Ruvolo PP', 'Deng X', 'May WS']","['University of Florida Shands Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Gainesville 32610-0232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Threonine/metabolism']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402090 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Apr;15(4):515-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402090.,,,,,,101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recognition of Jurkat cells in the absence of serum by human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiated into macrophages was enhanced by the oxidation with these reagents. The recognition was maximal when Jurkat cells were treated with each of the reagents at the relatively low concentrations, and the recognition was decreased on treatment with the reagents at the higher concentrations. The enhanced recognition of THP-1 macrophages to diamide-oxidized Jurkat cells was lowered when the binding was conducted in the presence of the oligosaccharides from band 3 glycoprotein and lactoferrin. The inhibitory effect of band 3 oligosaccharides was abolished by removal of the non-reducing-terminal sialyl residues or by cleavage of poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl sugar chains in the saccharides. Moreover, on enzymatic removal of the non-reducing-terminal sialyl residues or enzymatic cleavage of the poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl sugar chains on the surface of Jurkat cells prior to oxidation, the cells were recognized poorly by THP-1 macrophages.

The majority of patients are diagnosed because of a lymphocytosis of at least 5 x 10(9)/L on an incidental blood count. It needs to be distinguished from mantle cell lymphoma and splenic marginal zone lymphoma by lymphocyte markers. The immunophenotype of CLL is sparse surface immunoglobulin, CD5+, CD19+, CD23+, CD79b-, and FMC7-. The disease is staged according to the presence of lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly and the features of bone marrow suppression. Most patients have an early stage of disease when diagnosed and perhaps 50% will never progress. This group of patients have a normal life expectancy and do not require treatment beyond reassurance. Progression involves an increasing white cell count, enlarging lymph nodes and spleen, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Complications of progression include autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, and the development of a more aggressive lymphoma. A range of prognostic factors is available to predict progression, but most haematologists rely on close observation of the patient. Intermittent chlorambucil remains the first choice treatment for the majority of patients. Combination chemotherapy offers no advantage. Intravenous fludarabine is probably more effective than chlorambucil, but no trial has yet shown a survival advantage for using it first rather than as a salvage treatment in patients not responding to chlorambucil. It is at least 40 times as expensive as chlorambucil. Cladribine may be as effective as fludarabine, although it has been used less and is even more expensive. Patients who relapse after chlorambucil should be offered retreatment with the same agent and if refractory should be switched to fludarabine, which may also be offered for retreatment on relapse. For patients refractory to both drugs, a variety of options are available. High dose corticosteroids, high dose chlorambucil, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, vincristine and doxorubicin), anti-CD52, anti-CD20 and a range of experimental drugs which are being evaluated in clinical trials. Younger patients should be offered the chance of treatment with curative intent, preferably in the context of a clinical trial. Autologous stem cell transplantation after achieving a remission with fludarabine has relative safety and may produce molecular complete remissions. Only time will tell whether some of these patients are cured but it seems unlikely. Standard allogeneic bone marrow transplant is probably too hazardous for most patients, but non-myeloablative regimens hold out the hope of invoking a graft-versus-leukaemia effect without a high tumour-related mortality.

However, isolated cases of unusual hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemias (AML), multiple myeloma (MM) or plasmacytomas, and chronic leukemias have been reported. This review focuses on these uncommon malignancies supervening in the setting of HIV infection. Eighteen cases of AML have been reported. Extramedullary localizations are frequently noticed. Nontreated patients have a survival of 2.7 weeks, compared with 9.8 months for patients treated with chemotherapy; being HIV-positive is not a contraindication to the treatment of AML. Based on the observed 72% incidence of AML M4 and M5 in an HIV-infected population versus 19% to 36% expected in a non-HIV-infected population, we postulate that the association of AML and HIV is not coincidental. The monocytotropism of HIV, the chronic cytokine-mediated activation of monocytes/macrophages, and the immunodeficiency may explain this association. Twenty-two cases of MM or plasmacytomas have been described, most of them in young patients. Again, extramedullary plasma cell tumors are recorded in many patients. Physiopathologic studies suggest that MM may develop because of an antigen-driven response to the circulating viral antigens. A role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the pathogenesis, as previously described in high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, is suggested by the presence of EBV genomes in plasma cell tumors. Finally, a broad spectrum of chronic leukemias derived from B- or T-cell lymphocyte lineage has been reported. These associations seem coincidental.","['Pulik, M', 'Genet, P', 'Jary, L', 'Lionnet, F', 'Jondeau, K']","['Pulik M', 'Genet P', 'Jary L', 'Lionnet F', 'Jondeau K']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier d'Argenteuil, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AIDS Patient Care STDS,AIDS patient care and STDs,9607225,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'HIV Infections/*complications/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/epidemiology']",2001/05/22 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/05/22 10:00'],"['2001/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/apc.1998.12.913 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Patient Care STDS. 1998 Dec;12(12):913-9. doi: 10.1089/apc.1998.12.913.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proteins of 50, 60, and 80 kDa with specificity to bind to sialylated poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl sugar chains were detected in the chromatographic fractions.

We previously reported that Tax induced cell cycle progression from G0/G1 phase to S and G2/M phases in human T-cell line Kit 225 cells. To elucidate molecular mechanism of Tax-induced cell cycle progression, we systematically examined the effects of Tax on biochemical events associated with cell cycle progression. Introduction of Tax into resting Kit 225 cells induced activation of the G1/S transition regulation cascade consisting of activation of cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and CDK4, phosphorylation of the Rb family proteins and an increase in free E2F. The kinase activation was found to result from Tax-induced expression of genes for cell cycle regulatory molecules including cyclin D2, cyclin E, E2F1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, and Tax-induced reduction of CDK inhibitors p19(INK4d) and p27(Kip1). These modulations by Tax always paralleled the ability of Tax to activate the NF-kappaB transcription pathway.

Four had received interferon with no cytogenetic response, and only three underwent UD-CBT within 1 year of diagnosis. After serological typing for class I antigens, and high-resolution DNA typing for DRB1, the degree of HLA match between patients and cord blood (CB) units was 4/6 in six cases and 5/6 in three cases. The median number of nucleated cells infused was 1.7 x 10(7)/kg (range, 1.2 to 4.9 x 10(7)/kg), and was above 2 x 10(7)/kg in only two cases.

However, we find that in human CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, the HIV-based vectors with an internal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter express transgenes 100- to 1,000-fold less than the MLV-based retroviral vector murine stem cell virus (MSCV). To increase the expression of the integrated lentivirus, we replaced CMV promoter with that of the Rous sarcoma virus or MSCV and obtained a modest augmentation in expression. A more dramatic effect was seen when the CMV enhancer/promoter was removed and the HIV long-terminal repeat (LTR) was replaced by a novel HIV/MSCV hybrid LTR. This vector retains the ability to transduce nondividing cells but now expresses its transgene (enhanced green fluorescent protein) 10- to 100-fold greater than the original HIV-based vector. When compared under identical conditions, the HIV vector with the hybrid LTR transduced a higher percentage of CD34(+) cells than the MSCV-based retroviral vector (19.4% versus 2.4%). The number of transduced cells and level of transgene expression remain constant over 5-8 weeks as determined by long-term culture-initiating cells, fluoresence-activated cell sorting, and nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency repopulation assay.","['Choi, J K', 'Hoang, N', 'Vilardi, A M', 'Conrad, P', 'Emerson, S G', 'Gewirtz, A M']","['Choi JK', 'Hoang N', 'Vilardi AM', 'Conrad P', 'Emerson SG', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104, USA. jkchoi@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV/*genetics', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Genetic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', '*Transgenes']",2001/05/22 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/05/22 10:00'],"['2001/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.19-3-236 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2001;19(3):236-46. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.19-3-236.,['CA75330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells utilizing ALT have telomeres of very heterogeneous length, ranging from very short to very long. Here we report the effect of telomerase expression in the ALT cell line GM847. Expression of exogenous hTERT in GM847 (GM847/hTERT) cells resulted in lengthening of the shortest telomeres; this is the first evidence that expression of hTERT in ALT cells can induce telomerase that is active at the telomere. However, rapid fluctuation in telomere length still occurred in the GM847/hTERT cells after more than 100 population doublings. Very long telomeres and ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies continued to be generated, indicating that telomerase activity induced by exogenous hTERT did not abolish the ALT mechanism. In contrast, when the GM847 cell line was fused with two different telomerase-positive tumor cell lines, the ALT phenotype was repressed in each case. These hybrid cells were telomerase positive, and the telomeres decreased in length, very rapidly at first and then at the rate seen in telomerase-negative normal cells. Additionally, ALT-associated PML bodies disappeared. After the telomeres had shortened sufficiently, they were maintained at a stable length by telomerase. Together these data indicate that the telomerase-positive cells contain a factor that represses the ALT mechanism but that this factor is unlikely to be telomerase. Further, the transfection data indicate that ALT and telomerase can coexist in the same cells.","['Perrem, K', 'Colgin, L M', 'Neumann, A A', 'Yeager, T R', 'Reddel, R R']","['Perrem K', 'Colgin LM', 'Neumann AA', 'Yeager TR', 'Reddel RR']","[""Cancer Research Group, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales 2145, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*RNA', 'Telomerase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Transfection']",2001/05/22 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/22 10:00'],"['2001/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.12.3862-3875.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Jun;21(12):3862-75. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.12.3862-3875.2001.,,,,,,,PMC87050,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rapid increase in telomerase activity preceded proliferation of both populations of cells in the presence of stem cell factor and either IL-3 or IL-6. The induction was transient, and telomerase activity declined to basal levels well before the appearance of mature mast cells. Studies with pharmacologic inhibitors suggested that this induction was initially dependent on the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, but once cell replication was underway telomerase activity, but not cell replication, became resistant to the effects of inhibitors. Tumor mast cell lines, in contrast, expressed persistently high telomerase activity throughout the cell cycle, and this expression was unaffected by inhibitors of all known signaling pathways in mast cells even when cell proliferation was blocked for extended periods. These results suggest that the transient induction of telomerase activity in human progenitor mast cells was initially dependent on growth factor-mediated signals, whereas maintenance of high activity in tumor mast cell lines was not dependent on intracellular signals or cell replication.","['Chaves-Dias, C', 'Hundley, T R', 'Gilfillan, A M', 'Kirshenbaum, A S', 'Cunha-Melo, J R', 'Metcalfe, D D', 'Beaven, M A']","['Chaves-Dias C', 'Hundley TR', 'Gilfillan AM', 'Kirshenbaum AS', 'Cunha-Melo JR', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'CD13 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin']",2001/05/22 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/05/22 10:00'],"['2001/05/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.166.11.6647 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Jun 1;166(11):6647-56. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.11.6647.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant IgE-HRF (rHRF) obtained from Escherichia coli- or 293-transformed embryonal kidney cells was tested for B cell-stimulating activity. Both rHRFs stimulated B cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. However, boiling or anti-HRF Ab abolished the B cell stimulatory effects of rHRF. Recombinant HRF showed strong synergistic effects with IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 for B cell activation, with maximal activity in the presence of anti-CD40 AB: Recombinant HRF increased MHC class II expression of B cells. It also increased Ig production from B cells. Treatment with polymyxin B, a neutralizing peptide antibiotic of LPS, did not reduce the activity of rHRF. In addition, FACS analysis using PE-conjugated rHRF showed that HRF bound to B cells. Recombinant HRF up-regulated the expression of IL-1 and IL-6 in B cells. In vivo administration of rHRF or the cDNA for rHRF increased total and Ag-specific Ig synthesis.

OBJECTIVES: To test the efficacy of this combination in 12 patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). METHODS: Nine patients with erythrodermic CTCL were identified for the study, eight of whom met the criteria for Sezary syndrome (SS), and three with tumour-stage mycosis fungoides (MF). Patients received intravenous fludarabine and cyclophosphamide 3 days monthly for 3-6 months. RESULTS: Six patients tolerated at least three cycles. Five with SS had a response (one had a complete clinical response and four a partial response) and one patient with MF had stable disease. The mean duration of the response was 10 months. Six patients had treatment withdrawn, five due to bone marrow suppression and one due to progressive disease. No difference in pretrial parameters were found in those who had treatment withdrawn and those who tolerated at least three courses. Survival since the trial was similar in both groups at 11 months. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the combination of fludarabine with cyclophosphamide may be of clinical benefit in patients with SS but does not affect patient survival. As with other multiagent chemotherapy regimens, bone marrow toxicity is a common and severe side-effect.

Electrification in US farm and rural areas lagged behind urban areas until 1956. In recent years, childhood leukemia has been associated with residential electromagnetic fields. During 1928-1932, in states with above 75% of residences served by electricity, leukemia mortality increased with age for single years 0-4, while states with electrification levels below 75% showed a decreasing trend with age (P = 0.009). During 1949-1951, all states showed a peak in leukemia mortality at ages 2-4. At ages 0-1, leukemia mortality was not related to electrification levels. At ages 2-4, there was a 24% (95% confidence interval (CI), 8%-41%) increase in leukemia mortality for a 10% increase in percent of homes served by electricity.

In the present study, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) were found to modulate the sensitivity of HL-60 cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. During the early stages of differentiation, DMSO treatment increased the response of HL-60 cells to tumor necrosis factor alpha; (TNF-alpha), but enhanced responsiveness was lost during later differentiation stages. In contrast, ATRA treatment induced resistance to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. HL-60 cells were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis but were sensitized by culturing in serum-free conditions. Similar to its effect on TNF-alpha sensitivity, DMSO pretreatment augmented the response to Fas-mediated signaling, which coincided with increased expression of Fas on DMSO-pretreated cells. However, during the later stages of DMSO-induced differentiation, sensitivity to anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis declined significantly, although Fas expression was still elevated. The reduced sensitivity to anti-Fas treatment partially correlated with increased Fas-associated phosphatase-1 mRNA expression. Thus, regardless of either Fas up-regulation or potentiation of TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis during early DMSO-induced differentiation, a slow increase in resistance to apoptosis mediated through these death receptors occurs during DMSO-induced differentiation, which contrasts with the rapid induction of resistance following treatment with ATRA.","['Vondracek, J', 'Sheard, M A', 'Krejci, P', 'Minksova, K', 'Hofmanova, J', 'Kozubik, A']","['Vondracek J', 'Sheard MA', 'Krejci P', 'Minksova K', 'Hofmanova J', 'Kozubik A']","['Institute of Biophysics, Mendel University, Brno, Czech Republic. hivrisik@ibp.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN13 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', '*Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2001/05/19 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/19 10:00'],"['2001/05/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2001 May;69(5):794-802.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Koivunen et al., NAT: BIOTECHNOL:, 17: 768-774, 1999). As indicated by its amino acid composition, CTT is hydrophobic, and its partitioning into phospholipid films could be verified by the monolayer technique. Augmented fluorescence emission anisotropy (from 0.064 to 0.349) and reduced collisional quenching by I(-) of the Trp residue in CTT was evident in the presence of unilamellar phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes, revealing the association of CTT with the lipid bilayers. Gelatinases are potential targets of therapeutic intervention in cancer, and inhibitors of these enzymes can prevent tumor progression in animal models. CTT enhanced 3- to 4-fold the cellular uptake of liposome-encapsulated water-soluble fluorescent marker, rhodamine B by gelatinase-expressing cells. Gelatinase targeting seems to be essential, as modified peptides that were less potent gelatinase inhibitors were also less efficient in promoting the cellular uptake of liposomes. Augmented killing ( approximately 4-fold) of U937 leukemia and HT1080 sarcoma cells was obtained by the CTT-enhanced delivery of Adriamycin-containing liposomes, compared with control liposomes administered without the peptide.

In control lumbar DRGs cultured for 3 days, only 16% of neurons were immunoreactive for GAL, but this was increased to 38% in preparations cultured with LIF. NGF by itself had no effect on GAL expression, but the proportion of GAL-positive neurons in cultures incubated with LIF and NGF together (22%) was less than that observed in DRGs cultured with LIF alone. Similar results were obtained using thoracic DRGs. In collagen gels, NGF caused marked increases in the numbers and lengths of outgrowing axons as observed in previous studies. In contrast, LIF did not stimulate axonal outgrowth but increased the proportions of axons which were immunoreactive for GAL.

This study shows that cotreatment of cultured human dermal endothelial cells (CADMEC) with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha resulted in a marked increase in the adherence of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells to CADMEC and an increase in expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin. Pretreatment of CADMEC with dexamethasone, a long-lasting glucocorticoid, resulted in a decrease in both HL-60 cell adhesion to CADMEC and adhesion molecule expression.

FLRF represent a novel evolutionarily highly conserved RING finger gene, present in Drosophila, zebrafish, Xenopus, mouse, and humans. Full-length cDNA clones for mouse and human gene encode an identical protein of 317 amino acids with a C3HC4 RING finger domain at the amino terminus. During embryonic hematopoiesis FLRF is abundantly transcribed in mouse fetal liver HSC (Sca-1+c-kit+AA4.1+Lin- cells), but is not expressed in progenitors (AA4.1-). In adult mice FLRF is not transcribed in a highly enriched population of bone marrow HSC (Rh-123lowSca-1+c-kit+Lin- cells). Its expression is upregulated in a more heterogeneous population of bone marrow HSC (Lin-Sca-1+ cells), downregulated as they differentiate into progenitors (Lin-Sca-1- cells), and upregulated as progenitors differentiate into mature lymphoid and myeloid cell types. The human FLRF gene that spans a region of at least 12 kb and consists of eight exons was localized to chromosome 12q13, a region with frequent chromosome aberrations associated with multiple cases of acute myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The analysis of the genomic sequence upstream of the first exon in the mouse and human FLRF gene has revealed that both putative promoters contain multiple putative binding sites for several hematopoietic (GATA-1, GATA-2, GATA-3, Ikaros, SCL/Tal-1, AML1, MZF-1, and Lmo2) and other transcription factors, suggesting that mouse and human FLRF expression could be regulated in a developmental and cell-specific manner during hematopoiesis. Evolutionary conservation and differential expression in fetal and adult HSC and progenitors suggest that the FLRF gene could play an important role in HSC/progenitor cell lineage commitment and differentiation and could be involved in the etiology of hematological malignancies.","['Abdullah, J M', 'Li, X', 'Nachtman, R G', 'Jurecic, R']","['Abdullah JM', 'Li X', 'Nachtman RG', 'Jurecic R']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, Florida 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '122075-70-1 (phenylalanyl-leucyl-arginyl-phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Rnf41 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Fetus', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",2001/05/19 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/05/19 10:00'],"['2001/05/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bcmd.2001.0390 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(01)90390-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 Jan-Feb;27(1):320-33. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2001.0390.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF305730'],,,,,

In addition, to investigate whether loss of p53 would play a role in the transition from chronic phase to blast crisis of CML, we crossmated p210bcr/abl transgenic (BCR/ABLtg/-) mice with p53 heterozygous (p53+/-) mice and generated p210bcr/abl transgenic, p53 heterozygous (BCR/ABLtg/- p53+/-) mice, in which a somatic alteration in the residual p53 allele directly abrogates p53 function. The BCR/ABLtg/- p53+/- mice exhibited rapid proliferation of blast cells and died in a short period compared with their wild-type (BCR/ABL-/- p53+/+), p53 heterozygous (BCR/ABL-/- p53+/-), and p210bcr/abl transgenic (BCR/ABLtg/- p53+/+) littermates. Interestingly, the normal p53 allele was frequently and preferentially lost in the tumor tissues, providing in vivo evidence that acquired loss of p53 contributes to the blastic transformation of p210bcr/abl-expressing hematopoietic cells. Our transgenic mice will be a useful model for investigating oncogenic properties of p210bcr/abl in vivo and will provide insights into the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the progression from chronic phase to blast crisis of CML.","['Honda, H', 'Hirai, H']","['Honda H', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",2001/05/19 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/05/19 10:00'],"['2001/05/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bcmd.2000.0374 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(00)90374-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 Jan-Feb;27(1):265-78. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2000.0374.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence of the translocation, RARalpha variably fuses to the PML, PLZF, NPM, NuMA, and Stat5b genes (X genes), respectively, leading to the generation of RARalpha-X and X-RARalpha fusion genes. The aberrant chimeric proteins encoded by these genes, as well as the inactivation of the X and RARalpha functions, may exert a crucial role in leukemogenesis. To define the molecular genetics of APL and the contribution of each molecular event in APL pathogenesis, we have generated transgenic mice harboring X-RARalpha and/or RARalpha-X genes as well as mice where the various X genes have been inactivated by homologous recombination. Here we show that while the X-RARalpha fusion gene is crucial for leukemogenesis, the presence of RARalpha-X and the inactivation of X function are critical in modulating the onset as well as the phenotype of the leukemia.","['Merghoub, T', 'Gurrieri, C', 'Piazza, F', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Merghoub T', 'Gurrieri C', 'Piazza F', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics']",2001/05/19 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/05/19 10:00'],"['2001/05/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bcmd.2001.0385 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(01)90385-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 Jan-Feb;27(1):231-48. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2001.0385.,,,,,,92,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

For modeling leukemia, the retroviral model system has some distinct advantages over transgenic mice. Testing different forms and mutants of a given oncogene is much easier with the retroviral system and avoids the potential deleterious effects of expression of a transgene in nonhematopoietic tissues and during development. The retroviral provirus serves as a clonal marker of a transduced cell, facilitating analysis of clonality and transplantability of the malignancy. Finally, the retroviral system allows the assessment of the action of an oncogene in different subsets of hematopoietic precursor cells in the bone marrow, which is difficult or impossible with transgenic models.

This model is proving its value in elucidating mechanisms by which PMLRARalpha contributes to leukemia, identifying genetic changes that cooperate to cause leukemia, and investigating new molecular targets for leukemia therapy. These studies suggest that acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) such as APL result from genetic changes that combine to both impair differentiation and allow immature cells to survive and proliferate outside of a normal microenvironment. Retinoic acid targets the central molecular lesion in human APL and has greatly improved survival. Molecularly targeted therapies that either restore maturation or abrogate growth autonomy represent a hope for improving survival of patients with other subtypes of AML.","['Kogan, S C']",['Kogan SC'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143-0128, USA. skogan@cc.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics']",2001/05/19 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/05/19 10:00'],"['2001/05/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bcmd.2000.0345 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(00)90345-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2000 Dec;26(6):620-5. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2000.0345.,"['CA 75986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,9,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of glucocorticoids on the tissue-infiltrating capability of lymphoid cells. Using an in vitro invasion assay, we found that dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid analogue, inhibited the invasion of a murine T-cell hybridoma through a monolayer of fibroblast-like cells. Even low doses of dexamethasone were effective at inhibiting cellular transmigration (EC50 = 0.4 nM). A maximal decrease was observed after an overnight culture in the presence of dexamethasone. The effect persisted for at least 24 h after removal of the drug and required the binding of the hormone to its intracellular glucocorticoid receptor. Our results suggest that the decreased invasiveness of dexamethasone-treated cells is not the consequence of reduced motility or deficient production of an autocrine factor required for cell migration.

Inferences from BCR and ABL geometric distributions.,1-9,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) invites biologically based radiation risk modeling because CML is simultaneously well-understood, homogeneous and prevalent. CML is known to be caused by a translocation involving the ABL and BCR genes, almost all CML patients have the BCR-ABL translocation, and CML is prevalent enough that its induction is unequivocally detected among Hiroshima A-bomb survivors. In a previous paper, a linear-quadratic-exponential (LQE) dose-response model was used to estimate the lifetime excess risk of CML in the limit of low doses of gamma-rays, R gamma. This estimate assumed that BCR-ABL translocation dose-response curves in stem cells for both neutrons and gamma-rays, differ only by a common proportionality constant from dicentric aberration dose-response curves in lymphocytes. In the present paper we challenge this assumption by predicting the BCR-ABL dose response. The predictions are based on the biophysical theory of dual radiation action (TDRA) as it applies to recent BCR-to-ABL distance data in G0 human lymphocytes; this data shows BCR and ABL geometric distributions that are not uniform and not independent, with close association of the two genes in some cells. The analysis speaks against the previous proportionality assumption. We compute 11 plausible LQE estimates of R gamma, 2 based on the proportionality assumption and 9 based on TDRA predictions. For each estimate of R gamma we also compute an associated estimate of the number of CML target cells, N; the biological basis of the LQE model allows us to form such estimates.

It was found that irradiation leads to an increase in the incidence of leukoses in males by 7% and a decrease in life duration of females. A decrease in the content of protein p53 and L-chains in immunoglobulins in males and females was observed; however, in females, the decreases was less pronounced because the content of these proteins in females is naturally decreased. In mice irradiated with low doses at the age of three- to four months, a decrease in the amount of iron complexes at a later age (seven- to eight months) was registered.

LC as antigen-presenting cells play a critical role in the induction of allergic contact dermatitis. LC research is difficult because few LCs can be isolated from human skin, so efforts have focused on obtaining DCs from alternative sources. Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and CD34+ stem cells from human cord blood and marrow can be induced to form phenotypic and functional DCs, but experiments of this type are expensive and the DC yield is low. We report here the induction of the myeloid leukemia cell line (KG-1) to a DC morphology and phenotype by culturing the cells in a defined cytokine cocktail. Morphologically, the KG-1-derived DCs are large irregularly shaped cells with prominent dendritic processes and hair-like cytoplasmic projections. Phenotypically, the KG-1-derived DCs lack lineage-specific markers, and express MHC class II, costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, and CD83. Functionally, KG-1-derived DCs are capable of phagocytosing latex microspheres and are able to induce a potent allogeneic T-cell response. Within the KG-1-derived DCs, a subpopulation maintains the DC phenotype and morphology described above but further develops CD1a+ marker expression similar to that of resident skin-derived LCs. These findings illustrate that phenotypic, morphologic and functional DCs can be derived from the KG-1 cell line.","['Hulette, B C', 'Rowden, G', 'Ryan, C A', 'Lawson, C M', 'Dawes, S M', 'Ridder, G M', 'Gerberick, G F']","['Hulette BC', 'Rowden G', 'Ryan CA', 'Lawson CM', 'Dawes SM', 'Ridder GM', 'Gerberick GF']","['Procter & Gamble Company, Miami Valley Laboratories, Cincinnati, Ohio 45253-8707, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (CD1a antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD1/*analysis', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/19 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/05/19 10:00'],"['2001/05/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004030000201 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 2001 Mar;293(3):147-58. doi: 10.1007/s004030000201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytochrome P450 pathway generates tri- and dichloroacetate as metabolites of Perc, and these are associated with hepatic toxicity and carcinogenicity. The GSH conjugation pathway is associated with generation of reactive metabolites selectively in the kidneys and with Perc-induced renal toxicity and carcinogenicity. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models have been developed for Perc in rodents and in humans. We propose the addition of a submodel that incorporates the GSH conjugation pathway and the kidneys as a target organ. Long-term bioassays of Perc exposure in laboratory animals have identified liver tumors in male and female mice, kidney tumors in male rats, and mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats. Increases in incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and of cervical, esophageal, and urinary bladder cancer have been observed for workers exposed to Perc. Limited, and not always consistent, evidence is available concerning the kidneys as a target organ for Perc in humans. Three potential modes of action for Perc-induced liver tumorigenesis are: 1) modification of signaling pathways; 2) cytotoxicity, cell death, and reparative hyperplasia; and 3) direct DNA damage. Four potential modes of action for Perc-induced renal tumorigenesis are: 1) peroxisome proliferation, 2) alpha-2u-globulin nephropathy, 3) genotoxicity leading to somatic mutation, and 4) acute cytotoxicity and necrosis leading to cell proliferation. Finally, the epidemiological and experimental data are assessed and use of toxicity information in the development of a reference dose and a reference concentration for human Perc exposure are presented.","['Lash, L H', 'Parker, J C']","['Lash LH', 'Parker JC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201-1928, USA. l.h.lash@wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Pharmacol Rev,Pharmacological reviews,0421737,"['0 (Solvents)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'TJ904HH8SN (Tetrachloroethylene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*drug effects', 'Liver/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure', '*Solvents/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', '*Tetrachloroethylene/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/toxicity']",2001/05/18 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/05/18 10:00'],"['2001/05/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmacol Rev. 2001 Jun;53(2):177-208.,['R01-ES08828/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, the direct effects of LIF were evaluated on basal and human (h)CG-stimulated testosterone synthesis by cultured, purified Leydig cells isolated from porcine testes. LIF reduced (more than 60%) hCG-stimulated testosterone synthesis. This inhibitory effect was exerted in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The maximal and half-maximal effects were obtained with, respectively, 10 ng/ml (0.5 nM ) and 2.5 ng/ml (0.125 nM ) of LIF after a 48-h treatment of the Leydig cells. Such an effect of the cytokine was not a cytotoxic effect, because it was reversible and Leydig cells recovered most of their steroidogenic activity after the removal of LIF. Considering the sites of action of LIF in inhibiting gonadotropin-stimulated testosterone formation, it was shown that LIF significantly (P < 0.002) reduced, in a comparable range (about 60% decrease), testosterone synthesis stimulated with LH/hCG or with pharmacological agents that enhance cAMP levels (cholera toxin, forskolin, and PG E2), and testosterone synthesis stimulated with 8-bromo-cAMP. Such an observation indicates that the antigonadotropic action of the cytokine is exerted in a predominant manner at a step (or steps) located beyond cAMP formation. Furthermore, incubation of Leydig cells with 22R-hydroxycholesterol (5 microg/ml, 2 h), a cholesterol substrate derivative that does not need an assisted process to be delivered to the inner mitochondrial membrane, reversed most of the inhibitory effect of LIF on the steroid hormone formation. Such results indicate that LIF acts by reducing cholesterol substrate availability in the mitochondria. Consequently, LIF action was tested on steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and PBR (peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) shown to be potentially involved in such a cholesterol transfer. LIF reduced, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, LH/hCG-induced steroidogenic acute regulatory protein messenger RNA levels. The maximal inhibitory effect was obtained with 6.6 ng/ml of LIF after 48 h of treatment. In contrast, LIF had no effect on PBR messenger RNA expression or PBR binding. This inhibitory effect of LIF on Leydig cell steroidogenesis is probably exerted via an auto/paracrine action of the cytokine. Indeed, by immunohistochemistry, LIF and LIF receptor proteins were identified in Leydig and Sertoli cells but not in other testicular cell types, except for LIF receptor in spermatogonia. Furthermore, the presence of LIF and its receptor in Leydig cells at the neonatal and adult periods suggests that the inhibitory effect of LIF on androgen formation reported here probably occurs in both the fetal and the adult Leydig cell populations during testicular development.","['Mauduit, C', 'Goddard, I', 'Besset, V', 'Tabone, E', 'Rey, C', 'Gasnier, F', 'Dacheux, F', 'Benahmed, M']","['Mauduit C', 'Goddard I', 'Besset V', 'Tabone E', 'Rey C', 'Gasnier F', 'Dacheux F', 'Benahmed M']","['INSERM U. 407, Communications Cellulaires en Biologie de la Reproduction, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 69921 Oullins Cedex, France. mauduit@lsgrisnl.univ-lyon1.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxycholesterols)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein)', '17711-16-9 (22-hydroxycholesterol)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '409J2J96VR (Androstenedione)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)', '73R90F7MQ8 (Pregnenolone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Androstenedione/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/*pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone/metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Hydroxycholesterols/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leydig Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Luteinizing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Pregnenolone/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Swine', 'Testis/growth & development', 'Testosterone/*biosynthesis']",2001/05/18 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/18 10:00'],"['2001/05/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.142.6.8177 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2001 Jun;142(6):2509-20. doi: 10.1210/endo.142.6.8177.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we isolated cytotoxic substances against a human gastric cancer cell line, TMK-1, in I. similis pupae, with an activity similar to that of the adult butterfly. The basic fraction, prepared from a methanol extract, accounted for 83% of the cytotoxic activity. Two major cytotoxic substances were purified by HPLC, and one was determined to be a new phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid, trans-(+)-3,14alpha-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyphenanthroindolizidine (1), and the other a known compound, trans-(+)-3,14alpha-dihydroxy-4,6,7-trimethoxyphenanthroindolizidine (2). The IC(50) values for TMK-1 cells were 0.5 ng/mL and 0.7 ng/mL, respectively. These two compounds showed similar cytotoxic potential with four other cancer cell lines including cervical, lung, and colon carcinomas and leukemia. Quantitative analyses indicated the presence of each of the two phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids at levels of 11-74 microg in each larva, pupa, or adult of I. similis. However, 1 was not detected in the leaves of Tylophora tanakae, a host plant for larvae of I. similis, and the level of 2 (2 microg per gram of leaves) was far less than that in the larvae. Since the leaves of T. tanakae are known to contain various phenanthroindolizidines, compounds 1 and 2 are presumably metabolically converted from such alkaloids in larvae of I. similis.","['Komatsu, H', 'Watanabe, M', 'Ohyama, M', 'Enya, T', 'Koyama, K', 'Kanazawa, T', 'Kawahara, N', 'Sugimura, T', 'Wakabayashi, K']","['Komatsu H', 'Watanabe M', 'Ohyama M', 'Enya T', 'Koyama K', 'Kanazawa T', 'Kawahara N', 'Sugimura T', 'Wakabayashi K']","['Cancer Prevention Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1, Tsukiji 5-chome, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (3,14-dihydroxy-4,6,7-trimethoxyphenanthroindolizidine)', '0 (3,14-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyphenanthroindolizidine)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Butterflies/*chemistry', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Indolizines/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Phenanthrenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/18 10:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/05/18 10:00'],"['2001/05/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['jm0004042 [pii]', '10.1021/jm0004042 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2001 May 24;44(11):1833-6. doi: 10.1021/jm0004042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key steps in the high-yield synthesis of 6 involved hydration/dehydration of the C(4)=C(5) in the precursor 3a. In the presence of NH4OH at elevated temperature, 3a underwent a reverse Michael-type addition with water to produce hydrate 5. At 37 degrees C, 6 was also hydrated in the presence of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase to afford 5. Butenolide 6 exhibited an inhibitory property toward the enzyme. Such type II (enzyme-mediated addition of water across C(4)=C(5)) mechanism is the first example of ""enzyme-substrate intermediate"" inactivation of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase. In contrast with type I mechanism-based inactivation, reduction of enzyme-bound NADP(+) to NADPH was not observed.

For the synthesis of phosphonate derivative 11, the key step involved chlorination of phosphonate 9 by use of CF3SO2Cl and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in CH2Cl2. 6-Chloropurine-containing butenolide 3d, 6-chloropurine derivative of 4-hydroxybutenolide 4, and adenine-containing 4-hydroxybutenolide 5 did not show anticancer and antiviral activities. 6-Chloropurine-containing ethylidene-2,3-dialkoxybutenolides 3a-c and phosphonate 11, however, exhibited inhibitory activity against murine leukemias (L1210 and P388), breast carcinoma (MCF7), and human T-lymphoblasts (Molt4/C8 and CEM/0) cell lines. They were also notably active toward thymidine kinase-deficient varicella-zoster virus (TK(-)VZV). Adenine-containing ethylidene-2,3-dimethoxybutenolide 6 exhibited marked selectivity in cytostatic activity against the murine leukemia (P388) cell line.","['Hakimelahi, G H', 'Mei, N W', 'Moosavi-Movahedi, A A', 'Davari, H', 'Hakimelahi, S', 'King, K Y', 'Hwu, J R', 'Wen, Y S']","['Hakimelahi GH', 'Mei NW', 'Moosavi-Movahedi AA', 'Davari H', 'Hakimelahi S', 'King KY', 'Hwu JR', 'Wen YS']","['Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan 115, Republic of China. hosein@chem.sinica.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Purines)', '8KXK25H388 (butenolide)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase)', 'OL659KIY4X (4-Butyrolactone)']",IM,"['4-Butyrolactone/analogs & derivatives', 'Adenosylhomocysteinase', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Furans/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kinetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Purines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidine Kinase/deficiency', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/18 10:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/05/18 10:00'],"['2001/05/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['jm0004446 [pii]', '10.1021/jm0004446 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2001 May 24;44(11):1749-57. doi: 10.1021/jm0004446.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PCR-ELAHA systems can rapidly detect proviral DNA from any retroviral vector carrying the common selective and marker genes neomycin phosphotransferase and green fluorescent protein, and the methods described are equally applicable to other sequences of interest, providing a cheaper alternative to the evolving real-time PCR methods.

In the context of a gene therapy protocol for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) we examined whether the Bcr-Abl fusion protein would have either of these effects. Thus, the mechanism of cell killing by transfer of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) and subsequent ganciclovir (GCV) treatment was examined in pre-B (TonB210.1) cells and myeloid cells (32D) and in their BCR-ABL-expressing counterparts. HSV-tk-transduced cell lines, either in the presence or in the absence of BCR-ABL expression, became susceptible to GCV at concentrations which were nontoxic to the nontransduced cells. This susceptibility was represented by apoptotic cell death in all cases. Apoptosis was observed after 24 h of treatment with GCV in the tk-transduced parental cells and in the BCR-ABL-expressing TonB210.1 cells but only after a delay of more than 24 h in the 32Dp210 cells compared to 32D. Cell death in the BCR-ABL-expressing clones was preceded by S- and G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest. Activation of FAS/APO-1 and caspase-8 was observed in all the tk-transduced cell lines after GCV treatment. However, the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK only partially abrogated tk/GCV-induced apoptosis. A possible role for inhibition of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) expression in the apoptosis induced by GCV was observed in the tk-transduced TonB210.1 cells but not in the 32D or 32Dp210 cells. The data demonstrate that expression of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein does not block the apoptosis induced by the HSV-tk/GCV system, suggesting that this suicide gene therapy strategy could be considered for the treatment of CML in blast crisis.","['Rivas, C', 'Miller, A R', 'Collado, M', 'Lam, E W', 'Apperley, J F', 'Melo, J V']","['Rivas C', 'Miller AR', 'Collado M', 'Lam EW', 'Apperley JF', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 ONN, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/biosynthesis', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'Ganciclovir/*pharmacology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Time Factors', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis']",2001/05/18 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/05/18 10:00'],"['2001/05/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mthe.2001.0310 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(01)90310-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2001 May;3(5 Pt 1):642-52. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2001.0310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitochondria localized anti-death proteins of the Bcl-2 family play a central role in inhibiting apoptosis and therefore present valid targets for novel therapy. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) shares a close physical association with the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), a pivotal regulator of cell death located at mitochondrial contact sites. In this study we investigated the cytotoxicity of the PBR ligand, PK11195, in the micromolar concentration range. PK11195 induced antioxidant inhibitable collapse of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and mitochondrial swelling in HL60 human leukaemia cells, but not in SUDHL4 lymphoma cells (which exhibited a higher level of reduced glutathione and relative tolerance to chemotherapy or pro-oxidant induced DeltaPsi(m)dissipation). PK11195 induced the production of hydrogen peroxide that was not inhibited by Bcl-2 transfection, nor depletion of mitochondrial DNA. ROS production was however blocked by protonophore, implicating a requirement for DeltaPsi(m). Our findings suggest that PK11195-induced cytotoxicity relies upon Bcl-2 resistant generation of oxidative stress; a process only observed at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher that required to saturate its receptor.","['Fennell, D A', 'Corbo, M', 'Pallaska, A', 'Cotter, F E']","['Fennell DA', 'Corbo M', 'Pallaska A', 'Cotter FE']","[""Department of Experimental Haematology, St Bartholomew's & The Royal London School of Medicine, Turner Street, London, E1 2AD, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, GABA-A)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'YNF83VN1RL (PK 11195)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Isoquinolines/*toxicity', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphoma', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*physiology', 'Receptors, GABA-A/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/18 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/18 10:00'],"['2001/05/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/bjoc.2001.1788 [doi]', 'S0007092001917884 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 May 18;84(10):1397-404. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2001.1788.,,,,,,,PMC2363650,,['Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, these agents, generally either granulocyte-macrophage (GM)- or granulocyte (G)-CSF, were hypothesized to reduce rates of major infection and/or death in the initial weeks after administration of chemotherapy. Although trials have consistently shown that both cytokines accelerate neutrophil recovery, only 1 out of 5-10 large randomized trials has reported that a decrease in major infection occurs as a result. While some of these trials have found that the use of cytokines lowers days in hospital, on antibiotics, or with fever, it is unclear whether the magnitude of these effects outweighs the expense currently entailed in CSF administration; indeed it appears that estimates of cost are themselves quite variable. The second major use of cytokines has been in priming acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts to the cytotoxic actions of chemotherapy. Here again, the results of several randomized trials do not justify application of this strategy. It remains possible that there are subsets of AML patients who would benefit from priming. However, the identification of such patients might require years of accrual into clinical trials from which the majority of patients would not benefit. Future years may see trials of cytokines (e.g. pegylated recombinant human megakaryocytic growth and development factor +G- or GM-CSF) in patients in remission and as a means to increase the number of normal granulocytes that can be given to patients with infections. Further therapies may target cytokine receptors on AML blasts, to improve anti-leukaemia therapy.","['Estey, E H']",['Estey EH'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

The combination of all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and conventional anthracycline-ARA-C chemotherapy (CT) has clearly demonstrated its superiority over CT alone (in terms of relapse and survival) in newly diagnosed APL. Combination treatment probably also reduces the incidence of initial failures, and complete remission (CR) rates greater than 90% are now regularly reported in large multicentre trials. Some randomized studies strongly suggest than prolonged maintenance treatment (for 1 or 2 years) with ATRA and low dose CT, and possibly very early introduction of anthracycline CT during induction treatment (i.e. not after ATRA) may reduce the incidence of relapse. With those treatments, the risk of relapse appears to be only 10-15%, although it remains greater in patients who initially have white blood cell counts (often associated with variant M(3)morphology, short bcr(3)isoform etc.) and patients with residual disease detectable by RT-PCR at the end of consolidation courses.ATRA syndrome remains the major side effect of ATRA treatment. It occurs in 10-15% of patients and is currently fatal in at least 10% of them. Rapid onset of CT and/or high dose steroids should improve its outcome.A sizeable proportion of APL patients who relapse after ATRA and CT can be durably salvaged by the same treatment followed by allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation, provided the transplant (in the autologous setting) is RT-PCR negative. Arsenic trioxide can induce CR in most APL patients refractory to ATRA and CT. It acts mainly by inducing apoptosis of APL cells. A place for arsenic trioxide earlier in the treatment of APL must currently be more precisely defined. Another issue in the treatment of APL is reducing the toxicity of first line treatment without increasing the relapse risk. Preliminary findings suggest that this could be achieved by consolidation CT using an anthracycline alone, without cytarabine.","['Fenaux, P', 'Chomienne, C', 'Degos, L']","['Fenaux P', 'Chomienne C', 'Degos L']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU, 1 Place de Verdun, Lille, 59037, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Corresponding to the benefit to patients under the age of 60 from high-dose Ara-C there are also dose effects in those over 60 years old, in particular for daunorubicin in the induction treatment, and for the quantity in terms of duration of postremission treatment. The use of these effects can partly overcome the mostly unfavourable disease biology seen in older age AML patients, which is expressed by the absence of favourable and the over-representation of adverse chromosomal abnormalities as well as by the expression of drug resistance. We recommend an adequate dosage of 60 mg/m(2)daunorubicin for 3 days in combination with standard dose Ara-C and 6-thioguanine given for induction and consolidation, followed by a prolonged monthly maintenance chemotherapy for a duration of at least 1 year. Further improvements in supportive care may help in delivering additional anti-leukaemic cytotoxicity.

A clinical history of exposure to haematotoxins or radiation is helpful; however, many older patients are diagnosed with leukaemia with no antecedent history of exposure. These patients' disease show a remarkably similar phenotype to classic therapy-related leukaemia. The specific cytogenetic abnormalities common to MDS, alkylating-agent-related AML and poor-prognosis AML (3q-, -5, 5q-, -7, 7q-, +8, +9, 11q-, 12p-, -18, -19,20q-, +21, t(1;7), t(2;11)), probably reflect a common pathogenesis distinct from that of other de novo AMLs, although the pathogenetic pathway has yet to be elucidated. Possibly, tumour suppressor genes are implicated and genomic instability may be a cause of multiple unbalanced chromosomal translocations or deletions. Typically, these patients are either elderly or have a history of exposure to alkylating agents or environmental exposure 5-7 years prior to diagnosis. Another distinct entity affects the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene located on 11q23. These account for about 3% of patients with therapy-related leukaemia and have a short latency period from exposure, usually to an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. Other therapy-related patients with t(8:21), inv16 or t(15;17) translocations should be treated as any other de novo AML with similar cytogenetics. In summary, the major prognostic factor is related to the pathogenetic mechanisms of the leukaemia. Cytogenetics and molecular features are a better predictor of outcome than patient history. Patients should receive standard induction therapy. However, the long-term outcome is relatively poor; the best results being obtained among patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation.","['Dann, E J', 'Rowe, J M']","['Dann EJ', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Haifa, 31096, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Intensive consolidation can deliver a similar survival, of which high-dose Ara-C has been widely adopted, but other intensive schedules appear equivalent. It is not known how many treatment courses are required. Patients are at differing risks of relapse which may influence the choice of treatment. In trials where a risk profile is available, and where a donor versus no-donor analysis is performed, there appears to be little robust evidence to support transplant in good or poor risk disease, although the experience in the latter groups is not unanimous.

A common theme in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) associated with balanced reciprocal translocations is the involvement of transcription factors as one or both of the fusion partners. Transcription factors commonly involved in chromosomal translocations include core binding factor (CBF), retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), ETS family of transcription factors and homeobox gene (HOX) family members. In addition, the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors by these transcription factors suggests that these proteins also may play a critical role in leukaemogenesis. In support of this hypothesis' at least three fusions associated with leukaemias and involving transcriptional co-activators CBP and p300 have been recently cloned. However expression of transcription factor fusion proteins is not sufficient to induce a leukaemic phenotype, as evidenced in part by the long latencies required for disease development in the murine models of the disease. An emerging paradigm is the co-operation between constitutively activated tyrosine kinase molecules, such as FLT3, and transcription factor fusions in the pathogenesis of AML. In such a model, the activated tyrosine kinase confers proliferation and/or anti-apoptotic activity to the hematopoietic cells, while the transcription factor fusion impairs normal differentiation pathways with limited effect on cellular proliferation.","['Dash, A', 'Gilliland, D G']","['Dash A', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, 4 Blackfan Circle, Room 421, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

There are now several examples of alpha-nucleosides exerting a biological activity in some instances equal to, or even exceeding, that of the corresponding beta-anomer. Examples include growth inhibitory properties against mouse leukemia cells and antitumor activity. From stereochemical point of view, alpha-anomers serve as references for studying of interaction of the base with the sugar moiety in beta-anomers and may help in better understanding of structure-activity relationships. One important problem preventing conformational analysis of alpha nucleosides is uncertainty in the determination of vicinal coupling constants from simulation of overlapping sugar proton resonances of strongly coupled spin systems. A successful resolution of near-isochronous H3' and H4' resonances made possible a full conformational analysis for a series of alpha-anomers C5-substituted 2'-deoxyuridines, including methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, fluor, vinyl, and bromovinyl, in comparison to their beta counterparts. Conformation of the sugar ring is determined from proton-proton coupling constants and described in terms of pseudorotation between two main puckering domains C2'endo (S) and C3'endo (N). A thorough analysis of chemical shifts as well as conformation of the sugar ring and C4'-C5' rotamers made possible determination of conformational preferences in equilibrium about the glycosidic bond between two regions, anti and syn.

PGL-I alone did not induce TNF secretion by PBMC, but when associated with a sub-optimal dose of armadillo-derived M. leprae increased the release of this cytokine. In agreement with these results, M. leprae-exposed THP-1 cells did not secrete detectable levels of TNF unless PGL-I was simultaneously added to the culture. This increase in TNF production suggests that PGL-I plays a role in the induction of TNF during the natural infection. In addition, the modulatory effect of PGL-I on TNF release by THP-1 cells reinforces that monocytes are one of the possible targets of this molecule.","['Charlab, R', 'Sarno, E N', 'Chatterjee, D', 'Pessolani, M C']","['Charlab R', 'Sarno EN', 'Chatterjee D', 'Pessolani MC']","['Leprosy Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Av.

Reverse transcriptases are retroviral DNA polymerases that can synthesize DNA from both RNA and DNA. In general, because of the lack of 3'-->5' exonuclease activity in retroviral reverse transcriptases, the reverse transcription step is error prone. Mutations created during the reverse transcription step of cDNA synthesis or RT-PCR are delivered to the final products to be analyzed, interfering with accurate analysis of the RNAs. In addition, because reverse transcription uses RNA as a template, processive DNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase is frequently interrupted by secondary structures of the RNA templates, causing difficulties in full-length cDNA synthesis. Here, we report that an increase in reaction temperature greatly enhances both the accuracy and the processivity of reverse transcription catalyzed by murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptases.","['Malboeuf, C M', 'Isaacs, S J', 'Tran, N H', 'Kim, B']","['Malboeuf CM', 'Isaacs SJ', 'Tran NH', 'Kim B']","['University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['DNA, Complementary/*biosynthesis', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics', 'HIV-1/chemistry/enzymology/genetics', '*Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Mutation', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic']",2001/05/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/05/18 10:00'],"['2001/05/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2144/01305rr06 [doi]'],ppublish,"Biotechniques. 2001 May;30(5):1074-8, 1080, 1082, passim. doi: 10.2144/01305rr06.",['R29-GM55500/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we postulated that T cadherin could regulate surfactant protein (SP)-D gene expression in human bronchioloalveolar type-II cells. We transfected A549 cells (human lung cancer cell line with alveolar type-II cell characteristics) with the T-cadherin expression vector. Both original and control plasmid-transfected A549 cells expressed SP-D; however, neither human nor murine T-cadherin-transfected A549 cells expressed SP-D mRNA. The downregulation of SP-D production in human T-cadherin-expressed A549 cells was also demonstrated using Western immunoblotting techniques. Control vector-transfected A549 cells showed a positive band of SP-D but not of T cadherin. In contrast, T-cadherin-transfected A549 cells, which expressed T-cadherin protein, did not produce SP-D. We further examined the relationship of T cadherin and SP-D expression in secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with hematolymphoid malignancies. SP-D was detected in bronchioloalveolar type-II cells in alveolar proteinosis. However, little or no T-cadherin expression was detected in alveolar type-II cells in these patients.

Although the preclinical antitumor activity of FB642 has been well explored, its mechanism of action has not been as well delineated. Previous studies indicate that FB642 may interfere with mitosis and thus may disrupt or inhibit microtubule function resulting in apoptosis. This study seeks to determine if FB642 is a sufficiently novel agent worthy of further development by examining the effect of FB642 on apoptosis, the cell cycle, p53-positive and -negative tumors, and drug-resistant and MDR cell lines. The results of this present study indicate that FB642 increases the degree of apoptosis in all examined tumor cell lines, may induce G2/M uncoupling, may selectively kill p53 abnormal cells, and exhibits antitumor activity in drug- and multidrug-resistant cell lines. The induction of apoptosis by FB642, particularly in p53-deficient cells, its impressive in vivo activity against a broad spectrum of murine and human tumors, as well as an acceptable toxicity profile in animals, make FB642 an excellent candidate for further evaluation in clinical trials in cancer patients.","['Hammond, L A', 'Davidson, K', 'Lawrence, R', 'Camden, J B', 'Von Hoff, D D', 'Weitman, S', 'Izbicka, E']","['Hammond LA', 'Davidson K', 'Lawrence R', 'Camden JB', 'Von Hoff DD', 'Weitman S', 'Izbicka E']","['Institute for Drug Development, Cancer Therapy & Research Center, 8122 Datapoint Drive 650, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA. lhammond@saci.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'H75J14AA89 (carbendazim)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', '*Carbamates', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/physiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/physiology']",2001/05/18 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/18 10:00'],"['2001/05/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004320000212 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2001 May;127(5):301-13. doi: 10.1007/s004320000212.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these diseases, intrathecal use is restricted to methotrexate (MTX), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and corticosteroids. A number of other agents are, at the present time, under evaluation. Intrathecal MTX administered sequentially with systemic high dose MTX infusion prolongs therapeutic cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels of the drug. Prolonged therapeutic CSF levels can also be achieved by giving repeated small intrathecal doses of MTX over an extended period in selected patients, with an implanted Ommaya reservoir. In the CSF, the metabolic inactivation of Ara-C is significantly lower than in plasma with a CSF clearance similar to the rate of CSF bulk flow. A slow-release formulation of Ara-C may be given intrathecally, resulting in a prolonged cytotoxic concentration in the CSF. CNS relapse and neurotoxicity in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, especially younger children, may be reduced by using age-related dosing of intrathecal MTX and Ara-C. Hydrocortisone is used in combination with MTX and Ara-C for so-called 'triple intrathecal chemotherapy' in the treatment of meningeal leukaemia. Intrathecal thiotepa does not appear to be advantageous over systemic administration in patients with brain and meningeal leukaemia. Monoclonal antibodies, reactive with tumour-associated antigens, can be used as delivery systems for chemotherapeutic agents and radionuclides. However, the development of this new approach is currently under evaluation in larger clinical studies. Neurological adverse effects may be expected with intrathecal chemotherapy and are increased by high dose systemic therapy, concomitant cranial radiotherapy or meningeal infiltration by neoplastic cells. Inadvertant intrathecal administration of antineoplastic agents that are indicated for systemic administration only, is dangerous and may result in a fatal outcome.","['Ruggiero, A', 'Conter, V', 'Milani, M', 'Biagi, E', 'Lazzareschi, I', 'Sparano, P', 'Riccardi, R']","['Ruggiero A', 'Conter V', 'Milani M', 'Biagi E', 'Lazzareschi I', 'Sparano P', 'Riccardi R']","['Division of Paediatric Oncology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Medulloblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Thiotepa/therapeutic use']",2001/05/17 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/05/17 10:00'],"['2001/05/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00128072-200103040-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 2001;3(4):237-46. doi: 10.2165/00128072-200103040-00001.,,,,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AMD analogues consisted of two series of phenoxazone derivatives substituted with either benzo-15-crown-5 or benzo-18-crown-6 and with different lengths of spacers between the crown groups and the phenoxazone chromophore. The biological activities of the synthetic compounds were investigated by examination of drug-induced apoptosis and cell cycle perturbations in a human leukemia MOLT-3 cell line by flow cytometry. A compound with dimethylaminopropyl side chains on the phenoxazone chromophore was used as a control; this molecule was shown to intercalate into DNA by UV-visible spectroscopy and was found to have considerable cytotoxic activity in the 1-9 microM concentration range. Compounds with five-membered crown-ether side chains showed biological activity comparable with the control drug, whereas increasing the length of the spacers between the crown groups and the phenoxazone chromophore reduced the cytotoxic effect of the drugs. Compounds with six-membered crown-ether side chains reduced stabilization of the DNA double helical structure and abolished biological activity. Cell cycle alterations were observed only in drug systems which demonstrated cytotoxic activity. Cell cycle regulation was found to be sensitive to minor modifications (elongation of the spacer by one methylene group) in the side chains of the benzo-15-crown-5 derivatives, indicating that such series of synthetic drugs may serve as useful probes for investigation of cell cycle regulation processes.","['Karawajew, L', 'Glibin, E N', 'Maleev, V Y', 'Czerwony, G', 'Dorken, B', 'Davies, D B', 'Veselkov, A N']","['Karawajew L', 'Glibin EN', 'Maleev VY', 'Czerwony G', 'Dorken B', 'Davies DB', 'Veselkov AN']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle Clinic, Charite, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany. karawajew@rrk-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oxazines)', '1916-63-8 (phenoxazinone)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Oxazines/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/17 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/17 10:00'],"['2001/05/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 2000 Oct;15(5):331-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, pluripotent embryonic stem cells were transfected with cDNA encoding L-FABP and a series of clones expressing increasing levels of L-FABP were isolated. Untransfected ES cells, as well as ES cells transfected only with empty vector, spontaneously differentiated from rounded adipocyte-like to fibroblast-like morphology, concomitant with marked reduction in expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA-1). These changes in morphology and expression of SSEA-1 were greatest in ES cell clones expressing L-FABP above a threshold level. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that L-FABP was primarily localized in a diffuse-cytosolic pattern along with a lesser degree of punctate L-FABP expression in the nucleus. Nuclear localization of L-FABP was preferentially increased in clones expressing higher levels of L-FABP. In summary, L-FABP expression altered ES cell morphology and expression of SSEA-1. Taken together with the fact that L-FABP was detected in the nucleus, these data suggested that L-FABP may play a more direct, heretofore unknown, role in regulating ES cell differentiation by acting in the nucleus as well as cytoplasm.","['Schroeder, F', 'Atshaves, B P', 'Starodub, O', 'Boedeker, A L', 'Smith, R R 3rd', 'Roths, J B', 'Foxworth, W B', 'Kier, A B']","['Schroeder F', 'Atshaves BP', 'Starodub O', 'Boedeker AL', 'Smith RR 3rd', 'Roths JB', 'Foxworth WB', 'Kier AB']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Texas A&M University, TVMC, College Station 77843-4466, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fabp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fabp5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fabp7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 7)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 7', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lewis X Antigen/physiology', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2001/05/17 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/05/17 10:00'],"['2001/05/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1010851130136 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2001 Mar;219(1-2):127-38. doi: 10.1023/a:1010851130136.,"['DK41402/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-ES0916/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined whether p38 MAPK is activated by IFN-alpha in BCR-ABL-expressing cells and whether its function is required for the generation of growth inhibitory responses. IFN-alpha treatment induced phosphorylation/activation of p38 in the IFN-alpha-sensitive KT-1 cell line, but not in IFN-alpha-resistant K562 cells. Consistent with this, IFN-alpha treatment of KT-1 (but not K562) cells induced activation of the small GTPase Rac1, which functions as an upstream regulator of p38. In addition, IFN-alpha-dependent phosphorylation/activation of p38 was induced by treatment of primary granulocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with CML. To define the functional role of the Rac1/p38 MAPK pathway in IFN-alpha signaling, the effects of pharmacological inhibition of p38 on the induction of IFN-alpha responses were determined. Treatment of KT-1 cells with the p38-specific inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 reversed the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha. On the other hand, the MEK kinase inhibitor PD098059 had no effects, further demonstrating the specificity of these findings. To directly determine the significance of IFN-alpha-dependent activation of p38 in the induction of the anti-leukemic effects of IFN-alpha, we evaluated the effects of p38 inhibition on leukemic colony formation in bone marrow samples of patients with CML. IFN-alpha inhibited leukemic granulocyte/macrophage colony formation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas concomitant treatment with p38 inhibitors reversed such an inhibition. Thus, the Rac1/p38 MAPK pathway is activated by IFN-alpha in BCR-ABL-expressing cells and appears to play a key role in the generation of the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha in CML cells.","['Mayer, I A', 'Verma, A', 'Grumbach, I M', 'Uddin, S', 'Lekmine, F', 'Ravandi, F', 'Majchrzak, B', 'Fujita, S', 'Fish, E N', 'Platanias, L C']","['Mayer IA', 'Verma A', 'Grumbach IM', 'Uddin S', 'Lekmine F', 'Ravandi F', 'Majchrzak B', 'Fujita S', 'Fish EN', 'Platanias LC']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Illinois and the West Side Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP-kinase-activated kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP-kinase-activated kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interferon-alpha/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'K562 Cells', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Wortmannin', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2001/05/17 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/05/17 10:00'],"['2001/05/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M011685200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)31674-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jul 27;276(30):28570-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M011685200.

We reviewed 139 consecutive FNABS of 84 primary and 55 recurrent lymphomas. FCM was successful in 105 (75%) cases. The overall results, including cases without FCM, included 93/139 (67%) true positive, 7 (5%) false negative, and 39 indeterminate (27 [19%] suspicious and 12 [9%] atypical) diagnoses of lymphoma. In cases with FCM, there were 80/105 (77%) true positive, no false negative, and 25 indeterminate diagnoses (15 [14%] suspicious and 10 [9%] atypical). The overall results of the 84 primary lymphomas were 55 (67%) true positive, 5 (5%) false negative, and 24 indeterminate (14[16%] suspicious and 10 [12%] atypical) diagnoses for lymphoma. Of the 68 primary lymphomas analyzed with FCM, 50 [74%] were true positives, and 28 were indeterminate (11 [16%] suspicious and 7 [10%] atypical). There were no false negatives. Diagnostic accuracy varied among lymphoma subtypes. Subclassification of the positive cases were initially conclusive in only 55/93 cases (59%). However, a retrospective review of the morphologic together with FCM data in 15 of the 23 unclassified cases improved the overall subclassification of positive cases to 77%. Subclassification was best in small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and plasmacytoma (all 100%). Subclassification was poor in marginal-zone lymphoma (33%), and initially as well in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (62%), but it improved on review (95%), as did subclassification of follicular lymphoma (77 to 100% on review). Hodgkin's disease was recognized as malignant in only 44% of the cases (7/16) and was classified as such based on morphology alone. This review of our early efforts to diagnose and subclassify lymphoma with FNAB and FCM indicates that although a diagnosis and proper subclassification of lymphoma can be made with certainty in the majority of cases, recurrent or primary, it requires close coordination of cytomorphology and immunophenotyping data, which often comes with close cooperation of cytopathologists and hematopathologists. A mere cytological diagnosis of positive for lymphoma is no longer acceptable if FNAB is to become an independent diagnostic tool for lymphoma.","['Dong, H Y', 'Harris, N L', 'Preffer, F I', 'Pitman, M B']","['Dong HY', 'Harris NL', 'Preffer FI', 'Pitman MB']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Image Cytometry', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*classification/*diagnosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/05/16 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/16 10:00'],"['2001/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/modpathol.3880336 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2001 May;14(5):472-81. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880336.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were randomized to HAM as either the second or third therapy block, for the purpose of evaluation of efficacy and toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 471 children with de novo AML were entered onto the trial; 161 were at standard risk and 310 were at high risk. After the randomized induction (daunorubicin v idarubicin), further therapy, with the exception of HAM, was identical in the two risk groups and also comparable to that in study Acute Myeloid Leukemia-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (AML-BFM) 87. RESULTS: Overall, 387 (82%) of 471 patients achieved complete remission, and 5-year survival, event-free survival (EFS), and disease-free survival rates were 60%, 51%, and 62%, respectively. Idarubicin induction resulted in a significantly better blast cell reduction in the bone marrow on day 15. Estimated survival and probability of EFS were superior in study AML-BFM 93 compared with study AML-BFM 87 (P =.01, log-rank test). This improvement, however, was restricted to the 310 high-risk patients (remission rate and probability of 5-year EFS in study AML-BFM 93 v study AML-BFM 87: 78% v 68%, P =.007; and 44% v 31%, P =.01, log-rank test). Probability of 5-year EFS among standard-risk patients in study AML-BFM 93 was similar to that in study AML-BFM 87 (65% v 63%, P = not significant). Whether HAM was placed as the second or third therapy block was of minor importance. However, patients who received the less intensive daunorubicin treatment during induction benefited from early HAM. CONCLUSION: Improved treatment results in children with high-risk AML in study AML-BFM 93 must be attributed mainly to the introduction of HAM.","['Creutzig, U', 'Ritter, J', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Hermann, J', 'Berthold, F', 'Henze, G', 'Jurgens, H', 'Kabisch, H', 'Havers, W', 'Reiter, A', 'Kluba, U', 'Niggli, F', 'Gadner, H']","['Creutzig U', 'Ritter J', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reinhardt D', 'Hermann J', 'Berthold F', 'Henze G', 'Jurgens H', 'Kabisch H', 'Havers W', 'Reiter A', 'Kluba U', 'Niggli F', 'Gadner H']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Munster, Germany. ucreutzig@aol.com""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2001/05/16 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/16 10:00'],"['2001/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.10.2705 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 May 15;19(10):2705-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.10.2705.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examine whether the presence of residual 8-oxoguanine can be detected in mammalian cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. MOLT-4 human leukemia cells and CHO-K1 Chinese hamster cells were acutely irradiated in vitro with 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0 Gy gamma radiation at room temperature. The amounts of 8-oxoguanine and total DNA in the cell nucleus were detected by fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled avidin, which binds specifically and directly to 8-oxoguanine, and propidium iodide, respectively. The intensity ratios between these two fluorescent dyes were then taken as indices to measure the content of 8-oxoguanine within individual cells. We found an apparent dose-dependent increase in the amount of 8-oxoguanine accumulated in cells of both lines. Moreover, the content of 8-oxoguanine decreased from 2 to 20 h after irradiation in CHO-K1 cells, which may reflect the time-dependent repair processes at the 8-oxoguanine lesions. This novel approach may provide a sensitive tool for in situ measurement of 8-oxoguanine in cells or even in the human body after exposure to ionizing radiation.","['Chen, S K', 'Tsai, M H', 'Hwang, J J', 'Chang, W P']","['Chen SK', 'Tsai MH', 'Hwang JJ', 'Chang WP']","['Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and Institute of Public Health, National Yangming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['5614-64-2 (8-hydroxyguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Fluorescence', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Humans']",2001/05/16 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/16 10:00'],"['2001/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/0033-7587(2001)155[0832:dooiic]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2001 Jun;155(6):832-6. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2001)155[0832:dooiic]2.0.co;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Radiat Res 2001 Jul;156(1):124.

Given that some of the known opportunistic microbes found in patients infected with HIV-1 harbor neuraminidase (NA) activity, we speculated that pathogen-derived NA might be envisaged as an important factor in the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection. In the present study, we have monitored the putative modulation of HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation and virus replication by highly purified bacterial-derived NA from Arthrobacter ureafaciens. Taking advantage of a luciferase-based syncytium quantitative assay, we demonstrate here that the level of HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation is enhanced in the presence of NA and that it necessitates interaction between gp120 and CD4/chemokine coreceptor. By using pseudotyped recombinant luciferase-encoding HIV-1 particles, we found that NA treatment of human CD4-positive target cells (i.e., T lymphoid, monocytoid, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) significantly augmented single-round infection by T- and macrophage-tropic isolates of HIV-1. The observed increase in HIV-1 infection was linked with an enhancement in the initial steps of the virus replicative cycle as monitored by viral binding and entry assays. Interestingly, NA treatment also enhances infectivity of HIV-1 pseudotypes with envelope glycoprotein from the amphotropic murine leukemia virus or the vesicular stomatitis virus. Taken together, our results provide useful information regarding the possible contribution of microbial agents carrying NA activity to HIV-1 pathogenesis.","['Sun, J', 'Barbeau, B', 'Sato, S', 'Tremblay, M J']","['Sun J', 'Barbeau B', 'Sato S', 'Tremblay MJ']","['Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Pavillon CHUL, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Arthrobacter/*enzymology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Giant Cells/*virology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/biosynthesis', '*HIV-1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2001/05/16 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/16 10:00'],"['2001/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2001.0889 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(01)90889-X [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2001 May 25;284(1):26-36. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.0889.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We determined the molecular weight, tissue distribution and subcellular distribution of the autoantigen and obtained limited amino acid sequence after purification by ion-exchange chromatography and trypsin digestion. RESULTS: We identified the 74-kd autoantigen as synapsin I on the basis of the following observations. First, the autoantigen has properties consistent with synapsin I: molecular weight of approximately equals 74 kd, brain-specific distribution, presence in cytosol and on synaptosomes, and association with taxol-stabilized microtubules. Second, limited amino acid sequence determination after trypsin digestion of the autoantigen shows identity with synapsin I. Third, the autoimmune serum immunoblots fusion proteins that incorporate rat synapsin Ia. The autoantibodies reactive to synapsin Ia are of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM class. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of autoantibodies that are reactive to synapsin Ia. Autoantibodies that are reactive to synapsin Ia are not restricted to discoid lupus erythematosus patients, because we found identical reactivity in two of 18 sera from dsDNA-positive systemic lupus erythematosus patients and in two of 14 rheumatoid factor-positive sera. Whether autoantibodies to synapsin I are associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations is currently unknown.","['Gitlits, V M', 'Sentry, J W', 'Matthew, L S', 'Smith, A I', 'Toh, B H']","['Gitlits VM', 'Sentry JW', 'Matthew LS', 'Smith AI', 'Toh BH']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Monash Medical School, Prahran, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Synapsins)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Autoantigens/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Brain/*immunology', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Synapsins/immunology/*isolation & purification']",2001/05/16 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/16 10:00'],"['2001/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2310/6650.2001.33973 [doi]'],ppublish,J Investig Med. 2001 May;49(3):276-83. doi: 10.2310/6650.2001.33973.,,,,,,,,,,,10.2310/6650.2001.33973 [doi],,,,,,,,,,

Because of the high mutability of retroviruses, it is not the generation of new viral variants that limits the extent of diversity and the rate of evolution of retroviruses, but rather the selection forces that act on these variants. Here, we suggest that two selection forces--the immune response and the limited availability of appropriate target cells during transmission and persistence--are chiefly responsible for the observed sequence diversity in untreated retroviral infections. We illustrate these aspects of positive selection by reference to specific lentiviruses [human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV)] and oncoviruses [feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV)] that differ in their extent of variation and in disease outcomes.","['Overbaugh, J', 'Bangham, C R']","['Overbaugh J', 'Bangham CR']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. joverbau@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,['0 (Viral Vaccines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'HIV/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/physiology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/transmission/virology', '*Selection, Genetic', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/physiology', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",2001/05/16 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/16 10:00'],"['2001/05/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.1059128 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 2001 May 11;292(5519):1106-9. doi: 10.1126/science.1059128.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two cancer cell lines PAMC82 and K562 were used to examine their colony-forming ability in soft agar, microtubule structure, calmodulin levels and regulation of some gene expressions by Northern blot analysis with and without treatment by RE. The results showed that on soft agar culture the colony-forming ability of human gastric cancer cell line PAMC82 treated by RE chloride decreased and the PAMC82 cell microtubule abnormal structure became normal. The calmodulin (CaM) levels decreased in human leukemia cells (K562) treated with cerium chloride and neodymium chloride. The Northern blot analysis revealed marked up-regulation of p53, p16(MTS1), p21 (WAF1) gene expressions in PAMC82 cells treated with lanthanum chloride and cerium chloride, as compared to control PAMC82 cells. The light rare earth elements studied have certain suppression effects on proliferation of cancer cells.

In the present study, we tested the amino-polysaccharide fraction (designated as 'G009') from Ganoderma lucidum for the ability to protect against oxidative damage induced by ROS. G009 significantly inhibited iron-induced lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates and showed a dose-dependent inactivation of hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions. It also reduced strand breakage in phiX174 supercoiled DNA caused by UV-induced photolysis of hydrogen peroxide and attenuated phorbol ester-induced generation of superoxide anions in differentiated human promyelocytic leukaemia (HL-60) cells.

In the present work we observed increased acetylation of histones with allyl isothiocyanate and butanethiol but not with butyl sulfide or butyl disulfide. Increased acetylation of histones was established by change in electrophoretic mobility, incorporation of [3H]acetate or immunoblotting. Histone deacetylase in nuclei of DS19 cells was inhibited 74% by 0.5 mM allyl mercaptan and 43% by 0.5 mM butanethiol but was not significantly affected by 0.5 mM allyl isothiocyanate. There was some degree of reversibility in the effect of allyl isothiocyanate when the cells were incubated for 15 hr in fresh medium. The data suggested that allyl isothiocyanate may stimulate histone acetylation rather than inhibit histone deacetylation. Addition of allyl isothiocyanate, however, had very little or no additional effect on the induction of histone acetylation caused by trichostatin A. Histone acetyltransferase activity determined in cell homogenates was not increased by preincubation of cells with allyl isothiocyanate or inclusion of allyl isothiocyanate in the assay medium. It was concluded that treatment of mouse erythroleukemia cells with allyl isothiocyanate can cause increased acetylation of histones but the mechanism for this effect requires further elucidation.","['Lea, M A', 'Randolph, V M', 'Lee, J E', 'desBordes, C']","['Lea MA', 'Randolph VM', 'Lee JE', 'desBordes C']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA. lea@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Benzidines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '2X02101HVF (benzidine)', '3129-90-6 (isothiocyanic acid)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '77OY909F30 (n-butyl mercaptan)', 'BN34FX42G3 (allyl isothiocyanate)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Benzidines/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/15 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/15 10:00'],"['2001/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ijc.1277 [doi]', '10.1002/ijc.1277 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Jun 15;92(6):784-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1277.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear whether or not the cell cycle effects of polyphenols are related to their cell death-inducing ability. Here we report that the tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) inhibits DNA replication in three leukemia cancer cell lines, Jurkat T, HL-60 and K562. Among all the tested tea polyphenols, EGC was found to be the most potent in accumulation of S phase cells and inhibition of the S-G2 progression. In addition, EGC-mediated inhibition of S phase progression results in induction of apoptosis, as determined by sub-G1 cell population, breakage of endonuclear DNA, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and loss of cell viability. When used in cells containing low S and high G1 and G2/M populations, EGC did not induce apoptosis. Furthermore, EGC did not inhibit M-G1 transition. Our finding that EGC inhibits S phase progression that results in leukemia cell death provides a novel and plausible molecular mechanism for how green tea may inhibit the growth of rapidly proliferating neoplastic cells.","['Smith, D M', 'Dou, Q P']","['Smith DM', 'Dou QP']","['Drug Discovery Program, H.

The ability of ara-C to kill neoplastic cells has been correlated to the induction of apoptosis. The clinical use of ara-C is limited by the development of drug resistance. Alterations in drug-induced apoptosis play a critical role in ara-C resistance. In particular, the proto-oncogene bcl-2 has been implicated in this phenomenon. To better understand the molecular basis of the role of bcl-2 in ara-C resistance, we investigated the relationship between the cytotoxic effect of ara-C, the expression levels and the subcellular localization of bcl-2 in three human leukemic cell lines (HL-60, KG1, J111). We have also evaluated the effects of ara-C on the J111 leukemic cell line (showing the lowest levels of Bcl-2 and the highest sensitivity to ara-C) overexpressing the bcl-2 oncogene. The model we developed here will allow further studies on the role of post-translational events involving bcl-2 (such as translocation and/or phosphorylation) in the cellular response to ara-C treatment.","['Gariboldi, M B', 'Ravizza, R', 'Marras, E', 'Perletti, G', 'De Simone, A', 'Piccinini, F', 'Monti, E']","['Gariboldi MB', 'Ravizza R', 'Marras E', 'Perletti G', 'De Simone A', 'Piccinini F', 'Monti E']","['Dipartimento di Biologia Strutturale e Funzionale, Section of Pharmacology, University of Insubria, I-20129 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2001/05/15 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/05/15 10:00'],"['2001/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.18.6.1245 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Jun;18(6):1245-9. doi: 10.3892/ijo.18.6.1245.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluated in vitro the anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity of six different dedimethylamino chemically modified tetracyclines (CMT-1, CMT-3, CMT-5, CMT-6, CMT-7 and CMT-8) in sensitive and multidrug resistant myeloid leukaemia cells (HL60 and HL60R) in vitro. Three of these compounds (CMT-5, CMT-6, CMT-7) showed low cytotoxic activity both in sensitive and in resistant cells, CMT-3 was endowed with a high anti-proliferative activity only in sensitive cells and was moderately effective as apoptosis inducing agent, with an activity similar to that shown by doxycycline. On the contrary, CMT-1 and CMT-8 were very effective as programmed cell death inducing agents. The apoptotic pathway activated by these compounds involved the activation of caspases, especially caspase-9 and, for CMT-1, also the activation of FAS: Interestingly CMT-8, but not CMT-1, was able to induce apoptosis in multidrug resistant HL60R and in Fas-ligand resistant HUT78B1 cell lines. These properties, together with others previously described (e.g. anti-metastatic and anti-osteolytic activities), suggest that CMT-8 may have important applications in the clinical management of cancer. The comparative analysis of structure-activity relationship of CMT-8 and doxycycline suggests that the C-5 hydroxy moiety may play an important role in conferring activity in multidrug resistant cells. These findings appear to support the hypothesis that CMT-8 may represent an interesting lead for the development of a new class of potent apoptosis inducer agents active in multidrug resistant and Fas-ligand resistant malignancies.","['Tolomeo, M', 'Grimaudo, S', 'Milano, S', 'La Rosa, M', 'Ferlazzo, V', 'Di Bella, G', 'Barbera, C', 'Simoni, D', ""D'Agostino, P"", 'Cillari, E']","['Tolomeo M', 'Grimaudo S', 'Milano S', 'La Rosa M', 'Ferlazzo V', 'Di Bella G', 'Barbera C', 'Simoni D', ""D'Agostino P"", 'Cillari E']","['Divisione di Ematologia e Servizio AIDS, Policlinico Universitario Paolo Giaccone, via del Vespro 129, 90127 Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Tetracyclines)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Tetracyclines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2001/05/15 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/05/15 10:00'],"['2001/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0704068 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2001 May;133(2):306-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0704068.,,,,,,,PMC1572778,,,,,['Br J Pharmacol 2002 Mar;135(6):1588'],,,,,,,,,

Comparative analyses of the nucleotide sequences of 589 bp of the gp21 env gene and of 625 bp of the long terminal repeat (LTR) showed that this new HTLV-2 strain (HTLV-2 GUY) was of subtype A. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that HTLV-2 GUY was closely related to a group of distinct variants of HTLV-2 subtype A strains originating mostly from Brazilian inhabitants and formerly called HTLV-2 subtype C. As there is a high level of immigration from Brazil in French Guiana, we carried out a seroepidemiological study of 175 Brazilians, mostly women (obtained from a serum databank) and 72 female Brazilian prostitutes living in French Guiana to determine whether HTLV-2 is likely to become an emerging infection in this area.

RESULTS: All flare-up cases occurred during the first 5 years of the present study, 27.4% of carriers showed ALT flare-up during this period, but none in the second half of the study. Multivariate analysis showed that C100-3 antibody (Ab) and anti-human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I Ab were two independent and significant predictors of ALT flare-up in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA asymptomatic carriers (P = 0.04, P = 0.03, respectively). Liver biopsy was performed in 44 patients (11 with flare-up of ALT level, whereas 33 had normal ALT levels). Histological features of chronic hepatitis with lymphoid infiltration in the portal tracts were commonly observed in all specimens, and no differences were noted between the flare-up ALT group and the persistently normal ALT group.

The treatment course consisted of 2-CdA given at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg/24 h in a 2-h intravenous infusion for 5 (CMC5) or 3 (CMC3) consecutive days, mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 on day 1 and cyclophosphamide 650 mg/m2/iv on day 1. Thirty-three patients (19 with B-CLL and 14 with LG-NHL) entered the study and all of them were eligible. Twenty patients (60.6%) were recurrent after prior therapy and 13 (39.4%) had refractory disease. All patients received 5 or more cycles of chemotherapy before CMC treatment. Twenty-one patients were treated with CMC5 regimen and 12 with CMC3 regimen. The overall response rate, including CR and PR, was 48.6% (95% CI 32-66). There were no differences in the frequency of responses between the CMC3 and CMC5 treated groups (p>0.05). One patient with B-CLL and three patients with lymphocytic lymphoma achieved CR (12.1%). Among 12 patients (36.4%) who achieved PR there were 6 CLL patients, and 6 lymphoma patients. The major toxicity was myelosuppression. Severe neutropenia was seen in 11/33 (33.3%) patients, more frequently in patients who received CMC5 than in the patients who received CMC3, both in the CLL (50.0% and 28.5%, respectively) and in the LG-NHL group (22.2% and 0%, respectively). The rate of thrombocytopenia was similar in both groups. Infections and fever of unknown origin complicated the treatment with CMC5 more often than with CMC3: five episodes were seen in 3 patients treated with CMC3 when compared to 15 episodes in 12 patients treated with CMC5. In conclusion, the CMC programme is an active combined regimen in heavily pre-treated CLL and LG-NHL patients. However, its toxicity is significant and we suggest a shortening of 2-CdA infusion from 5 to 3 d in further studies. Whether a combination of 2-CdA with cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone would result in improved outcome as compared to 2-CdA alone, is being investigated in a prospective, randomised trial.","['Robak, T', 'Gora-Tybor, J', 'Lech-Maranda, E', 'Blonski, J Z', 'Kasznicki, M']","['Robak T', 'Gora-Tybor J', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Blonski JZ', 'Kasznicki M']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, 93-513 Lodz, ul Pabianicka 62, Poland. robaktad@psk2.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'CMC protocol 2']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/05/15 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/15 10:00'],"['2001/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['ejh303 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00303.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Mar;66(3):188-94. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00303.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow cells with high and low CD13 surface expression that entered the stromal layers all down-regulated CD13 mRNA expression as compared to cells in suspension above. For peripheral blood cells within stromal layers, CD13 mRNA expression was diminished in only 3 out of 6 cases. The ambiguous effect of stromal cells on peripheral blood cells may illustrate a differentiation-dependent response towards stroma. We determined the polyadenylation status of CD13 mRNA for 9 bone marrow aspirates and 7 peripheral blood samples. Polyadenylation was diminished in bone marrow cells from AML patients with low levels of normalised CD13 mRNA, raising the possibility of involvement of mRNA instability in regulation of CD13 mRNA expression in this subgroup of patients.","['Dybkaer, K', 'Olesen, G', 'Pedersen, F S', 'Kristensen, J S']","['Dybkaer K', 'Olesen G', 'Pedersen FS', 'Kristensen JS']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'CD13 Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis/blood', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/biosynthesis/blood', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2001/05/15 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/15 10:00'],"['2001/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['ejh310 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00310.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Mar;66(3):168-77. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00310.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 59 patients of whom 40 were treated by the combination of Acla and Ara-C we found that leukaemia cell drug resistance towards Acla was higher (by a factor 2.80) in patients who failed to enter complete remission (CR) after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy as compared to patients who entered complete remission. The relationship was significant in univariate as well as multivariate analysis (p=0.02 and 0.03, respectively). By contrast, no in vitro single drug resistance values were consistently correlated to other parameters of clinical outcome (overall CR rate, overall survival (OS), or continuous complete remission (CCR)), whereas the combined Acla and Ara-C drug resistance profile (Acla/Ara-C DRP) was of prognostic significance to overall survival of all 85 patients (p=0.004) as well as to the CCR of 39 complete responders (p=0.04). These findings remained statistically significant in multivariate analyses correcting for other variables influencing clinical outcome including patient age, leukocyte count, karyotype, FAB-subtype, and presence/absence of secondary AML. We conclude that the in vitro drug resistance of leukaemia cells at time of disease presentation appears to be independent of prognostic significance to short- and long-term clinical outcome in AML.","['Norgaard, J M', 'Langkjer, S T', 'Palshof, T', 'Pedersen, B', 'Hokland, P']","['Norgaard JM', 'Langkjer ST', 'Palshof T', 'Pedersen B', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark. janmaxgard@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/05/15 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/15 10:00'],"['2001/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['ejh361 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00361.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Mar;66(3):160-7. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00361.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor effector cell proliferation and marginal antitumor activity limit attempts to use immunotherapy. We have characterized the ex vivo expansion, up to 1000-fold, of CD3+ CD56+ lymphocytes from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of healthy donors. Expanded cells termed cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells induce non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted lysis of tumor cells and demonstrate cytolytic activity superior to lymphokine-activated killer cells without the requirement of interleukin (IL)-2 treatment in vivo. To determine whether cytolytic cells could be expanded from patient material, we evaluated samples of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) from 25 patients undergoing autologous HCT. The PBPCs were expanded by priming with interferon-gamma followed by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and IL-2 the next day. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed on days 0, 15, 21, and 28 of cell culture. The median T-cell content rose from 15.3% (range, 1.1% to 89.7%) on day 0 to 97.2% (range, 83.6% to 99.5%) by day 15. By day 21, T cells expanded 21.8-fold (range, 1.7- to 420.0-fold) and CD3+ CD56+ cells expanded 44.8-fold (range, 5.1- to 747.0-fold). CIK cells were used as effector cells against B-cell lymphoma targets (OCI-Ly8) with a median of 24% (range, 3% to 67%) and 42% (range, 6% to 96%) specific lysis of target cells on days 21 and 28, respectively. CIK cells derived from PBL of 2 additional patients with acute myelogenous leukemia demonstrated 39% and 78% specific lysis of OCI-Ly8 and 26% and 58% specific lysis of autologous leukemic blasts at an effector:target ratio of 40:1.

In syngeneic transplants, enrichment for pools of selected Vbeta families (Vbeta7, -11, and -13) of T cells or for a single Vbeta family (Vbeta7) of CD4+ T cells conveyed a beneficial GVL response to the recipients. Furthermore, in the haploidentical allogeneic model, both Vbeta6,7-enriched donor B6 T cells and Vbeta7-enriched CD4+ T cells exhibited significant GVL responses with concomitant minimization of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) development compared with equal numbers of unfractionated T cells.

Previously, it has been shown that LIF appears to be involved in skin inflammation and can induce the expression of IL-8. We sought to determine whether expression of LIF is abnormal in lesional psoriatic skin and whether this correlates with the expression of IL-8. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we measured the expression of LIF and IL-8 mRNA in biopsies from normal individuals, non-lesional psoriatic skin, and lesional psoriatic skin. No difference was seen between the expression of IL-8 and LIF in normal and in non-lesional psoriatic skin. However, LIF expression in lesional skin was increased 160% compared with normal biopsies or non-lesional skin (p < 0.001). Immunostaining of frozen sections showed that the expression of LIF protein was principally suprabasal and, in the majority of sections, concentrated mainly in the stratum corneum of the lesional skin, whereas it was mainly in the stratum spinosum of the normal/non-lesional skin. IL-8 mRNA expression did not differ between the non-lesional and normal skin, but expression in the lesional skin was 17.6-fold greater than in normal skin (p < 0.001), and this expression was correlated with the increased LIF expression (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). Although a significant negative correlation was demonstrated between LIF mRNA expression and the duration of the last outbreak of the disease, no other correlations were found between levels of cytokine expression and a variety of parameters including PASI score. These data suggest a role for keratinocyte LIF in the psoriatic lesion and a link between LIF and IL-8 expression.","['Szepietowski, J', 'Walker, C', 'Hunter, J A', 'McKenzie, R C']","['Szepietowski J', 'Walker C', 'Hunter JA', 'McKenzie RC']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Medicine, Chalubinskiego 1, 50-368, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psoriasis/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/05/15 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/15 10:00'],"['2001/05/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1346-8138.2001.tb00104.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 2001 Mar;28(3):115-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1346-8138.2001.tb00104.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Serum samples from 40 patients with positive serum quantitative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels were used for leukemia inhibitory factor determination. The serum leukemia inhibitory factor concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the following 4 groups: (1) normal intrauterine pregnancies, (2) threatened abortions, (3) spontaneous abortions, and (4) ectopic pregnancies. RESULTS: All patients had detectable concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor in serum, ranging from 2.44 to 8.25 pg/mL. Mean leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations for ectopic pregnancy were significantly lower (P <.05) than those of both the spontaneous abortion and threatened abortion groups by 1-way analysis of variance. When a cutoff point of serum leukemia inhibitory factor <6.2 pg/mL is assigned as diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy, leukemia inhibitory factor in patients with ectopic pregnancies versus all other groups predicted ectopic pregnancy with a sensitivity of 73%, specificity of 72%, positive predictive value of 50%, and negative predictive value of 88%. CONCLUSION: Serum leukemia inhibitory factor concentration is lowest in patients with ectopic pregnancy. A cutoff point of 6.2 pg/mL maximizes the sensitivity and specificity of the test; however, it is not sufficiently discriminatory to be used clinically for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.","['Wegner, N T', 'Mershon, J L']","['Wegner NT', 'Mershon JL']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/blood', 'Abortion, Threatened/blood', 'Biomarkers', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*blood', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Ectopic/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2001/05/12 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/12 10:00'],"['2001/05/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9378(01)77366-8 [pii]', '10.1067/mob.2001.115224 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2001 May;184(6):1074-6. doi: 10.1067/mob.2001.115224.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported a homozygous mutation (R278H) in DNA ligase IV in a developmentally normal leukemia patient who overresponded to radiotherapy. The impact of this hypomorphic mutation has been evaluated using cellular, biochemical, and structural approaches. Structural modeling using T7 DNA ligase predicts that the activity and conformational stability of the protein is likely to be impaired. We show that wild type DNA ligase IV-Xrcc4 is an efficient double-stranded ligase with distinct optimal requirements for adenylate complex formation versus rejoining. The mutation impairs the formation of an adenylate complex as well as reducing the rejoining activity. Additionally, it imparts temperature-sensitive activity to the protein consistent with the predictions of the structural modeling. At the cellular level, the mutation confers a unique V(D)J recombination phenotype affecting the fidelity of signal joint formation with little effect on the frequency of the reaction. These findings suggest that hypomorphic mutations in ligase IV may allow normal development but confer marked radiosensitivity.","['Riballo, E', 'Doherty, A J', 'Dai, Y', 'Stiff, T', 'Oettinger, M A', 'Jeggo, P A', 'Kysela, B']","['Riballo E', 'Doherty AJ', 'Dai Y', 'Stiff T', 'Oettinger MA', 'Jeggo PA', 'Kysela B']","['Medical Research Council, Cell Mutation Unit, University of Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RR, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (LIG4 protein, human)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)']",IM,"['Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Ligase ATP', 'DNA Ligases/*chemistry/genetics', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Models, Structural', '*Mutation', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Temperature']",2001/05/12 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/05/12 10:00'],"['2001/05/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M103866200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)80264-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Aug 17;276(33):31124-32. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M103866200.

DESIGN: Two phase postal survey. SETTING: United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: A 10% random sample of midwives registered with the United Kingdom Central Council for nursing, midwifery, and health visiting. Of 3191 midwives in the sample, 2515 (79%) responded to phase one and 2294 (72%) completed questionnaires on their current jobs (November 1998 to May 1999). In phase two, 853 (62%) of 1383 eligible midwives gave details on 2179 of their earliest jobs (start dates before 1990). RESULTS: All the midwives in clinical practice at the time of the survey (2271, 99%) reported that they were working in areas with official policies on neonatal vitamin K. Seven distinct policies were described: intramuscular vitamin K for all babies (1159, 51.0%); intramuscular vitamin K for babies at ""high risk,"" oral for others (470, 20.7%); oral vitamin K for all babies (323, 14.2%); parental choice for all (124, 5.5%); parental choice for all except babies at high risk, (119, 5.2%); intramuscular vitamin K for babies at high risk only (33, 1.5%); oral vitamin K for babies at high risk only (17, 0.7%); and a disparate group of policies including intravenous vitamin K for some babies (26, 1.1%). Previous policies were (and some may still be) open to individual interpretation and were not always followed. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital policy is not necessarily a good guide to individual practice. The primary purpose of clinical records is to document patient care, and recording practices reflect this. There is considerable variation in vitamin K policies and midwifery practice in the United Kingdom, and there is no clear consensus on which babies should receive vitamin K intramuscularly.","['Ansell, P', 'Roman, E', 'Fear, N T', 'Renfrew, M J']","['Ansell P', 'Roman E', 'Fear NT', 'Renfrew MJ']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Epidemiology, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9LN. p.e.ansell@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,['12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', '*Clinical Protocols', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Medical Records', 'Midwifery/*methods', 'Patient Selection', 'Postnatal Care/*methods', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United Kingdom', 'Vitamin K/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding/*prevention & control']",2001/05/12 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/12 10:00'],"['2001/05/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.322.7295.1148 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 2001 May 12;322(7295):1148-52. doi: 10.1136/bmj.322.7295.1148.,,['BMJ. 2001 Nov 3;323(7320):1068.

Elevation of intracellular calcium under these conditions caused an enhancement of BLV gp51 and p24 synthesis as well as an activation of the BLV long terminal repeat (LTR) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that elevated levels of intracellular calcium following A23187 stimulation lead to activation of NF-kappaB.

Since the incorporation of trans retinoic acid, event free survival of M3 acute myeloid leukemia is 80%. AIM: To report the results of acute myeloid leukemia treatment at the Hospital del Salvador, between 1990 and 1998. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 117 patients (66 female, mean age 48.2 years), treated between 1990 and 1998 using PANDA protocol, were retrospectively reviewed. Immunophenotyping was done in 69 patients and cytogenetic studies were done in 65. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of patients had M3 acute myeloid leukemia. The most frequent phenotype was the association of DR, CD34 plus a panmyeloid marker. DR and CD34 were negative in seven of nine patients with M3 acute myeloid leukemia. Cariotype was abnormal in 78% of patients. Complete remission was achieved in 65% of cases with a 13% of failures. Early mortality was 21.3% and decreased to 6.1% in the last three years. Infections and coagulation disorders were the main causes of death. Mean survival was 10.5 months. Five years event free survival was 11%. In M3 acute myeloid leukemia, the figure is 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment results are less effective than protocols that consider more aggressive chemotherapeutic protocols or bone marrow transplantation. The reduction in early mortality is due to a better management of febrile neutropenia.","['Puga, B L', 'Cabrera, M E', 'Undurraga, M S', 'Etcheverry, R', 'Vacarezza, R', 'Ducach, G', 'Toledo, H']","['Puga BL', 'Cabrera ME', 'Undurraga MS', 'Etcheverry R', 'Vacarezza R', 'Ducach G', 'Toledo H']","['Hospital del Salvador, Servicio de Medicina, Seccion de Hematologia, Departamento de Medicina Oriente, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile. bpuga@surfree.cl']",['spa'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/05/12 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/12 10:00'],"['2001/05/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 2000 Nov;128(11):1191-8.,,,,,Leucemia mieloide aguda del adulto.

It is associated with atypical morphology of lymphocytes, progressing disease and poor survival. A high incidence abnormality in the B-cell CLL is deletion of chromosome 13 (13q14) detected by using modern diagnostic methods such as southern blot hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization. It occurs in 51% of the CLL patients and in as much as 70% in mantle-cell lymphoma. The deletion of 13q14.3 affects a locus telomeric to the RB1 gene (retinoblastoma gene) and the marker D13S25 which bear relation to a candidate tumour suppressor gene. Also common are the chromosome 14 abnormalities which are expressed as the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) and which correlate with a high leukocytes count, adverse response to cytostatic therapy and increased risk of prolymphocytic proliferation. The oncogene BCL-1 is activated in this translocation. Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 18 (18q21)(q32;q13.1) activate the BCL-2 oncogene, while the translocation t(14;19)(q32;q13.1) activates the BCL-3 oncogene. Essential role in the pathogenesis of CLL is played by the aberrations in chromosome 17 and the p53 mutations (17p13.1). The gene p53 is defined as a tumour suppressor gene; mutations of this gene leads to a CLL characterized with rapid progression, aggressive course, poor prognosis and low survival. The deletions in chromosome 7 are associated with the multidrug resistance gene which causes resistance to doxorubicin, vinblastine and colchicine. All these abnormalities are characteristic of the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In the T-cell leukemia characteristic deletions are 11q22-q23, a.14q23.1, as well as the inversion inv(14)(11q32) and some rarer aberrations.","['Karnolsky, I N']",['Karnolsky IN'],"['Higher Medical Institute, Clinic of Haematology, 15A Vassil Aprilov St., 4000 Plovdiv, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Bulgaria,Folia Med (Plovdiv),Folia medica,2984761R,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology']",2001/05/12 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/12 10:00'],"['2001/05/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Med (Plovdiv). 2000;42(3):5-10.,,,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides the AML1, TEL is often fused to genes, which encod thyrosin-kinases. AML1 gene is a part of CBF transcription factor. AML1 can be altered in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and also in a substantial number of acute myeloid leukaemias (most frequently as an AML1/ETO fusion). TEL/AML1 fusion gene (derived from t(12;21)(p13;q22) translocation) became recently one of the most important genetic aberrations in children with ALL. TEL/AML1 act presumably as dominant inhibitors of the second AML1 allele and thus they block transcription of genes dependent on CBF factor. Childhood ALL with TEL/AML1 hybrid gene is very frequent (approximately 22% of overall childhood ALL in the Czech Republic) and patients with this fusion form relatively homogenous group. These children are diagnosed mostly in pre-school age as a B cell precursor leukaemias and they have very good treatment results.","['Zuna, J']",['Zuna J'],"['II. detska klinika 2.

The aim of this cross-sectional, nationwide study was to comprehensively assess long-term toxicity in ALL survivors, with special attention given to neuropsychological morbidity, and to look for possible differences in cognitive outcome between children having received prophylactic cranial irradiation and those not having received it. Between 1994 and 1996, long-term survivors of ALL were assessed in a multi-center setting according to a standardized protocol which included, besides usual clinical and laboratory investigations, a comprehensive endocrine work-up. Additionally, children having received anthracyclines were checked for possible late cardio-toxicity with echocardiography and ECG. Intellectual performance was evaluated with standardized neuropsychological tests (age-adapted versions of the Wechsler test). One-hundred and fifty patients were eligible for the study. The median age at diagnosis was 5 years and at evaluation 16 years, for a median follow-up of 10 years. Thirty-five patients had cranial irradiation as part of the prophylactic CNS treatment. One-hundred and forty (93%) of the 150 eligible patients were completely evaluated in terms of global long-term toxicity: 117 (83%) long-term survivors had no (n = 61) or only minimal (n = 56) late toxicity; 19 (14%) suffered from moderate impairments; 4 (3%) showed severe somatic or neuropsychological sequelae. Intellectual performance could be assessed in 147 (98%) of the 150 eligible patients. The mean global, verbal and non-verbal IQs (103, 105 and 101 respectively) of the ALL survivors as a group were comparable with those found in the general population. The results of the comparison between children having and those not having received prophylactic cranial irradiation showed: 1) significantly higher scores in chemotherapy-only treated patients, both for the global and the verbal performances; 2) significantly poorer results in specific items of the Wechsler test (short-term verbal memory, arithmetics, concentration/speed of processing) in irradiated children. These findings which show the deleterious role of cranial irradiation correlate well with many other reports found in the literature. However, they could have been influenced by the significantly longer time interval observed between therapy and evaluation in our irradiated patients. Prospective studies are needed to further characterize the potential neuropsychological hazards of chemotherapy and their evolution over time.","['von der Weid, N']",['von der Weid N'],"['Swiss Pediatric Oncology Group (SPOG), Medizinische Universitats-Kinderklinik, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland. nvdweid@insel.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Survivors']",2001/05/11 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/05/11 10:00'],"['2001/05/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['2001/13/smw-09671 [doi]'],ppublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2001 Apr 7;131(13-14):180-7. doi: 2001/13/smw-09671.,,,,,,,,['Swiss Pediatric Oncology Group (SPOG)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chest X-ray and computed tomography examinations demonstrated interstitial pneumonia. Cultures of gastric juice and bone marrow yielded colonies of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and a diagnosis of disseminated atypical mycobacteriosis was made.

We used 2 experimental protocols: the inoculation with irradiated M-CSF-producing L1210 cells (EM5) before the challenge with parental cells and after the challenge with parental cells. Both protocols effectively improved the survival rate of mice compared with protocols in which irradiated non-M-CSF-producing L1210 cells (EM-mock) were inoculated. Inoculation with 1 x 10(2) irradiated EM5 cells was sufficient to prolong the survival time of mice subsequently challenged with 1 x 10(4) parental cells. In vivo depletion experiments with administration of antibodies suggested the involvement of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells in the antitumor effect. Consistent with these findings, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity of splenocytes from EM5-inoculated mice was higher than that from EM-mock-inoculated mice, and L1210 tumors were heavily infiltrated by CD4+ T cells and NK cells as well as macrophages in EM5-inoculated mice.","['Suzu, S', 'Kimura, F', 'Tanaka-Douzono, M', 'Yamada, M', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Wakimoto, N', 'Sato, K', 'Morita, T', 'Ikeda, K', 'Motoyoshi, K']","['Suzu S', 'Kimura F', 'Tanaka-Douzono M', 'Yamada M', 'Nakamura Y', 'Wakimoto N', 'Sato K', 'Morita T', 'Ikeda K', 'Motoyoshi K']","['Biochemical Research Laboratory, Morinaga Milk Industry, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Graft Rejection', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/physiology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/radiation effects/*transplantation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Vaccination']",2001/05/10 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/05/10 10:00'],"['2001/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02981965 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Apr;73(3):378-82. doi: 10.1007/BF02981965.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As leukemic cells they described those which produced intense cytoplasmic and membrane positivity with antibody DBA.44 and corresponded morphologically to hairy cells. For evaluation computer analysis of the picture LUCIA-M was used. The infiltration grade was examined on three areas of standard size (3 x 65,265 micron 2) and expressed in percent. A total of 45 trepanobioptic specimens from 21 patients were examined who achieved after treatment with 2-CdA complete remission.

To identify the impact of different cumulative doses, even within a non-high dose range, and the echocardiographic parameters suitable for evaluating cardiac function, we studied diastolic and systolic echocardiographic parameters in a cohort of patients followed in a single center. PROCEDURE: A total of 117 subjects were studied at a median time of 7 years after treatment completion. A complete M-mode, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic study was obtained at rest in all patients according to the standard recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients (85%) had completely normal cardiac function, while 18 had abnormal echocardiographic findings: 12 had one abnormal value, 5 had two, and 1 had three abnormal values. All the changes were in left ventricular dimensions, wall thickness or indices of systolic function; no alterations in left ventricular diastolic function parameters were found. None of the echocardiographic parameters correlated significantly with the cumulative dose of anthracyclines administered either at univariate analysis or after adjusting for sex, body surface area or considered risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects exposed to a median cumulative dose of 214 mg/m(2) had no echographic abnormalities a median of 7 years later. We did not find any correlation between cumulative anthracycline dose and the echocardiographic parameters tested. We now offer echocardiographic follow-up to patients with mildly reduced fractional shortening and/or ejection fraction to rule out late onset dysfunction.","['Bossi, G', 'Lanzarini, L', 'Laudisa, M L', 'Klersy, C', 'Raisaro, A', 'Arico, M']","['Bossi G', 'Lanzarini L', 'Laudisa ML', 'Klersy C', 'Raisaro A', 'Arico M']","['Department of Pediatrics, IRCCS Policlinico, S.

FcepsilonRIbeta amplifies signaling of FcepsilonRI so that regulation of FcepsilonRIalpha:beta stoichiometry would affect cellular responsiveness. OBJECTIVE: We examined basophils from a variety of donors for differences in their expression of FcepsilonRIalpha and FcepsilonRIbeta protein. METHODS: Enriched blood basophils were assessed at baseline and after IL-3 culture for FcepsilonRIalpha and FcepsilonRIbeta protein by Western blotting, surface FcepsilonRIalpha by flow cytometry, and FcepsilonRIbeta mRNA by real-time PCR. Basophil functional response was measured by allergen-triggered histamine release. RESULTS: For the FcepsilonRIalpha subunit, 2 protein bands with molecular weights of 50 kd and 60 kd were identified by Western blots. The 60-kd band correlated to surface-expressed FcepsilonRIalpha detected by flow cytometry (Spearman R = 0.78, P <.01). Surface FcepsilonRIalpha also correlated with FcepsilonRIbeta protein (Spearman R = 0.92, P <.01). FcepsilonRIbeta protein levels increased disproportionately with higher surface FcepsilonRIalpha expression. The ratio of FcepsilonRIbeta to FcepsilonRIalpha varied 10-fold among donors and correlated with surface FcepsilonRIalpha. Basophil 50-kd alpha protein levels were similar despite a 10-fold range in surface FcepsilonRIalpha expression, implying stores of this protein such as those found in eosinophils. Unlike eosinophils, the basophil 50-kd protein was lost with culture and was absent from supernatants. Levels of beta protein and mRNA were enhanced by IL-3 culture, whereas FcepsilonRIalpha expression (by flow cytometry and 60 kd) was not. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate variable stoichiometry of FcepsilonRIalpha:beta in whole cells and that this stoichiometry can be altered by IL-3 culture. With the assumption that all detected beta protein is surface expressed, these findings suggest a variable stoichiometry for FcepsilonRIalpha:beta that is also related to FcepsilonRIalpha surface expression.","['Saini, S S', 'Richardson, J J', 'Wofsy, C', 'Lavens-Phillips, S', 'Bochner, B S', 'Macglashan, D W Jr']","['Saini SS', 'Richardson JJ', 'Wofsy C', 'Lavens-Phillips S', 'Bochner BS', 'Macglashan DW Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Subunits', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*blood/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/10 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/05/10 10:00'],"['2001/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S009167490186365X [pii]', '10.1067/mai.2001.114653 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2001 May;107(5):832-41. doi: 10.1067/mai.2001.114653.,"['AI01564/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI42220/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitochondrial DNA has been proposed to be involved in carcinogenesis because of high susceptibility to mutations and limited repair mechanisms in comparison to nuclear DNA. Since mtDNA lacks introns, it has been suggested that most mutations will occur in coding sequences and subsequent accumulation of mutations may lead to tumor formation. The mitochondrial genome is dependent upon the nuclear genome for transcription, translation, replication and repair, but precise mechanisms for how the two genomes interact and integrate with each other are poorly understood. In solid tumors, elevated expression of mtDNA-encoded subunits of the mitochondrial electron respiratory chain may reflect mitochondrial adaptation to perturbations in cellular energy requirements. In this paper, we review mitochondrial genomic aberrations reported in solid tumors of the breast, colon, stomach, liver, kidney, bladder, head/neck and lung as well as for hematologic diseases such as leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and lymphoma. We include data for elevated expression of mtDNA-encoded electron respiratory chain subunits in breast, colon and liver cancers and also the mutations reported in cancers of the colon, stomach, bladder, head/neck and lung. Finally, we examine the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by mitochondria in the process of carcinogenesis.","['Penta, J S', 'Johnson, F M', 'Wachsman, J T', 'Copeland, W C']","['Penta JS', 'Johnson FM', 'Wachsman JT', 'Copeland WC']","['Office of Clinical Research, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, P.O.

The aim of this study was to apply comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to cases of AML or MDS in transformation submitted for routine cytogenetic analysis to investigate whether this approach would yield any further information and, if possible, to predict which cases would benefit from CGH analysis. Nineteen cases with AML or MDS in transformation were analyzed. CGH revealed nine cases with gains or losses of chromosomal material. In six of these cases the chromosomal location of this material was not apparent from cytogenetic analysis especially when multiple markers were present. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with specific libraries for the chromosome regions that showed discordance between CGH and conventional cytogenetics, we were able to identify the chromosome location of material within the karyotype. In this group of six patients, four cases of an unbalanced translocation involving regions of chromosomes 5 and 17 were characterized. Three of these cases had additional abnormalities, including two cases with regions of amplification in which oncogenes are located (MYC, MLL) and one case with a dic(7;21)(p10;p10). In all six cases it was possible to characterize complex chromosomal aberrations such as derivative chromosomes, marker chromosomes, and ring chromosomes. This study demonstrates that CGH can detect true gain and loss of critical chromosome regions more accurately than conventional karyotyping in cases with very complex karyotypes, and can thus prove useful in predicting prognosis and pinpointing areas of the genome that require further study. Also, CGH can be a useful technique to identify the origin of marker chromosomes, and it can assist in choice of probes for confirmatory FISH, when there is no clue provided from the analysis of G-banded chromosomes.","['Kim, M H', 'Stewart, J', 'Devlin, C', 'Kim, Y T', 'Boyd, E', 'Connor, M']","['Kim MH', 'Stewart J', 'Devlin C', 'Kim YT', 'Boyd E', 'Connor M']","['Institute of Medical Genetics, Yorkhill Hospital Campus, G3 8SJ, Yorkhill, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods']",2001/05/10 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/10 10:00'],"['2001/05/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(00)00386-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00386-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Apr 1;126(1):26-33. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00386-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primitive neural stem cells have distinct growth factor requirements, express neural precursor markers, generate neurons and glia in vitro, and have neural and non-neural lineage potential in vivo.

Sixty-nine ALL cases (median age: 68 years) were diagnosed between 1980 and 1998 (18% of all adult ALL seen during this period). Ten of them (14%) had a past history of previous malignancy. Karyotypic analysis was performed successfully in 42 cases. Ten patients were diagnosed as Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph(+)) ALL. Immunophenotyping was performed in 63 cases. Fifty-six patients had B-cell lineage ALL. T lymphoid markers were observed only in 5 cases. Co-expression of myeloid markers was observed in 19% of tested cases. Five patients died before any chemotherapy could be given. All other patients received ""curative"" treatment according to different protocols used during the period of study. Overall complete remission (CR) rate of these patients was 62% (95% confidence interval (CI): 50-74%). Thirty-nine patients achieved CR after one course of chemotherapy and 4 patients after salvage therapy.

In multivariate analysis, the presence of hemorrhage (P = 0.02) was a poor prognostic for CR achievement. Higher WHO performance status (P = 0.003) and the presence of hemorrhage (P = 0.01) at diagnosis were poor prognostics for overall survival. When patients were stratified into three groups according to the time of admission, survival appeared significantly longer for patients admitted between July 1992 and December 1998 (median overall survival at 10 months) than for patients admitted before July 1992 (P = 0.04). ""Age-adapted"" therapy appeared superior to ""young adult-like"" therapy in terms of CR rate (96% versus 60%; P = 0.007). However, ""age-adapted"" therapy did not show any advantage in terms of DFS or overall survival, making the difference in CR rates questionable.

The geographic boundaries of the 259 census tracts in the study area were adjusted according to population at risk so as to make population density everywhere constant; then the 401 case locations were plotted on the density equalized map. If risk is everywhere equal, the resulting distribution of cases should be uniform except for statistical variation. The metric used was a measure of the variability of the density of cases on the density equalized map. The same metric was calculated for independent samples of artificial cases, generated under the null hypothesis of equal risk. The slight geographic non-uniformity observed among the real cases is well within the limits of variation observed in the samples of artificial cases.

Because the details about how the data was examined can greatly impact the conclusions, the epidemiologist then wants to know more information, such as 'over what time period' and 'how many other cancer types were examined'. For example, city A might have calculated cancer rates for many age groups within different regions of the city over many time intervals, but reported only the highest cancer rate discovered in a particular group. We will refer to such selective reporting as 'maximally selecting measures of evidence of disease clustering', or less formally as 'fishing for statistical significance'. The objective of this paper is to study the behaviour of maximally selected statistics for measuring the extent of clustering in disease outbreaks. The original data is the time and location of each reported case of the disease.

The lower respiratory tract is a frequently targeted site, but similar changes have not been described adequately in the sinonasal tract. Unfamiliarity with these changes could potentially cause confusion with an infectious or neoplastic process. All biopsies of the sinonasal tract at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were reviewed prospectively over a 54-month period. Eleven cases with bizarre atypia of the respiratory epithelium formed the basis of this study. The medical records of these patients were reviewed. The specimens were from 11 patients who had previously undergone chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation for acute myelocytic leukemia (n = 5), multiple myeloma (n = 3), acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 2), and chronic myelocytic leukemia (n = 1). Although the chemotherapy regimens were highly variable, all included one or more of the alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, n = 11; busulfan, n = 5; melphalan, n = 1). In all 11 patients, biopsies were acquired to rule out invasive fungal sinusitis. The atypical epithelial changes included striking nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, and pleomorphism. Sometimes these changes were full thickness and were associated with squamous metaplasia. Two of eight cases evaluated by frozen section were misinterpreted initially as high-grade epithelial dysplasia. Certain chemotherapeutic agents can induce striking epithelial atypia in the sinonasal tract. These changes should not be interpreted as neoplastic in nature, a potential pitfall in the frozen section evaluation of a destructive nasal process in oncology patients.","['Westra, W H', 'Holmes, G F', 'Eisele, D W']","['Westra WH', 'Holmes GF', 'Eisele DW']","['Departments of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21231-2410, USA. wwestra@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/adverse effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Epithelium/chemistry/*drug effects/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Male', 'Melphalan/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Paranasal Sinuses/chemistry/*drug effects/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sinusitis/*drug therapy/pathology']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-200105000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2001 May;25(5):652-6. doi: 10.1097/00000478-200105000-00013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular cloning of the C3aR has facilitated studies to identify nonpeptide antagonists of the C3aR. A chemical lead that selectively inhibited the C3aR in a high throughput screen was identified and chemically optimized. The resulting antagonist, N(2)-[(2,2-diphenylethoxy)acetyl]-L-arginine (SB 290157), functioned as a competitive antagonist of (125)I-C3a radioligand binding to rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells expressing the human C3aR (RBL-C3aR), with an IC(50) of 200 nM. SB 290157 was a functional antagonist, blocking C3a-induced C3aR internalization in a concentration-dependent manner and C3a-induced Ca(2+) mobilization in RBL-C3aR cells and human neutrophils with IC(50)s of 27.7 and 28 nM, respectively. SB 290157 was selective for the C3aR in that it did not antagonize the C5aR or six other chemotactic G protein-coupled receptors. Functional antagonism was not solely limited to the human C3aR; SB 290157 also inhibited C3a-induced Ca(2+) mobilization of RBL-2H3 cells expressing the mouse and guinea pig C3aRS: It potently inhibited C3a-mediated ATP release from guinea pig platelets and inhibited C3a-induced potentiation of the contractile response to field stimulation of perfused rat caudal artery. Furthermore, in animal models, SB 290157, inhibited neutrophil recruitment in a guinea pig LPS-induced airway neutrophilia model and decreased paw edema in a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model. This selective antagonist may be useful to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the C3aR.","['Ames, R S', 'Lee, D', 'Foley, J J', 'Jurewicz, A J', 'Tornetta, M A', 'Bautsch, W', 'Settmacher, B', 'Klos, A', 'Erhard, K F', 'Cousins, R D', 'Sulpizio, A C', 'Hieble, J P', 'McCafferty, G', 'Ward, K W', 'Adams, J L', 'Bondinell, W E', 'Underwood, D C', 'Osborn, R R', 'Badger, A M', 'Sarau, H M']","['Ames RS', 'Lee D', 'Foley JJ', 'Jurewicz AJ', 'Tornetta MA', 'Bautsch W', 'Settmacher B', 'Klos A', 'Erhard KF', 'Cousins RD', 'Sulpizio AC', 'Hieble JP', 'McCafferty G', 'Ward KW', 'Adams JL', 'Bondinell WE', 'Underwood DC', 'Osborn RR', 'Badger AM', 'Sarau HM']","['Department of Molecular Biology, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA 19406-0939, USA. bob_ames-1@sbphrd.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Complement Inactivator Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (SB 290157)', '0 (complement C3a receptor)', '80295-42-7 (Complement C3a)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Arginine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Arthritis, Experimental/immunology/pathology', 'Benzhydryl Compounds/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Complement C3a/*metabolism', 'Complement Inactivator Proteins/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Edema/pathology/prevention & control', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Hindlimb', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukocytosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects', 'Neutrophil Infiltration/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Complement/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.166.10.6341 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 May 15;166(10):6341-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.10.6341.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of MAIDS requires CD4(+) T cells and MHC class II expression by the infected host, supporting a role for T-B interaction in disease development or progression. To explore this possibility, we examined development of MAIDS in mice deficient in CD4 (CD4 knockout), in which T-B interactions are compromised. We find that in CD4 knockout hosts, BM5 causes T cell immunodeficiency in the remaining T cells but has only a limited ability to induce B cell phenotypic changes, hyperproliferation, hypergammaglobulinemia, or splenomegaly. There is also delayed death of infected mice. This implies that CD4 dependent T-B interaction is needed to induce the B cell aspects of disease and supports a multistep mechanism of disease in which B cell changes follow and are caused by CD4(+) T cell effects.","['Harris, D P', 'Koch, S', 'Mullen, L M', 'Swain, S L']","['Harris DP', 'Koch S', 'Mullen LM', 'Swain SL']","['The Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY 12983, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['0 (CD4 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*pathology', 'CD4 Antigens/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clonal Anergy/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/genetics/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology/mortality/virology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*genetics/immunology/mortality/virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/genetics/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.166.10.6041 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 May 15;166(10):6041-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.10.6041.,['CA56290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, this study reports on a novel pharmacologic activity of the compound, ie, enhancement of the cyto-differentiating, growth-inhibitory, and apoptogenic actions of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Whereas STI571 is not a cytodifferentiating agent by itself, the compound interacts with ATRA and enhances the myeloid maturation program set in motion by the retinoid in the PML-RARalpha(+) acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 and the PML-RARalpha(-) myeloblastic HL60 and U937 cell lines. In addition, STI571 relieves the cyto-differentiation block observed in the ATRA-resistant cell lines, NB4.R1, NB4.306, and NB4.007. In NB4 promyelocytes, a RARalpha agonist, but not an RXR agonist, can substitute for ATRA and interact with STI571. By contrast, STI571 is unique among c-Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors in modulating the pharmacologic activity of ATRA. In NB4 cells, enhanced cyto-differentiation results in increased up-regulation of the expression of a number of genes coding for myeloid differentiation markers, including CD11b, CD11c, and some of the components of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase enzymatic complex. All this is accompanied by inhibition of c-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation and retardation of the retinoid-dependent degradation of PML-RARalpha and RARalpha. Stabilization of the 2 retinoic acid receptors is likely to be the result of augmented and accelerated inhibition of the proteasome-dependent proteolytic activity observed on ATRA treatment.","[""Gianni', M"", 'Kalac, Y', 'Ponzanelli, I', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Terao, M', 'Garattini, E']","[""Gianni' M"", 'Kalac Y', 'Ponzanelli I', 'Rambaldi A', 'Terao M', 'Garattini E']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.10.3234 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55648-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 15;97(10):3234-43. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.10.3234.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several laboratories have identified promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies do not provide a global assessment of overall methylation changes and do not allow the identification of novel methylated sequences. Previously, nonrandom CpG island methylation was reported in 17 adult de novo AML diagnostic samples when compared with the corresponding remission samples by means of restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS). That study has been expanded on by an analysis of a larger set of CpG islands (1740 vs 1184), which now provides details of 33 cloned methylated loci, including 21 known genes or expressed sequence tags. Five of these cloned loci appear to be methylated only in AML and not in the 6 solid tumors studied in this study (more than 98 samples analyzed). Chromosomal location was available for 30 of the 33 loci, and 5 of these 30 (17%) are localized to chromosome 11, suggesting a trend toward overrepresentation of methylation events on this chromosome.

Cells recovered from mouse bone marrow or spleen resembled the original leukemia cells from patients with respect to surface lineage markers and T-cell receptor Vbeta gene rearrangements. Moreover, the pattern of leukemia dissemination in mouse tissues, resulting in universally fatal leukemia, is reminiscent of the human clinical disease. In addition, the fidelity of the model to the human disease is documented with regard to the presence of morphologically identifiable human leukemia cells in mouse bone marrow and blood and the maintenance of leukemia-initiating capacity within the leukemia-engrafted mouse. Therefore, several lines of independent approaches are used to suggest that the engrafted cells are of human leukemia origin and are not derived from cord blood.

The analysis of malignant cells from 7 patients shows that in all cases, like pDCs, leukemic cells are negative for lineage markers CD3, CD19, CD13, CD33, and CD11c but express high levels of interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain (IL-3Ralpha), HLA-DR, and CD45RA. Tumor cells produce interferon-alpha in response to influenza virus, while upon maturation with IL-3 they become a powerful inducer of naive CD4(+) T-cell proliferation and promote their T-helper 2 polarization. As pDCs, leukemic cells also express pre-Talpha and lambda-like 14.1 transcripts, arguing in favor of a lymphoid origin. In addition, malignant cells express significant levels of CD56 and granzyme B. Overall, those observations suggest that CD4(+)CD56(+) leukemic cells could represent the malignant counterpart of pDCs, both of which are closely related to B, T, and NK cells.","['Chaperot, L', 'Bendriss, N', 'Manches, O', 'Gressin, R', 'Maynadie, M', 'Trimoreau, F', 'Orfeuvre, H', 'Corront, B', 'Feuillard, J', 'Sotto, J J', 'Bensa, J C', 'Briere, F', 'Plumas, J', 'Jacob, M C']","['Chaperot L', 'Bendriss N', 'Manches O', 'Gressin R', 'Maynadie M', 'Trimoreau F', 'Orfeuvre H', 'Corront B', 'Feuillard J', 'Sotto JJ', 'Bensa JC', 'Briere F', 'Plumas J', 'Jacob MC']","['Department of Research and Development, Research Group on Lymphoma, EFS Rhone-Alpes Grenoble, La Tronche, France. laurence.chaperot@efs.sante.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD40 Antigens/genetics/physiology', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granzymes', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/analysis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.10.3210 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55645-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 15;97(10):3210-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.10.3210.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a phase II study of Mylotarg (CMA-676, gemtuzumab ozogamicin), which consists of a CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, saturation and internalization by leukemic and normal myeloid cells were analyzed in 122 patients with relapsed AML. Peripheral blood samples were obtained just before and 3 and 6 hours after the start of the first and second Mylotarg treatment cycles. Within 3 to 6 hours after infusion, near complete saturation of CD33 antigenic sites by Mylotarg was reached for AML blasts, monocytes, and granulocytes, whereas Mylotarg did not bind to lymphocytes. Saturation levels prior to the start of the second Mylotarg treatment cycle were significantly increased compared with background levels before the start of the first cycle. This apparently was caused by remaining circulating Mylotarg from the first treatment cycle (approximately 2 weeks earlier). On binding of Mylotarg to the CD33 antigen, Mylotarg was rapidly internalized, as determined by the decrease in maximal surface membrane Mylotarg binding. Internalization of Mylotarg was also demonstrated in myeloid cells in vitro and was confirmed by confocal laser microscopy. In vitro studies using pulse labeling with Mylotarg showed a continuous renewed membrane expression of CD33 antigens, which can significantly increase the internalization process and thereby the intracellular accumulation of the drug. Finally, Mylotarg induced dose-dependent apoptosis in myeloid cells in vitro. These data indicate that Mylotarg is rapidly and specifically targeted to CD33(+) cells, followed by internalization and subsequent induction of cell death.","['van Der Velden, V H', 'te Marvelde, J G', 'Hoogeveen, P G', 'Bernstein, I D', 'Houtsmuller, A B', 'Berger, M S', 'van Dongen, J J']","['van Der Velden VH', 'te Marvelde JG', 'Hoogeveen PG', 'Bernstein ID', 'Houtsmuller AB', 'Berger MS', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam and University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands. vandongen@immu.fgg.eur.nl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.10.3197 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55643-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 15;97(10):3197-204. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.10.3197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanisms of such infections remain unknown. To clarify the mechanism of immunodeficiency in those infected with HTLV-I, this study analyzed the T-cell subsets in HTLV-I carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and ATL using 3-color fluorescence with CD62L and CD45RA coexpression either with CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells. The number of naive T lymphocytes was markedly suppressed in patients with ATL, particularly in those with acute form, compared with uninfected control individuals. The number of naive T cells was low in HTLV-I-infected individuals under 50 years old compared with uninfected individuals, whereas the number of memory T lymphocytes was greater in HTLV-I-infected individuals. Although the increase of memory T lymphocytes correlated with HTLV-I provirus loads, no relationship was found between naive T-cell counts and provirus loads. T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs), which are generated by DNA recombination during early T lymphopoiesis, were quantified to evaluate thymic function in HTLV-I-infected individuals. TREC levels were lower in HTLV-I-infected individuals than in uninfected individuals. In HTLV-I carriers less than 70 years old, an increase of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed in 6 of 16 (38%) examined, whereas it was detectable in only 1 of 11 uninfected controls. These results suggested that the low number of naive T lymphocytes was due to suppressed production of T lymphocytes in the thymus, which might account for immunodeficiency observed in HTLV-I-infected individuals.","['Yasunaga Ji', 'Sakai, T', 'Nosaka, K', 'Etoh Ki', 'Tamiya, S', 'Koga, S', 'Mita, S', 'Uchino, M', 'Mitsuya, H', 'Matsuoka, M']","['Yasunaga Ji', 'Sakai T', 'Nosaka K', 'Etoh Ki', 'Tamiya S', 'Koga S', 'Mita S', 'Uchino M', 'Mitsuya H', 'Matsuoka M']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-7)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Carrier State', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*immunology/virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Viral Load']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.10.3177 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55640-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 15;97(10):3177-83. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.10.3177.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an alternative approach, this study analyzed the costimulatory capacity of a human B7-1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) fusion protein targeted to the cell membrane of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a low constitutive expression of B7-1 on human AML blasts (on average, 3.0 +/- 4.3%; n = 50). In contrast, the expression of B7-2 (CD86) was highly heterogeneous and higher in AML blasts of French-American-British classification types M4 and M5 (P <.0001). The B7-1 IgG fusion protein used in this study efficiently costimulated the proliferation of resting and preactivated T cells when immobilized on plastic. After preincubation with B7-1 IgG, specific binding of the fusion protein to the high-affinity Fcgammareceptor I (CD64) on leukemic cells was demonstrated and was found to increase the proliferation of both allogeneic and autologous T cells in costimulation experiments. Furthermore, targeting of B7-1 IgG to the tumor membrane resulted in increased proliferation of autologous remission T cells and had the potential to generate an enhanced redirected cytotoxic T-cell response against autologous AML blasts. In summary, the targeting of B7-1 IgG fusion protein described in this study represents a strategy alternative to gene therapy to restore the expression of the costimulatory molecule B7-1 on human AML blasts, thereby enhancing their immunogenicity for autologous T cells. This new approach may have implications for T-cell-mediated immunotherapy in AML.","['Notter, M', 'Willinger, T', 'Erben, U', 'Thiel, E']","['Notter M', 'Willinger T', 'Erben U', 'Thiel E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freie Universitat Berlin, Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['B7-1 Antigen/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*genetics/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.10.3138 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55635-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 15;97(10):3138-45. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.10.3138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice, these include the Ly49 family of molecules. One mechanism by which tumor cells may evade NK cell killing is by expressing the appropriate MHC class I and binding inhibitory Ly49 receptors. Therefore, the question of whether blocking the interaction between the Ly49 inhibitory receptors on NK and MHC class I cells on tumor cells augments antitumor activity was investigated. Blockade of Ly49C and I inhibitory receptors using F(ab')(2) fragments of the 5E6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) resulted in increased cytotoxicity against syngeneic tumors and decreased tumor cell growth in vitro. The effect of 5E6 F(ab')(2) was specific for the MHC of the tumor, as the use of F(ab')(2) of the mAb against Ly49G2 failed to increase NK activity. Treatment of leukemia-bearing mice with 5E6 F(ab')(2) fragments or adoptive transfer of NK cells treated ex vivo with the F(ab')(2) resulted in significant increases in survival. These results demonstrate that blockade of NK inhibitory receptors enhances antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that NK inhibitory receptors can be responsible for diminishing antitumor responses. Therefore, strategies to block inhibitory receptors may be of potential use in increasing the efficacy of immunotherapy.

Previously, it was found that the percentage of CD34(+) cells in bone marrow and the in vitro colony formation from CD34(+) cells of patients with SDS were markedly reduced. For these reasons, and because apoptosis is central in the pathogenesis of bone marrow dysfunction in MDS, this study was initiated to delineate the role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of the marrow failure. Eleven children with SDS were studied. Compared to normal controls, patients' marrow mononuclear cells plated in clonogenic cultures showed a significantly higher tendency to undergo apoptosis. The defect in SDS was found in patients with and without MDS. Patients showed a more prominent decrease in colony formation and increased apoptosis after preincubation with activating anti-Fas antibody. Fas expression on marrow cells from patients was significantly higher than from normal controls. The difference between patients and controls for Fas expression was also significant for the following cell fraction subpopulations: CD34(-)/CD38(-), CD34(-)/CD38(+), and CD34(+). In conclusion, SDS hematopoietic progenitors are intrinsically flawed and have faulty proliferative properties and increased apoptosis. Bone marrow failure in SDS appears mediated by increased apoptosis as the central pathogenetic mechanism. This increased propensity for apoptosis is linked to increased expression of the Fas antigen and to hyperactivation of the Fas signaling pathway.","['Dror, Y', 'Freedman, M H']","['Dror Y', 'Freedman MH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. yigal.dror@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adolescent', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndrome', 'fas Receptor/analysis/immunology/*physiology']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.10.3011 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55619-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 15;97(10):3011-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.10.3011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with UBMT recipients, UCBT recipients had delayed hematopoietic recovery (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [95CI]: 0.27-0.52; P <.001), increased 100 day transplant-related mortality (HR = 2.13; 95CI: 1.20-3.76; P <.01) and decreased acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (HR = 0.50; 95CI: 0.34-0.73; P <.001). T-UBMT recipients had decreased aGVHD (HR = 0.25; 95CI: 0.17-0.36; P <.0001) and increased risk of relapse (HR = 1.96; 95CI: 1.11-3.45; P =.02). After day 100 posttransplant, the 3 groups achieved similar results in terms of relapse. Chronic GVHD was decreased after T-UBMT (HR = 0.21; 95CI: 0.11-0.37; P <.0001) and UCBT (HR = 0.24; 95CI: 0.01-0.66; P =.002), and overall mortality was higher in T-UBMT recipients (HR = 1.39; 95CI: 0.97-1.99; P <.07). In conclusion, the use of UCBT, as a source of hematopoietic stem cells, is a reasonable option for children with AL lacking an acceptably matched unrelated marrow donor.","['Rocha, V', 'Cornish, J', 'Sievers, E L', 'Filipovich, A', 'Locatelli, F', 'Peters, C', 'Remberger, M', 'Michel, G', 'Arcese, W', 'Dallorso, S', 'Tiedemann, K', 'Busca, A', 'Chan, K W', 'Kato, S', 'Ortega, J', 'Vowels, M', 'Zander, A', 'Souillet, G', 'Oakill, A', 'Woolfrey, A', 'Pay, A L', 'Green, A', 'Garnier, F', 'Ionescu, I', 'Wernet, P', 'Sirchia, G', 'Rubinstein, P', 'Chevret, S', 'Gluckman, E']","['Rocha V', 'Cornish J', 'Sievers EL', 'Filipovich A', 'Locatelli F', 'Peters C', 'Remberger M', 'Michel G', 'Arcese W', 'Dallorso S', 'Tiedemann K', 'Busca A', 'Chan KW', 'Kato S', 'Ortega J', 'Vowels M', 'Zander A', 'Souillet G', 'Oakill A', 'Woolfrey A', 'Pay AL', 'Green A', 'Garnier F', 'Ionescu I', 'Wernet P', 'Sirchia G', 'Rubinstein P', 'Chevret S', 'Gluckman E']","['Eurocord-Cord Blood Transplant Group (CBTG) and Biostatistics Department, Saint Louis Hospital AP-HP, University of Paris 7, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', '*Treatment Outcome']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.10.2962 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55612-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 15;97(10):2962-71. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.10.2962.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study tested the hypothesis that the numbers of donor mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, and CD34(+) cells influence relapse and event-free survival (EFS) after BMT. The study population consisted of 113 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent non-T-cell-depleted BMT from HLA-matched siblings. Sixty-four patients had low-risk diagnoses (ALL/AML CR1, MDS RA/RARS, and CML CP1); 49 patients had high-risk diagnoses (all others). CD34(+) cells, T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and a rare population of CD3(-), CD4(bright) cells in the allografts were measured by flow cytometry. The CD3(-), CD4(bright) cells in bone marrow had the same frequency and phenotype as CD123(bright) type 2 dendritic cell (DC) progenitors, and they differentiated into typical DCs after short-term culture. Cox regression analyses evaluated risk strata, age, gender, and the numbers of nucleated cells, CD3(+) T cells, CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, and CD4(bright) cells as covariates for EFS, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality. Recipients of larger numbers of CD4(bright) cells had significantly lower EFS, a lower incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), and an increased incidence of relapse. Recipients of larger numbers of CD34(+) cells had improved EFS; recipients of fewer CD34(+) cells had delayed hematopoietic engraftment and increased death from infections. In conclusion, the content of donor CD4(bright) cells was associated with decreased cGVHD and graft-versus-leukemia effects in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, consistent with a role for donor DCs in determining immune responses after allogeneic BMT.","['Waller, E K', 'Rosenthal, H', 'Jones, T W', 'Peel, J', 'Lonial, S', 'Langston, A', 'Redei, I', 'Jurickova, I', 'Boyer, M W']","['Waller EK', 'Rosenthal H', 'Jones TW', 'Peel J', 'Lonial S', 'Langston A', 'Redei I', 'Jurickova I', 'Boyer MW']","['Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Center, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cells/pathology', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.10.2948 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55610-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 15;97(10):2948-56. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.10.2948.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Blood 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1677'],,,,,,,,,

In this study, culture conditions were developed that resulted in the expansion of CD8(+) NKT cells from bone marrow, thymus, and spleen by the timed addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. After 14 to 21 days in culture, dramatic expansion of CD3(+), CD8(+), alphabetaT-cell receptor(+) T cells resulted with approximately 20% to 50% of the cells also expressing the NK markers NK1.1 and DX5. The CD8(+) NKT cells demonstrated lytic activity against several tumor target cells with more than 90% lysis by day 14 to day 21 of culture. Cytotoxicity was observed against both syngeneic and allogeneic tumor cell targets with the greatest lytic activity by the cells expressing either NK1.1 or DX5. The expanded CD8(+) NKT cells produce T(H)1-type cytokines with high levels of IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Expansion of the CD8(+) NKT cells was independent of CD1d. Ly49 molecules were expressed on only a minority of cells. A single injection of expanded CD8(+) NKT cells was capable of protecting syngeneic animals from an otherwise lethal dose of Bcl1 leukemia cells. Expanded CD8(+) NKT cells produced far less graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) than splenocytes across major histocompatibility barriers, even when 10 times the number of CD8(+) NKT cells as compared to splenocytes were injected. This reduction in GVHD was related to IFN-gamma production since cells expanded from IFN-gamma knock-out animals caused acute lethal GVHD, whereas cells expanded from animals defective in fas ligand, fas, IL-2, and perforin did not. These data indicate that CD8(+) NKT cells expanded in this fashion could be useful for preserving graft-versus-leukemia activity without causing GVHD.","['Baker, J', 'Verneris, M R', 'Ito, M', 'Shizuru, J A', 'Negrin, R S']","['Baker J', 'Verneris MR', 'Ito M', 'Shizuru JA', 'Negrin RS']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Graft vs Host Disease', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.10.2923 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55607-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 15;97(10):2923-31. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.10.2923.,"['2PO1CA49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-57443/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA80006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, we herein review and discuss the biological and clinical implications of sFas in ATL.","['Kamihira, S', 'Yamada, Y']","['Kamihira S', 'Yamada Y']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan. kamihira@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'RNA Splicing', 'Solubility', 'fas Receptor/*genetics/metabolism/physiology']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001144 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190109057967 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Mar;41(1-2):169-76. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057967.,,,,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have investigated the in vivo effects of IL-4, IL-10, and amifostine on cytokine production in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Serum IL-1ra, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, GM-CSF, and SCF levels were measured in AML patients who received IL-4, IL-10, or amifostine. No significant changes in the serum levels of IL-1ra, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, GM-CSF, and SCF were found in AML patients who received amifostine. Both IL-4 and IL-10 were found to increase serum IL-1ra. This data is in accord with the in vitro studies. However, IL-4 increased serum GM-CSF levels and IL-10 increased serum IL-1beta and TNFalpha levels. These in vivo effects of the two cytokines differ from their in vitro effects. Despite the similar effects of IL-4 and IL-10 on cytokine production by AML cells in vitro, different effects were observed in AML patients in vivo. IL-4 increased serum SCF levels, whereas IL-10 decreased serum SCF levels. IL-4 increased serum GM-CSF levels, whereas IL-10 had no effect on them. Although IL-10 increased serum IL-1beta and TNFalpha levels, IL-4 had no effect on them. These findings indicate that the in vitro effects of IL-4 and IL-10 do not necessarily reflect their in vivo effects, and that the complex effects of the two cytokines on serum cytokine levels make it difficult to predict their therapeutic potential.","['Tao, M', 'Li, B', 'Nayini, J', 'Sivaraman, S', 'Song, S', 'Larson, A', 'Toofanfard, M', 'Chen, H', 'Venugopal, P', 'Preisler, H D']","['Tao M', 'Li B', 'Nayini J', 'Sivaraman S', 'Song S', 'Larson A', 'Toofanfard M', 'Chen H', 'Venugopal P', 'Preisler HD']","[""Rush Cancer Institute, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, 1725 West Harrison Street, Suite 809, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",IM,"['Amifostine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-1/blood', 'Interleukin-10/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/blood/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/blood/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/drug effects/metabolism']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001172 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190109057966 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Mar;41(1-2):161-8. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057966.,['1-PO-01 CA 75606-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The French group study design permitted a single crossover to include or discontinue cytarabine or interferon. Endpoints were overall survival, complete hematologic remission (CHR) at six months, and major cytogenetic response at 12 months. We modified a published Markov model that compared IFN-alpha alone to IFN-alpha plus cytarabine and included the possibility of crossover as in the French study. The model permits allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), and follows cytogenetic response and acceleration of CML through death. Treatment response, toxicity, and survival are drawn from the French Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Study Group population of 810 patients on an intention-to-treat model. Survivals are extended to 62 months based on currently available follow-up. Costs from a United States oncology specialty institution, and state utilities from previous research and a quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms or Toxicity analysis of the subject study were discounted at 3% per annum. At the median cohort age of 50, cytarabine offers 21 months of added median survival to IFN-alpha, which itself is superior to conventional chemotherapy by 21 months. Cost-effectiveness estimates for cytarabine added to IFN-alpha range from $7,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to $35,000 per QALY, under all plausible assumptions superior to IFN-alpha alone. The model is sensitive to the quality of life on therapy, as well as to remission rate with additive cytarabine, although the cost-effectiveness calculations are robust over the entire range of clinical assumptions. Based on data from the French study, cytarabine added to IFN-alpha substantially improves the cost-effectiveness of initial therapy for early chronic phase CML.","['Beck, J R', 'Guilhot, J', 'Giles, F J', 'Aoki, N', 'Wirt, D P', 'Guilhot, F']","['Beck JR', 'Guilhot J', 'Giles FJ', 'Aoki N', 'Wirt DP', 'Guilhot F']","['Information Technology Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferons/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/economics/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/economics/mortality/*therapy', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001146 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190109057960 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Mar;41(1-2):117-24. doi: 10.3109/10428190109057960.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few prospective studies, however, in which other trigger values were tested have been published. In this study all hospitalized, thrombocytopenic adult hematology-oncology patients in our institution were prospectively evaluated daily for hemorrhage and platelet transfusion during a one year period; no patients were excluded for bleeding or infectious problems. By design, during the initial six-months (baseline period), the prophylactic platelet transfusion trigger was 20 x 10(9) /L; for the second six-months (study period) this threshold was changed to 10 x 10(9) /L. Patients studied during the two periods did not differ significantly in age, gender, diagnosis, blood or marrow transplant status, and duration of neutropenia. Compliance with the thresholds was 95.6% (baseline period) and 93.5% (study period). For patients with platelet counts under 20 x 10(9) /L, the mean use of platelet transfusions per patient per day was significantly lower in the study period (4.47) than in the baseline period (6.48; p<0.001). Both mean prophylactic (1.54/patient-day) and therapeutic (2.93/patient-day) platelet transfusions were reduced in the study period compared with the baseline period (2.26 and 4.22/patient-day, respectively). Hemorrhage was slightly reduced in the study period compared with the baseline period: major hemorrhage, 15.2% vs. 18.4% (p=0.014); minor hemorrhage, 63.6% vs. 70.1% (p<0.001). Thus, hemorrhage was not increased with the lower trigger level.

Blood and urinary cultures were negative as well as serum anti-virus abs. However, serum anti-ganglioside abs. were positive for anti-asialo GM1 and anti-Gd1b. This latter finding was consistent with an autoimmune mechanism, not described until now as CDA neurotoxicity.

Overally, the frequencies of the polymorphic allele were similar (35.3% and 32.0% respectively)(P=0.6). We did not find differences between patients and controls except for myeloma/plasmacytoma group (n=26) which showed a CC genotype less than expected (19% vs 46%) (p=0.01) with a frequency ratio of 0.28 (0.10-0.77). Even among the IgG myeloma cases only one patient showed a common genotype (CC) (1/15, 7%) (P=0.003). If these preliminary data are validated with prospective studies, the 677C allele of MTHFR gene could be confirmed as an effective multiple myeloma protective factor (specially for the IgG cases).","['Gonzalez Ordonez, A J', 'Fernandez Carreira, J M', 'Fernandez Alvarez, C R', 'Martin, L', 'Sanchez Garcia, J', 'Medina Rodriguez, J M', 'Alvarez, M V', 'Coto, E']","['Gonzalez Ordonez AJ', 'Fernandez Carreira JM', 'Fernandez Alvarez CR', 'Martin L', 'Sanchez Garcia J', 'Medina Rodriguez JM', 'Alvarez MV', 'Coto E']","['Hematology Department; Hospital S.

Understanding the cellular biology of immune effector cells from CLL patients as well as leukemic target cells is essential to developing immune mediated therapeutic strategies for CLL. In this study, an immortal CLL cell line called WSU-CLL has been used to study the characteristics of B-cell CLL as a tumor target for natural killer (NK), activated natural killer, and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells. The WSU-CLL cells were significantly less (p<0.001) susceptible to NK cell mediated cytotoxicity compared to K562, a standard tumor target cell line. In vitro activation of effector cells with either short term, low dose IL-2 or long term, high dose IL-2 significantly increased the susceptibility of CLL cells for cell mediated killing. The addition of CD1a+/CD3-/CD4+/CD80+/CD83+ dendritic cells derived from human umbilical cord blood increased the cytotoxicity of LAK cells against WSU-CLL. There is an increased expression of Bcl-2 and decreased expression of Fas on WSU-CLL cells as determined by RT-PCR techniques indicating possible roles for these genes in exerting resistance to immune cell mediated lysis. When Bcl-2 expression was downregulated in WSU-CLL cells using gene specific antisense oligonucleotides, the susceptibility of WSU-CLL cells to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agent Fludarabine was increased. Thus, our results suggest that in vitro activation with cytokines, addition of accessory cell populations such as dendritic cells and/or manipulation of key gene expression i.e. down regulation of Bcl-2 might be potential strategies to increase the antitumor cytotoxicity against CLL cells.","['Vu, U E', 'Pavletic, Z S', 'Wang, X', 'Joshi, S S']","['Vu UE', 'Pavletic ZS', 'Wang X', 'Joshi SS']","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center Omaha, Nebraska 68198-6395, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001121 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009113387 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Nov;39(5-6):573-82. doi: 10.3109/10428190009113387.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been some studies in the literature suggesting an association between the deficiency of these elements and the development of malignant disorders. In this study hair and serum zinc and magnesium levels were investigated in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and malignant lymphoma (ML) at the time of initial diagnosis. Ten children with T-cell ALL, 10 children with B-precursor ALL, 5 children with Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL), 11 children with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), 10 children with non-Burkitt non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NBNHL) and 12 age and sex matched healthy children as a control group were included in the study. Mean hair magnesium levels in all of the groups of the patients were lower than the levels in the control group but the difference was statistically significant only in the children with T cell ALL comparable to the controls (28.9+/-3.9 microg/g and 87.6+/-18.5 microg/g respectiveley, p<0,05). Mean serum magnesium levels in all the cohorts were not significantly different than those in controls (p>0.05 in each comparison). Mean hair zinc levels in the patients with T-cell, B-precursor ALL, BL, HL, NBNHL were 103.4+/-14.6 microg/g, 100.9+/-7.8 microg/g, 91.1+/-19 microg/g, 72.5+/-9.1 microg/g, 103.2+/-12.2 microg/g respectively. Each of these levels were significantly lower than the mean hair zinc levels of the control group (141.2+/-9.6 microg/g, p<0.05 in each comparison). Although mean serum zinc levels in all of the groups were also decreased, the differences were statistically significant only in the groups with B-precursor ALL, HL and NBNHL (75.9+/-5.29 microg/dl, 68.6+/-7.3 microg/dl, 85.7+/-5.5 microg/dl respectively) when compared with controls (105.1+/-9.9 microg/dl, p<0.05 in each comparison). Hair magnesium and zinc levels showed a positive correlation with each other in all the groups (r congruent with 0.5). No significant difference was found in the mean hair/serum magnesium and zinc levels between malnourished and nonmalnourished patients. In conclusion, regarding the results of our study and previous data in the literature chronic magnesium and zinc deficiency seems to be associated with the development of ALL and malignant lymphoma in a group of patients.","['Sahin, G', 'Ertem, U', 'Duru, F', 'Birgen, D', 'Yuksek, N']","['Sahin G', 'Ertem U', 'Duru F', 'Birgen D', 'Yuksek N']","[""Dr. Sami Ulus Children's Hospital Department of Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Hair/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/metabolism', 'Magnesium/analysis/blood', 'Magnesium Deficiency/complications/*epidemiology', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Nutritional Status', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/metabolism', 'Prevalence', 'Zinc/analysis/blood/*deficiency']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001129 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009113385 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Nov;39(5-6):555-62. doi: 10.3109/10428190009113385.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were managed according to their performance status (PS) and associated diseases in both institutions. The proportion of patients with poor PS (3-4) was higher in center 1 (37%) than in center 2 (10%) and in center 1 palliative treatment was given more frequently (16/32 patients) than in center 2 (7/42 patients). Fifty-one patients received intensive combination chemotherapy including an anthracycline and ara-C or VP16 (2 patients) and 36 patients received a second intensive course as reinduction or as consolidation treatment after complete remission. Patients not eligible for myelosuppressive chemotherapy were treated with palliative measures (23 patients). With intensive chemotherapy, complete remission (CR) was achieved in 29 of 51 patients (57%), after first (20 patients) or second course (9 patients) and the rate of deaths during induction was 14% (7 patients). The CR rate was lower for patients with performance status >or= 2 (48%) as compared to patients with performance status <or= 1 (78%) and for patients with secondary AML (46%) as compared to patients with de novo AML (60%). Median survival was 9.1 months for patients receiving intensive treatment and 1.2 months for patients receiving palliative treatment (P=0.001). In the Cox model for overall survival, treatment with curative intent was associated with longer survival (hazard ratio: 0.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.58) and poor performance status (PS >or= 2) was associated with reduced survival (hazard ratio: 3.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.75-6.17). Overall 2-years and 5-years survival were 20% and 11% for the patients treated intensively. From this study it appears that an individualized approach of treatment with intensive chemotherapy for selected patients offers a substantial CR rate and an improvement in survival.

Nearly 30 years ago, TRAP became known to hematologists as cytochemical marker enzyme of hairy cell leukemia. Physiologically, TRAP is primarily a cytochemical marker of macrophages, osteoclasts and dendritic cells. TRAP is localized intracellularly in the lysosomal compartment. Recent data suggest also secretion of TRAP by some cell types, in particular by osteoclasts. Human, mouse and rat TRAP are biochemically well characterized. While the complete genomic sequence of TRAP has been elucidated, only limited information on the genetic details of the gene and its regulation is available. It appears that the intracellular iron content is involved in the regulation of the enzyme. The physiological substrates for this enzyme have not been identified yet and consequently the functional role of TRAP remains completely unknown, though some hypotheses have been forwarded, e.g. involvement in bone resorption and iron homeostasis (transport, metabolism). Taken together, research on the biology of TRAP has been intensive and has led to considerable progress on a number of fronts, including the cloning of the gene. Further studies are, however, still required to determine the role of TRAP in vivo.","['Lamp, E C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Lamp EC', 'Drexler HG']","['Institute for Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acp5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase', 'Tissue Distribution']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001108 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009113378 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Nov;39(5-6):477-84. doi: 10.3109/10428190009113378.,,,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytochemical examination revealed YM711 cells to be positive for peroxidase, alpha-naphtyl butyrate esterase, and acid phosphatase as well. Karyotypic analysis showed them to be nearly tetraploid (92 XXYY). Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that, although PML/RARalpha mRNA was detected in YM711, these cells could not be differentiated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We therefore designated the YM711 cell line as being ATRA resistant. Because YM711 expressed multi drug resistance 1 (MDR-1) mRNA and p-glycoprotein cell surface protein, we assessed whether verapamil and ATRA would induce the differentiation of YM711 cells; they did not. An increased expression of cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP)-II was also detected on YM711 cells compared with that of HL-60. These results suggest that high level of expression of CRABP-II may contribute to be the mechanism of ATRA resistance.

There are a variety of synonyms for MSE among hematologists and biochemists. Biochemically, MSE is well-characterized, but should be discerned from other esterases with similar or identical substrate specificities and other features. Intensive analysis of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells and leukemia-lymphoma cell lines using isoelectric focusing established the specificity of this enzyme for monocytes and related cells, hence its designation as monocyte-specific esterase. Cloning of the gene led to its molecular characterization and provided new opportunities to examine MSE expression also at the RNA level which confirmed the monocyte/macrophage specificity. The availability of the gene sequences of various serine esterases and lipases which also hydrolyze ester bonds allowed for the identification of identical isolates from different tissues and the construction of an unrooted dendrogram based on sequence homologies of 22 enzymes. The detailed regulation of the gene and the functional role of MSE have remained largely unknown as of yet. However, DNA binding sites for various transcription factors have already been detected. Some evidence suggests involvement in physiological detoxification processes and in the immune defense against tumor cells. A more thorough understanding of the in vivo function of this truly unique enzyme should be helped by characterizing the signals and signal transduction mechanisms which lead to MSE expression.","['Uphoff, C C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Uphoff CC', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.- (monocyte-specific esterase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Esterases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001105 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009065825 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Oct;39(3-4):257-70. doi: 10.3109/10428190009065825.,,,,,,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Members of both the PBX and Meis groups have been implicated in tumorigenesis and are known to cooperatively bind DNA with Class I (clustered) HOX homeoproteins. Here we show that PBX and Meis homeoproteins cooperatively bind the PBX-responsive sequence in vitro with the oncoprotein encoded by the non-clustered homeobox gene HOX11 activated by the t(10;14)(q24;q11) chromosomal translocation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). An FPWME motif N-terminal to the homeodomain is required for interaction with PBX proteins, which appears to confer DNA-binding specificity to HOX11. PBX proteins are highly expressed in HOX11 immortalized/transformed hematopoietic cells; in particular, the 10q24 translocation-carrying T-ALL Sil and K3P lines were found to selectively express PBX2. Ectopic retroviral-directed overexpression of PBX2 in concert with HOX11 in NIH3T3 cells resulted in decreased contact inhibition of growth as evidenced by focus formation in confluent cell monolayers.

Over the last five years or so a number of studies have identified that such patients are at high risk of developing secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The actuarial risks have been estimated to be up to 18% in some series. More recently, studies from France and the EBMT suggest that in Registries containing large numbers of transplanted patients the risks are lower and are of the order of 3-5% at five years. Cytogenetic examination of bone marrow cells taken pre-transplant may also show identical abnormalities to those found in the leukaemic clone after transplant indicating that in many instances the stem cell damage was caused by prior treatment. In addition, a report from the British National Lymphoma Investigation has identified that post-transplant MDS/AML was related to the total quantity of treatment received, with mustine being identified as a particular culprit. It thus seems probable that the additional stem cell insult offered by the transplant may be small although a factor which may increase the risk is the use of total body irradiation.","['Milligan, D W']",['Milligan DW'],"['Consultant Haematologist and Honorary Senior Lecturer Department of Haematology Birmingham Heartlands Hospital Birmingham B9 5SS, UK. d.w.milligan@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001092 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009065822 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Oct;39(3-4):223-8. doi: 10.3109/10428190009065822.,,,,,,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Along with this concept normal hematopoietic cells and the majority of leukemias express exclusively myeloid or lymphoid specific antigens. On the other hand, growing evidence exists challenging the lineage fidelity model. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the blast crisis may switch to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and as a result of the chemotherapy ALL may converse to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, a substantial portion of leukemia cases, named acute mixed-lineage leukemia (AMLL), show simultaneous expression of both myeloid and lymphoid antigens. Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements, correlating with myeloid-lymphoid immunophenotype in AMLL, support the hypothesis of lineage infidelity of early progenitor cells, rather than the aberrant antigen expression. Based on a detailed characterization of AMLL we present a modified model of a ""common myeloid/lymphoid progenitor cell"". This hypothetical very early hematopoietic progenitor cell shows a transient expression of myeloid and B- or T-lymphoid antigen and may also have rearranged its Ig and/or TCR genes. Subsequently, myeloid or lymphoid markers are downregulated and the hematopoietic cell enters either myeloid, T-lymphoid or B-lymphoid differentiation pathway.","['Schmidt, C A', 'Przybylski, G K']","['Schmidt CA', 'Przybylski GK']","['Humboldt Universitat Berlin, Charite Campus Virchow, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int Rev Immunol,International reviews of immunology,8712260,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I341E001022 [pii]', '10.3109/08830180109056725 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Rev Immunol. 2001 Feb;20(1):107-15. doi: 10.3109/08830180109056725.,,,,,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of normal and leukemic myeloid cells as well as those of cells derived from mice with targeted disruption showed that a series of transcription factors play a major role in both commitment and maturation of myeloid cells. This is primarily because these transcription factors direct an ordered pattern of gene expression according to a well-defined developmental program. PU.1, an Ets family member, is one of the master transcription factors identified to regulate development of both granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Further, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPvarepsilon of the bZip family have important roles in directing granulocytic maturation. A number of additional transcription factors such as AML1, RARalpha, MZF-1, Hox and STAT families of transcription factors, Egr-1 and c-myb etc are shown to play roles in myeloid cell differentiation. Our laboratory has recently obtained evidence that ICSBP, a member of the IRF family, is involved in lineage commitment during myeloid cell differentiation and stimulates maturation of functional macrophages. Future elucidation of pathways and networks through which these transcription factors act in various stages of development would provide a more definitive picture of myeloid cell commitment and maturation.","['Nagamura-Inoue, T', 'Tamura, T', 'Ozato, K']","['Nagamura-Inoue T', 'Tamura T', 'Ozato K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation National Institute of Child Health and Human Development National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-2753, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int Rev Immunol,International reviews of immunology,8712260,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Leucine Zippers/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Genetic', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/classification/genetics/*physiology', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/physiology']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['I341E001021 [pii]', '10.3109/08830180109056724 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Rev Immunol. 2001 Feb;20(1):83-105. doi: 10.3109/08830180109056724.,,,,,,145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During a scientific 'Bootsma' cruise on his sailing-boat 'de Losbol', we visit a variety of scenery locations along the lakes and canals in Friesland, passing the highlights of Dirk Bootsma's scientific oeuvre. Departing from 'de Fluessen', his homeport, with his PhD work on the effect of X-rays and UV on cell cycle progression, we head for the pioneering endeavours of his team on mapping genes on human chromosomes by cell hybridization. Next we explore the use of cell hybrids by the Bootsma team culminating in the molecular cloning of one of the first chromosomal breakpoints involved in oncogenesis: the bcr-abl fusion gene responsible for chronic myelocytic leukemia. This seminal achievement enabled later development of new methods for early detection and very promising therapeutic intervention. A series of highlights at the horizon constitute the contributions of his team to the field of DNA repair, beginning with the discovery of genetic heterogeneity in the repair syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) followed later by the cloning of a large number of human repair genes. This led to the discovery that DNA repair is strongly conserved in evolution rendering knowledge from yeast relevant for mammals and vice versa. In addition, it resolved the molecular basis of several repair syndromes and permitted functional analysis of the encoded proteins. Another milestone is the discovery of the surprising connection between DNA repair and transcription initiation via the dual functional TFIIH complex in collaboration with Jean-Marc Egly et al. in Strasbourg. This provided an explanation for many puzzling clinical features and triggered a novel concept in human genetics: the existence of repair/transcription syndromes. The generation of many mouse mutants carrying defects in repair pathways yielded valuable models for assessing the clinical relevance of DNA repair including carcinogenesis and the identification of a link between DNA damage and premature aging. His team also opened a fascinating area of cell biology with the analysis of repair and transcription in living cells. A final surprising evolutionary twist was the discovery that photolyases designed for the light-dependent repair of UV-induced DNA lesions appeared to be adopted for driving the mammalian biological clock. The latter indicates that it is time to return to 'de Fluessen', where we will consider briefly the merits of Dirk Bootsma for Dutch science in general.","['Hoeijmakers, J H']",['Hoeijmakers JH'],"['MGC, Cell Biology and Genetics, Center for Biomedical Genetics, Erasmus University, P.O.

Other substrates of asparaginases include L-glutamine, D-asparagine, and succinic acid monoamide. In this report, we present high-resolution crystal structures of the complexes of Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase (ErA) with the products of such reactions that also can serve as substrates, namely L-glutamic acid (L-Glu), D-aspartic acid (D-Asp), and succinic acid (Suc). Comparison of the four independent active sites within each complex indicates unique and specific binding of the ligand molecules; the mode of binding is also similar between complexes. The lack of the alpha-NH3(+) group in Suc, compared to L-Asp, does not affect the binding mode. The side chain of L-Glu, larger than that of L-Asp, causes several structural distortions in the ErA active side. The active site flexible loop (residues 15-33) does not exhibit stable conformation, resulting in suboptimal orientation of the nucleophile, Thr15. Additionally, the delta-COO(-) plane of L-Glu is approximately perpendicular to the plane of gamma-COO(-) in L-Asp bound to the asparaginase active site. Binding of D-Asp to the ErA active site is very distinctive compared to the other ligands, suggesting that the low activity of ErA against D-Asp could be mainly attributed to the low k(cat) value. A comparison of the amino acid sequence and the crystal structure of ErA with those of other bacterial L-asparaginases shows that the presence of two active-site residues, Glu63(ErA) and Ser254(ErA), may correlate with significant glutaminase activity, while their substitution by Gln and Asn, respectively, may lead to minimal L-glutaminase activity.","['Aghaiypour, K', 'Wlodawer, A', 'Lubkowski, J']","['Aghaiypour K', 'Wlodawer A', 'Lubkowski J']","['Macromolecular Crystallography Laboratory, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'AB6MNQ6J6L (Succinic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Asparaginase/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Aspartic Acid/chemistry/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/*enzymology', 'Glutamic Acid/chemistry/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Succinic Acid/chemistry/metabolism']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['bi0029595 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0029595 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2001 May 15;40(19):5655-64. doi: 10.1021/bi0029595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['PDB/1HFW', 'PDB/1HG0', 'PDB/1HG1', 'PDB/R1HFWSF', 'PDB/R1HG0SF', 'PDB/R1HG1SF']",,,,,

Ag(+) also induced a rapid change in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins including the focal adhesion kinase but not Syk kinase. The Syk-selective inhibitor piceatannol and the Src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1 dose-dependently inhibited FcepsilonRI-mediated degranulation, whereas neither compound inhibited the Ag(+)-mediated degranulation. Furthermore, likewise FcepsilonRI aggregation, Ag(+) also induced leukotriene secretion. These results show that Ag(+) activates RBL-2H3 mast cells through a tyrosine phosphorylation-linked mechanism, which is distinct from that involved in FcepsilonRI-mediated activation.","['Suzuki, Y', 'Yoshimaru, T', 'Yamashita, K', 'Matsui, T', 'Yamaki, M', 'Shimizu, K']","['Suzuki Y', 'Yoshimaru T', 'Yamashita K', 'Matsui T', 'Yamaki M', 'Shimizu K']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, 173-8610, Japan. ysuzuki@med.nihon-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Ptk2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Precursors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukotrienes/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Mercury/toxicity', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Silver/*toxicity', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tyrosine/chemistry/metabolism']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.4844 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)94844-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 May 11;283(3):707-14. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.4844.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Pathology materials consisted of autopsy, biopsy and rare cytology specimens. 92.3% of these patients were male, and 85.8% were between 50 and 79 years in age. The major primary site of the tumor was the pleura (73.1%). However, in a group of the asbestos insulation workers, the peritoneum was the more common primary site of malignant mesothelioma, compared to the pleura. Histologically, epithelial cell type was the majority (61.1%), followed by biphasic (22.1%) and fibrosarcomatous (16.4%). A double primary tumor (malignant mesothelioma associated with other cancer) was present in 32 of the 1,517 cases. These 32 cancers included lung cancers, renal cell carcinomas, colorectal cancers, pancreatic cancers and a cancer of the larynx, which are known to be at higher risk among asbestos insulation workers. The latency period of the vast majority (98.1%) of these mesothelioma cases were longer than 20 years. It is well accepted that cigarette smoking does not contribute to the induction of malignant mesothelioma. Indeed, the present study confirmed that 19.9% of these mesothelioma patients had never smoked cigarettes.","['Suzuki, Y']",['Suzuki Y'],"['Department of Community and Preventive Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, 10029, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Ind Health,Industrial health,2985065R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autopsy', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Pleural Neoplasms/pathology', 'United States']",2001/05/09 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/05/09 10:00'],"['2001/05/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2486/indhealth.39.183 [doi]'],ppublish,Ind Health. 2001 Apr;39(2):183-5. doi: 10.2486/indhealth.39.183.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk associated with exposure to external X- or gamma-radiation increases linearly with increasing dose to the thyroid gland at low-to-moderate doses, but the dose-response relationship appears to flatten at the very high doses characteristic of cancer radiotherapy. Because of the extreme sensitivity of the thyroid gland in children, there is a risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer even when the thyroid gland is outside of the irradiated field. Increased incidence of thyroid cancer has been noted following radiotherapy for childhood Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, acute lymphocytic leukemia and tumors of the central nervous system. Radiation-induced tumors begin to appear 5-10 years after irradiation and excess risk persists for decades, perhaps for the remainder of life. The background incidence of thyroid cancer is two- to threefold higher among females than males, and the absolute increase in risk due to irradiation is higher in females as well. Most of the thyroid cancers that occur in association with irradiation are of the papillary type, for which the cure rate is high if tumors are detected early. This highlights the importance of long-term surveillance of persons irradiated during childhood. Important areas for research include the possibility that children with certain types of first cancer are especially susceptible, the basis of the greater female susceptibility, the joint effects of radiation and other factors, and genetic mechanisms in radiation-induced and spontaneously occurring thyroid cancer.","['Inskip, P D']",['Inskip PD'],"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. inskippe@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology']",2001/05/08 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/08 10:00'],"['2001/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.1132 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 May;36(5):568-73. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1132.,,,,,,50,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

All are associated with a distinct form of leukemia characterized by chromosomal translocations as a treatment complication. Most of the translocations disrupt a breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of the MLL gene at chromosome band 11q23. Other characteristic translocations also may occur. The normal function of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II is to catalyze changes in DNA topology between relaxed and supercoiled states by transiently cleaving and re-ligating both strands of the double helix. Anticancer drugs that are DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors are cytotoxic because they form complexes with DNA and DNA topoisomerase II. The complexes decrease the re-ligation rate, disrupt the cleavage-re-ligation equilibrium, and have a net effect of increasing cleavage. The increased cleavage damages the DNA and leads to chromosomal breakage. Cells with irreparable DNA damage die by apoptosis. The association of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors with leukemia suggests that the drug-induced, DNA topoisomerase II-mediated chromosomal breakage may be relevant to translocations in addition to this anti-neoplastic, cytotoxic action. Epidemiological studies, genomic translocation breakpoint cloning and in vitro DNA topoisomerase II cleavage assays together lead to a model for treatment-related leukemia in which DNA topoisomerase II causes chromosomal breakage and translocations form when the breakage is repaired.","['Felix, C A']",['Felix CA'],"[""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. felix@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Survivors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/05/08 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/08 10:00'],"['2001/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.1125 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 May;36(5):525-35. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1125.,"['CA66140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,157,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Key features are the linearity in the dose response (i.e., a straight line adequately fits the observed data), and the effect modification of age at exposure (i.e., risk is inversely related to exposure age and exposures past the menopausal ages appear to carry a very low risk); and the minimal effect of fractionating dose on subsequent risk. A recent combined analysis of almost 78,000 women and 1,500 breast cancer cases from eight cohorts confirmed the downturn in risk at the highest dose levels (related in part to the killing of cells rather than transformation) and that fractionation of dose has little influence on risk, at least on an absolute scale. It is not known whether persons predisposed to cancer are at enhanced risk of radiation-induced breast cancer from low-dose exposures, although this seems unlikely.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 children, 0--14 years old, with newly diagnosed and bone-marrow-biopsy-confirmed acute childhood leukemia between 1993 and 1996 were followed up until death or March 31, 1998. IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGFBP-3 were measured at diagnosis and clinical data, including presence of hepatosplenomegaly and number of white blood cells, were available. RESULTS: After controlling for gender, age, indicators of clinical severity and the other measured components of the IGF system there was a statistically significant (p < 0.05) inverse association of IGFBP-3 with survival. An increment of one standard deviation in IGFBP-3 was associated with a 65% reduction of the death hazard among the children with leukemia. Neither IGF-1 nor IGF-2 was associated with survival in this data set. CONCLUSION: The presented empirical evidence in conjunction with the fact that IGFBP-3 modulates IGF-1 and IGF-2 bioavailability and is likely to have proapoptotic effects makes this compound a plausible independent predictor of survival from childhood leukemia.","['Petridou, E', 'Skalkidou, A', 'Dessypris, N', 'Moustaki, M', 'Mantzoros, C', 'Spanos, E', 'Trichopoulos, D']","['Petridou E', 'Skalkidou A', 'Dessypris N', 'Moustaki M', 'Mantzoros C', 'Spanos E', 'Trichopoulos D']","['Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Athens University Medical School, Athens, Greece. epetrid@atlas.uoa.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/analysis', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/mortality']",2001/05/08 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/05/08 10:00'],"['2001/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['55326 [pii]', '10.1159/000055326 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2001;60(3):252-7. doi: 10.1159/000055326.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

Although we could not detect the TLS/FUS-ERG fusion transcripts by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in pre-BMT remission phase, they were clearly detectable in bone marrow cells obtained 6 months after transplantation with no translocation detected by conventional cytogenetics. We consider that even high-dose chemotherapy with BMT may not be effective in the eradication of this type of leukemia, and that the detection of minimal residual disease possibly contributes to the better planning of the therapeutic strategy.","['Okoshi, Y', 'Shimizu, S', 'Kojima, H', 'Obara, N', 'Mukai, H Y', 'Komeno, T', 'Hasegawa, Y', 'Mori, N', 'Nagasawa, T']","['Okoshi Y', 'Shimizu S', 'Kojima H', 'Obara N', 'Mukai HY', 'Komeno T', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Mori N', 'Nagasawa T']","['Division of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Platelet Count', 'Radiotherapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Failure']",2001/05/08 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/08 10:00'],"['2001/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['46532 [pii]', '10.1159/000046532 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2001;105(1):45-8. doi: 10.1159/000046532.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

Because CNS gliomas rarely metastasize, they represent an attractive target for gene therapy through local gene delivery. Here we report on the use of two different fusogenic membrane glycoproteins (FMGs), the measles virus proteins F and H (MV-F and MV-H) and a mutated form of the retroviral envelope protein of the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV.fus), as a novel class of therapeutic transgenes in gliomas. Transfection of U87 and U118 cells with MV-F and MV-H cDNA or GALV.fus cDNA led in 48 hr to massive syncytial formation followed by cell death. FMG-mediated cytotoxicity in the U87 and U118 cell lines was superior to the cytotoxicity caused by transfection with HSV-tk cDNA followed by ganciclovir (GCV) treatment at all time points. At high-density cell seeding, addition of tumor cells transfected with MV-F and H killed at least 1 log more cells than by HSV-tk + GCV treatment, indicating higher bystander effect. Similar results were obtained with GALV.fus. The mechanism of syncytial death in cultured glioma cell lines was predominantly apoptotic. Transfection of U87 cells with F + H or GALV.fus expression constructs completely suppressed their tumorigenicity. Treatment of established U87 xenografts in nude mice with a combination of F and H adenoviruses at 1:1 ratio led to complete tumor regression, significantly higher antitumor effect, and prolongation of survival as compared with control animals treated with a GFP adenovirus. In summary, the viral fusogenic membrane glycoproteins (GALV and the MV-F + MV-H combination) are potent therapeutic transgenes with potential utility in the gene therapy of gliomas.","['Galanis, E', 'Bateman, A', 'Johnson, K', 'Diaz, R M', 'James, C D', 'Vile, R', 'Russell, S J']","['Galanis E', 'Bateman A', 'Johnson K', 'Diaz RM', 'James CD', 'Vile R', 'Russell SJ']","['Medical Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. galanis.evanthia@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Hemagglutinins, Viral)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (hemagglutinin protein G, measles virus)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Fusion', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Giant Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Glioma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Hemagglutinins, Viral/adverse effects/genetics/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Measles virus/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/adverse effects/genetics/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Transgenes/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/adverse effects/*genetics/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",2001/05/08 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/08 10:00'],"['2001/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303401750148766 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 May 1;12(7):811-21. doi: 10.1089/104303401750148766.,['CA 84388-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoic acid-induced differentiation in the embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line NCR-G3 triggers concurrent induction of apoptosis. Using this system, which serves as a model of early embryogenesis, the expression of various bcl-2-related genes was analyzed as these genes display either positive or negative regulatory effects on apoptosis. EAT/mcl-1, an antiapoptotic bcl-2-related gene and immediate early gene, was dramatically expressed at an early stage of NCR-G3 differentiation. Bcl-xL, another antiapoptotic gene, was induced at a middle stage of differentiation and then gradually decreased to basal level. Expression of Bax, a proapoptotic molecule, was detected at a high level and remained relatively constant. Meanwhile, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xS were below detectable levels throughout the various stages of differentiation. As the balance of bcl-2 genes is a crucial regulatory step in apoptosis, the results suggest that EAT and Bax likely regulate apoptosis in the early stages of differentiation. In later stages of differentiation, down-regulation of EAT was found to coincide with a gradual increase in apoptosis of NCR-G3 cells. Furthermore, use of the monoclonal antibody (3A2) specific to EAT revealed that EAT is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane in human EC cells. In addition, EAT immunoreactivity was not detected in apoptotic NCR-G3 cells while it was observed in nearly all viable cells. The findings suggest that rapid induction of EAT may prevent NCR-G3 cells from undergoing apoptosis, thereby supporting viability at the early stage of differentiation.","['Sano, M', 'Umezawa, A', 'Abe, H', 'Akatsuka, A', 'Nonaka, S', 'Shimizu, H', 'Fukuma, M', 'Hata , J']","['Sano M', 'Umezawa A', 'Abe H', 'Akatsuka A', 'Nonaka S', 'Shimizu H', 'Fukuma M', 'Hata J']","['Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Body Patterning/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*embryology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2001/05/08 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/08 10:00'],"['2001/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2001.5203 [doi]', 'S0014482701952036 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 May 15;266(1):114-25. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5203.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

By fixing chiral conformation on carbon numbers 2 and 3 in the ceramide structure, four chiral C2-ceramides naming d-erythro-, l-erythro-, d-threo- and l-threo C2-ceramide were synthesized. We have investigated the chiral effects of these C2-ceramides on the sphingolipid metabolism, particularly on both the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway and on the degradation pathway. In both HL-60 and U937 cells, the chiral C2-ceramide (10 microM) showed sphingosine accumulation monitored fluoromatrically by a high performance liquid chromatographic separation of the sphingoid bases. Most importantly, in HL-60 cells, l-erythro C2-ceramide induced a 50 fold increase in sphingosine as compared to the control, while l-threo C2-ceramide exhibited a minimal 7-fold increase. In contrast, sphinganine, another sphingoid base, showed less accumulation by any chiral C2-ceramide tested under the same conditions. These results suggested that chiral C2-ceramide primarily acts on the sphingolipid degradation pathway rather than on the sphingolipid biosynthetic route. The strong G0/G1 phase arrest in the cell cycle by treatment of l-erythro C2-ceramide indicates that the blockade of the sphingolipid degradation pathway might be concomitantly involved in the dysfunction of the cell cycle. On the other hand, the fact that all chiral C2-ceramides tested failed to inhibit the activity of sphingosine kinase acting on the removal of sphingosine by producing sphingosine-l-phosphate demonstrates that chiral C2- ceramides may increase sphingosine by activating various ceramidases by which natural ceramides are divided into sphingosine and free fatty acids. However, the precise steps involved in this interaction are still unknown.","['Baek, M Y', 'Yoo, H S', 'Nakaya, K', 'Moon, D C', 'Lee, Y M']","['Baek MY', 'Yoo HS', 'Nakaya K', 'Moon DC', 'Lee YM']","['College of Pharmacy, Chungbuk National University, Chongju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Sphingolipids)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ceramides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2001/05/08 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/05/08 10:00'],"['2001/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02976482 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2001 Apr;24(2):144-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02976482.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most recently published figures show that between 1972-96, a total of 106 children contracted leukaemia when 81 cases would have been expected in the under 14s. Within ten kilometres of the nuclear establishments at Aldermaston and Burghfield, the risk of a child getting leukaemia, which is very small (400 children a year in the UK) is none the less doubled in under-fives meaning that one more child a year is affected. There is also an increased incidence of all cancers in this age group and geographical area. Theories as to why this should be abound, but until the cause of cancer is fully understood, and what the part of radiation in the process could be, no firm measures can be taken to redress the balance.","['Barton, C']",['Barton C'],['Oxford and Anglia Multi-Research Ethics Committee.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Med Confl Surviv,"Medicine, conflict, and survival",9612305,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Power Plants', 'Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Wales/epidemiology']",2001/05/08 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/08 10:00'],"['2001/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13623690108409554 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Confl Surviv. 2001 Jan-Mar;17(1):48-55. doi: 10.1080/13623690108409554.,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An advantage of using mRNA is that protein expression can be achieved in post-mitotic or quiescent cells where there is usually little or no gene expression with non-viral DNA delivery systems. Furthermore, the cleavage of mRNA by catalytic RNA molecules, or ribozymes, is a useful strategy to downregulate aberrant gene expression. The purpose of this review is to provide an update of current applications that use RNA molecules such as mRNA and ribozymes as a basis for gene therapy strategies targeting the initiation and progression of cancer.

At least one mass was observed on the skin of all three patients. A 17-year-old boy had masses in each temporal region that were accompanied by bilateral facial paralysis. He was administered chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but he died of infection secondary to a second relapse 29 months after the initial diagnosis. A 17-year-old girl had a tumor in the right parotid area. She received chemotherapy, but she died of infection and bleeding 2 months after the initial diagnosis. A 33-year-old man had numerous tumors widely disseminated over his skin. He received chemotherapy and was in remission 12 months after the initial diagnosis, but he eventually relapsed and died. Granulocytic sarcoma can be localized in unexpected regions, including the head and neck. This tumor is very often misdiagnosed as a malignant lymphoma, which leads to delayed treatment and a poor outcome. Therefore, clinical and histopathologic findings should be evaluated before any diagnosis of malignant lymphoma is pronounced. Immunohistochemical stains should also be performed on patients with suspected granulocytic sarcoma, and aggressive chemotherapy or immunotherapy should be administered. We believe that high-dose chemotherapy can improve survival rates in granulocytic sarcoma associated with AML.","['Cankaya, H', 'Ugras, S', 'Dilek, I']","['Cankaya H', 'Ugras S', 'Dilek I']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Yuzuncu Yil University Medical Faculty, 65200 Van, Turkey. hcankaya2@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ear Nose Throat J,"Ear, nose, & throat journal",7701817,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Facial Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Facial Paralysis/etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Parotid Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2001/05/08 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/08 10:00'],"['2001/05/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Ear Nose Throat J. 2001 Apr;80(4):224-6, 228-9.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed nitrate exposure from 1955 through 1988 using public databases for municipal water supplies in Iowa (quartile cutpoints: 0.36, 1.01, and 2.46 mg per liter nitrate-nitrogen). As no individual water consumption data were available, we assigned each woman an average level of exposure calculated on a community basis; no nitrate data were available for women using private wells. Cancer incidence (N = 3,150 cases) from 1986 through 1998 was determined by linkage to the Iowa Cancer Registry. For all cancers, there was no association with increasing nitrate in drinking water, nor were there clear and consistent associations for non-Hodgkin lymphoma; leukemia; melanoma; or cancers of the colon, breast, lung, pancreas, or kidney. There were positive associations for bladder cancer [relative risks (RRs) across nitrate quartiles = 1, 1.69, 1.10, and 2.83] and ovarian cancer (RR = 1, 1.52, 1.81, and 1.84), and inverse associations for uterine cancer (RR = 1, 0.86, 0.86, and 0.55) and rectal cancer (RR = 1, 0.72, 0.95, and 0.47) after adjustment for a variety of cancer risk/protective factors, agents that affect nitrosation (smoking, vitamin C, and vitamin E intake), dietary nitrate, and water source.

This improved PERT assay is easy to perform and is able to detect minute amounts of purified RT, as well as RT in crude cell lysates and concentrated culture supernatants.","['Voisset, C', 'Tonjes, R R', 'Breyton, P', 'Mandrand, B', 'Paranhos-Baccala, G']","['Voisset C', 'Tonjes RR', 'Breyton P', 'Mandrand B', 'Paranhos-Baccala G']","[""Unite Mixte de Recherche 2142 CNRS-bioMerieux, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 46, allee d'Italie, 69364 Cedex 07, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', '86834-22-2 (polydeoxyadenylic acid-polythymidylic acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Culture Media', 'DNA', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Mice', '*Polydeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*analysis/genetics', '*Retroviridae', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2001/05/05 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/05/05 10:00'],"['2001/05/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0166093401002555 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(01)00255-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2001 May;94(1-2):187-93. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(01)00255-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fully suitable classification does not exist. The goal of our study was to determine common and different signs of MD and MP type of CMML and to observe frequency of shifts from MD to MP-CMML. Sixty nine CMML patients were divided according to FAB proposal into two groups: 31 patients into the MD group (WBC < or = 13 x 10(9)/l) and 38 patients into the MP group (WBC < or = 13 x 10(9)/l). Presenting features and the course of the disease in both groups were evaluated. The median age of patients was not different in both groups (71.5 and 74 years, respectively), male/female ratio was 1.1 and 2.4, respectively. The median follow-up time was 15.5 months (1-58.8) in MP group and 24 months (2-118) in MD group. In MP group splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, abnormal karyotype and skin involvement were found more often than in MD group. Median LDH value was higher in MP group. Probability of survival was higher in the MD group than in MP group (median 30 and 11 months, respectively). Leukaemia transformation frequency was similar in both groups. In 12 out of 24 (50%) MD group patients WBC increased during the course of the disease over 13 x 10(9)/l. Oscillation of WBC values below and over 13 x 10(9)/l was observed in three patients. During the follow-up time number of patients with splenomegaly and/or immature granulocytes in the PB increased. After inclusion of 12 patients who shifted from MD to MP group a new CMML group resulted characterised by longer median survival (17 months) due to a higher number of patients in an earlier stage of the disease. Failure of evolution of myeloproliferative signs and lower frequency of AL in the remaining group might be explained by an early stage of CMML, untimely deaths due to unrelated causes and/or by patients suffering of RA with monocytosis rather than of CMML. In summary, our data suggest, that evolution from MD-CMML to MP-CMML is a frequent event and that MD-CMML could be the early stage of CMML in most of cases. The WBC at diagnosis as the single criterion for subclassification of CMML does not seem to be fully justified. We propose that CMML should not be divided in MD and MP types and that monitoring of patients and search for other signs of myeloproliferation such as PB immature granulocytes, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, skin involvement, pleural or peritoneal effusions, spontaneous growth of CFU-GM in vitro should be taken in consideration for a better classification of CMML, which would have an impact on the therapeutic approach.","['Voglova, J', 'Chrobak, L', 'Neuwirtova, R', 'Malaskova, V', 'Straka, L']","['Voglova J', 'Chrobak L', 'Neuwirtova R', 'Malaskova V', 'Straka L']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital, 50 005, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*classification/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/mortality', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",2001/05/05 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/05 10:00'],"['2001/05/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00159-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00159-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Jun;25(6):493-9. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00159-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C-terminally truncated STAT isoforms (STATbeta), as opposed to the full length form (STATalpha), have a competitive or even transdominant negative effect on gene induction mediated by the STAT pathway. We have previously demonstrated that while constitutively active STAT proteins were detected in ten of 36 (28%) for STAT3 and eight of 36 (22%) for STAT5 in pretreatment samples from newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, a significantly larger fraction of samples [21 of 27 (78%)] expressed STATbeta proteins. To determine whether STATbeta expression was maintained or increased after relapse in AML, we compared STAT activity and isoform expression at diagnosis and at relapse in 17 patients. In this selected group, constitutively active STAT3 was detected in 13 of 17 (76%) AML samples at diagnosis but was detected in only four of these patients at relapse. Constitutively active STAT5 was detected in three of 17 (18%) AML samples at diagnosis; but only two at relapse. In contrast, STATbeta protein expression was observed in 12 of the 17 pretreatment samples (71%) and in 16 of 17 samples at relapse. Only one patient did not express STATbeta at relapse.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine, induces a robust and sustained activation of STAT3 in M1 acute myeloid leukemia cells, which in turn undergo growth arrest, terminal differentiation and apoptosis in response to IL-6. The roles of STAT3 activation in IL-6-mediated responses in M1 cells are not fully understood. We introduced STAT3 antisense cDNA into M1 cells. STAT3 antisense cDNA blocked the expression and IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of STAT3, and resulted in reduction of both IL-6-induced growth arrest at G(0)/G(1) phase and macrophage differentiation in the M1 transformants. This observation is in accordance with previous reports and confirms that STAT3 plays an essential role in IL-6-induced growth arrest and terminal differentiation in M1 leukemia cells. On the other hand, STAT3 antisense cDNA augmented IL-6-induced apoptosis of M1 cells, which was supported by the cell cycle assay, DNA fragmentation assay and detection of the p17 active fragment of Caspase 3. As proliferation inhibition and differentiation induction stands for a negative signal, while survival maintenance stands for a positive signal, we conclude that STAT3 exerts two-way regulation on the biological effects of IL-6 in M1 leukemia cells.","['Zhang, J', 'Shen, B', 'Li, Y', 'Sun, Y']","['Zhang J', 'Shen B', 'Li Y', 'Sun Y']","['Department of Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, 27 Taiping Road, PO Box 130 (3), 100850, Beijing, PR China. jiyanzhang@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/05 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/05 10:00'],"['2001/05/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00157-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00157-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Jun;25(6):463-72. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00157-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that the growth of leukemia cells in colony and liquid cultures was inhibited by KH (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/l) after treatment for 7 days. The percentages of NBT and NSAE positive cells were 71.17 and 79.25%, respectively, after treatment with KH (10(-8)-10(-6) mol/l) for 5 days. The morphology of treated leukemia cells was identified to be macrophage-like and these cells acquired significant ACP activities. It was indicated that the ACP enzyme activities were increased as high as two and three times of the control, respectively, after treatment with 10(-8) or 10(-5) mol/l KH for 6 days. It was also indicated by DNA fragmentation in gel electrophoresis that WEHI-3B cells were induced toward apoptosis by KH (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/l) when checked at day 5. The c-myc mRNA expressions in WEHI-3B cells were decreased by 58.7% after treatment with KH (10(-8) mol/l) for 5 days. Therefore, it is first reported here that KH, a novel 2-aminosteroid, could suppress proliferation and induce differentiation of WEHI-3B leukemia cells. These differentiated cells were mature macrophage-like cells and showed characteristics of functional phagocytes acquired with acid phosphatase activity. The mechanisms underlying the above effects involved the apoptosis of WEHI-3B leukemia cells and the down-regulation of c-myc oncogene expression. It is also shown that the counts of immature granulocytes and monocytes were significantly decreased in both peripheral blood and bone marrow of BALB/c leukemia mice after KH was administrated per os for 7 consecutive days with four doses (5, 10, 15 or 20 mg/kg day), respectively.

Compound 2 was converted to its thiomidazolide derivative (3). Compounds 1 and 3 were found to induce apoptotic cell death in human T-cell leukemia lines and to interfere with their cell cycle, arresting cells at G(0/1) phase. Apoptosis can involve the activation and/or suppression of critical genes such as c-myc whose reduction or its inappropriate expression can be associated with induction of cell death and bcl-2 whose activation prevents apoptosis in the latter case. In order to detect any concomitant effect (1 and 3) upon c-myc and bcl-2 oncogene expression, we performed Western blot analysis to determine the levels of expression of these two genes upon treatment with the above compounds. Western blot analysis showed that of c-myc proto-oncogene levels were markedly reduced before massive apoptosis ensued in H33AJ-JA1 and MOLT3 cells, while bcl-2 expression remained unaffected.

In this study we investigated the mechanisms of ATP-induced cytotoxicity in a human leukemic cell line (U-937). ATP added as a single dose exceeding 50 microM was cytostatic or even cytotoxic for U-937 cells. Interestingly, growth inhibition by ATP (50-3500 microM) showed a biphasic dose response. Up to 800 microM, ATP was cytotoxic in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50) 90 microM). In a range between 800 and 2500 microM, cell count was markedly higher despite the higher ATP concentrations. The cytotoxic effect of ATP could be antagonized by addition of uridine as a pyrimidine source and, alternatively, by addition of the nucleoside transmembrane inhibitor dipyridamole. The apoptosis-inducing adenosine A(3) receptor was not involved in measurable quantities, since (1) adenosine did not lead to an elevation of intracellular calcium levels, and (2) an unselective A(1-3) antagonist (ULS-II-80) could not abrogate the cytotoxic effect. Experiments monitoring extracellular nucleotide metabolism confirmed the assumption that the long-term production and continuous uptake of adenosine, which is extracellularly generated by degradation of ATP, led to an intracellular nucleotide imbalance with pyrimidine starvation. The biphasic dose response to higher ATP concentrations could be explained by the rapid degradation of lower ATP concentrations (300 microM) to adenosine by serum-derived enzymes, whereas higher concentrations (900 microM) only produced small amounts of adenosine due to forward inhibition of AMP hydrolysis by prolonged high ADP levels. FACS analysis revealed that at lower adenosine concentrations (300 microM) a reversible G(1) phase arrest of the cell cycle was induced, whereas higher concentrations (1000 microM) triggered apoptosis. Considering ATP as a potential cytostatic drug, our data have important implications concerning metabolic interactions of administered nucleotides.","['Schneider, C', 'Wiendl, H', 'Ogilvie, A']","['Schneider C', 'Wiendl H', 'Ogilvie A']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. christian.schneider@med3.imed.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A3)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'K8CXK5Q32L (pyrimidine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists', 'Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'Receptor, Adenosine A3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/05 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/05 10:00'],"['2001/05/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0167488901000696 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(01)00069-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001 Apr 23;1538(2-3):190-205. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(01)00069-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this method followed by gel filtration, we isolated multi-ubiquitinated proteins with high molecular masses (>30 kDa) and also ubiquitinthioester-linked and mono-ubiquitinated forms of ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes, UbcH7 and UBE2N, together with mono-, di- and tri-ubiquitin molecules, from the cytoplasmic extract of heat-shock-treated K562 erythroleukaemia cells. We also demonstrated that the FK2 antibody was capable of precipitating a ubiquitin-UbcH7 thioester, but not free UbcH7, which enabled the measurement of the respective cellular levels separately. The immunoprecipitable ubiquitin-UbcH7 thioester was found only when the cells were treated with heat-shock.

Its clinical course is characterised by thomboembolic and, less frequently, by haemorrhagic complications. Life expectancy of ET is generally of normal length and progression to acute leukaemia is a rare event. About one third of all patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis and many of them remain without complications for years. Therefore, the main challenge for treating patients with ET is to select patients who will benefit from a cytoreductive or antiplatelet therapy, because it is doubtful whether the beneficial effects of therapy outweigh the potential hazards in all cases. For this reason a risk stratification in high and low risk ET patients is essential. The treatment of ET has evolved from alkylating agents to hydroxyurea (HU) or pipobroman and more recently to agents such as IFN-alpha and anagrelide. Aspirin as an antiplatelet therapy is also expected to play a part in the treatment of ET. HU is first-line therapy for elderly patients with high risk ET. In young ET patients without ET related complications and a platelet count << 1000 - 1500 x 10(9)/l abstention from cytoreductive therapy or therapy with low-dose aspirin alone seems to be appropriate.

Expression of c-raf-1 modifies cell growth, proliferation and survival. Although expression of c-raf-1 has been studied in several tumors, the role of c-raf-1 in leukemia is so far unclear. We examined the expression of c-raf-1 in the human leukemia cell lines U937 and K562, and in a cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C)-resistant cell line (K562AC) derived from K562. Expression of c-raf-1 was increased in U937 and in Ara-C-resistant K562AC cells compared with the parental cells. We then investigated whether inhibition of c-raf-1 expression by antisense oligonucleotides increases the sensitivity to Ara-C in U937 and K562AC cells. Antisense oligonucleotides for c-raf-1 inhibited expression of c-raf-1 mRNA, but did not affect cell growth and increased sensitivity to Ara-C but not to other drugs such as adriamycin, VP-16 or vincristine. These results suggest that c-raf-1 is one of the factors involved in Ara-C resistance in leukemia and lend weight to the case for development of anti-cancer therapeutics involving oncogene-targeted antisense oligonucleotides.","['Funato, T', 'Kozawa, K', 'Fujimaki, S', 'Kaku, M']","['Funato T', 'Kozawa K', 'Fujimaki S', 'Kaku M']","['Division of Molecular Diagnostics, Department of Clinical Medicine, Tohoku University, School of Medicine, Seiryoumachi 1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8574, Japan. tfunato@mail.cc.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'U937 Cells/cytology/drug effects']",2001/05/04 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/05/04 10:00'],"['2001/05/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200104000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2001 Apr;12(4):325-9. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200104000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although exposure to AC has been described to affect the ultrastructural appearance of large granular lymphocytes and to temporarily inhibit cytolytic activity of PBMC preparations, the cellular basis of this phenomenon has not been studied. Here, the inhibitory effect of AC on human CTL and NK-mediated cytotoxicity has been analyzed in 4-h 51Cr-release assays. The results show that NK killing of K562 leukemia cells and xenogeneic endothelial cells is inhibited by AC exposure. The effect is dose-dependent and reversible, because recovery of cytotoxicity is observed within 15 h of re-culturing. AC does not reduce the viability of NK cells and the inhibitory effect is not mediated by the exhaustive release of granzymes upon AC treatment. In contrast, antigen-specific CTL killing of EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and xenogeneic PHA lymphoblasts was less sensitive to AC and data are presented suggesting that FasL-induced apoptosis is not inhibited by AC. In conclusion, perforin-mediated NK killing is AC-sensitive whereas CTL killing and FasL-mediated killing appear to be AC-resistant. Therefore, AC represents a powerful tool to study different mechanisms of cell-mediated cytotoxicity and may be helpful in assessing antigen-specific CTL cytotoxicity without the influence of NK cell-mediated background killing.","['Brander, C', 'Matter-Reissmann, U B', 'Jones, N G', 'Walker, B D', 'Sachs, D H', 'Seebach, J D']","['Brander C', 'Matter-Reissmann UB', 'Jones NG', 'Walker BD', 'Sachs DH', 'Seebach JD']","['AIDS Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology']",2001/05/04 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/05/04 10:00'],"['2001/05/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S002217590100326X [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00326-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2001 Jun 1;252(1-2):1-14. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00326-x.,"['5P01 AI39755/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL63430/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The telomere length serves as a mitotic clock determining the remaining replicative capacity of the cell. Telomeric sequences are lost during each cell division, leading to a process thought to contribute to senescence and cell death. The enzyme telomerase adds 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeats to the mammalian telomeres and maintains the telomere length. Telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells but telomerase activity is observed in malignancies. In this study telomerase activity was analyzed in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and lymphoma by PCR and ELISA. This approach combines highly specific amplification of the telomerase-mediated elongation products with nonradioactive detection in a highly sensitive photometric ELISA. The PCR products were also analyzed by Southern blotting. The telomerase-specific PCR products were seperated by electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane with subsequent detection of the biotinylated amplificates. High activity levels were detected in 17 CML ( 34%) patients. On the other hand, no activity was observed in lymphoma patients. An increase in the shorter telomeric bands was observed in CML patients who displayed a high level of telomerase activity. In contrast to the low enzyme activity, evidence of telomeric repeats were also found in some lymphoma patients by Southern blotting. This may indicate that lymphoma cells may make use of different pathways for maintaining the length of their telomeres.","['Bitisik, O', 'Yavuz, S', 'Yasasever, V', 'Dalay, N']","['Bitisik O', 'Yavuz S', 'Yasasever V', 'Dalay N']","['Istanbul University, Oncology Institute, Dept. of Basic Oncology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol,Research communications in molecular pathology and pharmacology,9437512,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/blood/*enzymology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/chemistry/*physiology']",2001/05/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/05/04 10:00'],"['2001/05/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/04 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 2000;107(1-2):3-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although not observable by conventionally employed techniques, such as PAGE and dimethyl sulfate (DMS) protection, the formation of such higher-order structures by this oligonucleotide was revealed by several techniques. These included capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE), which demonstrated the presence of molecules with greatly increased retention time compared with the monomer; magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, which demonstrated a band at 290 nm, a characteristic of antiparallel tetraplexes; and fluorescence energy transfer measurements. For the last, the 18-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was synthesized with a 5'-fluorescein group. Similar to the molecular beacon model, its fluorescence was quenched when combined in solution with tetraplex-forming oligomers that contained a 3'-Dabcyl moiety. 7-Deazaguanosine inhibits the formation of tetraplexes by eliminated Hoogsteen base pair interactions. The wild-type and 7-deazaguanosine-substituted antisense c-myb oligomers differentially downregulated the expression of the c-myb proto-oncogene in K562 and HL60 cells, with the wild-type oligomer being the least active.

Binding specificity appeared to be a combinatorial property of a number of residues within the C-terminal portion of Fv1.","['Bishop, K N', 'Bock, M', 'Towers, G', 'Stoye, J P']","['Bishop KN', 'Bock M', 'Towers G', 'Stoye JP']","['Division of Virology, National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Gene Deletion', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.11.5182-5188.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jun;75(11):5182-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.11.5182-5188.2001.,,,,,,,PMC114923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to AKV-type MuLV, Cas-E-type MuLV is not carried by common laboratory mice. Wild mice of Mus musculus (M. m.) castaneus carry multiple copies of Cas-E-type endogenous MuLV, including the Fv-4(r) gene that is a truncated form of integrated MuLV and functions as a host's resistance gene against ecotropic MuLV infection. Our genetic cross experiments showed that only the Fv-4(r) gene was associated with resistance to ecotropic F-MuLV infection. Because the spontaneous expression of infectious virus was not detected in M. m. castaneus, we generated mice that did not carry the Fv-4(r) gene but did carry a single or a few endogenous MuLV loci. In mice not carrying the Fv-4(r) gene, infectious MuLVs were isolated in association with three of six Cas-E-type endogenous MuLV loci. The isolated viruses showed a weak syncytium-forming activity for XC cells, an interfering property of ecotropic MuLV, and a slight antigenic variation. Two genomic DNAs containing endogenous Cas-E-type MuLV were cloned and partially sequenced. All of the Cas-E-type endogenous MuLVs were closely related, hybrid-type viruses with an ecotropic env gene and a xenotropic long terminal repeat.

Nearly all retroviruses, including amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1, are classified as pH independent. However, ecotropic MuLV is considered to be a pH-dependent virus. We have examined the infectious entry of ecotropic and amphotropic MuLVs and found that they were equally inhibited by NH4Cl and bafilomycin A. These agents inhibited both viruses only partially over the course of the experiments. Agents that block the acidification of endocytic vesicles also arrest vesicular trafficking. Thus, partial inhibition of the MuLVs could be the result of virus inactivation during arrest in this pathway. In support of this contention, we found that that the loss of infectivity of the MuLVs during treatment of target cells with the drugs closely corresponded to the loss of activity due to spontaneous inactivation at 37 degrees C in the same period of time. Furthermore, the drugs had no effect on the efficiency of infection under conditions in which the duration of infection was held to a very short period to minimize the effects of spontaneous inactivation. These results indicate that the infectious processes of both ecotropic and amphotropic MuLVs were arrested rather than aborted by transient treatment of the cells with the drugs. We also found that infectious viruses were efficiently internalized during treatment. This indicated that the arrest occurred in an intracellular compartment and that the infectious process of both the amphotropic and ecotropic MuLVs very likely involved endocytosis. An important aspect of this study pertains to the interpretation of experiments in which agents that block endocytic acidification inhibit infectivity. As we have found with the MuLVs, inhibition of infectivity may be secondary to the block of endocytic acidification. While this strongly suggests the involvement of an endocytic pathway, it does not necessarily indicate a requirement for an acidic compartment during the infectious process. Likewise, a lack of inhibition during transient treatment with the drugs would not preclude an endocytic pathway for viruses that are stable during the course of the treatment.","['Katen, L J', 'Januszeski, M M', 'Anderson, W F', 'Hasenkrug, K J', 'Evans, L H']","['Katen LJ', 'Januszeski MM', 'Anderson WF', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Evans LH']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Macrolides)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '116764-51-3 (bafilomycin A)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/virology', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eukaryotic Cells/drug effects/*virology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism/*pathogenicity', '*Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.11.5018-5026.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Jun;75(11):5018-26. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.11.5018-5026.2001.,,,,,,,PMC114905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Published results show considerable discrepancies although studies of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing high doses of cranial radiotherapy report short- and long-term loss of cognitive ability. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of BMT and the effect of anxiety on the pre-BMT assessment in a group of children with severe hematological disease treated in our center. METHODS: We performed a descriptive, prospective, longitudinal study of 54 children, aged 4-15 years, who were treated between 1987 and 1995. Twenty-two children were evaluated before and after BMT by means of the Weschler Intelligence Scale. To control for the effect of anxiety on the pre-BMT scores, the patients were divided into two groups according to the scores obtained in this test (group 1: IQ score 100; group 1: IQ100). RESULTS: Comparison of pre- and post-BMT scores for both groups revealed no significant differences. However, comparison of the results between groups revealed that group I scored lower in the post-BMT test than in the pre-BMT test while group I scored higher in the post-BMT test than in the pre-BMT test. CONCLUSIONS: Although comparison between the pre- and post-BMT results obtained from the whole sample showed no differences that indicated post-treatment sequelae, treatment-induced anxiety may have influenced the pre-BMT score.","['Daniel Llach, M', 'Perez Campdepadros, M', 'Baza Ceballos, N', 'Igual Brull, L', 'Badell Serra, I', 'Puig Reichach, T', 'Cubells Riero, J']","['Daniel Llach M', 'Perez Campdepadros M', 'Baza Ceballos N', 'Igual Brull L', 'Badell Serra I', 'Puig Reichach T', 'Cubells Riero J']","['Servicio de Pediatria.

Previous studies have reported excess risk of some cancers but have been limited by small numbers or little information on employment characteristics. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort mortality study among 7,789 Philadelphia firefighters employed between 1925 and 1986. For each cause of death, the standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. We also compared mortality among groups of firefighters defined by the estimated number of career runs and potential for diesel exposure. RESULTS: In comparison with U.S. white men, the firefighters had similar mortality from all causes of death combined (SMR = 0.96) and all cancers (SMR = 1.10). There were statistically significant deficits of deaths from nervous system diseases (SMR = 0.47), cerebrovascular diseases (SMR = 0.83), respiratory diseases (SMR = 0.67), genitourinary diseases (SMR = 0.54), all accidents (SMR = 0.72), and suicide (SMR = 0.66). Statistically significant excess risks were observed for colon cancer (SMR = 1.51) and ischemic heart disease (SMR = 1.09). The risks of mortality from colon cancer (SMR = 1.68), kidney cancer (SMR = 2.20), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SMR = 1.72), multiple myeloma (SMR = 2.31), and benign neoplasms (SMR = 2.54) were increased among firefighters with at least 20 years of service.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A 29-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia underwent SCT. Oral and lung CGVHD developed on approximately day 130, and dry eye associated with CGVHD was diagnosed on day 168. The patient began receiving cyclosporin A (150 mg/d) for the treatment of oral and lung CGVHD. Treatment with prednisolone (1 mg/kg/d) began on approximately day 300. Oral and lung GVHD improved slightly, but worsened again although systemic administration of cyclosporin A and prednisolone were continued. Cyclosporin A was discontinued, and systemic administration of FK506 was started on day 376. Forty-four days later, marked improvement in the ocular surface and other organs was observed. However, the dry eye worsened while tapering FK506, with no flare of other affected organs. A 43-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome underwent SCT. She received FK506 for prophylaxis of CGVHD. She had mild dry eye before SCT. Oral and intestinal CGVHD developed, and the dry eye worsened significantly on approximately day 150 while tapering FK506. Treatment with prednisolone (1 mg/kg/d) began, and the dose of FK506 was increased. By day 240, the symptoms of dry eye and the findings of the ocular surface markedly improved, and CGVHD in other organs was completely resolved. However, the improvement in the dry eye was lost when FK506 was tapered for the second time. CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of FK506 with corticosteroids is an effective treatment of severe dry eye in patients with CGVHD, but long-term administration may be required to achieve a lasting response. These cases also suggest that further investigation into the use of topical FK506 and prednisolone as a maintenance therapy should be pursued.","['Ogawa, Y', 'Okamoto, S', 'Kuwana, M', 'Mori, T', 'Watanabe, R', 'Nakajima, T', 'Yamada, M', 'Mashima, Y', 'Tsubota, K', 'Oguchi, Y']","['Ogawa Y', 'Okamoto S', 'Kuwana M', 'Mori T', 'Watanabe R', 'Nakajima T', 'Yamada M', 'Mashima Y', 'Tsubota K', 'Oguchi Y']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Division of Hematology, the Department of Medicine, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. yoko@med.keio.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cornea,Cornea,8216186,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*administration & dosage', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Prednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Tacrolimus/*administration & dosage']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003226-200105000-00020 [doi]'],ppublish,Cornea. 2001 May;20(4):430-4. doi: 10.1097/00003226-200105000-00020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, various protocols to quantify minimal residual disease in leukemia or lymphoma patients have been developed. These assays assume that PCR efficiencies are equal for all samples. Determining t(14;18) and albumin reaction efficiencies for sixteen follicular lymphoma patient samples revealed higher efficiencies for blood samples than for lymph node samples in general. However, within one sample both reactions had equivalent efficiencies. Differences in amplification efficiencies between patient samples (low efficiencies) and the calibrator in quantitative analyses result in the underestimation of residual disease in patient samples whereby the weakest positive patient samples are at highest error. Based on these findings for patient samples, the efficiency compensation control was developed. This control includes two reference reactions in a multiplex setting, specific for the beta-actin and albumin housekeeping genes that are present in a constant ratio within DNA templates. The difference in threshold cycle values for both reference reactions, ie, the Ct(2) value, is dependent on the amplification efficiency, and is used to compensate for efficiency differences between patient samples and the calibrator. The beta-actin reference reaction is also used to normalize for DNA input. Furthermore, the efficiency compensation control facilitates identification of patient samples that are so contaminated with PCR inhibitory compounds that different amplification reactions are affected to a different extent. Accurate quantitation of residual disease in these samples is therefore impossible with the current quantitative real-time PCR protocols. Identification and exclusion of these inadequate samples will be of utmost importance in quantitative retrospective studies, but even more so, in future molecular diagnostic analyses.","['Meijerink, J', 'Mandigers, C', 'van de Locht, L', 'Tonnissen, E', 'Goodsaid, F', 'Raemaekers, J']","['Meijerink J', 'Mandigers C', 'van de Locht L', 'Tonnissen E', 'Goodsaid F', 'Raemaekers J']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology/Hematology, Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. meyerink@kgk.fgg.eur.nl""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Albumins)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Albumins/genetics', 'Calibration', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-1578(10)60652-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60652-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2001 May;3(2):55-61. doi: 10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60652-6.,,['J Mol Diagn. 2001 Nov;3(4):189-90.

Deletion constructs were prepared from the region -1123/+42 to -20/+42, and putative regulatory sites were mutated. In all three cell lines, the two major regulatory elements for constitutive expression were the (-80)ets site and the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) half-site at -70. A protein from HEL and CHRF, but not HL60, nuclear extracts bound to the (-80)ets site. Another protein from all three cell lines bound to the (-70)CRE. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) increased expression of the reporter in HEL cells 2.5-3- and 4.5-fold, respectively, from all constructs except those with (-70)CRE mutations. PMA virtually eliminated expression of serglycin mRNA and promoter constructs, but dbcAMP increased expression in HL-60 cells. The effects of PMA and dbcAMP on promoter expression correlated with mRNA expression. The strengths of two DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the 5'-flanking region and the first intron in all three cells correlated with relative endogenous serglycin mRNA expression. An additional DNase I-hypersensitive site in HL60 DNA in the first intron may be related to the high serglycin expression in HL60 relative to HEL or CHRF cells.","['Schick, B P', 'Petrushina, I', 'Brodbeck, K C', 'Castronuevo, P']","['Schick BP', 'Petrushina I', 'Brodbeck KC', 'Castronuevo P']","['Cardeza Foundation for Hematologic Research, Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, 1015 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA. barbara.schick@mail.tju.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (serglycin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteoglycans/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M102958200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)79543-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jul 6;276(27):24726-35. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M102958200.

Conventional cytogenetic analysis, complemented by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is highly effective in the accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities. For the precise identification of specific genetic changes, molecular techniques may be applied. Chromosomal changes in ALL may be of structural or numerical type. A large number of established structural chromosomal rearrangements have now been described for which the genetic alterations and effect on prognosis are well known. These include t(9;22)(q34;q11) and BCR/ABL, rearrangements of 11q23 involving MLL, t(12;21)(p13;q22) with the ETV6/AML1 fusion, t(1;19)(q23;p13) with E2A/PBX1, t(8;14)(q24;q32) and the immunoglobulin genes. Genetic changes associated with T ALL are also known, although their effect on outcome is less pronounced. Rare chromosomal abnormalities are continually being discovered in small patient subgroups leading to the identification of new ALL associated genetic changes. Alterations in chromosome number have a strong impact on outcome in childhood ALL. The association of a high hyperdiploid karyotype (51-65 chromosomes) with a good prognosis has been known for more than 20 years. Conversely, the loss of chromosomes in the near-haploid group (23-28 chromosomes) indicates a poor outcome. New methods of cancer classification involving gene expression profiling may eventually supercede cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis and prediction of outcome in leukaemia. It is more likely that they will be used in a complementary approach alongside cytogenetic, FISH and molecular analysis to guide patient management in childhood ALL.","['Harrison, C J']",['Harrison CJ'],"['Leukaemia Research Fund/UK Cancer Cytogenetics Group Karyotype Database in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Royal Free and University College School of Medicine, Rowland Hill Street, London, UK. cjh@rfc.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/blre.2001.0150 [doi]', 'S0268-960X(01)90150-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2001 Mar;15(1):49-59. doi: 10.1054/blre.2001.0150.,,,,,,117,,,['Copyright 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The nuclear morphology was visualized by panoptic May-Grunwald/Giemsa staining and cytochemical method for DNA, nucleoli were visualized by cytochemical methods for the demonstration of RNA and silver stainable proteins including those of interphase silver stained nucleolus organizer regions (AgNORs). In most cells ALA-based photodynamic treatment (PDT) produced marked alterations such as formation of apoptotic bodies, and large condensation of nuclear chromatin structure but without nuclear segmentation. Such changes are in harmony with the apoptotic process induced in these cells but without previous terminal differentiation. In nucleoli ALA-based PDT produced the reduction and disappearance of nucleolar silver stainable particles (SSPs) representing AgNORs which apparently reflected the alteration of the nucleolar biosynthetic activity and cell proliferation. The latter is also reflected by the disappearance of mitotic divisions. On the other hand, a small subpopulation of cells was less sensitive or resistant to the ALA-based PDE since they did not show mentioned nuclear and nucleolar alterations.","['Smetana, K', 'Cajthamlova, H', 'Grebenova, D', 'Hrkal, Z']","['Smetana K', 'Cajthamlova H', 'Grebenova D', 'Hrkal Z']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. karel.smetana@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

Although some information is available regarding the cellular and molecular changes in lymphocytes exposed to microgravity, little is known about the erythroid cellular changes that may underlie the reduction in erythropoiesis and resultant anemia. We now report a reduction in erythroid growth and a profound inhibition of erythropoietin (Epo)-induced differentiation in a ground-based simulated microgravity model system. Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells were grown either in tissue culture vessels at 1 x g or in the simulated microgravity environment of the NASA-designed rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Logarithmic growth was observed under both conditions; however, the doubling time in simulated microgravity was only one-half of that seen at 1 x g. No difference in apoptosis was detected. Induction with Epo at the initiation of the culture resulted in differentiation of approximately 25% of the cells at 1 x g, consistent with our previous observations. In contrast, induction with Epo at the initiation of simulated microgravity resulted in only one-half of this degree of differentiation. Significantly, the growth of cells in simulated microgravity for 24 h prior to Epo induction inhibited the differentiation almost completely. The results suggest that the NASA RWV bioreactor may serve as a suitable ground-based microgravity simulator to model the cellular and molecular changes in erythroid cells observed in true microgravity.","['Sytkowski, A J', 'Davis, K L']","['Sytkowski AJ', 'Davis KL']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. asytkows@caregroup.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

This is thought to indicate that control mechanisms of intestinal apoptosis are gut segment-specific. Little is known on the expression of Bcl-2 homologs during gut development. In man, intestinal features and functions are acquired largely by mid-gestation (18-20 wks); the question whether segment-specific controls of intestinal apoptosis are also acquired early during development remains open. In the present study, we approached this by investigating the expression of six Bcl-2 homologs (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, Bax, Bak, Bad), and one nonhomologous associated molecule (Bag-1), during development of the human ileum and colon (12-20 wks of gestation). Beginning at 18 wks, we found that the epithelial localization of Bcl-2 homologs displayed differential patterns (or gradients) in both the ileum and colon; however, the patterns of some of the homologs differed between the two segments. For instance, Bag-1 and Bcl-2 exhibited crypt-villus decreasing gradients of expression in the ileum but not in the colon, whereas Mcl-1 displayed differing compartimentalizations between the two segments. Further analyses indicated that the steady-state expression levels of Bcl-2 homologs underwent modulations between 12 and 20 wks; however, the observed developmental profiles contrasted significantly between the two segments. For example, Bcl-2, Bag-1 and Bak levels increased in the colon, but the levels of these same homologs decreased in the ileum. Furthermore, by 18-20 wks, we found that the expression levels of each Bcl-2 homolog analyzed differed greatly between the ileum and colon. Altogether, these data indicate that the expression of Bcl-2 homologs is modulated differentially during human gut development in order to establish, by mid-gestation, distinct expression profiles for the small and large intestines. This in turn suggests that gut segment-specific control mechanisms of human intestinal apoptosis are acquired early during fetal life.","['Vachon, P H', 'Cardin, E', 'Harnois, C', 'Reed, J C', 'Plourde, A', 'Vezina, A']","['Vachon PH', 'Cardin E', 'Harnois C', 'Reed JC', 'Plourde A', 'Vezina A']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sherbrooke, QC, Canada. phvachon@courrier.usherb.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Colon/*embryology/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Ileum/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Morphogenesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-16.497 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2001 Apr;16(2):497-510. doi: 10.14670/HH-16.497.,,,,,,,,,,,10.14670/HH-16.497 [doi],,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to search for abnormal immunoprofiles of p53 and Rb growth control pathways and to determine the proliferative activity and the apoptotic index of TCL. Abnormal overexpression of p53, p21 and mdm2, in comparison to normal lymph nodes, was found in 12/57, 10/57 and 2/57 cases of TCL, respectively. Abnormal loss of Rb and p16 expression was found in 1/57 and 2/39 cases, respectively, whereas abnormal overexpression of cyclin D1 was not detected in any of the 57 cases. Our data revealed entity-related p53/p21/mdm2 phenotypes. Indeed, most nodal and cutaneous CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) showed concomitant overexpression of p53 and p21 proteins (7/8 cases), and mdm2 was overexpressed in 2 p53-positive nodal ALCL. In contrast, overexpression of p53 was found in 3/17 cases of nodal peripheral TCL unspecified (PTCL-UC) and 2/7 non-ALCL cutaneous pleomorphic TCL. Overexpression of p21 protein was detected in 2/3 p53-positive PTCL-UC and in 1/2 p53-positive non-ALCL cutaneous pleomorphic TCL. Finally, all the remaining 25 cases of TCL did not show p53 and p21 overexpression. Overall, the p53+/p21+ phenotype in 10/57 TCL suggests wild-type p53 capable of inducing p21 expression. The highest apoptotic index (AI) was found in ALCL and a positive correlation between apoptotic index and Ki67 index (p<0.001) was detected. Ki67, cyclin A and cyclin B1 expression was found in all 57 TCL and on the basis of the combined use of these 3 variables, 3 groups of proliferative activity could be determined: a) high in ALCL and T-LBL, b) low in mycosis fungoides (MF) and gammadelta hepatosplenic TCL, and c) intermediate in the remaining TCL entities. The proliferative activity in the 12 p53 overexpressing cases was higher in comparison to the 45 p53-negative cases. Ki67 expresion in more than 25% of tumour cells showed significant correlation with p53 overexpression (p<0.001).

Because of these potential applications of chitosan-PVP hydrogel, the present study was designed to investigate its effect on macrophage activation. Macrophages did not adhere to hydrogel in culture but maintained their viability and did not undergo apoptosis as confirmed by trypan blue staining and absence of DNA ladder. Hydrogel leach-out products did not exhibit cytotoxic effects on macrophage functionality at mitochondrial and lysosomal level as confirmed by tetrazolium reduction (MTT) and neutral red uptake (NRU) assay. On exposure to hydrogels, macrophages showed comparable expression of activation markers such as CDllb/CD18 (Mac-1), CD45, and CD14 to those cultured in the presence of PTFE, a known biocompatible control, indicating its nonactivating nature. Macrophage activation was also assessed by checking the level of messenger RNA of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which did not show stastistically significant difference (p > 0.05) in the expression of these transcripts in both control and hydrogel-exposed macrophages. The nonimmunogenic nature of the hydrogel was further confirmed by the lack of induced proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes after exposure to hydrogel leach-outs. All these results point out that chitosan-PVP hydrogel did not activate macrophages and thus is immunocompatible. Our results indicate that this hydrogel could be a potential candidate for transplantation studies by virtue of its biocompatibility and imunocompatibility.","['Risbud, M', 'Bhonde, M', 'Bhonde, R']","['Risbud M', 'Bhonde M', 'Bhonde R']","['Tissue Engineering and Banking Laboratory, National Centre for Cell Science, Ganeshkhind, Pune, India. mrisbud@nccs.res.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,"['0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hydrogels)', '1398-61-4 (Chitin)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biocompatible Materials/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chitin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Chitosan', 'Cytokines/analysis/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hydrogels', 'Leukemia P388', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Povidone/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2001 Mar-Apr;10(2):195-202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 306 chicken and 59 turkey commercial flocks, submitted for differential avian oncogenic virus diagnosis, served to evaluate the flock mixed virus infection rate, the rate of birds with a multiple virus infection, and the issue of retroviral LTR integration into MDV in vivo. About a quarter of the tumor-bearing commercial flocks carried a mixed MDV and retrovirus infection. A total of 2926 DNA samples were analyzed, including 2428 chicken and 498 turkey DNA samples. Of these, 991 DNAs originated from flocks with a multiple virus infection. In 103 DNA preparations from that group (103/991, 10.4%), including 38 and 56 from chicken blood and tumor tissues, respectively, and nine samples from turkey blood, multiple virus sequences were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fifty-six of the 103 samples were further analyzed by the previously developed hot spot-combined (HS-cPCR assay, of which 48% (27/56) contained chimeric MDV and retroviral LTR molecules. When extrapolated to the total samples derived from the flocks with multiple virus infection, that rate implies that about 5% of the DNA samples would carry MDV-retrovirus integration events. Several birds held a variety of chimeric molecules, indicating that several recombination events occurred simultaneously. The validation of the MDV and retroviral LTR chimeric constitution of these molecules was derived by the MDV and retroviral heterologous primers used for their creation by the HS-cPCR assay, Southern blotting and their detection by retroviral LTR probes, and LTR amplification from the gel-purified chimeric molecules. From several molecules, the LTR was sequenced, and a 161-bp retroviral LTR sequence was demonstrated. Our biochemical data imply that a recent integration occurred in the birds.

Our progress in understanding and treating childhood malignancies is one of the success stories in paediatrics and in cancer biology and management. In the Nordic countries, about three of four children with cancer are cured, but the progress is different in different disease groups. For some malignancies, survival is close to 100%, while progress for other types have been much slower. However, cancer is still the main cause of death in children above one year of age who die of a disease. The progress has its price. The treatment is often intensive, with great morbidity and a definite mortality. Late effects are also of great concern. A more specific therapy targeted against the malignant cell, with less damage to normal cells, has long been our goal. Progress in recent years in the understanding of the malignant cells has now given the first definite examples that such targeted therapy may soon become a reality.","['Lie, S O']",['Lie SO'],['Barneklinikken Rikshospitalet 0027 Oslo. sverre.olaf.lie@rikshospitalet.no'],['nor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', '*Neoplasms/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['292474 [pii]'],ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2001 Mar 20;121(8):951-5.,,,,,"Barn med kreft--store fremskritt, mange gleder og noen skuffelser.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was originally from the Carribean island of Grenada. The disease had started two years before and was diagnosed as lupus erythematosus, polymorphic light eruption and atopic eczema. Physical examination showed skin-colored papules all over the integument, sebostasis and enlarged supraclavicular and inguinal lymph nodes. INVESTIGATIONS: Lymphocyte count was elevated with 58% as well as LDH (322 U/l) and gamma GT (133 U/l). In a blood smear characteristic pleomorphic lymphoid cells (flower cells) could be obtained. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated a subepidermally located infiltrate of pleomorphic lymphocytes with epidermal involvement. HTLV-I/II serology (ELISA-screening test) was positive. Polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed HTLV-specific sequences. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Diagnosis of adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia was obtained. Treatment consisted of interferon alpha 2b and zidovudine which resulted in a rapid response. However, as a result of an increased loss of weight (12 kg) this therapy was stopped. Two weeks later generalized lymphadenopathy and disseminated skin lesions were observed. Chemotherapy (CHOP-scheme) was initiated. The patient deceased with signs of an acute leukemia after a short period. CONCLUSIONS: Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia is a rare disease in Europe.

Photosensitized damage to K562 leukemia cells from cis-di(4-sulfonatophenyl)diphenylporphine, hypericin and protoporphyrin IX was inhibited by GRP-carotenal under conditions where beta-apo-8'-carotenal, beta-carotene and crocetin were ineffective. The unique cytoprotective properties of GRP-carotenal, relative to the other carotenoids studied, could not be explained by the differences in the cell content of the various carotenoids or by the changes in the cell content of the photosensitizers used. Photosensitizer fluorescence from labeled K562 cells was reduced by GRP-carotenal but not by the other carotenoids studied. The novel photoprotective properties of GRP-carotenal may be due to its subcellular distribution. In photosensitizer-containing detergent micelles, novel properties of GRP-carotenal were not apparent. None of the carotenoids studied reduced photosensitizer fluorescence or singlet-oxygen generation. Singlet-oxygen quenching by GRP-carotenal and by beta-apo-8'-carotenal were roughly the same. Crocetin has a singlet-oxygen quenching constant that is about a factor of five lower. Singlet-oxygen quenching by beta-carotene was limited by its aggregation.","['Kanofsky, J R', 'Sima, P D']","['Kanofsky JR', 'Sima PD']","['Medical Service, Edward Hines Jr., Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital, Hines, IL, USA. jeff.kanofsky@med.va.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (GRP-carotenal)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (di(4-sulfonatophenyl)diphenylporphine)', '0 (trans-sodium crocetinate)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)', '7V2F1075HD (hypericin)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'V22N3E2U32 (apocarotenal)']",IM,"['Anthracenes', 'Carotenoids/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxygen/chemistry', 'Perylene/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Photochemistry', 'Photosensitizing Agents/toxicity', 'Porphyrins/toxicity', 'Protoporphyrins/toxicity', 'Singlet Oxygen', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Vitamin A/analogs & derivatives']",2001/05/03 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/05/03 10:00'],"['2001/05/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0349:gsrpdo>2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2001 Apr;73(4):349-58. doi: 10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0349:gsrpdo>2.0.co;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of lymphomatoid granulomatosis with onset after the completion of chemotherapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two months after treatment ended, the 7-year-old girl developed splenomegaly, cervical adenopathy, and bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates. She improved on cefotaxime but experienced a seizure 1 month later. A computed tomography scan of the head was normal, but her pulmonary infiltrates had become nodular. A computed tomography-guided biopsy of 1 of the nodules revealed cellular interstitial pneumonitis. One month later, she had persistent pulmonary infiltrates, marked splenomegaly, and new seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed cerebral nodules. Itraconazole was begun, and the pulmonary infiltrates resolved. Five months after her initial symptoms, she developed tonic pupil and a decreased level of consciousness. Dexamethasone was initiated. Needle biopsies of the brain were carried out, yielding the diagnosis of severe chronic inflammatory changes focally consistent with granuloma. The child redeveloped splenomegaly and fever, and then suffered an acute decompensation with hypoxemia, tachypnea, splenomegaly, and cardiac gallop. Open-lung biopsy revealed lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Lymphoma-directed therapy was initiated, and the patient had complete resolution of pulmonary and cerebral nodules 5 months later. No intrathecal chemotherapy was administered, and radiation therapy was not necessary. Neuropsychological testing obtained after completion of therapy revealed an improvement in attention, coordination, and fine motor speed over time. She is now in good health and attending school.","['Moertel, C L', 'Carlson-Green, B', 'Watterson, J', 'Simonton, S C']","['Moertel CL', 'Carlson-Green B', 'Watterson J', 'Simonton SC']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospitals and Clinics, St Paul, Minnesota, USA. chris.moertel@childrenshc.org""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2001/05/23 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/05/23 10:00'],"['2001/05/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1542/peds.107.5.e82 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatrics. 2001 May;107(5):E82. doi: 10.1542/peds.107.5.e82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Testicular tissue with both normal morphology and DNA content was obtained from necro-donors and fixed in Bouin's solution. A TdT-mediated dUTP end-labelling method (TUNEL) was used for the detection of apoptotic cells. Expression of apoptosis regulatory Bcl-2 family proteins and of p53 and p21(Waf1) was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Germ cell apoptosis was detected in all testes and was mainly seen in primary spermatocytes and spermatids and in a few spermatogonia. Bcl-2 and Bak were preferentially expressed in the compartments of spermatocytes and differentiating spermatids, while Bcl-x was preferentially expressed in spermatogonia. Bax showed a preferential expression in nuclei of round spermatids, whereas Bad was only seen in the acrosome region of various stages of spermatids. Mcl-1 staining was weak without a particular pattern, whereas expression of Bcl-w, p53 and p21(Waf1) proteins was not detected by immunohistochemistry. The results show that spontaneous apoptosis occurs in all male germ cell compartments in humans.

In the 19th century, it was the mainstay of the materia medica. A solution of potassium arsenite (Fowler's solution) was used for a variety of systemic illnesses from the 18th until the 20th century. This multipurpose solution was also primary therapy for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia until replaced by radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy. The past 100 years have seen a precipitous decline in arsenic use and, by the mid-1990s, the only recognized indication was the treatment of trypanosomiasis. Much of this decline was due to concerns about the toxicity and potential carcinogenicity of chronic arsenic administration. The rebirth of arsenic therapy occurred in the 1970s when physicians in China began using arsenic trioxide as part of a treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Their accumulated experience showed that a stable solution of arsenic trioxide given by intravenous infusion was remarkably safe and effective both in patients with newly diagnosed APL leukemia and in those with refractory and relapsed APL. The mechanisms of action of arsenic derivatives in this disease and other malignancies are many and include induction of apoptosis, partial cytodifferentiation, inhibition of proliferation, and inhibition of angiogenesis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Combinations of EM with other antimitotic agents such as docetaxel are synergistic in vitro and show significant clinical activity in patients with HRPC. We studied intravenous administration of docetaxel 70 mg/m(2), oral estramustine, and low-dose daily hydrocortisone in men with HRPC who demonstrated progression after initial hormone therapy. RESULTS: Of the 47 men enrolled onto this multicenter cooperative group study, 46 were assessable for response and/or toxicity. In the 24 patients with measurable disease, there were three complete and nine partial responses for a measurable disease response rate of 50% (12 of 24 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27% to 73%). In the 44 patients in whom pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was elevated, 30 (68%) had a 50% or greater decrease, and 25 (57%) had a 75% or greater decrease in PSA. The combined measurable disease and biochemical response rate in all 46 assessable patients was 54% (three complete responses, 22 partial responses, 95% CI, 37% to 71%). The predominant toxicity was neutropenia, with 26% of patients having grade 3 and 30% having grade 4 granulocytopenia; there were no episodes of febrile neutropenia. Other common but mild adverse effects included malaise/fatigue, peripheral edema, and hyperglycemia. The incidence of thromboembolic events during therapy was 9%. With a median follow-up of 17 months, the median survival was 20 months. The median time to disease progression was 8 months for all patients, and 10 months for those with measurable disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic analyses were performed at local laboratories, with results reviewed centrally. RT-PCR for AML1/ETO and CBFbeta/MYH11 was performed centrally. RESULTS: CBF AML was ultimately identified in 48 patients: 21 had t(8;21) or its variant and AML1/ETO, and 27 had inv(16)/t(16;16), CBFbeta/MYH11, or both. Initial cytogenetic and RT-PCR analyses correctly classified 95.7% and 96.1% of patients, respectively (P =.83). Initial cytogenetic results were considered to be false-negative in three AML1/ETO-positive patients with unique variants of t(8;21), and in three CBFbeta/MYH11-positive patients with, respectively, an isolated +22; del(16)(q22),+22; and a normal karyotype. The latter three patients were later confirmed to have inv(16)/t(16;16) cytogenetically. Only one of 124 patients reported initially as cytogenetically normal was ultimately RT-PCR-positive. There was no false-positive cytogenetic result. Initial RT-PCR was falsely negative in two patients with inv(16) and falsely positive for AML1/ETO in two and for CBFbeta/MYH11 in another two patients. Two patients with del(16)(q22) were found to be CBFbeta/MYH11-negative. M4Eo marrow morphology was a good predictor of the presence of inv(16)/t(16;16). CONCLUSION: Patients with t(8;21) or inv(16) can be successfully identified in prospective multi-institutional clinical trials. Both cytogenetics and RT-PCR detect most such patients, although each method has limitations. RT-PCR is required when the cytogenetic study fails; it is also required to determine whether patients with suspected variants of t(8;21), del(16)(q22), or +22 represent CBF AML. RT-PCR should not replace cytogenetics and should not be used as the only diagnostic test for detection of CBF AML because of the possibility of obtaining false-positive or false-negative results.","['Mrozek, K', 'Prior, T W', 'Edwards, C', 'Marcucci, G', 'Carroll, A J', 'Snyder, P J', 'Koduru, P R', 'Theil, K S', 'Pettenati, M J', 'Archer, K J', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Kolitz, J E', 'Larson, R A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Mrozek K', 'Prior TW', 'Edwards C', 'Marcucci G', 'Carroll AJ', 'Snyder PJ', 'Koduru PR', 'Theil KS', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Archer KJ', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Vardiman JW', 'Kolitz JE', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210-1228, USA. mrozek-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/05/02 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/02 10:00'],"['2001/05/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.9.2482 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 May 1;19(9):2482-92. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.9.2482.,"['CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine of 230 patients with a primary diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) developed tMDS/sAML after HDT comprising cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation (TBI) supported by autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells. G-banding and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect clonal cytogenetic abnormalities. RESULTS: The majority of patients showed complex karyotypes at diagnosis of tMDS/sAML containing, in particular, complete or partial loss of chromosomes 5 and/or 7. Using single locus-specific FISH probes, significant levels of clonally abnormal cells were found before HDT in 20 of 20 tMDS/sAML patients screened, compared with three of 24 patients screened who currently have not developed tMDS/sAML, at a median follow-up of 5.9 years after HDT. CONCLUSION: Prior cytotoxic therapy may play an important etiologic role and may predispose to the development of tMDS/sAML. Using a triple FISH assay designed to detect loss of chromosomal material from 5q31, 7q22, or 13q14, significant levels of abnormal cells can be detected before HDT and may predict which patients are at increased risk of developing secondary disease. Further prospective evaluation of this FISH assay is warranted to determine its predictive power in this setting.","['Lillington, D M', 'Micallef, I N', 'Carpenter, E', 'Neat, M J', 'Amess, J A', 'Matthews, J', 'Foot, N J', 'Young, B D', 'Lister, T A', 'Rohatiner, A Z']","['Lillington DM', 'Micallef IN', 'Carpenter E', 'Neat MJ', 'Amess JA', 'Matthews J', 'Foot NJ', 'Young BD', 'Lister TA', 'Rohatiner AZ']","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom. d.lillington@icrf.net.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced']",2001/05/02 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/02 10:00'],"['2001/05/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.9.2472 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 May 1;19(9):2472-81. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.9.2472.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on promising phase II data, a randomized comparison of various methods for the biochemical modulation of 5-FU was undertaken in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The control group received single-agent 5-FU as a 24-hour infusion weekly. Patients (N = 1,120) with no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to one of the following arms: arm A, 5-FU 2,600 mg/m2 by 24-hour infusion, weekly; arm B, N-phosphonoacetyl-l-aspartic acid 250 mg/m2 day l, 5-FU 2,600 mg/m2 by 24-hour infusion day 2, weekly; arm C, 5-FU 600 mg/m2 with oral leucovorin (LV) 125 mg/m2 hourly for the preceding 4 hours, weekly; arm D, 5-FU 600 mg/m2 with intravenous (IV) LV 600 mg/m2, weekly; arm E, 5-FU 750 mg/m2/d IV by continuous infusion for 5 days, then 750 mg/m2 weekly, and recombinant interferon alfa-2a 9 million units subcutaneously three times weekly. Median follow-up was 4.8 years. RESULTS: Of the 1,098 assessable patients, 57% had measurable disease. The toxicity of all the regimens was tolerable. Grade 4 or worse toxicity occurred in 11%, 11%, 30%, 24%, and 22% on each arm, respectively; diarrhea was the most common adverse effect. These toxicity patterns favored significantly (P <.001) the 24-hour infusion arms. Median survival (months) by arm was A, 14.8; B, 11.9; C, 13.5; D, 13.6; and E, 15.2. These survival durations did not differ significantly.

RESULTS: Five patients underwent diagnostic orchidectomy. The median patient age was 8.5 years (range, 2 to 14 years), and their cancers were stage III (18 patients), stage IV (five patients), and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (seven patients). Five patients had central nervous system involvement. Twenty-eight patients (95%) achieved complete remission. Twenty-six patients are alive without progressive disease (median follow-up, 6.5 years).

Previous work has shown that optimal T3 regulation of malic enzyme transcription is dependent on the presence of an accessory element (designated as region E) that immediately flanks a cluster of five T3 response elements in the malic enzyme gene. Here, we have analyzed the binding of nuclear proteins to region E and investigated the mechanism by which region E enhances T3 responsiveness. In nuclear extracts from hepatocytes, region E binds heterodimeric complexes consisting of the homeodomain proteins PBX and MEIS1. Region E contains four consecutive PBX/MEIS1 half-sites. PBX-MEIS1 heterodimers bind the first and second half-sites, the third and fourth half-sites, and the first and fourth half-sites. The configuration conferring the greatest increase in T3 responsiveness consists of the first and fourth half-sites that are separated by 7 nucleotides. Stimulation of T3 response element functions by region E does not require the presence of additional malic enzyme sequences. In pull-down experiments, PBX1a and PBX1b specifically bind the nuclear T3 receptor-alpha, and this interaction is enhanced by the presence of T3. A T3 receptor-alpha region containing the DNA binding domain plus flanking sequences (amino acids 21-157) is necessary and sufficient for binding to PBX1a and PBX1b. These results indicate that PBX-MEIS1 complexes interact with nuclear T3 receptors to enhance T3 regulation of malic enzyme transcription in hepatocytes.","['Wang, Y', 'Yin, L', 'Hillgartner, F B']","['Wang Y', 'Yin L', 'Hillgartner FB']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', 'EC 1.1.1.37 (Malate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.83 (D-malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Extracts/analysis', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Hepatocytes/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Malate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Triiodothyronine/*pharmacology']",2001/05/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/05/02 10:00'],"['2001/05/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M102166200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)78385-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jun 29;276(26):23838-48. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M102166200.

We have independently identified RERE in a search for genes localized to the translocation breakpoint region at chromosome 1p36.2 in the neuroblastoma cell line NGP. Here we show that neuroblastoma tumor cell lines display reduced abundance of RERE transcripts. Furthermore, we detected RERE protein mainly in the nucleus, where it colocalizes with the promyelocytic leukemia protein in promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic domains (PODs).

METHODS: The assay measured the capacity of the biological fluids to inhibit the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) from sodium benzoate under the influence of the free oxygen radicals derived from Fenton's reaction. A solution of 1 mmol/litre uric acid was used as standard. RESULTS: The following mean (SD) antioxidative activities were found (as uric acid) in the various biological fluids: serum, 2.04 (0.20) mmol/litre; urine, 176.5 (25.6) micromol/litre; cerebrospinal fluid, 95.0 (26.9) micromol/litre; aqueous humour oculi, 61.25 (9.9) micromol/litre; saliva, 838.5 (48.2) micromol/litre; tears, 247.0 (17.0) micromol/litre; ascites fluid, 270.0 (63.3) micromol/litre; kidney cyst fluid, 387.1 (28.1) micromol/litre. Small samples of the biological material were needed for the analyses: 10 microl of serum and 50-100 microl of other body fluids. In the sera of 48 healthy individuals there was a significant positive correlation between values obtained with the Randox method (as a reference method) and the new method proposed here (correlation coefficient, 0.8728; mean difference between methods, <0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This method is easy, rapid, reliable, and practical for the routine measurement of total antioxidant activity in serum and other human body fluids. Small samples of biological material are needed for the analyses and the results are comparable with the reference (Randox) method.","['Koracevic, D', 'Koracevic, G', 'Djordjevic, V', 'Andrejevic, S', 'Cosic, V']","['Koracevic D', 'Koracevic G', 'Djordjevic V', 'Andrejevic S', 'Cosic V']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Medical faculty, University Clinical Center, Nis, Yugoslavia.

Unexpectedly, Nef induced cytokine-independent TF-1 cell outgrowth and constitutive activation of the Stat3 transcription factor. Induction of survival required the Nef SH3 binding and membrane-targeting motifs and was blocked by dominant-negative Stat3 mutants.

Overexpression also transforms Rat1 fibroblasts by an unknown mechanism, which is likely to be related to its role in leukemia and which depends upon its repressor activity. We show here that mutant murine Evi-1 proteins, lacking either the N-terminal zinc finger DNA binding domain or both DNA binding zinc finger clusters, function as dominant negative mutants by reverting the transformed phenotype of Evi-1 transformed Rat1 fibroblasts. The dominant negative activity of the non-DNA binding mutants suggests sequestration of transformation-specific cofactors and that recruitment of these cellular factors might mediate Evi-1 transforming activity. C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) co-repressor family proteins bind PLDLS-like motifs. We show that the murine Evi-1 repressor domain has two such sites, PFDLT (site a, amino acids 553--559) and PLDLS (site b, amino acids 584--590), which independently can bind CtBP family co-repressor proteins, with site b binding with higher affinity than site a. Functional analysis of specific CtBP binding mutants show site b is absolutely required to mediate both transformation of Rat1 fibroblasts and transcriptional repressor activity. This is the first demonstration that the biological activity of a mammalian cellular transcriptional repressor protein is mediated by CtBPs. Furthermore, it suggests that CtBP proteins are involved in the development of some acute leukemias and that blocking their ability to specifically interact with EVI1 might provide a target for the development of pharmacological therapeutic agents.","['Palmer, S', 'Brouillet, J P', 'Kilbey, A', 'Fulton, R', 'Walker, M', 'Crossley, M', 'Bartholomew, C']","['Palmer S', 'Brouillet JP', 'Kilbey A', 'Fulton R', 'Walker M', 'Crossley M', 'Bartholomew C']","['Glasgow Caledonian University, School of Biological & Biomedical Sciences, City Campus, Cowcaddens Rd., Glasgow, G4 OBA, Scotland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2001/05/01 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/05/01 10:00'],"['2001/05/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M102343200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)30128-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jul 13;276(28):25834-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M102343200.

Pyramine encapsulating or rhodamine incorporating small unilamellar liposomes with mean diameters around 80 nm (demonstrated to retain encapsulated material and to be nontoxic under experimental conditions) were used. Liposome uptake by both types of cells increased when increasing amounts of vesicles were co-incubated. For both lipid compositions, the interaction with HUVEC was very fast (association reached a plateau within 5 min) and so was the release of internalized vesicles (90% within 10 min at 37 degrees C). The reduced association values at 4 degrees C and the punctuate fluorescence observed in the cell cytoplasm after interaction, were indicative of whole liposome internalization. This internalization was clathrin-independent, since it was not inhibited by sodium azide and deoxyglucose. Pre-treatment of HUVEC with filipin or NEM resulted in modification of the interaction, something that could be due to alterations in the biochemical characteristics of HUVEC membranes that inhibit vesicular processes. In HL-60 cells, a slower association and faster release of PC/Chol liposomes was demonstrated, while association of both liposomes with these cells was energy-and temperature-independent. Nevertheless, morphological studies revealed differences in the interactions: A bright fluorescent rim observed after interaction with PC/Chol liposomes, suggests that these liposomes were adsorbed on the surface of HL60 cells, while the uniform cytoplasmic fluorescence observed after incubation with PS/Chol liposomes was indicative of fusion as the interaction mechanism.","['Papadimitriou, E', 'Antimisiaris, S G']","['Papadimitriou E', 'Antimisiaris SG']","['Lab. of Molecular Pharmacology; Dept. of Pharmacy, School of Health Sciences, University of Patras, 26500 Patras, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,"['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)']",IM,"['Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Phosphatidylcholines/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Phosphatidylserines/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics']",2001/05/01 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/05/01 10:00'],"['2001/05/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['I383J001013 [pii]', '10.3109/10611860008997910 [doi]']",ppublish,J Drug Target. 2000;8(5):335-51. doi: 10.3109/10611860008997910.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The movements of CD63-GFP were studied in living RBL cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). CD63-GFP, in which GFP was conjugated to the C-terminus of CD63, was located on both the granule membranes and the plasma membranes of RBL cells. The diameter of the fluorescent granules in the cytoplasm varied from 0.5 to 1.5 microm. Before antigen stimulation most granules with CD63-GFP hardly moved in RBL cells. However, after antigen stimulation the plasma membranes ruffled violently and the granules moved dramatically. They reached the plasma membranes in a few minutes and fused with them instantaneously. Analysis of the movement of each granule provided a new insight into the elementary process of degranulation. The velocity of the granule movement toward the plasma membranes on antigen stimulation was calculated to be 0.1+/-0.02 microm/s.

Our hypothesis was that V beta T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity among recipients of allogeneic BMT is influenced by the expression of major and minor HLA antigens in the host. The study population comprised unmanipulated and CD34(+)-selected allogeneic bone marrow grafts, autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplants and recipients of volunteer unrelated donor (VUD) bone marrow transplants. Using flow cytometry, the relative frequencies of 18 V beta TCR families were determined and ranked for each time point studied. Comparisons and correlations were made between paired blood samples obtained within a single patient over time, and between donors and their recipients. The pattern of the V beta TCR repertoire from allogeneic recipients and their HLA-matched donors was very similar, with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.59. This similarity was not as marked in VUD pairs (CC = 0.32). By 3 months after transplant, the pattern of the V beta TCR repertoire in recipients of HLA-matched sibling transplants was more similar to the pattern seen in pretransplant recipients than to the donor pattern (CC = 0.40 vs. 0.31).

Thirteen patients developed a maximum of grade IV, five grade III and two grade II acute GVHD, with 15 patients being refractory to steroids and five dependent on steroids. Patients were treated with ATGAM (15 mg/kg for 5 d) and tacrolimus (0.025--0.1 mg/kg/d) in addition to continuation of their high-dose steroids and cessation of their cyclosporine. Within 28 d of treatment, we observed eight complete responses (CR), six partial responses (PR) and six with no response. Overall response (CR + PR) was predicted by GVHD severity. Infectious complications occurred in 80% of patients. The median survival was 86.5 d (range, 21--1081 d) with 35% of patients remaining alive. Survival following combination therapy was significantly more likely in men (P < 0.001), skin-only GVHD (P = 0.027), less severe GVHD (P = 0.048), and in responders to tacrolimus and ATGAM (P < 0.001).

We have defined previously the proximal breakpoint of a constitutional 7q22--q34 inversion, carried in a cell line derived from a member of a family with a history of MDS. A YAC clone spanning this breakpoint was identified. Both inversion breakpoints have now been cloned and sequenced, placing the proximal breakpoint 40 kb centromeric to the TAC2 (tachykinin 2) gene and the distal breakpoint 42 kb telomeric to the SSBP (mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein) gene. Sequence alignments revealed small (3--4 bp) duplications at the inversion breakpoints, suggesting that the mechanism of inversion involved the creation of staggered breaks and filling in of the overhanging ends.

TNF alpha and IFN gamma production by CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD56(+) lymphocytes was significantly enhanced compared with that of patients at diagnosis. However, the values were lower than those of normal controls. These results indicate that, in contrast to the observations at presentation, CML patients, at the time of the best possible response to treatment, show a normalized T-cell subset distribution associated with an activated CD4 T-cell compartment and a restored cytotoxic activity. In addition, they also show a markedly increased intracellular cytokine production by the lymphoid populations that play an important role in the process of specific tumour recognition. The design of therapeutic strategies aimed at stimulating the host immune compartment finds a further rationale for CML patients responsive to treatment with both IFN alpha and hydroxyurea.","['Guarini, A', 'Breccia, M', 'Montefusco, E', 'Petti, M C', 'Zepparoni, A', 'Vitale, A', 'Foa, R']","['Guarini A', 'Breccia M', 'Montefusco E', 'Petti MC', 'Zepparoni A', 'Vitale A', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD56 Antigen', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",2001/05/01 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/01 10:00'],"['2001/05/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2724 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02724.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Apr;113(1):136-42. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02724.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that proteasome inhibitor Z-Ile-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leucinal (PSI) was cytotoxic on most human myeloid leukaemia cell lines at IC50 doses ranging from 5 to 25 nmol/l. Additionally, PSI pre-treatment enhanced cytotoxicity by taxol and cisplatinum. PSI was more active on leukaemic than on normal CD34(+) bone marrow progenitors because the 50% growth inhibition of colony-forming unit granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) from cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and normal subjects was achieved by 15 nmol/l and 50 nmol/l PSI respectively. PSI killed cells by apoptosis as revealed by ultrastructural changes, nuclear DNA fragmentation, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and of beta-catenin, and was antagonized by ectopic expression of Bcl-2 but not by inactivating mutations of p53. This event was associated with a slight accumulation of Bcl-2, a decrease of Bax but no changes in Bcl-X(L) protein expression at any time point. In Ph(+) cell lines BCR-ABL protein was only down-regulated after 48 h of treatment with 10 nmol/l PSI. Altogether, these results indicate that PSI, alone or in association with other cytotoxic agents, has anti-tumour activity against myeloid malignancies and is more effective on leukaemic than on normal haematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Soligo, D', 'Servida, F', 'Delia, D', 'Fontanella, E', 'Lamorte, G', 'Caneva, L', 'Fumiatti, R', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, G']","['Soligo D', 'Servida F', 'Delia D', 'Fontanella E', 'Lamorte G', 'Caneva L', 'Fumiatti R', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers G']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, I.R.C.C.S., Ospedale Maggiore and University of Milan, Italy. dsoligo@galactica.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '82473-52-7 (leucinal)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, p53', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leucine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Protease Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', '*Trans-Activators', 'beta Catenin']",2001/05/01 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/05/01 10:00'],"['2001/05/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2683 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02683.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Apr;113(1):126-35. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02683.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median colony growth according to the three risk groups was 2 (range 0--344) in group A, 14.5 (range 0--5000) in group B and 50.0 (0--3000) in group C (A vs. B, P < 0.001; A vs. C, P < 0.001; B vs. C, P < 0.01).

The median colony growth of all patients [13/10(5) bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs); range 0--5000] significantly discriminated between patients regarding survival (OS 11 vs. 7 months, P = 0.044). However, multiple Cox regression analysis revealed cytogenetic risk groups as the most important predictor for achieving CR, disease-free and overall survival, with colony growth adding no additional prognostic information. In 64 patients, colony growth was also investigated without the addition of exogenous cytokines. Interestingly, none of the patients with a favourable karyotype exhibited autonomous growth, whereas 50% with an intermediate and 73% of patients with an unfavourable karyotype displayed either partial or full autonomous growth in vitro (P = 0.0004).

'Silent' inactivation may additionally reduce treatment intensity. Therefore, PEG-ASNase (Oncaspar), a polyethylene glycol conjugate of the native Escherichia coli-ASNase, was introduced into the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 96 treatment protocol for relapsed ALL under drug monitoring conditions. A single i.v. dose of 500 IU/m2 PEG-ASNase, substituted for the native ASNases, was administered to supply a plasma activity of 100 IU/l for 1 week. From November 1997 to March 2000, 35 patients from 23 BFM-associated hospitals, with or without a previous allergic reaction to one or both native preparations, underwent monitoring. After 82 applications, a total of 270 samples were submitted to be tested for ASNase activity. The ASNase activity on the day of the administration and the following day ranged between < 20 and 693 IU/l, with a median of 413 IU/l (53 samples). The median on d 7 +/- 1 was 199 IU/l (range <20--421 IU/l; 41 samples) and on d 14 +/- 1, 105 IU/l (range <20--188 IU/l; 19 samples). An ASNase activity of > 100 IU/l was seen on d 7 in 36 activity time courses of 52 interpretable applications (69%). Intraindividual variability of activity time courses was low. However, a rapid decrease in ASNase activity after repeated applications was observed in 4 out of 20 children. Previously experienced allergic reactions to native ASNases did not influence PEG-ASNase pharmacokinetics. PEG-ASNase is a useful alternative to the native ASNases in children with relapsed ALL.

The effect of intensified therapy on the importance of currently recognized phenotypic and genotypic determinants of outcome was assessed in 2090 children enrolled on the Medical Research Council United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukaemia XI (MRC UKALL XI) protocol. Treatment allocation was not determined by risk factors. Multivariate analysis confirmed the dominant influence on prognosis of age, sex and presenting white cell count (WCC). After allowing for these features, blast karyotype, d 8 marrow blast percentage and remission status at the end of induction therapy were the only remaining significant predictors of outcome. Organomegaly, haemoglobin concentration, French--American--British type, body mass index, presence of central nervous system disease at diagnosis, immunophenotype and presence of TEL/AML1 fusion gene (examined in a subset of 659 patients) either had no significant effect on outcome or were significant only in univariate analysis. Among karyotype abnormalities with an independent influence on prognosis, high hyperdiploidy (> 50 chromosomes) was shown to be favourable, whereas near haploidy (23--29 chromosomes), presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, t(4;11) and abnormalities affecting the short arm of chromosome 9 [abn (9p)] were adverse risk factors. Early responders to therapy, determined by residual marrow infiltration after 8 d of induction therapy, had a good outcome, while the small proportion of patients who did not achieve a complete remission by the end of induction therapy had a poor outcome. A third block of late intensification was shown to improve event-free survival by 8% at 5 years. The effect of these risk factors was not significantly different between those randomized to the third intensification block and those not randomized to a third block.","['Hann, I', 'Vora, A', 'Harrison, G', 'Harrison, C', 'Eden, O', 'Hill, F', 'Gibson, B', 'Richards, S']","['Hann I', 'Vora A', 'Harrison G', 'Harrison C', 'Eden O', 'Hill F', 'Gibson B', 'Richards S']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology & Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.

In order to ascertain basic demographic risk factors for the development of TTP, we compared the 22 patients with 434 patients who did not develop TTP. Compared with patients who did not develop TTP, patients with TTP were nearly three times older (P < 0.001) and were more than twice as likely to be female (P = 0.001).

Among these factors, expression of GATA-2 mRNA in purified CD34-positive cells was markedly decreased in aplastic anaemia compared with that in ITP and in normal subjects. The expression levels of SCL and AML1 mRNA in CD34-positive cells in aplastic anaemia were not different from those in normal subjects. When the expression of GATA-2 protein in CD34-positive cells was examined by immunocytochemical analysis, the percentage of GATA-2-positive cells in aplastic anaemia was lower than that in normal subjects.

This transcription factor family is characterized by a DNA-binding alpha-subunit harboring the Runt domain and a secondary subunit, beta, which binds to the Runt domain and enhances its interaction with DNA. Missense mutations in the Runt domain from either the blood or bone-related gene product are associated with the onset of acute human leukemia as well as a disease of skeletal patterning known as cleidocranial dysplasia. NMR ""footprinting"" analysis of Runt domain/beta/DNA ternary complexes in solution previously identified the likely residues that form the heterodimerization and DNA-binding surfaces of the Runt domain. Functional mutagenesis at 37 positions in the Runt domain or beta confirms the original identification of these interaction surfaces and reveals that the heterodimerization and DNA-binding surfaces of the Runt domain occur at distinct, non-overlapping sites within the domain. The analysis of an additional 21 disease-related missense mutations identified from patients with either blood or bone disease demonstrates that the primary defect in these patients is a failure in DNA-recognition by the Runt domain.

The minimal promoter region resides 300 nucleotides upstream of a putative ATG initiation codon preceded by a pyrimidine-rich region.

METHODS: Forty four women who volunteered to terminate their pregnancy were divided into 3 group: mifepristone group (exp. 1, n = 15), mifepristone with misoprostol group (exp. II, n = 14) and control group (n = 15). The cell cycles of DNA of the decidual and villous cells stained with Propidium Iodide (PI) were analyzed and bcl-2 and bax gene protein labeled with immuno-fluorescence were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The percentage of decidual cells apoptosis were (14.0 +/- 3.9)%, (22.9 +/- 6.3)%, (5.3 +/- 9.3)% and of villous apoptosis were (10.9 +/- 2.8)%, (13.9 +/- 4.7)%, (4.6 +/- 3.0)% in exp. I, exp. II and control group respectively. The apoptotic percentages in decidual and villous cells of exp. I and exp. II groups were significantly higher than that of control (P < 0.01-0.001). On DNA histogram, apoptosis peaks appeared in all the groups. The decidual cell apoptosis of exp. II groups was significantly higher than that of exp. I group (P < 0.01). Both decidual apoptotic percentages of exp. I and exp. II groups were significantly higher than that of villous (P < 0.01). Decidual bcl-2/bax ratio were 1.4 +/- 0.7, 0.9 +/- 0.3, 1.4 +/- 0.7 and villous bcl-2/bax ratio were 1.0 +/- 0.4, 0.8 +/- 0.3, 1.4 +/- 0.6 in the 3 groups respectively. Both decidual and villous bcl-2/bax ratio of exp. II group was significantly lower than that of control (P < 0.05-0.01) which was in consistent with apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that mifepristone with misocprostol for terminating human early pregnancy might be realized by inducing decidual and villous cells excessive apoptosis. The descent of bcl-2/bax ratio could be one of the factors of inducing decidual and villous apoptosis.","['Li, R', 'Wang, Z', 'Wu, R']","['Li R', 'Wang Z', 'Wu R']","['Second Hospital, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi,16210370R,"['0 (Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal)', '0 (Abortifacient Agents, Steroidal)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0E43V0BB57 (Misoprostol)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)']",IM,"['Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal', '*Abortifacient Agents, Steroidal', 'Abortion, Induced/methods', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Chorionic Villi/*pathology', 'Decidua/*cytology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', '*Mifepristone', 'Misoprostol', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2001/05/01 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/05/01 10:00'],"['2001/05/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/05/01 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi. 1999 May;34(5):281-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently found that Tax binds to and chronically stimulates the catalytic function of IkappaB kinase (IKK), a cellular enzyme complex that phosphorylates and inactivates the IkappaB inhibitory subunit of NF-kappaB. We now demonstrate that the IKKbeta catalytic subunit and IKKgamma regulatory subunit of IKK are chronically phosphorylated in HTLV1-infected and Tax-transfected cells. Alanine substitutions at Ser-177 and Ser-181 in the T loop of IKKbeta protect both of these IKK subunits from Tax-directed phosphorylation and prevent the induction of IkappaB kinase activity. Each of these inhibitory effects is recapitulated in Tax transfectants expressing the bacterial protein YopJ, a potent in vivo agonist of T loop phosphorylation. Moreover, ectopically expressed forms of IKKbeta that contain glutamic acid substitutions at Ser-177 and Ser-181 have the capacity to phosphorylate a recombinant IKKgamma substrate in vitro. We conclude that Tax-induced phosphorylation of IKKbeta is required for IKKbeta activation, phosphoryl group transfer to IKKgamma, and acquisition of the deregulated IKK phenotype.","['Carter, R S', 'Geyer, B C', 'Xie, M', 'Acevedo-Suarez, C A', 'Ballard, D W']","['Carter RS', 'Geyer BC', 'Xie M', 'Acevedo-Suarez CA', 'Ballard DW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232-0295, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (YopP protein, Yersinia)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",2001/04/28 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/04/28 10:00'],"['2001/04/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.C000777200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)79504-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jul 6;276(27):24445-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.C000777200.

Nevertheless, most individuals infected with HTLV-1 do not develop ATL. To attempt to identify genetic factors promoting the progression to ATL, we investigated in HTLV-1 carriers the relationship between susceptibility to ATL and several polymorphisms: the three ""decreased-detoxifying"" polymorphisms in GSTM1, GSTT1, and CYP1A1, the ""proapoptotic"" polymorphism in BCL2, and the five ""high-production"" polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) using PCR-based genotyping assays. ATL patients (n = 71) were younger than HTLV-1 carriers (n = 80; 57 +/- 12 versus 63 +/- 10 years; P = 0.0017). MALE:female ratio in ATL patients was higher than in carriers (52:19 versus 19:61, respectively; P < 0.0001), probably reflecting a higher incidence of HTLV-1 infection in females and a higher incidence of development of ATL in males. We found that the frequency of the TNF-alpha-857T allele, reported to be associated with high transcriptional activity of the promoter/enhancer region of the TNF-alpha gene, was enriched in individuals with ATL compared with healthy carriers (18.3% versus 8.8%, respectively; odds ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.7). None of the other four TNF-alpha polymorphisms was a significant indicator of risk of development of ATL, although odds ratios (ATL versus carrier) of all of the TNF-alpha polymorphisms were higher than 1.0. Furthermore, analysis of polymorphisms for GSTM1, GSTT1, CYP1A1, and BCL2 showed no significant difference between ATL patients and healthy carriers. Genetic polymorphism leading to increased TNF-alpha production may enhance susceptibility to ATL among HTLV-1 carriers. Alternatively, but less likely, the HLA loci might be an important factor because the TNF-alpha gene lies within the class III region of the MHC; however, the 857T allele is not in linkage disequilibrium with HLA alleles associated with ATL development.","['Tsukasaki, K', 'Miller, C W', 'Kubota, T', 'Takeuchi, S', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Ikeda, S', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Tsukasaki K', 'Miller CW', 'Kubota T', 'Takeuchi S', 'Fujimoto T', 'Ikeda S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, 90024, USA. tsukasak@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Carrier State/*virology', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",2001/04/28 10:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/04/28 10:00'],"['2001/04/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 May 1;61(9):3770-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the potential role of the gene mutated in NBS (NBS1) in the pathogenesis and disease progression of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Samples from 47 children with first relapse of ALL were analyzed for mutations in all 16 exons of the NBS1 gene, and in 7 of them (14.9%), four novel amino acid substitutions were identified. Mutations S93L, D95N, and I171V occur in the two known domains of nibrin that are probably involved in protein-protein interactions. Germ-line origin of the I171V mutation was confirmed in three patients, whereas the D95N exchange was present only in leukemic cells. The R215W mutation was observed in one ALL but also in a population-based study and probably represents a rare sequence variant. No additional mutations were found on the second allele in any of these seven patients.

Standard analyses for clonality assessment include Southern blotting or PCR-based detection of clonal TCR gene rearrangements. The latter consist of heteroduplex PCR analysis by separation of PCR products on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (PAGE). We describe a rapid and sensitive method to identify specific clonal rearrangements in PCR fragments obtained by amplification of TCRgamma and TCRdelta genes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We applied a semi-automated electrophoretic technique (PhastSystem , Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and compared it with standard homo-heteroduplex analysis in 21 cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RESULTS: The results obtained for each sample analyzed by standard homo-heteroduplex detection were completely reproduced by the PhastSystem approach. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that heteroduplex analysis of TCR gene rearrangements using the semi-automated PhastSystem is a simple, rapid, cheap and highly reproducible method which can be used as an alternative to traditional analysis for detection of clonality.","['Germano, G', 'Songia, S', 'Biondi, A', 'Basso, G']","['Germano G', 'Songia S', 'Biondi A', 'Basso G']","['Clinica di Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Dipartimento di Pediatria, Universita di Padova, Italy. ggermano@oncopedipd.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Child', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Electronic Data Processing', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/instrumentation/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology']",2001/04/28 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/04/28 10:00'],"['2001/04/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Apr;86(4):382-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax is a transcriptional activator. Its ability to modulate the expression and function of many cellular genes has been reasoned to be a major contributory mechanism explaining HTLV-I-mediated transformation of cells. In activating cellular gene expression, Tax impinges upon several cellular signal-transduction pathways, including those for CREB/ATF and NF-kappa B.

METHODS: The inhibitory effect of H2O2 on cell growth was determined using the tetrazolium dye colorimetric test, and the lipid peroxidation was estimated by malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. DNA damage was detected using single cell gel electrophoresis, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation was measured using a fluorescent probe, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). RESULTS: H2O2 (100 mumol.L-1) suppressed the growth of HL-60 cells and the addition of Ebs (1-20 mumol.L-1) reduced the suppression in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ebs also displayed a concentration-dependent reduction of MDA formation in H2O2-treated cells, at the concentration of 20 mumol.L-1 the inhibitory rate was 56.4%. Ebs was able to reduce the ROS formation and DNA damage caused by H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner.

Here we test that hypothesis in the PC-3 human prostate tumor. We found that the essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA), and the AA metabolite PGE(2) stimulate tumor growth while oleic acid (OA) and the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) inhibited growth. In examining the role of AA in growth response, we extended our studies to analyze changes in early gene expression induced by AA. We demonstrate that c-fos expression is increased within minutes of addition in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the immediate early gene cox-2 is also increased in the presence of AA in a dose-dependent manner, while the constitutive cox-1 message was not increased. Three hours after exposure to AA, the synthesis of PGE(2) via COX-2 was also increased. Previous studies have demonstrated that AA was primarily delivered by low density lipoprotein (LDL) via its receptor (LDLr). Since it is known that hepatomas, acute myelogenous leukemia and colorectal tumors lack normal cholesterol feedback, we examined the role of the LDLr in growth regulation of the PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Analysis of ldlr mRNA expression and LDLr function demonstrated that human PC-3 prostate cancer cells lack normal feedback regulation. While exogenous LDL caused a significant stimulation of cell growth and PGE(2) synthesis, no change was seen in regulation of the LDLr by LDL. Taken together, these data show that normal cholesterol feedback of ldlr message and protein is lost in prostate cancer.

In a cohort study of Swiss railway personnel with 2.7 x 10(5) person-years of follow-up (1972--1993), the authors compared occupations with high average exposures (line engineers: 25.9 microT) to those with medium and low exposures (station masters: 1 microT). The mortality rate ratio for leukemia was 2.4 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 6.1) among line engineers (reference category: station masters). The mortality rate ratio for brain tumors was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.2, 4.6) among line engineers and 5.1 (95% CI: 1.2, 21.2) among shunting yard engineers (compared with station masters). Two exposure characteristics were evaluated: cumulative exposure in microT-years and years spent under exposure to magnetic fields of > or =10 microT. There was a significant increase in leukemia mortality of 0.9% (95% CI: 0.2, 1.7) per microT-year of cumulative exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields. The increase by years spent under exposure of > or =10 microT was even stronger: 62% per year (95% CI: 15, 129). Brain cancer risk did not show a dose-response relation.

Clinical trials have been undertaken to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy by adding an MRP inhibitor to the treatment regimen. This study attempted not only to determine novel resistance mechanisms in MRP-overexpressing AML cells (AML-2/DX100) by chronic exposure to doxorubicin in the presence of an MRP inhibitor probenecid but also to find out whether probenecid could increase MRP levels. AML-2/DXPBA cultured in the presence of probenecid (600 microM) and doxorubicin (100 ng/ml) showed a higher level of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype when compared to AML-2/DX100. AML-2/DXPBA showed increased levels of MRP compared to those of AML-2/DX100. Probenecid increased the MRP levels without an increase in MRP mRNA in AML-2/WT in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. Of the MRP inhibitors including probenecid, ofloxacin, erythromycin, and rifampicin used in this study, only probenecid showed a marked chemosensitizing effect in AML-2/DX100 but not in HL-60/Adr, suggesting that the chemosensitizing effects of the MRP inhibitors vary according to the type of resistant cells. The maximum noncytotoxic concentrations of these MRP inhibitors increased the MRP levels to various degrees in both AML-2/WT and HL-60/WT. However, the chemosensitizing effects of the MRP inhibitors were not correlated with their MRP-increasing effects. Altogether, MRP inhibitors such as probenecid have been shown to function as a double-edged sword, indicating that they are not only an effective chemosensitizer of MRP-associated MDR tumor cells but also an MRP activator. Therefore caution should be taken whenever using MRP inhibitors to reverse MRP-mediated multidrug resistance in clinical cancer chemotherapy as well as when used to inhibit MRP expression in vitro.","['Kim, H S', 'Min, Y D', 'Choi, C H']","['Kim HS', 'Min YD', 'Choi CH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Department of General Surgery, Chosun University Medical School, 375 Seosuk-dong, Dong-gu, Kwangju, 501-759, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Uricosuric Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '63937KV33D (Erythromycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)', 'VJT6J7R4TR (Rifampin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythromycin/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Ofloxacin/pharmacology', 'Probenecid/*pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rifampin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uricosuric Agents/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2001/04/27 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/27 10:00'],"['2001/04/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.4746 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)94746-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Apr 27;283(1):64-71. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.4746.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The updated study covered an observation period of 51 years, from 1946 to 1996, with a total of 208,627 person-years of observation. A total of 3020 (40.0%) cohort members were known to have died. The mortality data were analyzed in terms of cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The overall mortality of the cohort was significantly lower than expected when compared with that of the general US population (SMR, 95.7; 95% CI, 92.3 to 99.2). Overall cancer mortality was also lower than expected (SMR, 85.8; 95% CI, 79.4 to 92.5). For specific cancer sites, significant mortality deficits were observed for the following: buccal cavity and pharynx, esophagus, large intestine, rectum, larynx, lung, and bladder and other urinary organs. No significant increase was reported for any site-specific cancer. A non-significant increase in acute myeloid leukemia was observed among male employees (SMR, 147.2; 95% CI, 76.1 to 257.2). Detailed analyses indicated that the excess was restricted to workers hired before 1950. No increase was detected for other leukemia cell-types, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. For non-malignant diseases, the majority of SMRs were below 100, and no significant increase was observed for any cause. In particular, significant mortality deficits were reported for ischemic heart disease (SMR, 91.0; 95% CI, 85.4 to 96.9), non-malignant respiratory disease (SMR, 61.5; 95% CI, 52.2 to 72.0), pulmonary fibrosis (SMR, 51.0; 95% CI, 22.0 to 100.4), cirrhosis of the liver (SMR, 47.2; 95% CI, 30.6 to 69.7), and accidents (SMR, 81.7; 95% CI, 66.3 to 99.6). Separate analyses of male workers by job classification (process and maintenance) were conducted. Mortality from acute myeloid leukemia was elevated among employees in maintenance jobs (8 observed deaths vs 4.31 expected; SMR, 185.5; 95% CI, 80.1 to 365.6). However, no upward trend by length of service was found. A detailed analysis indicated that the acute myeloid leukemia mortality excess was limited to maintenance workers who were hired before 1950. No other significant excess was detected for any cause among maintenance or process workers.

In order to enhance the graft-versus-leukemia effect, patients received no graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was given at a dose of 60 micrograms/m2 after transplant. Acute GVHD grade I-IV was seen in all patients. Eight out of ten patients achieved complete remission: one out of two patients with AML and late relapse is in good condition with limited chronic GVHD more than 1 year after the second PBSCT. The other patient died on day +171 after the second PBSCT from cerebral aspergillosis. One patient with blastic phase CML achieved molecular remission but died +330 days after the second PBSCT because of intracranial bleeding. Of the remaining five patients, three died of infectious complications on days +36, +70, and +27, one patient died with extramedullary relapse on day +35, and one from multi-organ failure in association with acute GVHD on day +32 after the second PBSCT. Two out of ten showed progressive disease and died on days +30 and +90, respectively. Although several patients achieved complete remission, the high risk of GVHD and treatment-related mortality should be kept in mind, especially when a second transplant is considered during a period of less than 12 months after the first procedure. Monitoring of minimal residual disease might predict relapse thus preventing high doses of cytotoxic drugs for reconditioning.

Since troxacitabine is a cytidine nucleoside analogue like AraC (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine), which is currently used in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, we compared the in vivo antileukemic activity of troxacitabine with that of AraC in human leukemia xenograft models. METHODS: The antiproliferative activity of troxacitabine and AraC was analyzed on hemapoietic cell lines by use of a thymidine incorporation assay. For in vivo studies, we compared troxacitabine with AraC by using equitotoxic schedules of the two nucleosides optimized for therapeutic activity. The antileukemic activity of both drugs was evaluated by measurement of their effect on the percent increased lifespan. RESULTS: AraC had good in vitro antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 14 nM) but was ineffective in vivo against the HL60 promyelocyte leukemia cell line (treated vs control, T/C = 105%). Troxacitabine, which in contrast to AraC is not a substrate for cytidine deaminase, showed potent in vitro and in vivo activity in the same model (IC50 = 53 nM and T/C = 272% to 422%). The poor in vivo activity of AraC against HL60 leukemia cells could be due to the high cytidine deaminase (CDA; EC 3.5.4.5) activity in this cell line. This hypothesis was tested with CCRF-CEM T-lymphoblastoid leukemia cells which have undetectable levels of CDA activity. Short-term exposure of these leukemia cell lines to both drugs indicated that AraC was indeed significantly more effective in the CCRF-CEM cell line than in HL60. In contrast, the antiproliferative activity of troxacitabine was similar for both cell lines. These observations were extended to in vivo studies. Mice bearing CCRF-CEM tumor xenografts were treated with AraC and troxacitabine. In this model, T/C values were comparable for both drugs and ranged from 138% to 157%. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that troxacitabine is likely to be effective not only against solid tumors with high CDA activity but also in leukemias which have developed resistance to AraC due to increased CDA levels; this suggests that troxacitabine is a promising agent for the treatment of cancer. Indeed, significant antileukemic activity has been observed with troxacitabine in a phase I clinical trial in patients with primary refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemias (AML).","['Gourdeau, H', 'Bibeau, L', 'Ouellet, F', 'Custeau, D', 'Bernier, L', 'Bowlin, T']","['Gourdeau H', 'Bibeau L', 'Ouellet F', 'Custeau D', 'Bernier L', 'Bowlin T']","['BioChem Pharma Inc., 275 Armand-Frappier Blvd, Laval, Quebec H7V 4A7, Canada. gourdeah@biochempharma.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dioxolanes)', '60KQZ0388Y (troxacitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Dioxolanes/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/26 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800000223 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Mar;47(3):236-40. doi: 10.1007/s002800000223.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of a pilot trial in which TG was used in place of MP, we studied the plasma pharmacokinetics of oral TG and measured steady-state plasma and CSF TG concentrations during a continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) in children with newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL. METHODS: Nine plasma samples were collected after each patient's first 60 mg/m2 oral TG dose during maintenance. CIVI TG (20 mg/m2/h over 24 h) was administered during the consolidation phase of therapy, and simultaneous plasma and CSF samples were collected near the end of the infusion. TG was measured by reverse-phase HPLC with ultraviolet detection. Erythrocyte TG nucleotide (TGN) concentrations were measured 7 days after a course of CIVI TG and prior to the start of each maintenance cycle. RESULTS: After oral TG (n = 35), the mean (+/- SD) peak plasma concentration was 0.46 +/- 0.68 microM and the AUC ranged from 0.18 to 9.5 microM.h (mean 1.5 microM.h). Mean steady-state plasma and CSF TG concentrations during CIVI (n = 33) were 2.7 and 0.5 microM, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) TG clearance was 935 +/- 463 ml/min per m2. Plasma TG concentrations did not correlate with erythrocyte TGN concentrations after oral or CIVI TG. The 8-OH-TG metabolite was detected in plasma and CSF. CONCLUSIONS: TG concentrations that are cytotoxic to human leukemia cell lines can be achieved in plasma after a 60 mg/m2 oral dose of TG and in plasma and CSF during CIVI of TG.","['Lowe, E S', 'Kitchen, B J', 'Erdmann, G', 'Stork, L C', 'Bostrom, B C', 'Hutchinson, R', 'Holcenberg, J', 'Reaman, G H', 'Woods, W', 'Franklin, J', 'Widemann, B C', 'Balis, F M', 'Murphy, R F', 'Adamson, P C']","['Lowe ES', 'Kitchen BJ', 'Erdmann G', 'Stork LC', 'Bostrom BC', 'Hutchinson R', 'Holcenberg J', 'Reaman GH', 'Woods W', 'Franklin J', 'Widemann BC', 'Balis FM', 'Murphy RF', 'Adamson PC']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, 10 Center Drive, Building 10, Room 13C103, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. lowee@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/urine', 'Area Under Curve', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/urine']",2001/04/26 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800000229 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Mar;47(3):199-205. doi: 10.1007/s002800000229.,['5 MO1 RR00069/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fetal human stem cells derived from central nervous system (CNS) tissue are potential transplantable sources for all cell types found in the mature human nervous system including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendroglia. Although nearly all areas of the fetal human neuraxis contain undifferentiated neural precursor cells, the phenotypic fate of the daughter cells might vary from one region to another during a specific developmental period. The purpose of this study was to compare the various cell types derived from neural precursors cultured from second trimester fetal human brain and spinal cord. To this end, brains (n = 8) and spinal cords (n = 8) of 15-24 week fetuses were dissociated and grown in culture medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The proliferating precursor cells from both brain and spinal cord grew as spherical masses that were plated on laminin-coated dishes after seven days in culture. During the next 5-7 days, the cells that emerged from these spheres were fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry. Brain derived spheres gave rise to cells expressing antigens specific for neurons (MAP-2ab and neuron specific-intermediate filaments), astrocytes (GFAP) and oligodendrocytes (A007). In contrast, cells that emerged from spinal cord derived spheres were only immunoreactive for GFAP. These data suggest that neuroepithelial precursor cells from different CNS regions, although similar in their responsiveness to proliferative growth factors, might differ in their ability to generate different cell types in the adult CNS.","['Barami, K', 'Zhao, J', 'Diaz, F G', 'Lyman, W D']","['Barami K', 'Zhao J', 'Diaz FG', 'Lyman WD']","['Dept. of Neurosurgery, Wayne State University UHC-6E, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neurol Res,Neurological research,7905298,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neurofilament Proteins)']",IM,"['Astrocytes/cytology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Nervous System/*cytology/*embryology', 'Female', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis', 'Neurofilament Proteins/analysis', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Second', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2001/04/26 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/04/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/016164101101198406 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurol Res. 2001 Mar-Apr;23(2-3):260-6. doi: 10.1179/016164101101198406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prenylation of Ras proteins plays a major role in cell proliferation of both normal and cancerous cells. Normal and oncogenic Ras proteins are posttranslationally modified by a farnesyl group that promotes membrane binding. Inhibitors of farnesyl protein transferase (FPTase), the enzyme that catalyzes the prenylation of Ras proteins, inhibit growth of tumor cells. In an effort to identify structurally diverse and unique inhibitors of FPTase, a program devoted to screening of natural products was initiated. This effort led to the identification of 10 different families of compounds, all of which selectively inhibit FPTase with a variety of mechanisms that are reviewed in this manuscript. These compounds originated from the fermentations of a number of microorganisms, either actinomycetes or fungi, isolated from different substrates collected in tropical and temperate areas.

Indirect evidence on the basis of RNA analysis and in vivo competitive repopulation experiments in animal models suggests a correlation between transduction efficiency and the abundance of retrovirus receptors on the hematopoietic target cell. However, transduction by oncoretroviral vectors is also subject to other factors such as target cell cycle status and the composition of the virus-containing medium, making it difficult to determine the level of receptor expression required for efficient transduction. In the present study we investigated the impact of receptor expression level on transduction by a vector with a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope protein in a tetracycline-inducible tissue culture model that allowed for the cell cycle-independent, regulated expression of the GALV receptor (Pit1) in otherwise non-susceptible NIH 3T3 cells. Up-regulation of receptor RNA expression by 4.5-fold resulted in a mean 150-fold increase in transduction efficiency. We then analyzed cell surface expression of the Pit1 receptor using a fusion protein consisting of GALV SU portion of the viral envelope protein linked to the human IgG Fc. These experiments showed that tetracycline-regulated receptor induction resulted in a dose-dependent increase in binding of fusion protein. At maximum induction fusion protein binding increased up to five-fold which paralleled the increase in RNA expression, and correlated with the improved transduction efficiency. Finally, studies of pseudotype-specific fusion protein binding to human CD34-enriched cells revealed increased expression of retrovirus receptors after cytokine stimulation, although overall receptor expression in CD34(+)cells remained lower than in fibroblast cell lines efficiently transduced by amphotropic and GALV vectors.","['Kurre, P', 'Morris, J', 'Miller, A D', 'Kiem, H P']","['Kurre P', 'Morris J', 'Miller AD', 'Kiem HP']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis/immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",2001/04/26 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/04/26 10:00'],"['2000/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2001/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301438 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2001 Apr;8(8):593-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301438.,"['DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Gag is capable of specifically packaging the genomic RNA into the particle, this RNA species is unnecessary for particle assembly in vivo. In vitro, nucleic acids profoundly enhance the efficiency of assembly by recombinant Gag proteins, apparently by acting as ""scaffolding"" in the particle. To address the participation of RNA in retrovirus assembly in vivo, we analyzed murine leukemia virus particles that lack genomic RNA because of a deletion in the packaging signal of the viral RNA. We found that these particles contain cellular mRNA in place of genomic RNA. This result was particularly evident when Gag was expressed by using a Semliki Forest virus-derived vector: under these conditions, the Semliki Forest virus vector-directed mRNA became very abundant in the cells and was readily identified in the retroviral virus-like particles. Furthermore, we found that the retroviral cores were disrupted by treatment with RNase.

Crosslinking of p75/AIRM-1 or CD33 has been shown to sharply inhibit the in vitro proliferation of both normal myeloid cells and chronic myeloid leukemias. In this study, we analyzed acute myeloid leukemic cells for the expression of p75/AIRM-1. p75/AIRM-1 marked the M5 (11/12) and M4 (2/2) but not the M1, M2, and M3 subtypes according to the French-American-British classification. Cell samples from 12 acute myeloid leukemias were cultured in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Addition to these cultures of anti-CD33 antibody resulted in approximately 70% inhibition of cell proliferation as assessed by [(3)H]thymidine uptake or by the recovery of viable cells. Anti-p75/AIRM-1 antibody exerted a strong inhibitory effect only in two cases characterized by a high in vitro proliferation rate. After crosslinking of CD33 (but not of p75/AIRM-1), leukemic cells bound Annexin V and displayed changes in their light-scattering properties and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, thus providing evidence for the occurrence of apoptotic cell death. Remarkably, when anti-CD33 antibody was used in combination with concentrations of etoposide insufficient to induce apoptosis when used alone, a synergistic effect could be detected in the induction of leukemic cell death. These studies provide the rationale for new therapeutic approaches in myeloid leukemias by using both chemotherapy and apoptosis-inducing mAbs.","['Vitale, C', 'Romagnani, C', 'Puccetti, A', 'Olive, D', 'Costello, R', 'Chiossone, L', 'Pitto, A', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Moretta, L', 'Mingari, M C']","['Vitale C', 'Romagnani C', 'Puccetti A', 'Olive D', 'Costello R', 'Chiossone L', 'Pitto A', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Moretta L', 'Mingari MC']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale and Dipartimento di Oncologia, Biologia e Genetica, Universita degli Studi di Genova, 16132 Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/26 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.091097198 [doi]', '091097198 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 May 8;98(10):5764-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.091097198.

We report transcriptional regulation of the hST3Gal I gene in colon adenocarcinoma and leukemia cell lines. To determine the genomic structure of the 5'-untranslated region, we cloned and identified the 5'-untranslated region of hST3Gal I from a human genome library. The 5'-untranslated region was found to be divided into three exons, namely, exons Y, X, and C1. The transcription initiation sites map at -1035 bp from the translation initiation site. Our results indicate that the transcriptional regulation of hST3Gal I depends on the pI promoter that exists 5'-upstream of exon Y in these cell lines. The results of luciferase assay suggest that the nt -304 to -145 region is important for transcriptional activity of hST3Gal I gene in both cell lines. The nt -304 to -145 region contains two sequences similar to the Sp1 recognition elements (GC-box) and one USF binding site. The results of site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the Sp1 binding sites and USF binding site of the pI promoter are involved in the transcription of hST3Gal I mRNA. However, the triple mutant of these sites still exhibits about 50% transcriptional activity, suggesting that there are other transcription factors involved in the transcription of hST3Gal I mRNA. These results suggest that these factors may play a critical role in the up-regulation of the hST3Gal I gene during malignant transformation.","['Taniguchi, A', 'Yoshikawa, I', 'Matsumoto, K']","['Taniguchi A', 'Yoshikawa I', 'Matsumoto K']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toho University, 2-2-1, Miyama, Funabashi, Chiba 274-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.4 (beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'Exons', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Genome', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sialyltransferases/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/26 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/04/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/glycob/11.3.241 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycobiology. 2001 Mar;11(3):241-7. doi: 10.1093/glycob/11.3.241.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB046716'],,,,,

We report three cases of asymptomatic ischemic retinopathy in cancer patients receiving interferon. DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional, noncomparative small case series. METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical records and fundus photographs. RESULTS: Interferon-induced ischemic retinopathy can occur in asymptomatic cancer patients. The retinal changes are usually reversible with discontinuation of interferon therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These three cases underscore the importance of dilated funduscopic examination at baseline and during follow-up, at least every 3 months, for all cancer patients receiving interferon to identify retinal toxicity at its earliest stages. A prospective study evaluating the incidence and severity of interferon retinopathy in cancer patients would be prudent.","['Esmaeli, B', 'Koller, C', 'Papadopoulos, N', 'Romaguera, J']","['Esmaeli B', 'Koller C', 'Papadopoulos N', 'Romaguera J']","['Ophthalmology Section, Department of Plastic Surgery, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*adverse effects', 'Ischemia/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/secondary', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Retinal Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Retinal Vessels/*drug effects/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Visual Acuity']",2001/04/26 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-6420(01)00546-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-6420(01)00546-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 2001 May;108(5):858-60. doi: 10.1016/s0161-6420(01)00546-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently no efficient antiviral treatment is known. Thus, testing new modalities of early diagnosis and treatment is a crucial objective. Adenovirus infection is defined by the combination of symptoms and the isolation of virus from the source of clinical symptoms. The involvement of two or more organs and the presence of virus in blood cultures define disseminated disease. Seven children with a median age of 7 years received bone marrow transplantation for leukemia. All received an unrelated graft without T cell depletion. Adenovirus was sought in blood, urine and biopsy specimens using PCR and culture. Analysis of biopsy specimens included systematic immunohistochemistry. Cidofovir treatment was initiated as soon as biopsy revealed the histopathological signs of adenovirus. Cidofovir was given at 5 mg/kg once weekly for 3 weeks then every 2 weeks. Six patients had diarrhoea and one patient had cystitis. Adenovirus infection and disseminated disease were diagnosed in four cases and three cases, respectively. In six cases, serotype A31 was isolated from gastrointestinal biopsy and in two cases serotypes B2 and C6 were detected in blood and urine. Cidofovir treatment was associated with clinical improvement of diarrhoea, cystitis and fever in five patients, in whom the virus became undetectable in cultures and PCR analyses despite the persistence of immunodeficiency. The median follow-up was 360 days after BMT (240-570). One child died of invasive aspergillosis and another of disseminated adenovirus after interruption of cidofovir therapy.

The cytotoxic activity of these compounds was determined using a salivary gland tumor cell line (HSG), oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HSC-2) and human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60). A parabolic relationship between the cytotoxicity and log P (the octanol-water partition coefficient) was observed, showing that both BHA and bis-MMP, with a log P of 3-4, were the most cytotoxic. The cytotoxic activity of the 2-methoxy derivatives, eugenol, MMP and bis-MMP, against HSG cells was significantly enhanced by visible-light irradiation, possibly due to their high redox potential. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy indicated that eugenol and BHA alone produced radicals under alkaline conditions (pH > 9.5), and eugenol most efficiently scavenges reactive oxygen species (O2-). Antioxidative reactivity of eugenol-related compounds was determined by measuring the inhibiting periods of the AIBN (2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile)/MMA (methyl methacrylate) polymerization system, and the number of moles of peroxy radical trapped by moles of the relevant phenols (stoichiometric factor, n). It was found that the n values of eugenol and MMP were approximately 1, whereas those of BHA >2, suggesting that eugenol and MMP undergo dimerization through radical-radical couplings through quinone methides, whereas BHA undergoes the competitive interaction with poly-MMA radicals after oxidation by AIBN-peroxy radicals. BHA was an efficient peroxy radical-scavenger, but possibly reacted with polymer radicals of the lipid, thus mediating the cytotoxicity. The n value of bis-BHA was two, whereas those of bis-EUG and bis-MMP were 1.6-1.7, suggesting that the latter were further oxidized. The enthalpies of phenoxyl radical formation were determined using the semi-empirical PM3 quantum-mechanical method and the possible link to redox potential was discussed.","['Fujisawa, S', 'Atsumi, T', 'Satoh, K', 'Kadoma, Y', 'Ishihara, M', 'Okada, N', 'Nagasaki, M', 'Yokoe, I', 'Sakagami, H']","['Fujisawa S', 'Atsumi T', 'Satoh K', 'Kadoma Y', 'Ishihara M', 'Okada N', 'Nagasaki M', 'Yokoe I', 'Sakagami H']","['Department of Oral Diagnosis, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Saitama, Japan. fujisawa@dent.meikai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,In Vitr Mol Toxicol,In vitro & molecular toxicology,9808800,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '3T8H1794QW (Eugenol)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Antioxidants/metabolism/toxicity', 'Eugenol/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*metabolism', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mouth Neoplasms', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/25 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/25 10:00'],"['2001/04/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/25 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vitr Mol Toxicol. 2000 Winter;13(4):269-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was also a positive association with CLL (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-3.0). Finally, transfusion was associated with nodal (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5) but not extranodal (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7-2.1) NHL. Further adjustment for marital status, farm residence, diabetes, alcohol use, smoking, and red meat and fruit consumption did not alter these associations. In conclusion, prior blood transfusion was associated with NHL and CLL, and the strongest associations were seen for low-grade NHL, particularly follicular and small lymphocytic NHL.","['Cerhan, J R', 'Wallace, R B', 'Dick, F', 'Kemp, J', 'Parker, A S', 'Zheng, W', 'Sellers, T A', 'Folsom, A R']","['Cerhan JR', 'Wallace RB', 'Dick F', 'Kemp J', 'Parker AS', 'Zheng W', 'Sellers TA', 'Folsom AR']","['Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. cerhan.james@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', '*Transfusion Reaction']",2001/04/25 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/04/25 10:00'],"['2001/04/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/25 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2001 Apr;10(4):361-8.,"['K07 CA64220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA39741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the TNF gene and the LT-alpha gene, polymorphisms have been identified at nucleotide positions -308 and +252, respectively. The variant alleles for TNF are designated TNF1 and TNF2, the ones for LT-alpha LT-alpha (10.5 kb) and LT-alpha (5.5 kb). Of interest, TNF2 and LT-alpha (5.5 kb) were shown to be associated with higher TNF and LT-alpha plasma levels than their counterparts. In the present study, we investigated the associations of the above mentioned polymorphisms with risk of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated according to Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) protocols. METHODS: Matched case-control study of 64 relapsed and 64 successfully treated non-relapsed childhood B-cell precursor ALL patients of standard and intermediate risk for treatment failure. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) for the combined category of TNF1/TNF2 and TNF2/TNF2 genotypes in comparison to the TNF1/TNF1 genotype was 1.17 (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.53 - 2.56, P = 0.697). The ORs for the LT-alpha (10.5 kb/5.5 kb) and the LT-alpha (5.5 kb/5.5 kb) genotypes with reference to the LT-alpha (10.5 kb/10.5 kb) genotype were 2.17 (95 % CI = 0.84 - 5.58, P = 0.107) and 0.5 (95 % CI = 0.09 - 2.66, P = 0.418), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not suggest a major role of the investigated genetic polymorphisms with regard to risk of relapse in standard- and intermediate-risk childhood B-cell precursor ALL treated according to BFM protocols.","['Stanulla, Martin', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Welte, Karl', 'Schrappe, Martin']","['Stanulla M', 'Schrauder A', 'Welte K', 'Schrappe M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany. stanulla.martin@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Blood Disord,BMC blood disorders,100968550,,,,2001/04/25 10:00,2001/04/25 10:01,['2001/04/25 10:00'],"['2000/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2001/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1471-2326-1-2 [doi]'],ppublish,BMC Blood Disord. 2001;1(1):2. doi: 10.1186/1471-2326-1-2.,,,,,,,PMC32163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently demonstrated that the major breakpoint region (mbr) of BCL2, which is implicated in 70% of t(14;18) translocations present in human follicular lymphoma, is a matrix attachment region. Since these regions are implicated in control of both transcription and replication, we wished to determine whether BCL2 translocation was also accompanied by changes in replication timing of the translocated allele. Using both fluorescence in situ hybridization and allele-specific PCR, we have demonstrated that the translocated allele replicates at the G1/S boundary, while the wildtype allele continues to replicate as usual in mid-S phase. These differences are accompanied by allele-specific changes in BCL2 expression. Since the net structural effect of t(14;18) translocations within the mbr is to disrupt the BCL2 MAR and replace it with the IGH MARs located just downstream of each breakpoint, we conclude that MAR exchange is a significant, selectable outcome of these translocations. We propose that subsequent changes of replication and transcriptional patterns for the translocated BCL2 allele result from this exchange and represent important early steps in lymphomagenesis.","['Sun, Y', 'Wyatt, R T', 'Bigley, A', 'Krontiris, T G']","['Sun Y', 'Wyatt RT', 'Bigley A', 'Krontiris TG']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope National Medical Center, 1450 E.

This study describes a gentle and simple method to concentrate MLV vectors or HIV vectors pseudotyped with MLV envelopes. Having a fast and inexpensive method to concentrate large volumes of vector supernatant will facilitate in vivo experiments and clinical trials that require high titer vector stocks. METHODS: The methods employed in the study were co-precipitation of viral supernatant with calcium phosphate, low-speed centrifugation, dialysis, and infection assays with Lac-Z transducing vectors. RESULTS: Murine leukemia virus vectors and HIV vectors pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV.G) or MLV envelopes were concentrated successfully using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Parameters that influence virus yield and the reproducibility of the method were investigated. The optimized protocol involves virus harvest in serum-free media, co-precipitation using 60mM calcium chloride, pelleting at 2,000 g, resuspending the pellet in a small volume of 0.1M EDTA-saline, and dialysis against saline to remove EDTA. Volumes were decreased from 300 ml to 10 ml, with 50-100% recovery, and titers can be concentrated up to 1,000-fold.

MRD monitoring of APL was performed with standard and nested RT-PCR for PML/RARalpha gene, the sensitivity of which was 1 leukemic cell in 10(3)-10(4) and 1 in 10(4)-10(5) cells, respectively. Patients were nine children with APL (average age: 8.3 year; average period of follow-up: 69.2 months) who, after achieving remission with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), received treatment either with multidrug chemotherapy or with a combination of chemotherapy and ATRA. Out of six patients treated with multidrug-combined chemotherapy, two patients exhibited PCR positivity after six months of post- remission therapy, which shifted from the detectable range of the nested PCR to that of the standard PCR. These two patients subsequently relapsed and, together with two of the other patients receiving multidrug-combined chemotherapy, underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. No MRD was detected in these patients after transplantation. In the remaining three patients who underwent cyclic treatment with alternative chemotherapy and ATRA, two showed positive RT-PCR at the nested or standard level, respectively, after six months of combined therapy, and one of them relapsed. Overall, three of four patients with MRD detected in post-remission period ultimately relapsed, while all of five patients without detectable MRD had a good prognosis. These findings suggest that impending relapse may be predicted by the detection of preceding PCR positivity with an increasing quantity of the PML/RARalpha mRNA that appears beyond six months of post-remission chemotherapy, with or without combined ATRA therapy.","['Suzuki, H', 'Imaizumi, M', 'Sato, A', 'Yoshinari, M', 'Rikiishi, T', 'Endo, M', 'Takano, T', 'Shimizu, T', 'Hatae, Y', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Iinuma, K']","['Suzuki H', 'Imaizumi M', 'Sato A', 'Yoshinari M', 'Rikiishi T', 'Endo M', 'Takano T', 'Shimizu T', 'Hatae Y', 'Fujimoto T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Iinuma K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2001/04/25 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/04/25 10:00'],"['2001/04/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1620/tjem.193.127 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2001 Feb;193(2):127-39. doi: 10.1620/tjem.193.127.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent availability of clonality studies have repeatedly shown that a significant number of female patients diagnosed as E.T. according the most stringent criteria had a definitely polyclonal myelopoiesis. Although the incidence of patients newly diagnosed every year is low, there is in fact a conspicuous population of E.T., followed as outpatients in every department of hematology or internal medicine, including a large number of young females. These eventualities should be integrated in further discussions of the benefit/risk ratio of cytoreduction with the presently available drugs. The combination of several evidence-based data is the basis of a widely accepted stratification of high-risk patients defined by any of the following features. Age > 60 to 65. History of thrombosis or embolic or major ischemic events. Platelet counts in excess of 1000 or 1500 x 10(9)/L. In the question of chemotherapy in E.T., growing concern comes from the potential leukemogenic risk associated with the presently available drugs and extends beyond Melphalan, Busulfan and other alkylating agents and includes non-alkylating agents like Hydroxyurea. At the same time, much attention has been paid to the introduction of very precise initial diagnostic criteria directed to elimination of other myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disorders with an increased risk of transformation. Present treatment of E.T. is a compromise between prevention of E.T. related thrombotic and bleeding complications on one hand and long term side effects and toxicity of the presently available drugs on the other hand. The recent availability of non mutagenic drugs like Interferon and most of all Anagrelide; the recognition of the role of antiaggregating agents in the treatment of platelet related microvascular ischemic events gives the opportunity for further comparative prospective trials.

Retrospective evidence indicates that vascular occlusion occurs less frequently when the PCV is controlled at normal levels. Venesection is the treatment of choice to lower the PCV.

We postulated that exposure to agents associated with increased leukemia risk would induce genomic changes in cells in the hsc compartment. Aneusomy involving chromosomes 2 and 11 in sorted hsc (Lin(-)c-kit(+)Sca-1(+)) and maturing lymphoid and myeloid cells from mice that received topical doses of benzene (bz) or trichloroethylene (TCE) was quantified using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Six days after bz or TCE exposure, aneuploid cells in the hsc compartment increase four- to eightfold in a dose- and schedule-independent manner. Aneuploid lymphoid and myeloid cells from bz- and TCE-treated mice approximate controls, except after repeated benzene exposures. Aneuploid cells are more frequent in the hsc compartment than in mature hematopoietic subpopulations. Hematotoxicity was also quantified in bz- and TCE-exposed hematopoietic subpopulations using two colony-forming assays: CFU-GM (colony-forming units/granulocyte-macrophage progenitors) and CAFC (cobblestone area-forming cells). Data indicate that bz is transiently cytotoxic (< or =1 week) to hsc subpopulations, and induces more persistent toxicity (>2 weeks) in maturing, committed progenitor subpopulations. TCE is not hematotoxic at the doses applied. In conclusion, we provide direct evidence for induction of aneuploidy in cells in the hsc compartment by topical exposure to bz and TCE. Disruption of genomic integrity and/or toxicity in hsc subpopulations may be one step in leukemic progression.","['Giver, C R', 'Wong, R', 'Moore, D H 2nd', 'Pallavicini, M G']","['Giver CR', 'Wong R', 'Moore DH 2nd', 'Pallavicini MG']","['Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143-0808, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '290YE8AR51 (Trichloroethylene)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Administration, Cutaneous', '*Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'Benzene/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Trichloroethylene/administration & dosage/*toxicity']",2001/04/24 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/04/24 10:00'],"['2001/04/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/em.1027 [pii]', '10.1002/em.1027 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2001;37(3):185-94. doi: 10.1002/em.1027.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that an increased level of regeneration in the host muscle enhances incorporation of donor myoblasts. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) increases the number of dystrophic fibers expressing dystrophin after myoblast transplantation and enhances regeneration in injured and diseased muscle. Morphometric analysis was used to investigate whether an increased level of regeneration is induced by LIF after myoblast transplantation. We found that, in muscles treated with LIF, the number of fibers undergoing regeneration was increased. The increased incorporation of donor myoblasts and thus dystrophin expression induced by LIF may be due, at least in part, to an increased level of regeneration of dystrophic muscle.","['White, J D', 'Bower, J J', 'Kurek, J B', 'Austin, L']","['White JD', 'Bower JJ', 'Kurek JB', 'Austin L']","[""Melbourne Neuromuscular Research Center, St. Vincent's Hospital, Victoria Parade, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia. jwhite@anhb.uwa.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Muscle Nerve,Muscle & nerve,7803146,"['0 (Dystrophin)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Dystrophin/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/transplantation', 'Muscle, Skeletal/cytology/*physiology', 'Regeneration/*drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2001/04/24 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/24 10:00'],"['2001/04/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/mus.1057 [pii]', '10.1002/mus.1057 [doi]']",ppublish,Muscle Nerve. 2001 May;24(5):695-7. doi: 10.1002/mus.1057.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

One approach is to analyze blood transfusion costs for individual medical and surgical Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). Rank ordering of DRGs by transfusion costs and interinstitutional comparisons of these costs may lead to the selection of DRGs for further analysis of the process of blood transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Common DRGs (n = 486) that were related to discharges in 1995 were analyzed from 60 university hospital members of the University HealthSystems Consortium (UHC). Cost data were tabulated by using cost-to-charge ratios reflecting all aspects of blood transfusion-related costs of participating institutions. RESULTS: Of these 486 DRGs, 471 had identifiable mean blood costs, and 34 had median blood costs, mostly for surgical conditions. Transfusion costs represented a small proportion (< or = 1%) of total hospitalization costs for most DRGS: Nonetheless, millions of dollars were spent on blood transfusion, and for the most expensive DRGs, the costs ranged from 5.0 to 8.6 percent of total hospitalization costs. Transfusion costs are more variable for the DRGs with the lowest transfusion costs than for those with the highest transfusion costs. CONCLUSION: Members of the UHC may utilize such analyses to identify surgical or medical diagnoses with transfusion costs at variance with the group norm. These DRGs could then be targeted for further evaluation of components contributing to high costs, for possible alterations in physician or clinical laboratory practices. Considering those conditions with the highest cumulative transfusion costs (e.g., BMT, liver transplant, acute leukemia, and cardiothoracic procedures), changes in transfusion practices that affect these particular patient categories may have a significant impact on global blood transfusion costs.","['Jefferies, L C', 'Sachais, B S', 'Young, D S']","['Jefferies LC', 'Sachais BS', 'Young DS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. jefferie@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Blood Transfusion/*economics', '*Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Databases, Factual', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'United States']",2001/04/24 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/04/24 10:00'],"['2001/04/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.2001.41040522.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2001 Apr;41(4):522-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2001.41040522.x.,['P01-HL-54516-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Transfusion. 2001 Apr;41(4):437-9.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Adult male mice were locally irradiated on the testes. Induction of apoptosis in the different testicular cell types following X-ray radiation was identified by the TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) approach. Growth factor expression was evidenced by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. RESULTS: Apoptosis, identified through the TUNEL approach, occurred in radiosensitive testicular (premeotic) germ cells with the following kinetics: the number of apoptotic cells increased after 24 h (p < 0.001) and was maximal 48 h after a 2-Gy ionizing radiation (p < 0.001). Apoptotic cells were no longer observed 72 h after a 2-Gy irradiation. The number of apoptotic cells increased with the dose of irradiation (1-4 Gy). In the seminiferous tubules, the growth factor expression in premeiotic radiosensitive germ cells was modulated by irradiation. Indeed Fas, c-kit, and LIF-R expression, which occurs in (radiosensitive) germ cells, decreased 24 h after a 2-Gy irradiation, and the maximal decrease was observed with a 4-Gy irradiation. The decrease in Stra8 expression occurred earlier, at 4 h after a 2-Gy irradiation. In addition, a significant (p < 0.03) decrease in Stra8 mRNA levels was observed at the lowest dose used (0.5 Gy, 48 h). Moreover, concerning a growth factor receptor, such as TGFbeta RI, which is expressed both in radiosensitive and radioresistant cells, we observed a differential expression depending on the cell radiosensitivity after irradiation. Indeed, TGFbeta RI expression was increased after irradiation in interstitial radioresistant testicular cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while it decreased in seminiferous radiosensitive (germ cells) testicular cells. Such a differential expression between radioresistant and radiosensitive cells in TGFbeta RI levels was observed in terms of both mRNA and protein. In contrast, the growth factors specifically expressed in the somatic radioresistant (Sertoli) cells in the seminiferous tubules (SCF, Fas-L, TNF R55) were not affected by ionizing radiation (up to 4 Gy, 72 h). CONCLUSION: Growth factor expression decreased in the radiosensitive testicular cells after irradiation. Such a decrease occurred before the detection of apoptosis using the TUNEL approach. TGFbeta RI mRNA levels decreased in the radiosensitive cells, whereas it increased in the radioresistant cells, suggesting that TGFbeta RI may represent a biomarker of the intrinsic radiosensitivity of cells.","['Mauduit, C', 'Siah, A', 'Foch, M', 'Chapet, O', 'Clippe, S', 'Gerard, J P', 'Benahmed, M']","['Mauduit C', 'Siah A', 'Foch M', 'Chapet O', 'Clippe S', 'Gerard JP', 'Benahmed M']","['Laboratoire de Recherche sur les Communications Cellulaires en Biologie de la Reproduction, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Faculte de Medecine Lyon-Sud, BP 12, 69 921 Oullins cedex, France. mauduit@lsgrisn1.univ-lyon1.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Radiation Tolerance/physiology', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sertoli Cells/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Spermatozoa/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Testis/cytology/*metabolism/*radiation effects']",2001/04/24 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/24 10:00'],"['2001/04/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(01)01461-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(01)01461-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 May 1;50(1):203-12. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(01)01461-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each approach represents a fundamentally different source of data from which plutonium risk estimates can be derived. These are: (1) epidemiologic studies of workers exposed to plutonium; (2) epidemiologic studies of persons exposed to low-LET radiation combined with a factor for the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of plutonium alpha particles appropriate for each cancer site of concern; (3) epidemiologic studies of persons exposed to alpha-emitting radionuclides other than plutonium; and (4) controlled studies of animals exposed to plutonium and other alpha-emitting radionuclides extrapolated to humans. This procedure yielded the following organ-specific estimates of the distribution of mortality risk per unit dose from exposure to plutonium expressed as the median estimate with the 5th to 95th percentiles of the distribution in parentheses: lung 0.13 Gy(-1) (0.022-0.53 Gy(-1)); liver 0.057 Gy(-1) (0.011-0.47 Gy(-1)); bone 0.0013 Gy(-1) (0.000060-0.025 Gy(-1)); bone marrow (leukemia), 0.013 Gy(-1) (0.00061-0.05 Gy(-1)). Because the different tissues do not receive the same dose following an inhalation exposure, the mortality risk per unit intake of activity via inhalation of a 1-microm AMAD plutonium aerosol also was determined. To do this, inhalation dose coefficients based on the most recent ICRP models and accounting for input parameter uncertainties were combined with the risk coefficients described above. The following estimates of the distribution of mortality risk per unit intake were determined for a 1-microm AMAD plutonium aerosol with a geometric standard deviation of 2.5: lung 5.3 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (0.65-35 x 10(-7) Bq(-1)), liver 1.2 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (0.091-20 x 10(-7) Bq(-1)), bone 0.11 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (0.0030-4.3 x 10(-7) Bq(-1)), bone marrow (leukemia) 0.049 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (0.0017-0.59 x 10(-7) Bq(-1)). The cancer mortality risk for all sites was estimated to be 10 x 10(-7) Bq(-1) (2.1-55 x 10(-7) Bq(-1))--a result that agrees very well with other recent estimates. The large uncertainties in the risks per unit intake of activity reflect the combined uncertainty in the dose and risk coefficients.","['Grogan, H A', 'Sinclair, W K', 'Voilleque, P G']","['Grogan HA', 'Sinclair WK', 'Voilleque PG']",['grogan@bendnet.com'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)']",IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects', 'Alpha Particles/adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Linear Energy Transfer', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Plutonium/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/04/24 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/24 10:00'],"['2001/04/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-200105000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 2001 May;80(5):447-61. doi: 10.1097/00004032-200105000-00005.,,['Health Phys. 2002 Jun;82(6):902-3; author reply 903-4.

Differential diagnosis of hematological, neurogenic, and myogenic neoplasms.",271-9,"CD56-positive nasal and nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma is now a well-defined disease entity. Rare cases of blastic NK-cell lymphoma positive for CD56 have been recently reported. However, CD56 expression is also identified in several types of non-hematopoietic small round cell tumors in which lymphoma is included as a differential consideration. Here, we present nine cases of CD56+ small round cell tumors of histological origin unrelated to nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Eight of the nine cases presented as solid tumors of the sinonasal region. Clinical, histological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical examination and gene analysis for T-cell receptor (TcR) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes and in situ hybridization (ISH) for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were performed. Two cases presented with features consistent with blastic NK-cell lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma of NK-cell phenotype. These cases showed features of lymphoblastic lymphoma, phenotypes of sCD3-, cCD3+, CD45+, CD56+, TdT+, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+, germline of IgH and TcR genes, and EBV negative reactivity. One case had myeloid/NK-precursor acute leukemia/lymphoma with a phenotype of CD13+, CD33+, CD34+, CD56+, and MPO-. Three cases were neurogenic, including one case of olfactory neuroblastoma and two of primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). It was difficult to differentiate CD56+ PNET from blastic NK-cell lymphoma, especially when only paraffin-embedded sections were available. Myogenic markers, such as HHF35, alpha-sarcomeric actin, and desmin, were positive in three cases of rhabdomyosarcomas. Our findings suggest that as CD56 is used more routinely as a marker in immunohistochemical staining, the differential diagnosis of extranodal lymphohematological malignancies and small round cell tumors will become more complicated.","['Liu, Q', 'Ohshima, K', 'Sumie, A', 'Suzushima, H', 'Iwasaki, H', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Liu Q', 'Ohshima K', 'Sumie A', 'Suzushima H', 'Iwasaki H', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Nanakuma 7-45-1, Jonanku, Fukuoka 814-01, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/diagnosis', 'Nose Neoplasms/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology']",2001/04/24 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/24 10:00'],"['2001/04/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004280000326 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2001 Mar;438(3):271-9. doi: 10.1007/s004280000326.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the involvement of BSAP in the growth regulation of malignant B-1 cells derived from the NZB murine model of human chronic lymphocytic leukemia. BSAP protein was found in normal B-2 cells, elevated in normal B-1 cells, and highest in NZB malignant B-1 cells. When these malignant B-1 cells were treated with antisense oligonucleotides for BSAP, their growth was inhibited with a G2/M phase arrest. In contrast, B cell lines that did not appear to be of B-1 origin (IgG+/B220+/BSAPlow) were unaffected by treatment with antisense BSAP oligonucleotides. Centrifugal elutriation experiments showed that BSAP mRNA was expressed at the highest levels in the G2/M phases in malignant B-1 cells. Treatment with demecolcine (Colcemid), a known mitotic blocker, resulted in a decrease in the level of BSAP gene expression in malignant B-1 cells, further demonstrating links between BSAP expression and successful G2/M transition in the cell cycle. These data suggest a correlation between BSAP and the development of B-1 malignancy, perhaps through the regulation of cell-cycle progression.","['Chong, S Y', 'Zhang, M', 'Lin, Y C', 'Coffman, F', 'Garcia, Z', 'Ponzio, N', 'Raveche, E S']","['Chong SY', 'Zhang M', 'Lin YC', 'Coffman F', 'Garcia Z', 'Ponzio N', 'Raveche ES']","['Department of Pathology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey/New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', '*Transcription Factors']",2001/04/24 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/24 10:00'],"['2001/04/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620000165 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2001 Mar;50(1):41-50. doi: 10.1007/s002620000165.,['CA71478/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since these chimeric proteins are expressed only in leukemic cells they have the potential to serve as tumor-specific antigens for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Using the 12B1 murine leukemia cell line, derived by retroviral transformation of BALB/c bone marrow cells with the bcr-abl (b3a2) fusion gene, we have demonstrated that intravenous inoculation of 12B1 cells into BALB/c mice results in a disseminated acute leukemia analogous to human CML in blast crisis. Histological sections of liver and spleen and polymerase chain reaction analysis of peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver, spleen and lymph nodes confirmed the presence of bcr-abl+ leukemia cells in these murine tissues, while Western blot data demonstrated the expression of the fusion protein in 12B1 cells. Immunization of mice with dendritic cells (DC) loaded with the synthetic bcr-abl chimeric nonapeptide, GFKQSSKAL, led to a 150 times higher frequency of bcr-abl-specific CTL precursors in the spleen than in mice immunized with peptide alone. In vitro re-stimulation of DC-peptide-primed splenocytes resulted in substantial secretion of interferon gamma and augmented cytolytic activity against 12B1 targets. Finally, vaccination with peptide-loaded DC significantly prolonged survival of BALB/c mice that were challenged with 12B1 leukemia. The capacity to generate bcr-abl-specific CTL in vivo by DC-based immunization may have clinical implications in the treatment of CML.","['He, L', 'Feng, H', 'Raymond, A', 'Kreeger, M', 'Zeng, Y', 'Graner, M', 'Whitesell, L', 'Katsanis, E']","['He L', 'Feng H', 'Raymond A', 'Kreeger M', 'Zeng Y', 'Graner M', 'Whitesell L', 'Katsanis E']","[""University of Arizona, Department of Pediatrics, Steele Memorial Children's Research Center, 1501 N.

METHODS: The pattern of migration of human monocytes towards the supernatants of blasts from 15 patients with AML was studied and the role of MCP-1, produced by these blasts, was assessed. RESULTS: In 4 patients (group 1) the amount of monocyte migration was low and not inhibited by the addition of anti-hMCP-1. In 11 patients, the amount of monocyte migration was high; after addition of anti-hMCP-1, monocyte migration was either completely (8 patients, group 2), or partly or not (3 patients, group 3) inhibited to the level of chemokinesis. In groups 1 and 2, there was a good correlation (r = 0.67) between the concentration of MCP-1 in the supernatants and the amount of monocyte migration. In group 3, such a correlation was not evident, suggesting that another chemokine might be involved or MCP-1 function was impaired by an unknown substance. Finally, measurements of MCP-1 during culture of AML blasts showed that the time at which maximal amounts of MCP-1 are produced differs between the AML samples. CONCLUSIONS: AML blasts produce different amounts of MCP-1, which plays an important role in monocyte migration towards most AML blasts. Therefore, in the context of adoptive immunotherapy, MCP-1 might be involved in future tumor vaccination programmes using autologous MCP-1-transfected irradiated AML blasts.","['Legdeur, M C', 'Broekhoven, M G', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'Beelen, R H', 'Ossenkoppele, G J']","['Legdeur MC', 'Broekhoven MG', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Beelen RH', 'Ossenkoppele GJ']","['Department of Hematology, BR 240, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)']",IM,"['Cancer Vaccines/immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CCL2/analysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Monocytes/*physiology']",2001/04/24 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/24 10:00'],"['2001/04/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620000161 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2001 Mar;50(1):16-22. doi: 10.1007/s002620000161.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A critical question in comparing an experimental treatment to a standard is how much increase in an adverse event rate is an acceptable trade-off for achieving a targeted improvement in efficacy, or vice versa. We consider settings where one may characterize patient outcome as a bivariate (efficacy, safety) variable and quantify treatment effect as a corresponding two-dimensional parameter. A set of target parameters, each representing a clinically meaningful improvement over the standard, are elicited from the physician. Each target is a two-dimensional generalization of the usual one-dimensional shift parameter. We define the alternative hypothesis in the two-dimensional effect space as the convex hull of the sets of parameters that are at least as desirable as each target point. The rejection region is obtained by shifting the alternative toward (0,0) to achieve a given type I error, with sample size computed to achieve a given power at the targets. The method is illustrated by application to two cancer chemotherapy trials.","['Thall, P F', 'Cheng, S C']","['Thall PF', 'Cheng SC']","['Department of Biostatistics, M. D.

We previously reported that the trans-activator Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) induces endogenous cyclin D2 expression along with cell cycle progression in a resting human T-cell line, Kit 225, suggesting a role of cyclin D2 in Tax-mediated cell cycle progression. The cyclin D2 gene has a typical E2F binding element, raising the possibility that induction of cyclin D2 expression is a consequence of cell cycle progression. In this study, we examined the role and molecular mechanism of induction of the endogenous human cyclin D2 gene by Tax. Introduction of p19(INK4d), a cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor of the INK4 family specific for D-type CDK, inhibited Tax-mediated activation of E2F, indicating requirement of D-type CDK in Tax-mediated activation of E2F. Previously indicated E2F binding element and two NF-kappaB-like binding elements in the 1.6 kbp cyclin D2 promoter fragment had little, if any, effect on responsiveness to Tax. We found that trans-activation of the cyclin D2 promoter by Tax was mainly mediated by a newly identified NF-kappaB-like element with auxiliary contribution of a CRE-like element residing in sequences downstream of -444 which were by themselves sufficient for trans-activation by Tax. These results indicate that Tax directly trans-activates the cyclin D2 gene, resulting in growth promotion and perhaps leukemogenesis through activation of D-type CDK.","['Huang, Y', 'Ohtani, K', 'Iwanaga, R', 'Matsumura, Y', 'Nakamura, M']","['Huang Y', 'Ohtani K', 'Iwanaga R', 'Matsumura Y', 'Nakamura M']","['Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['*Carrier Proteins', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2000/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2000/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204198 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Mar 1;20(9):1094-102. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204198.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These rearrangements are mostly due to chromosome translocations and result in production of chimeric proteins composed of the N-terminal fragment of ALL-1 and the C-terminal segments of the partner proteins. The most common chromosome translocation involving ALL-1 is the t(4 : 11) associated with ALL. ALL-1 is the human homologue of Drosophila trithorax and directly activates transcription of multiple Hox genes. A preliminary DNA microarray screen indicated that the Meis1, HoxA9 and AC133 genes were overexpressed in ALLs with t(4 : 11), compared to ALLs with very similar phenotype but without the chromosomal abnormality. These genes, as well as additional five Hox genes, were subjected to comprehensive semi-quantitative or quantitative RT-PCR analysis in 57 primary ALL and AML tumors. Meis1 and HoxA9 were found expressed in 13/14 of ALLs with the t(4 : 11) and in 8/8 of AMLs with ALL-1 rearrangements. The two genes were not consistently transcribed in other types of ALL. AC133 was transcribed in 13/14 of ALLs with t(4 : 11), but in only 4/8 of AMLs with ALL-1 rearrangements. HoxA10 was expressed in most leukemias with ALL-1 alterations, but was also transcribed in PrePreB CD10(-) ALLs lacking the t(4 : 11). Expression of HoxA5, HoxA7, HoxC8 and HoxC10 did not correlate with ALL-1 rearrangements. Coexpression of Meis1 and HoxA9, overexpression of HoxA10, and overexpression or fusion of HoxA9 were previously implicated in certain acute myeloid leukemias in mice and humans. The present work suggests that upregulation of Meis1, HoxA9, and possibly HoxA10 might also play a role in pathogenesis of acute lymphocytic and acute myeloid leukemias associated with ALL-1 fusions.","['Rozovskaia, T', 'Feinstein, E', 'Mor, O', 'Foa, R', 'Blechman, J', 'Nakamura, T', 'Croce, C M', 'Cimino, G', 'Canaani, E']","['Rozovskaia T', 'Feinstein E', 'Mor O', 'Foa R', 'Blechman J', 'Nakamura T', 'Croce CM', 'Cimino G', 'Canaani E']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Up-Regulation']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2000/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2000/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204174 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Feb 15;20(7):874-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204174.,['CA 50507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the murine pro-B Ba/F3 cell line, this fusion constitutively activates the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (Stat5) factors and, as a consequence, induces the sustained expression of various Stat5-target genes including the Cytokine Inducible SH2-containing protein (Cis) gene, which codes for a member of the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (Socs) protein family. In TEL-Jak2-transformed Ba/F3 cells, we also observed the upregulation of the Socs1 gene, whose product has been reported to negatively regulate the Jak kinase activity. In transient transfection experiments, Socs1 physically interacts with TEL-Jak2 and interferes with the TEL-Jak2-induced phosphorylation and activation of Stat5 factors, probably through the Socs1-induced proteasome-mediated degradation of the fusion protein. Interestingly, TEL-Jak2-expressing Ba/F3 cells were found to be resistant to the anti-proliferative activities of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) seemingly as a consequence of Socs1 constitutive expression. These results indicate that the Socs1-dependent cytokine feedback loop, although active, is bypassed by the TEL-Jak2 fusion, but may play a role in the leukemogenic process by altering the cytokine responses of the leukemic cells. Our results also suggest that Socs1 plays a role in shutting down the signaling from the normally activated Jak2 kinase by inducing its proteasome-dependent degradation.","['Monni, R', 'Santos, S C', 'Mauchauffe, M', 'Berger, R', 'Ghysdael, J', 'Gouilleux, F', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Bernard, O', 'Penard-Lacronique, V']","['Monni R', 'Santos SC', 'Mauchauffe M', 'Berger R', 'Ghysdael J', 'Gouilleux F', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Bernard O', 'Penard-Lacronique V']","[""INSERM U434, Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH), 27 Rue Juliette Dodu, 75010 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mice', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Interferon/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2000/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2000/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204201 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Feb 15;20(7):849-58. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRalpha is known to activate transcription of specific genes in the presence of its cognate ligand, T3 hormone, while in its absence it represses it. v-ErbA is unable to bind ligand, and hence is thought to contribute to leukemogenesis by actively repressing erythroid-specific genes such as the carbonic anhydrase II gene (CA II). In the prevailing model, v-ErbA occludes liganded TR from binding to its cognate elements and constitutively interacts with the corepressors NCoR/SMRT. We previously identified a v-ErbA responsive element (VRE) within a DNase I hypersensitive region (HS2) located in the second intron of the CA II gene. We now show that HS2 fulfils all the requirements for a genuine enhancer that functions independent of its orientation and position with a profound erythroid-specific activity in normal erythroid progenitors (T2ECs) and in leukemic erythroid cell lines. We find that the HS2 enhancer activity is governed by two adjacent GATA-factor binding sites. v-ErbA as well as unliganded TR prevent HS2 activity by nullifying the positive function of factors bound to GATA-sites. However, v-ErbA, in contrast to TR, does not convey active repression to silence the transcriptional activity intrinsic to a heterologous tk promoter. We propose that depending on the sequence and context of the binding site, v-ErbA contributes to leukemogenesis by occluding liganded TR as well as unliganded TR thereby preventing activation or repression, respectively.","['Braliou, G G', 'Ciana, P', 'Klaassen, W', 'Gandrillon, O', 'Stunnenberg, H G']","['Braliou GG', 'Ciana P', 'Klaassen W', 'Gandrillon O', 'Stunnenberg HG']","['Department of Molecular Biology, NCMLS University of Nijmegen, Geert Groote plein 26 PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbA)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/*genetics', 'Chickens', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbA/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2000/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2000/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204159 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Feb 15;20(7):775-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are the first structural and functional data for p53 and p73 cDNAs and gene products in a naturally occurring, non-mammalian disease model. Core sequence of the predicted clam p53 (Map53) and p73 (Map73) proteins is virtually identical and includes the following highly conserved regions: the transcriptional activation domain (TAD), MDM2 binding site, ATM phosphorylation site, proline rich domain, DNA binding domains (DBDs) II-V, nuclear import and export signals and the tetramerization domain. The core sequence is a structural mosaic of the corresponding human proteins, with the TAD and DBDs resembling Hsp53 and Hsp73, respectively. This suggests that Map53 and Map73 proteins may function similarly to human proteins. Clam proteins have either a short (Map53) or long (Map73) C-terminal extension. These features suggest that Map53 and Map73 may be alternate splice variants of a p63/p73-like ancestral gene. Map73 is significantly upregulated in hemocytes and adductor muscle from leukemic clams. In leukemic hemocytes, both proteins are absent from the nucleus and sequestered in the cytoplasm. This observation suggests that a non-mutational p53/p73-dependent mechanism may be involved in the clam disease. Further studies of these gene products in clams may reveal p53/p73-related molecular mechanisms that are held in common with Burkitt's lymphoma or other human cancers.","['Kelley, M L', 'Winge, P', 'Heaney, J D', 'Stephens, R E', 'Farell, J H', 'Van Beneden, R J', 'Reinisch, C L', 'Lesser, M P', 'Walker, C W']","['Kelley ML', 'Winge P', 'Heaney JD', 'Stephens RE', 'Farell JH', 'Van Beneden RJ', 'Reinisch CL', 'Lesser MP', 'Walker CW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Biology and School of Marine Science, University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469-5751, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bivalvia/*genetics', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Hemocytes/pathology', 'Leukemia/genetics/veterinary', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2000/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2000/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204144 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Feb 8;20(6):748-58. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204144.,"['CA44307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD28204-01A1/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF253323', 'GENBANK/AF253324']",,,,,

In the present study, we demonstrate that human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines, KU812 and K562 cells, either induced apoptosis or differentiation, respectively, by treatment with activin A. During these cell fate decisive events caused by activin A, rapid and transient up-regulation of Mcl-1 was observed in both cell lines. In activin A-induced apoptosis of KU812 cells, continuous up-regulation of Bax was observed. After the decrease in Mcl-1 expression had occurred, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and cleavage of DFF45 were shown to take place in KU812 cells, resulting in the fragmentation of the genomic DNA of the cells. In contrast, the down-regulation of Mcl-1 without up-regulation of Bax caused accumulation of hemoglobin (Hb) contents in activin A-treated K562 cells. Interestingly, erythropoietin (EPO) prevented activin A-induced apoptosis with continuous expression of Mcl-1 and caused KU812 cells to undergo erythroid differentiation. To address the role of Mcl-1 in activin A-treated CML cells, KU812 and K562 cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding Mcl-1 (designated as KU812/mcl and K562/mcl cells). As in combined effect of activin A and EPO on the parental KU812 cells, activin A induced differentiation, but not apoptosis, of KU812/mcl cells without modulating Bax levels. Activin A-treated K562/mcl cells, as well as parental cells, were only differentiated to erythroid cells. These results suggest that Mcl-1 is an early inducible gene activated by the activin A signaling pathway for both cellular differentiation and apoptosis, and continuous expression of Mcl-1 may be contributed to differentiation signals to the erythroid lineage in CML cells.","['Fukuchi, Y', 'Kizaki, M', 'Yamato, K', 'Kawamura, C', 'Umezawa, A', 'Hata Ji', 'Nishihara, T', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Fukuchi Y', 'Kizaki M', 'Yamato K', 'Kawamura C', 'Umezawa A', 'Hata Ji', 'Nishihara T', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Activins', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Inhibins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2000/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2000/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204142 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Feb 8;20(6):704-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204142.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous works have demonstrated that both PI 3-K/Akt and STAT3 pathways were concomitantly activated and cooperatively mediated the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6. This investigation reports that IL-6 protected cells against apoptosis induced by a variety of agents including, TGF-beta, UV and retinoic acid (RA) in Hep3B cells, suggesting that IL-6 is a fundamental determinant of hepatic cell survival. Mcl-1, but not other Bcl-2 family members, was rapidly up-regulated by IL-6, with a peak (approximately 3-4-fold) appearing at 4 h. Transient transfection of cells with a mcl-1 antisense vector, resulting in a 50-60% reduction of the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6, indicating that Mcl-1 is a downstream effector of IL-6. Which signaling pathway transduced by IL-6 responsible for the Mcl-1 up-regulation was further investigated. In Hep3B cells, the JAK/STAT3, ERK, and PI 3-K/Akt pathways were activated by IL-6 stimulation. Blocking JAK/STAT3 activation with a dominant-negative mutant STAT3F or a JAK inhibitor AG490 could not influence IL-6-mediated Mcl-1 up-regulation. Similarly, PD98059 treatment, a MEK specific inhibitor, also failed to inhibit Mcl-1 expression. However, the IL-6-induced Mcl-1 up-regulation was effectively attenuated in the presence of PI 3-K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin. Expression of dominant-negative Akt, but not Etk, could abrogate the IL-6-induced increase of Mcl-1. In conclusion, our results suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 is mediated, at least in part, by Mcl-1 expression and that is mainly through the PI 3-K/ Akt-dependent pathway.","['Kuo, M L', 'Chuang, S E', 'Lin, M T', 'Yang, S Y']","['Kuo ML', 'Chuang SE', 'Lin MT', 'Yang SY']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Toxicology, Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2000/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2000/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204140 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Feb 8;20(6):677-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show by yeast two-hybrid assays, GST-pull-down experiments and in a far western blot analysis that this domain is necessary and sufficient to recruit a novel member of the human Polycomb protein family (hPc3). hPc3 RNA was detected throughout the human hematopoietic system. Similar to other Polycomb proteins hPc3 acts as a transcriptional repressor. The ENL-hPc3 interaction was verified by mutual co-precipitation of the proteins from cell extracts. ENL and hPc3 tagged with fluorescent proteins co-localized in living cells in a nuclear dot pattern. An internal region of hPc3 was responsible for binding to ENL. Finally, hPc3 binds to the C-terminus of AF9, another common MLL fusion partner.

The other fusion partners involved are CBP, p300 and TIF2, transcriptional coactivators with known or potential histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. MOZ itself is a 2004-residue protein containing a putative acetyl CoA-binding motif, so it was hypothesized that MOZ is a HAT. Here we present direct evidence that MOZ has intrinsic HAT activity. Moreover, MOZ possesses a transcriptional repression domain at its N-terminal part and an activation domain at its C-terminal part. The activation domain does not show sequence similarity to any yeast proteins, but when tethered, it is able to activate transcription in yeast. Therefore, MOZ is a HAT with characteristics of a transcriptional coregulator, supporting the hypothesis that aberrant acetylation by abnormal MOZ proteins leads to leukemogenesis.","['Champagne, N', 'Pelletier, N', 'Yang, X J']","['Champagne N', 'Pelletier N', 'Yang XJ']","['Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1A1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Maltose-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Maltose-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', '*Zinc Fingers']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2000/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2000/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204114 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Jan 18;20(3):404-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204114.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although SN-1 cells were not induced to differentiate by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD3), retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists, such as 9-cis retinoic acid and Ro48-2250, effectively induced differentiation of the cells. Downregulation of the expression of the MLL-CBP fusion gene occurred during the differentiation of SN-1 cells. When SN-1 cells were treated with MLL-CBP antisense oligonucleotide, the cells were induced to differentiate by ATRA or VD3, suggesting that the MLL-CBP fusion gene dominant-negatively suppresses ATRA- or VD3-induced differentiation. Moreover, suboptimal concentrations of sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, had a cooperative effect with ATRA or VD3 in inducing the differentiation of SN-1 cells. The downregulation of the expression of MLL-CBP mRNA was accompanied by the induction of differentiation. These findings suggest that RXR agonists or a clinically applicable combination of ATRA and butyrate derivatives might be useful for differentiation therapy in leukemia patients with the MLL-CBP fusion gene.","['Niitsu, N', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Honma, Y']","['Niitsu N', 'Hayashi Y', 'Honma Y']","['Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Ina-machi, Saitama 362-0806, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Ro48 2250)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Butyric Acid/pharmacology', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/agonists', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/agonists', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2000/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2000/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204081 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Jan 18;20(3):375-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204081.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown that over-expression of the full-length, most highly expressed Runx2 isoform in the thymus perturbs T-cell development, leads to development of spontaneous lymphomas at low frequency and is strongly synergistic with Myc. To gain further insight into the relationship of Runx2 to other lymphomagenic pathways, we tested the effect of combining the CD2-Runx2 transgene either with a Pim1 transgene (E(mu)-Pim1) or with the p53 null genotype, as each of these displays independent synergy with Myc. In both cases we observed synergistic tumour development. However, Runx2 appeared to have a dominant effect on the tumour phenotype in each case, with most tumours conforming to the CD3(+), CD8(+), CD4(+/-) phenotype seen in CD2-Runx2 mice. Neonatal infection of CD2-Runx2 mice with Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Moloney MLV) also led to a dramatic acceleration of tumour onset. Analysis of known Moloney MLV target genes in these lymphomas showed a high frequency of rearrangement at c-Myc or N-Myc (82%), and a significant number at Pim1 or Pim2 (23%), and at Pal1/Gfi1 (18%).

Alternative splicing of CASP-2 messenger RNA generates a long isoform, procaspase-2L, whose overexpression induces cell death and a truncated isoform, procaspase-2S, whose function remains poorly defined. The present study explored the consequences of procaspase-2S overexpression in U937 human leukemic cells exposed to the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide as an apoptotic stimulus. Overexpression of procaspase-2S in U937 cells partially prevented nuclear changes associated with etoposide-induced cell death, as determined by Hoechst 33342 staining of nuclear chromatin and electron microscopy studies. Procaspase-2S also prevented the maturation of apoptotic bodies, delayed phosphatidylserine externalization on the plasma membrane and prevented the cleavage and activation of procaspase-2L. These effects were not observed when the cysteine 289 in the consensus QACRG motif was mutated into a serine. Wild-type procaspase-2S overexpression did not influence the cleavage of procaspase-3, procaspase-7 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase nor the fragmentation of nuclear DNA into nucleosome-sized fragments.

We examined the effect of p53 on bcl-2 expression in both the DHL-4 B cell line and the K562 erythroleukemia line. Transient transfection analyses revealed that wild-type p53 repressed the bcl-2 full-length promoter. The region of the bcl-2 promoter that was responsive to p53 was mapped to the bcl-2 P2 minimal promoter region, and we showed that p53 and the TATA binding protein bound to the bcl-2 TATA sequence. The TATA binding protein, p53, histone deacetylase-1 and mSin3a could be co-immunoprecipitated from K562 cell nuclear extract. The TATA binding protein and mSin3a could be recovered in a complex at the bcl-2 promoter TATA sequence, however, the formation of this complex was not dependent on the presence of p53. Treatment of K562 cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, resulted in an increase in bcl-2 promoter activity whether p53 was present or not. Therefore, we demonstrated that p53 and the histone deacetylases repress the bcl-2 promoter independently. Similar results were obtained when endogenous bcl-2 mRNA or protein levels were measured in response to either p53 or trichostatin A, and p53 expression resulted in enhanced apoptosis. RNase protection assays demonstrated that transcription from the endogenous 3' bcl-2 promoter was decreased by p53. The regions of p53 that were required for repression of the bcl-2 promoter were defined. We conclude that the TATA sequence in the bcl-2 P2 minimal promoter is the target for repression by p53, and that the interaction between p53 and TBP is most likely responsible for the repression.

Excessive or insufficient production of IL-6 may contribute to certain diseases of the skin. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of IL-6 in the tumorigenesis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Initially, we transfected IL-6 expression vector, under the control of a CMV promoter, into human BCC cells and successfully obtained IL-6-overexpressing clones (BCC/IL-6-c1 and BCC/IL-6-c2) and a mixture (BCC/IL-6). DNA synthesis assay determined using (3)H-thymidine pulse incorporation revealed that IL-6-expressing BCC cells exhibited a much higher DNA synthesis rate than the neo control or parental BCC cells. We also detected a greater abundance of IL-6-expressing cell colonies formed in soft agar than in the vector control cells. Furthermore, BCC/IL-6 cells, but not vector control cells, were resistant to UV and photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced apoptosis, as confirmed using DNA fragmentation and morphologic change analyses. Immunoblot analysis showed that Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein, was specifically up-regulated IL-6 transfectants but not in the control cells. Transient transfection of IL-6 transfectants with antisense mcl-1 greatly enhanced their apoptosis frequency by UV treatment. In tumorigenesis assay, IL-6 transfected clones formed tumors in nude mice more rapidly than the control cells. These tumors appeared to be highly vascularized using pathological examination. Supportive of this finding, we found that IL-6 transfected cells expressed elevated levels of two angiogenic factors, cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These results suggest that overexpression of IL-6 enhances the tumorigenic activity of BCC cells by both suppressing apoptosis and actively promoting angiogenesis.","['Jee, S H', 'Shen, S C', 'Chiu, H C', 'Tsai, W L', 'Kuo, M L']","['Jee SH', 'Shen SC', 'Chiu HC', 'Tsai WL', 'Kuo ML']","['Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)']",IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Lymphokines/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2000/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2000/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204076 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Jan 11;20(2):198-208. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204076.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that expression of Bcr interferes with the oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl. To examine the effects of increased Bcr expression on Bcr-Abl oncogenic effects in a more physiological system, we tested the leukemogenic potential of a clone of K562 cells (K6 K562) containing an inducible BCR gene in NOD/scid mice. In this clone, the BCR gene was placed under the control of a tetracycline (Tet) repression system with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Induction of exogenous Bcr protein by removal of Tet from the culture medium caused a dramatic increase in Bcr serine kinase activity, yielding predominantly phosphoserine Bcr, despite the presence of Bcr-Abl in the kinase reaction mixture. Prior to induction, the endogenous Bcr was predominantly in the phosphotyrosine form because of phosphorylation by Bcr-Abl, which we previously have shown suppresses Bcr serine/threonine kinase activity. Injection of K6 K562 cells into NOD/scid mice under conditions where BCR expression was suppressed resulted in death or terminal illness in 100% of the mice within 35 days after injection. These mice had a severe wasting syndrome characterized by atrophy of bone marrow hematopoiesis, and/or neoplasia of liver, bone marrow and spleen. Neoplastic spleens from these mice usually contained b3a2 Bcr-Abl transcripts. In contrast, induction of BCR expression at the time of injection allowed 80% survival; these healthy mice had no detectable microscopic lesions in blood forming organs. This difference in survival was significant with P<0.0001. Of interest, mice that were fed Tet for 19 days to initiate the disease syndrome and then released from the BCR transcriptional block had a significantly better survival pattern than mice exposed to Tet throughout the entire period. Moreover, 30% of these mice (three mice) survived through day 50. We conclude from these findings that BCR gene expression strongly inhibits the oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl in NOD/scid mice, yielding healthy mice in most cases.","['Lin, F', 'Monaco, G', 'Sun, T', 'Liu, J', 'Lin, H', 'Stephens, C', 'Belmont, J', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Lin F', 'Monaco G', 'Sun T', 'Liu J', 'Lin H', 'Stephens C', 'Belmont J', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2001/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204409 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Apr 5;20(15):1873-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204409.,"['A16672/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated specific antisera that recognize phosphoserines 11 and 12 of c-Myb. C-Myb protein levels, extent of CK2 phosphorylation and DNA binding were then monitored following mitogenic stimulus and passage through the cell cycle in normal peripheral T-cells and the T leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM. We found that endogenous c-Myb is constitutively phosphorylated at serines 11 and 12. The amount of phosphorylated c-Myb correlates with DNA binding activity in cycling CEM cells but not upon entry of T-cells into the cell cycle. Exogenous expression of c-Myb with substitutions of serines 11 and 12 with glutamic acid or alanine had no effect on the transactivation of a c-Myb responsive reporter.

We demonstrated stable integration of the recombinant retrovirus in the Mphi genome, efficient recombinant retrovirus production, and EGFP gene delivery to different cell lines in vitro. To evaluate Mphi-mediated EGFP gene transfer in vivo, allogeneic mice were injected s.c. with the retrovirus-producing WGL5 Mphi, that gave rise to solid tumor masses at the injection site, highly infiltrated with host leukocytes. We observed EGFP fluorescence in tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) host T lymphocytes, providing direct evidence of the ability of engineered Mphi to mediate EGFP gene delivery to host cells in vivo. Moreover, we showed that retrovirus-producing Mphi could home to different organs in vivo following i.v. injection into mice.

In HIV-1-infected patients, the appearance of X4 strains (T cell line-tropic) correlates with disease progression. Since its discovery, the CXCR4 co-receptor has been a major target for different agents which block its function, such as stromal-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and the anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody, 12G5. In the present studies, the 12G5 hybridoma was used to construct a single-chain variable antibody fragment (SFv). Murine leukemia virus (MLV) and simian virus 40 (SV(40)) were utilized as delivery vehicles for the anti-CXCR4 SFv. Intracellular expression of the anti-CXCR4 SFv led to down-regulation of this critical co-receptor, as demonstrated by immunostaining. This effect significantly and specifically protected transduced cells from challenge with HIV-1, as measured by HIV-1 p24 antigen expression. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication was specific for X4 HIV-1 strains as demonstrated by MAGI assays. HeLa-CD4/betagal-CCR5 cells expressing the anti-CXCR4 SFv showed significant inhibition of infectivity by the X4 HIV-1 strain NL4-3, but not with the R5 HIV-1 strain Bal. Thus, this anti-HIV-1 molecular therapy has the potential to inhibit HIV-1 replication and virion spread.

However, the transduction efficiency (TE) of retroviruses embedding endogenous envelope proteins in human cancer cells was found to be unsatisfactory. Recently, several research groups have demonstrated the feasibility of a retroviral vector pseudotyped with a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) protein. In this study, the potential of VSV-G pseudotyped MLV-based retrovirus was examined as a delivery vehicle in a variety of human cancer cells including brain tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The transduction efficiency of the 293T/G/GP/LacZ retrovirus in cell culture was superior in most cancer cells, particularly in brain tumor cells, compared with that of other retroviruses, such as PA317- or PG13-derived. The relative growth rate and phosphatidylserine expression level on the plasma membrane of target cells mainly influenced the transduction efficiency of VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus, which suggested that both the relative growth rate and phosphatidylserine expression level were major determinants of TE. Furthermore, 293T/G/GP/LacZ could efficiently transduce human cancer cells regardless of the presence of chemical additives, whereas in other retroviruses, cationic chemical additives such as polybrene or liposomes were essential during virus infection. Finally, an average of 10% gene expression was routinely obtained exclusively in the tumor mass when 293T/G/GP/LacZ concentrated by simple ultracentrifugation was directly administrated to pre-established brain tumors in animal models (U251-N nu/nu mice or C6 Wistar rats).

Lentiviral vectors offer an advantage over Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) vectors because of their ability to translocate across an intact nuclear membrane and integrate into the genome of nonproliferating cells. We have recently demonstrated that a central strand displacement event, controlled by the central polypurine tract (cPPT) and the central termination sequence (CTS), results in the formation of a central DNA flap which acts as a cis-determinant of HIV-1 genome nuclear import. Here, we show that insertion of this DNA determinant in a classical lentiviral vector resulted in a significantly higher level of transduction in activated T cells (51 +/- 12.7% versus 15 +/- 1.4%). CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were transduced at equivalent levels. Importantly, freshly isolated T cells stimulated only during the 12-h transduction period could be efficiently transduced with this new flap-containing lentiviral vector, but not with the parental lentiviral vector nor an MuLV vector. Transgene expression in the flap-containing lentiviral vector, under the control of either an internal cytomegalovirus or the elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1 alpha) promoter, was significant and expression remained elevated in resting T cells. Thus, this system allows stable expression of transgenes in T lymphocytes following a short ex vivo transduction protocol.","['Dardalhon, V', 'Herpers, B', 'Noraz, N', 'Pflumio, F', 'Guetard, D', 'Leveau, C', 'Dubart-Kupperschmitt, A', 'Charneau, P', 'Taylor, N']","['Dardalhon V', 'Herpers B', 'Noraz N', 'Pflumio F', 'Guetard D', 'Leveau C', 'Dubart-Kupperschmitt A', 'Charneau P', 'Taylor N']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, UMR 5535/IFR 22, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2000/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301378 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2001 Feb;8(3):190-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301378.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms regulating TRAIL-induced apoptosis remain to be elucidated. We have investigated the role of PKC in regulating TRAIL-induced mitochondrial events and apoptosis in the Jurkat T cell line. We found a caspase-dependent decline in mitochondrial membrane potential and translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol in response to TRAIL. Both these events were prevented by PKC activation. Moreover, PKC activation considerably reduced the activation of caspases, PARP cleavage and apoptosis when induced upon TRAIL treatment. MAPK activation was involved in the mechanism of PKC-mediated inhibition of TRAIL-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Furthermore, inhibition of the MAPK pathway partially reversed the PKC-mediated inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Besides, PKC activation may also inhibit the TRAIL-induced apoptosis through a MAPK-independent mechanism. Altogether, these results indicate a negative role of PKC in the regulation of apoptotic signals generated upon TRAIL receptor activation.","['Sarker, M', 'Ruiz-Ruiz, C', 'Lopez-Rivas, A']","['Sarker M', 'Ruiz-Ruiz C', 'Lopez-Rivas A']","['Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina CSIC, calle Ventanilla 11, 18001 Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2000/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2000/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400791 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2001 Feb;8(2):172-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400791.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, it has become clear that in an attempt to prevent viral replication, viral dissemination or persistent viral infection of the cell, many of these protective measures actually involve the induction of programmed cell death, or apoptosis. An initial response to viral infection primarily involves the innate arm of immunity and the killing of infected cells with cytotoxic lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells through mechanisms that include the employment of perforin and granzymes. Once the virus has invaded the cell, however, a second host defense-mediated response is also triggered which involves the induction of a family of cytokines known as the interferons (IFNs). The IFNs, which are essential for initiating and coordinating a successful antiviral response, function by stimulating the adaptive arm of immunity involving cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), and by inducing a number of intracellular genes that directly prevent virus replication/cytolysis or that facilitate apoptosis. The IFN-induced gene family is now known to comprise the death ligand TRAIL, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML), all of which have been reported to be mediators of cell death. That DNA array analyses indicate that numerous cellular genes, many as yet uncharacterized, may similarly be induced by IFN, further emphasizes the likely importance that these cytokines have in the modulation of apoptosis. This likelihood is additionally underlined by the elaborate strategies developed by viruses to inhibit IFN-antiviral function and the mechanisms of cell death.","['Barber, G N']",['Barber GN'],"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami School of Medicine, FL 33136, USA. gbarber@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', ""61172-40-5 (2',5'-oligoadenylate)"", '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Endoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Genes, Regulator/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/therapy', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligoribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Virus Diseases/*immunology', 'Viruses/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'eIF-2 Kinase/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2000/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400823 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2001 Feb;8(2):113-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400823.,,,,,,156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess whether this resistance to ATRA is related to an impaired function of the Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha (RARalpha), we performed an analysis of RARalpha expression and transactivation activity, in several myeloid leukemic cell lines, representative of different types of spontaneous acute myeloid leukemias. Our results indicate that a functionally active RARalpha nuclear receptor is expressed in all the analyzed cell lines, regardless of their differentiation capacity following exposure to ATRA. The observation that ATRA treatment is able to induce the expression of retinoic acid target genes, in late- but not in early-myeloblastic leukemic cells, raises the possibility that the differentiation block of these cells is achieved through a chromatin mediated mechanism. Acetylation is apparently not involved in this process, since the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, is not able to restore the differentiation capacity of early leukemic myeloblasts. Further investigation is needed to clarify whether myeloid transcription factors, distinct to RARalpha, play a role in the resistance of these cells to ATRA treatment.","['Grande, A', 'Montanari, M', 'Manfredini, R', 'Tagliafico, E', 'Zanocco-Marani, T', 'Trevisan, F', 'Ligabue, G', 'Siena, M', 'Ferrari, S', 'Ferrari, S']","['Grande A', 'Montanari M', 'Manfredini R', 'Tagliafico E', 'Zanocco-Marani T', 'Trevisan F', 'Ligabue G', 'Siena M', 'Ferrari S', 'Ferrari S']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, Sezione di Chimica Biologica, Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2000/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2000/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400771 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2001 Jan;8(1):70-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400771.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on 352 trephine biopsies derived from 123 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at standardized endpoints before and after allogeneic BMT and compared to a control group. The purpose of this investigation was to quantify the B-CD20(+) and T-CD45RO(+) lymphocyte subsets and to determine possible relationships with the occurrence of acute and chronic GVHD. Moreover, we studied the dynamics of lymphocyte repopulation in the post-transplant period, correlations with the total peripheral lymphocyte count and differences associated with sibling vs alternate HLA-compatible (unmanipulated) marrow grafts. Morphometric analysis revealed a very fast regeneration of CD45RO(+) and CD20(+) marrow lymphocytes in the first 2 weeks following BMT. In less than 2 months, in most patients, the post-transplant quantity of lymphocytes was comparable to that of the normal bone marrow. This finding was opposed to the profound depression of the absolute lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood. No relevant relationships could be calculated between engraftment status and the lymphocyte repopulation in the bone marrow. On the other hand, significant correlations were calculable between the development of (chronic and acute) GVHD including severity with the number of CD45RO(+) lymphocytes. In non-related graft constellations a more frequent evolution of acute grade III + IV GVHD was detectable. This complication was accompanied by an increased quantity of CD45RO(+) lymphocytes in the marrow.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Beelen, D W', 'Welter, A', 'Schneider, S', 'Leder, L D', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Beelen DW', 'Welter A', 'Schneider S', 'Leder LD', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institutes of Pathology, Universities of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD20/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Family', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2000/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702789 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Feb;27(4):425-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702789.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six normal controls were also analyzed for comparison. Expression of type 1 T helper (Th1) cytokines, IL-2 and IFN-gamma was greatly increased in all three patients. In particular, the changes in IL-2 gene expression correlated well with disease progression, suggesting that IL-2 has a critical role in the development of GVHD. Although the pattern of type 2 T helper (Th2) cytokine gene expression differed in each patient, the expression of IL-4 was inversely related to expression of Th1 cytokines.

Fifty patients with CML (1.CP = 46; aP = 4) and a median age of 36 years (range 16-52) were enrolled in this sequential trial between 1994 and 1999. In both groups patients were well balanced with respect to age, disease status, stem cell source and CMV status. All patients received standard doses of cyclosporin A, methotrexate and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as GVHD prophylaxis. No graft failures occurred in either group. The median day of leukocyte engraftment was earlier in the Bu/Cy than in the TBI/Cy group (day 15 vs 17; P = 0.006). The incidence of grade II-IV GVHD was 40% in the TBI/Cy and 36% in the Bu/Cy group, whereas severe grade III/IV GVHD was only observed in 12% of patients in both groups. The incidence of chronic GVHD (limited and extensive) at 1 year was higher in the Bu/Cy arm (65% vs 30%; P = 0.02). More toxicity grade I/II of the liver (88% vs 44%; P = 0.002) and more hemorrhagic cystitis (32% vs 8%; P = 0.02) were observed in the Bu/Cy regimen. Seven relapses in the TBI and no relapse in the Bu/Cy group were observed after a median follow-up of 44 and 15 months, respectively. The estimated 3 year OS and DFS was 72% (95% CI: 55-98%) and 58% (95% CI: 39-77%) in the TBI and 70% (95% CI: 51-89%) for DFS and OS in the Bu/Cy group. We conclude that the anti-leukemic effect of the Bu/Cy regimen seems to be at least as effective as the TBI/Cy combination in unrelated stem cell transplantation of CML patients, with no graft failures, but that it correlates with a higher incidence of liver toxicity, hemorrhagic cystitis and chronic GVHD. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine the late relapse rate and late toxicity.","['Kroger, N', 'Zabelina, T', 'Kruger, W', 'Renges, H', 'Stute, N', 'Kabisch, H', 'Jaburg, N', 'Loliger, C', 'Krull, A', 'Zander, A R']","['Kroger N', 'Zabelina T', 'Kruger W', 'Renges H', 'Stute N', 'Kabisch H', 'Jaburg N', 'Loliger C', 'Krull A', 'Zander AR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation, University-Hospital Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality/standards', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods/standards', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods/mortality/standards', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects/standards']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2000/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2000/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702802 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Feb;27(4):349-54. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702802.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of the Cyp33 protein in leukemia cells results in altered expression of HOX genes that are targets for regulation by MLL. These alterations are suppressed by cyclosporine and are not observed in cell lines that express a mutant MLL protein without PHD fingers.

TEL-JAK2, in addition to activating Stat5, associates with Shc and Grb2 and induces activation of Erk2, and expression of Socs-1 inhibits engagement of each of these signaling molecules. TEL-JAK2 kinase activity is inhibited by Socs-1, as assessed by in vitro kinase assays. In addition, Socs-1 induces proteasomal degradation of TEL-JAK2. Mutational analysis indicates that the SOCS box of Socs-1 is required for proteasomal degradation and for abrogation of growth of TEL-JAK2-transformed cells. Furthermore, murine bone marrow transplant assays demonstrate that expression of Socs-1 prolongs latency of TEL-JAK2-mediated disease in vivo.

The function of these ubiquitous subnuclear structures, whose integrity is compromised in pathological situations such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) or DNA virus infection, remains poorly understood. There is little evidence for the occurrence of actual physiological processes within NBs. The two NB proteins PML and SP100 are covalently modified by the ubiquitin-related SUMO-1 modifier, and recent work indicates that this modification is critical for the regulation of NB dynamics. In exploring the functional relationships between NBs and chromatin, we have shown previously that SP100 interacts with members of the HP1 family of nonhistone chromosomal proteins and that a variant SP100 cDNA encodes a high-mobility group (HMG1/2) protein. Here we report the isolation of a further cDNA, encoding the SP100C protein, that contains the PHD-bromodomain motif characteristic of chromatin proteins. We further show that TIF1alpha, a chromatin-associated factor with homology to both PML and SP100C, is also modified by SUMO-1. Finally, in vitro experiments indicate that SUMO modification of SP100 enhances the stability of SP100-HP1 complexes. Taken together, our results suggest an association of SP100 and its variants with the chromatin compartment and, further, indicate that SUMO modification may play a regulatory role in the functional interplay between the nuclear bodies and chromatin.","['Seeler, J S', 'Marchio, A', 'Losson, R', 'Desterro, J M', 'Hay, R T', 'Chambon, P', 'Dejean, A']","['Seeler JS', 'Marchio A', 'Losson R', 'Desterro JM', 'Hay RT', 'Chambon P', 'Dejean A']","['Unite de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique, INSERM U163, Institut Pasteur, 75074 Paris Cedex 15, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (transcriptional intermediary factor 1)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.10.3314-3324.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 May;21(10):3314-24. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.10.3314-3324.2001.,,,,,,,PMC100253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD8(+) CTL clones specific for these hTERT peptides exerted cytotoxicity against leukemia cells in an HLA-A24-restricted manner.

It was found that FasL-defective B6.gld donor T cells display diminished GVHD activity but have intact GVL activity. In contrast, perforin-deficient B6.pfp(-/-) donor T cells have intact GVHD activity but display diminished GVL activity. Splenic T cells from recipients of B6.gld or B6.pfp(-/-) T cells had identical proliferative and cytokine responses to host antigens; however, splenic T cells from recipients of B6.pfp(-/-) T cells had no cytolytic activity against leukemia cells in a cytotoxicity assay. In experiments with selected CD4(+) or CD8(+) donor T cells, the FasL pathway was important for GVHD activity by both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, whereas the perforin pathway was required for CD8-mediated GVL activity. These data demonstrate in a murine model for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation that donor T cells mediate GVHD activity primarily through the FasL effector pathway and GVL activity through the perforin pathway. This suggests that donor T cells make differential use of cytolytic pathways and that the specific blockade of one cytotoxic pathway may be used to prevent GVHD without interfering with GVL activity.","['Schmaltz, C', 'Alpdogan, O', 'Horndasch, K J', 'Muriglan, S J', 'Kappel, B J', 'Teshima, T', 'Ferrara, J L', 'Burakoff, S J', 'van den Brink, M R']","['Schmaltz C', 'Alpdogan O', 'Horndasch KJ', 'Muriglan SJ', 'Kappel BJ', 'Teshima T', 'Ferrara JL', 'Burakoff SJ', 'van den Brink MR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.9.2886 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55723-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 1;97(9):2886-95. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.9.2886.,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5PO1 CA39542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were used as tools for modulating the expression of heavy and light ferritin subunits of K562 cells. mRNA and protein levels of each subunit were markedly reduced by 2-day treatment with antisense probes against the respective subunit. Although the combined action of antisense probes against both subunits reduced their protein expression, antisense repression of one subunit led to an increased protein expression of the other. Antisense treatment led to a rise in the steady-state labile iron pool, a rise in the production of reactive oxygen species after pro-oxidative challenges and in protein oxidation, and the down-regulation of transferrin receptors. When compared to the repression of individual subunits, co-repression of each subunit evoked a more than additive increase in the labile iron pool and the extent of protein oxidation. These treatments had no detectable effects on the long-term growth of cells. However, repression of ferritin synthesis facilitated the renewal of growth and the proliferation of cells pre-arrested at the G(1)/S phase. Renewed cell growth was significantly less dependent on external iron supply when ferritin synthesis was repressed and its degradation inhibited by lysosomal antiproteases. This study provides experimental evidence that links the effect of ferritin repression on growth stimulation to the expansion of the labile iron pool.","['Kakhlon, O', 'Gruenbaum, Y', 'Cabantchik, Z I']","['Kakhlon O', 'Gruenbaum Y', 'Cabantchik ZI']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Institute of Life Sciences, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Ferritins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Oxidative Stress']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.9.2863 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55720-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 1;97(9):2863-71. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.9.2863.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, signaling pathways were examined and compared between cells derived from leukemic patients and cells expressing a bcr-abl construct (MBA). The effects of acute inhibition of bcr-abl with STI-571 on these signals and the survival of bcr-abl-expressing cells were also evaluated. Expression of bcr-abl in interleukin-3 (IL-3)/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent Mo7e cells (MBA) resulted in growth factor independence, constitutive activation of Stat-5 phosphorylation, engagement of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signals, and increased expression of PTP1B and bcl-x(L). STI-571 inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in bcr-abl-expressing cells (MBA, K562, BV-173, KBM5) but not in bcr-abl(-) tumor cells (Mo7e, KG-1, ME-180, Daudi). STI-571-mediated apoptosis correlated with the inhibition of Stat-5 and MAP kinase activation and a reduction in overexpressed bcl-x(L) but not in PTP1B. Inhibitor had no effect on IL-3/GM-CSF-dependent Mo7e cell signaling and did not prevent activation of the other Jak/Stat pathways (interferon alpha, IL-3/GM-CSF). However, neither IL-3 nor GM-CSF could reactivate Stat-5 after the STI-571-mediated inhibition of bcr-abl. Expression of the common beta-chain of the IL-3/GM-CSF receptor was down-regulated in Stat-5-activated myeloid leukemic cells, suppressing IL-3/GM-CSF signal transduction and the ability of these cytokines to provide apoptotic protection. These studies suggest that bcr-abl activates cytokine-independent mechanisms of survival while inactivating intrinsic cytokine signaling cascades, making bcr-abl(+) myeloid cells vulnerable to apoptosis after bcr-abl inactivation.","['Donato, N J', 'Wu, J Y', 'Zhang, L', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Talpaz, M']","['Donato NJ', 'Wu JY', 'Zhang L', 'Kantarjian H', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, M.

Thus, proliferating U937, TUR, and retrodifferentiated U937 cells exhibited a 4.3-fold, 5.8-fold, and 4.3-fold proteasome activation within 15 minutes after adriamycin treatment, respectively. In contrast, little if any proteasome activation was detectable in a growth-arrested differentiated U937 population following adriamycin treatment. Further analysis of this mechanism revealed a significant reduction of adriamycin-induced proteasome activity after inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA) in the proliferating leukemic cell types. These findings suggested that PARP is involved in the regulation of drug-induced proteasome activation. Indeed, anti-PARP immunoprecipitation experiments of adriamycin-treated cells revealed increasing levels of coprecipitated, enzymatically active proteasome particularly in the proliferating cell variants in contrast to the differentiated U937 cells, with a maximum after 15 minutes, and sensitivity to PARP inhibition by 3-ABA. The specific role of the PARP was investigated in U937 and TUR cell clones stably transfected with a constitutively active antisense PARP (asPARP) vector. Thus, asPARP-TUR cells developed a 25-fold increased sensitivity to adriamycin treatment. Furthermore, we investigated leukemic blasts isolated from acute myelogenous leukemia patients and obtained a similarly enhanced proteasome activity after adriamycin treatment, which was dependent on the PARP and thus could be coprecipitated with anti-PARP antibodies. Transient transfection of leukemic blasts with the asPARP vector significantly reduced the adriamycin-induced proteasome activation. These data suggest that the PARP-associated nuclear proteasome activation represents a potential target within chemotherapeutic defense mechanisms developed by leukemia cells.","['Ciftci , O', 'Ullrich, O', 'Schmidt, C A', 'Diestel, A', 'Hass, R']","['Ciftci O', 'Ullrich O', 'Schmidt CA', 'Diestel A', 'Hass R']","['Department of Cell and Neurobiology, Institute of Anatomy, and Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Charite, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.9.2830 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55716-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 1;97(9):2830-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.9.2830.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study this issue, the methylation status of 14 promoter-associated CpG islands was analyzed in 36 cases of AML previously characterized for estrogen-receptor methylation (ERM). Cases with methylation density of 10% or greater were considered positive. Seventeen cases (47%) were ERM(+) while 19 cases were ERM(-). Hypermethylation of any of the following, p15, p16, CACNA1G, MINT1, MINT2, MDR1, THBS1, and PTC1 (2 promoters), was relatively infrequent (6% to 31% of patients). For each of these CpG islands, the methylation density was positively correlated with ERM density (rank order correlation coefficients, 0.32-0.59; 2-tailed P < or = .058 for each gene). Hypermethylation of MYOD1, PITX2, GPR37, and SDC4 was frequently found in AML (47% to 64% of patients). For each of these genes as well, methylation density was positively correlated with ERM density (correlation coefficients 0.43 to 0.69, P < or = .0087 for each gene). MLH1 was unmethylated in all cases. Hypermethylation of p15, MDR1, and SDC4 correlated with reduced levels of expression. There was an inverse correlation between age and the number of genes methylated (P = .0030). It was concluded that CpG-island methylation in AML results from methylation defects in subsets of cases. These results have potential implications for the classification and prognosis of AML and for the identification of patients who may benefit from treatment with methylation inhibitors.","['Toyota, M', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Toyota, M O', 'Jair, K W', 'Willman, C L', 'Issa, J P']","['Toyota M', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Toyota MO', 'Jair KW', 'Willman CL', 'Issa JP']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.9.2823 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55715-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 1;97(9):2823-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.9.2823.,"['CA-32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was previously shown to block the antiproliferative effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Evi-1 represses TGF-beta signaling by direct interaction with Smad3 through its first zinc finger motif. Here, it is demonstrated that Evi-1 represses Smad-induced transcription by recruiting C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) as a corepressor. Evi-1 associates with CtBP1 through one of the consensus binding motifs, and this association is required for efficient inhibition of TGF-beta signaling. A specific inhibitor for histone deacetylase (HDAc) alleviates Evi-1-mediated repression of TGF-beta signaling, suggesting that HDAc is involved in the transcriptional repression by Evi-1. This identifies a novel function of Evi-1 as a member of corepressor complexes and suggests that aberrant recruitment of corepressors is one of the mechanisms for Evi-1-induced leukemogenesis.","['Izutsu, K', 'Kurokawa, M', 'Imai, Y', 'Maki, K', 'Mitani, K', 'Hirai, H']","['Izutsu K', 'Kurokawa M', 'Imai Y', 'Maki K', 'Mitani K', 'Hirai H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (C-terminal binding protein)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.9.2815 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55714-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 1;97(9):2815-22. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.9.2815.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was hypothesized that interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) induces apoptosis through activation of the CD95-mediated pathway and that CD95 and ligands of the death domain may belong to the group of IFN-stimulated genes. Therefore, the effect of IFN-alpha on CD95-CD95L expression, on the release of TNF-alpha, and on TNF receptor 1 expression in an IFN-sensitive human Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Daudi) was investigated. After 5 days' incubation, apoptosis in 81% of IFN-alpha-treated Daudi cells was preceded by a release of TNF-alpha and an induction of CD95 receptor expression. Although supernatants of IFN-treated Daudi cells induced apoptosis of CD95-sensitive Jurkat cells, CD95L was undetectable on protein or on messenger RNA levels, and the weak initial expression of TNF receptor 1 increased only slightly during IFN treatment. Surprisingly, binding of TNF-alpha to CD95 was observed and confirmed by 3 different techniques-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using immobilized CD95:Fc-immunoglobulin G, immunoprecipitation assay using CD95 receptor precipitates of Daudi cells, and binding of sodium iodide 125-TNF-alpha to Daudi cells, which was strongly stimulated by IFN-alpha and inhibited by CD95L, CD95:Fc, unlabeled TNF-alpha, and anti-TNF-alpha antibody. Preincubation of Daudi cells with antagonists of the CD95-mediated pathway resulted in an inhibition of IFN-alpha-mediated cell death. The present investigation shows that IFN-alpha induces autocrine cell suicide of Daudi cells by a cross-talk between the CD95 receptor and TNF-alpha.

Survivin expression and regulation were examined in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Survivin was detected by Western blot analysis in all myeloid leukemia cell lines and in 16 of 18 primary AML samples tested. In contrast, normal CD34(+) cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressed no or very low levels of survivin. Cytokine stimulation increased survivin expression in leukemic cell lines and in primary AML samples. In cultured primary samples, single-cytokine stimulation substantially increased survivin expression in comparison with control cells, and the combination of G-CSF, GM-CSF, and SCF increased survivin levels even further. Conversely, all-trans retinoic acid significantly decreased survivin protein levels in HL-60, OCI-AML3, and NB-4 cells within 96 hours, parallel to the induction of myelomonocytic differentiation. Using selective pharmacologic inhibitors, the differential involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathways were demonstrated in the regulation of survivin expression. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 down-regulated survivin expression in both resting and GM-CSF-stimulated OCI-AML3 cells, whereas the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited survivin expression only on GM-CSF stimulation.

These cells are the progeny of a proliferating pool that feeds the accumulating compartment. The authors sought to determine which molecular mechanisms govern the proliferating pool, how they relate to apoptosis, and what the role is of the microenvironment. To begin to resolve these problems, the expression and modulation of the family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) were investigated, with consideration given to the possibility that physiological stimuli, such as CD40 ligand (CD40L), available to B cells in the microenvironment, might modulate IAP expression. The in vitro data on mononuclear cells from PB or BM of 30 patients demonstrate that B-CLL cells on CD40 stimulation express Survivin and that Survivin is the only IAP whose expression is induced by CD40L. Through immunohistochemistry, in vivo Survivin expression in lymph node (LN) and BM biopsies was evaluated. In reactive LN, Survivin was detected only in highly proliferating germinal center cells. In LN from patients with B-CLL, Survivin was detected only in pseudofollicles. Pseudofollicle Survivin(+) cells were actively proliferating and, in contrast to Survivin(+) B cells found in normal GC, were Bcl-2(+). In B-CLL BM biopsies, CD5(+), Survivin(+) cells were observed in clusters interspersed with T cells. These findings establish that Survivin controls the B-CLL proliferative pool interfacing apoptosis and that its expression may be modulated by microenvironmental stimuli.","['Granziero, L', 'Ghia, P', 'Circosta, P', 'Gottardi, D', 'Strola, G', 'Geuna, M', 'Montagna, L', 'Piccoli, P', 'Chilosi, M', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F']","['Granziero L', 'Ghia P', 'Circosta P', 'Gottardi D', 'Strola G', 'Geuna M', 'Montagna L', 'Piccoli P', 'Chilosi M', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', '*Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*immunology', 'Survivin']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.9.2777 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55709-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 1;97(9):2777-83. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.9.2777.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloid malignancies provide a unique opportunity to derive dendritic cells (DCs), functioning antigen-presenting cells, from the malignant cells themselves. These may then co-express leukemic antigens together with appropriate secondary signals and be used to generate a specific, antileukemic immune response. In this study, blasts from 40 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were cultured with combinations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 4, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, and development to DCs was assessed. After culture, cells from 24 samples exhibited morphological and immunophenotypic features of DCs, including expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, CD1a, CD83, and CD86, and were potent stimulators in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Stimulation of autologous T-cell responses was assessed by the proliferative response of autologous T cells to the leukemic DCs and by demonstration of the induction of specific, autologous, antileukemic cytotoxicity. Of 17 samples, 11 were effective stimulators in the autologous MLR, and low, but consistent, autologous, antileukemic cytotoxicity was induced in 8 of 11 cases (mean, 27%; range, 17%-37%).

Theoretical values of V(H) segment usage were calculated with the assumption that all V(H) segments capable of undergoing rearrangement have an equal probability of selection for recombination. Leukemic clones from 127 patients with adult B-lineage acute leukemias were studied by fingerprinting by means of primers for the framework 1 and joining segments. Clones from early preimmune B cells (245 alleles identified) show a predominance of V(H)6 family rearrangements and, consequently, do not conform to this hypothesis. However, profiles of V(H) gene family usage in mature B cells, as investigated in peripheral blood (6 samples), B-cell lymphomas (36 clones) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (56 clones), are in agreement with this theoretical profile. Sequence analyses of 64 V(H) clones in adult ALL revealed that the rate of V(H) usage is proportional to the proximity of the V(H) gene to the J(H) locus and that the relationship can be mathematically defined. Except for V(H)6, no other V(H) gene is excessively used in adult ALL. V(H) pseudogenes are rarely used (n = 2), which implies the existence of early mechanisms in the pathway to B-cell maturation to reduce wasteful V(H)-(D(H))-J(H) recombination. Finally, similar to early immunoglobulin-H rearrangement patterns in the mouse, B cells of ALL derive from a pool of cells more immature than the cells in chronic lymphoid B-cell malignancies.","['Mortuza, F Y', 'Moreira, I M', 'Papaioannou, M', 'Gameiro, P', 'Coyle, L A', 'Gricks, C S', 'Amlot, P', 'Prentice, H G', 'Madrigal, A', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Foroni, L']","['Mortuza FY', 'Moreira IM', 'Papaioannou M', 'Gameiro P', 'Coyle LA', 'Gricks CS', 'Amlot P', 'Prentice HG', 'Madrigal A', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Foroni L']","['Department of Haematology and Immunology, Royal Free and University College of London (Royal Free Campus), London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.9.2716 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55701-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 1;97(9):2716-26. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.9.2716.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, retrovirus-mediated gene transfer (RMGT) was used to restore p16(INK4a) expression in the p16(INK4a)-deficient lymphoid and myeloid cell lines BV173 and K562, and it was confirmed that this inhibited their growth. Second, to sequester p16(INK4a) and related INK4 proteins, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) was retrovirally transduced into normal human CD34(+) bone marrow cells and then cultured in myeloid colony-forming cell (CFC) assays. The growth of CDK4-transduced colonies was more rapid; the cell-doubling time was reduced; and, upon replating, the colonies produced greater yields of secondary colonies than mock-untransduced controls. Third, colony formation was compared by marrow cells from p16(INK4a-/-) mice and wild-type mice. The results from p16(INK4a-/-) marrow were similar to those from CDK4-transduced human CFCs, in terms of growth rate and replating ability, and were partially reversed by RMGT of p16(INK4a). Lines of immature granulocytic cells were raised from 15 individual colonies grown from the marrow of p16(INK4a-/-) mice. These had a high colony-forming ability (15%) and replating efficiency (96.7%). The p16(INK4a-/-) cell lines readily became growth factor-independent upon cytokine deprivation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of INK4 proteins, in particular p16(INK4a), increases the growth rate of myeloid colonies in vitro and, more importantly, confers an increased ability for clonal expansion on hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Lewis, J L', 'Chinswangwatanakul, W', 'Zheng, B', 'Marley, S B', 'Nguyen, D X', 'Cross, N C', 'Banerji, L', 'Glassford, J', 'Thomas, N S', 'Goldman, J M', 'Lam, E W', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Lewis JL', 'Chinswangwatanakul W', 'Zheng B', 'Marley SB', 'Nguyen DX', 'Cross NC', 'Banerji L', 'Glassford J', 'Thomas NS', 'Goldman JM', 'Lam EW', 'Gordon MY']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Campus, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.9.2604 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55686-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 1;97(9):2604-10. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.9.2604.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human recombinant TRAIL alone variably affected the survival/growth of erythroleukemic cells; K562 cells were the most sensitive. Moreover, all erythroleukemic cells were radio-resistant, as demonstrated by the fact that cytotoxicity was evident only after treatment with high-dose (15 Gy) IR. Remarkably, when IR and TRAIL were used in combination, an additive effect was noticed in all erythroleukemic cells. Augmentation of TRAIL-induced cell death by IR was observed with both low and high IR doses and required the sequential treatment of IR 3 to 6 hours before the addition of TRAIL. Conversely, both TRAIL and IR showed a moderate cytotoxicity on primary CD34(+)-derived normal erythroblasts when used alone, but their combination did not show any additive effect. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of IR plus TRAIL observed in erythroleukemic cells was accompanied by the selective up-regulation of the surface expression of TRAIL-R1 (DR4), and it was completely blocked by the z-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-CH(2) (z-VAD-fmk) caspase inhibitor. On the other hand, the surface expression of TRAIL-R1 in CD34(+)-derived normal erythroblasts was unaffected by IR, which induced the up-regulation of the decoy TRAIL-R3. These data demonstrate that treatment with IR provides an approach to selectively sensitize erythroleukemic cells, but not normal erythroblasts, to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the functional up-regulation of TRAIL-R1.","['Di Pietro, R', 'Secchiero, P', 'Rana, R', 'Gibellini, D', 'Visani, G', 'Bemis, K', 'Zamai, L', 'Miscia, S', 'Zauli, G']","['Di Pietro R', 'Secchiero P', 'Rana R', 'Gibellini D', 'Visani G', 'Bemis K', 'Zamai L', 'Miscia S', 'Zauli G']","['Institute of Human Morphology, ""G.

The neutrophils of individuals with SGD display atypical bi-lobed nuclei, lack expression of all secondary and tertiary granule proteins, and possess defects in chemotaxis, disaggregation, receptor up-regulation, and bactericidal activity, resulting in frequent and severe bacterial infections. Previously, a homozygous mutation in the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) gene was reported for one case of SGD. To substantiate the role of C/EBPepsilon in the development of SGD and elucidate its mechanism of inheritance, the mutational status of the gene was determined in a second individual. An A-nucleotide insertion in the coding region of the C/EBPepsilon gene was detected. This mutation completely abolished the predicted translation of all C/EBPepsilon isoforms. Microsatellite and nucleotide sequence analyses of the C/EBPepsilon locus in the parents of the proband indicated that the disorder may have resulted from homozygous recessive inheritance of the mutant allele from an ancestor shared by both parents. The mutant C/EBPepsilon(32) protein localized in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus and was unable to activate transcription. Consistent with this, a significant decrease in the levels of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the secondary granule protein human 18-kd cationic antimicrobial protein (hCAP-18)/LL-37 and the primary granule protein bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein were observed in the patient. The hCAP-18 mRNA was induced by overexpression of C/EBPepsilon(32) in the human myeloid leukemia cell line, U937, supporting the hypothesis that C/EBPepsilon is a key regulator of granule gene synthesis. This study strongly implicates mutation of the C/EBPepsilon gene as the primary genetic defect involved in the development of neutrophil SGD and defines its mechanism of inheritance.","['Gombart, A F', 'Shiohara, M', 'Kwok, S H', 'Agematsu, K', 'Komiyama, A', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Gombart AF', 'Shiohara M', 'Kwok SH', 'Agematsu K', 'Komiyama A', 'Koeffler HP']","['Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Burns and Allen Research Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. gombarta@csmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Female', '*Frameshift Mutation', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/congenital/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Neutrophils/pathology']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.9.2561 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55680-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 May 1;97(9):2561-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.9.2561.,['CA26038-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, expression of the retrovirally transferred genes is variable (position effect and expression variegation) because retroviruses are highly susceptible to the influence of the host genome sequences which flank the integration site. We have investigated this phenomenon with respect to the human housekeeping enzyme, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (hG6PD). We have constructed retroviral vectors in which the hG6PD cDNA is driven by either of two conventional retroviral promoters and enhancers from the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) and the Myeloproliferative Sarcoma Virus (MPSV) long terminal repeats (LTR) or by the hG6PD own promoter replacing most of enhancer and promoter LTR (GRU5). We have compared the activity of retrovirally transferred hG6PD driven by these promoters after retroviral integration in bulk cultures and in individual clones of murine fibroblasts. The level of hG6PD expressed by the hG6PD promoter of GRU5-G6PD was significantly lower than that expressed by conventional retroviral vectors. However, analysis of the single copy clones showed less variation of expression with GRU5-G6PD (coefficient of variation, CV, 35.5%) than with conventional vectors (CV, 58.9%). Thus we have several vectors competent for reliable transfer and expression of hG6PD. The hG6PD promoter provides reproducible expression of hG6PD and limits the variability of expression. This decreased variability is important in order to help ensuring a consistent level of delivery of the needed gene product in future therapeutic protocols.","['De Angioletti, M', 'Rovira, A', 'Notaro, R', 'Camacho Vanegas, O', 'Sadelain, M', 'Luzzatto, L']","['De Angioletti M', 'Rovira A', 'Notaro R', 'Camacho Vanegas O', 'Sadelain M', 'Luzzatto L']","['Department of Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transfection']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111901003948 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00394-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2001 Apr 18;267(2):221-31. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00394-8.,"['HL57612/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL59312/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, potential cross-reactivity to these ubiquitously expressed MAGE gene products should be considered in the design of MAGE-targeted immunotherapies for cancer.","['Stone, B', 'Schummer, M', 'Paley, P J', 'Crawford, M', 'Ford, M', 'Urban, N', 'Nelson, B H']","['Stone B', 'Schummer M', 'Paley PJ', 'Crawford M', 'Ford M', 'Urban N', 'Nelson BH']","['Virginia Mason Research Center, 1201 Ninth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98101-2795, USA. bstone@vmresearch.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (MAGEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Cross Reactions', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111901004061 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00406-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2001 Apr 18;267(2):173-82. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00406-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The T-lymphotropic Herpesvirus saimiri establishes specific replicative and persistent conditions in different primate host species. Virtually all squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) are persistently infected with this virus. In its natural host, the virus does not cause disease, whereas it induces fatal acute T-cell lymphoma in other monkey species after experimental infection. The virus can be isolated by cocultivation of permissive epithelial cells with peripheral blood cells from naturally infected squirrel monkeys and from susceptible New World monkeys during the virus-induced disease. Tumour-derived and in vitro-transformed T-cell lines from New World monkeys release virus particles. Herpesvirus ateles is a closely related virus of spider monkeys (Ateles spp.) and has similar pathogenic properties to Herpesvirus saimiri in other New World primate species. Similar to other rhadinoviruses, the genome of Herpesvirus saimiri harbours a series of virus genes with pronounced homology to cellular counterparts including a D-type cyclin, a G-protein-coupled receptor, an interleukin-17, a superantigen homologue, and several inhibitors of the complement cascade and of different apoptosis pathways. Preserved function has been demonstrated for most of the homologues of cellular proteins. These viral functions are mostly dispensable for the transforming and pathogenic capability of the virus. However, they are considered relevant for the apathogenic persistence of Herpesvirus saimiri in its natural host. A terminal region of the non-repetitive coding part of the virus genome is essential for pathogenicity and T-cell transformation. Based on the pathogenic phenotypes and the different alleles of this variable region, the virus strains have been assigned to three subgroups, termed A, B and C. In the highly oncogenic subgroup C strains, the two virus genes stpC and tip are transcribed from one bicistronic mRNA and are essential for transformation and leukaemia induction. stpC fulfils the typical criteria of an oncogene; its product interacts with Ras and tumour necrosis factor-associated factors and induces mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa B activation. Tip interacts with the RNA transport factor Tap, with signal transduction and activation of transcription factors, and with the T-cellular tyrosine kinase Lck, which is activated by this interaction and phosphorylates Tip as a substrate. It is of particular interest that certain subgroup C virus strains such as C488 are capable of transforming human T lymphocytes to stable growth in culture. The transformed human T cells harbour multiple copies of the viral genome in the form of stable, non-integrated episomes. The cells express only a few virus genes and do not produce virus particles. The transformed cells maintain the antigen specificity and many other essential functions of their parental T-cell clones. Based on the preserved functional phenotype of the transformed T cells, Herpesvirus saimiri provides useful tools for T-cell immunology, for gene transfer and possibly also for experimental adoptive immunotherapy.","['Fickenscher, H', 'Fleckenstein, B']","['Fickenscher H', 'Fleckenstein B']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany. fickenscher@viro.med.uni-elargen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The resulting dogma against an infectious cause for cancer produced great prejudice in the scientific community against the first report of an oncogenic virus by Rous early in the 20th century and, even in the 1950s, against Gross's finding of a murine leukaemia virus and a murine virus causing solid tumours. The Lucke frog renal carcinoma virus was the first cancer-associated herpesvirus. Intriguingly, an environmental factor, ambient temperature, determines virus genome expression in the poikilothermic frog cells. Although an alpha-herpesvirus, Marek's disease virus of chickens shares some aspects of biological behaviour with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) of man. Very significantly, its lymphomas are the first naturally occurring malignancy to be controlled by an antiviral vaccine, with implications for human virus-associated cancers. The circumstances and climate of opinion in which successive gamma-herpesviruses were discovered are described. The identification of EBV involved two unconventionalities: its finding in cultured Burkitt's lymphoma cells when no human lymphoid cell had ever been maintained in vitro, and its recognition in the absence of biological activity by the then new technique of electron microscopy. These factors engendered hostility to its acceptance as a new human tumour-associated virus. The EBV-like agents of Old World apes and monkeys and the T-lymphotropic gamma-herpesviruses of New World monkeys were found at about the same time, not long after the discovery of EBV. For many years these were thought to be the only gamma-herpesviruses of non-human primates; however, very recently B-lymphotropic EBV-like agents have been identified in New World species as well. Mouse herpesvirus 68 came to light by chance during a search for arboviruses and has become important as a laboratory model because of its close genetic relatedness to EBV and its comparable biological behaviour. The discovery of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus six years ago was made using unconventional new methods, but, unlike with EBV 30 years before, this did not hinder its acceptance. This contrast is discussed in the context of the great progress in human tumour virology which has been made in recent years.","['Epstein, M A']",['Epstein MA'],"['Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The effects of garcinol and curcumin on cell viability in human leukemia HL-60 cells were investigated. Garcinol and curcumin displayed strong growth inhibitory effects against human leukemia HL-60 cells, with estimated IC(50) values of 9.42 and 19.5 microM, respectively. Garcinol was able to induce apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; however, curcumin was less effective. Treatment with garcinol caused induction of caspase-3/CPP32 activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but not caspase-1 activity, and induced the degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Pretreatment with caspase-3 inhibitor inhibited garcinol-induced DNA fragmentation. Treatment with garcinol (20 microM) caused a rapid loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol, and subsequent induction of procaspase-9 processing. The cleavage of D4-GDI, an abundant hematopoietic cell GDP dissociation inhibitor for the Ras-related Rho family GTPases, occurred simultaneously with the activation of caspase-3 but preceded DNA fragmentation and the morphological changes associated with apoptotic cell death. Of these, Bcl-2, Bad, and Bax were studied. The level of expression of Bcl-2 slightly decreased, while the levels of Bad and Bax were dramatically increased in cells treated with garcinol. These results indicate that garcinol allows caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease to enter the nucleus and degrade chromosomal DNA and induces DFF-45 (DNA fragmentation factor) degradation. It is suggested that garcinol-induced apoptosis is triggered by the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, procaspase-9 processing, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-2, degradation of PARP, and DNA fragmentation caused by the caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease through the digestion of DFF-45. The induction of apoptosis by garcinol may provide a pivotal mechanism for its cancer chemopreventive action.","['Pan, M H', 'Chang, W L', 'Lin-Shiau, S Y', 'Ho, C T', 'Lin, J K']","['Pan MH', 'Chang WL', 'Lin-Shiau SY', 'Ho CT', 'Lin JK']","['Institutes of Biochemistry and Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'TR1VR1V71B (garcinol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*toxicity', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Terpenes/*toxicity']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['jf001129v [pii]', '10.1021/jf001129v [doi]']",ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2001 Mar;49(3):1464-74. doi: 10.1021/jf001129v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The utility of these cell lines for the production of clinical grade vectors critically depends on the definition of optimal conditions for scaled-up cultures. In this work, a clone derived from the TE Fly GALV packaging cell (Duisit et al. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999, 10, 189) that produces high titers of a lacZ containing retroviral vector with a Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus envelope glycoprotein was used. This clone can produce (2-5) x 10(6) PFU cm(-3) in small scale cultures and has been evaluated for growth and vector production in different reactor systems. The performances of fixed bed reactors [CellCube (Costar) and Celligen (New Brunswick)] and stirred tank reactors [microcarriers and clump cultures] were compared. The cells showed a higher apparent growth rate in the fixed bed reactor systems than in the suspension systems, probably as a result of the fact that aggregation and/or formation of clumps led to a reduced viability and reduced growth of cells in the interior of the clumps. As a consequence, the final cell density and number were in average 3- to 7-fold higher in the fixed bed systems in comparison to the suspension culture systems. The average titers obtained ranged from 0.5 to 2.1 x 10(7) PFU cm(-3) for the fixed bed and microcarrier systems, while the clump cultures produced only (2-5) x 10(5) PFU cm(-3). The differences in titers reflect cell densities as well as specific viral vector production rates, with the immobilization and microcarrier systems exhibiting an at least 10-fold higher production rate in comparison to the clump cultures. A partial optimization of the culture conditions in the Celligen fixed bed reactor, consisting of a 9-fold reduction of the seeding cell density, led to a 5-fold increased vector production rate accompanied by an average titer of 3 x 10(7) PFU cm(-3) (maximum titer (4-5) x 10(7) PFU cm(-3)) in the fixed bed reactor. The performance evaluation results using mathematical models indicated that the fixed bed bioreactor has a higher potential for retroviral vector production because of both the higher reactor productivity and the lower sensitivity of productivity in relation to the changes in final retrovirus titer in the range of 3 x 10(6) to 15 x 10(6) PFU cm(-3).","['Merten, O W', 'Cruz, P E', 'Rochette, C', 'Geny-Fiamma, C', 'Bouquet, C', 'Goncalves, D', 'Danos, O', 'Carrondo, M J']","['Merten OW', 'Cruz PE', 'Rochette C', 'Geny-Fiamma C', 'Bouquet C', 'Goncalves D', 'Danos O', 'Carrondo MJ']","[""Genethon III, CNRS URA 1923, 1, rue de l'Internationale, F-91002 Evry, France. omerten@genethon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,,IM,"['*Bioreactors', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Vectors/*biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",2001/04/21 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/04/21 10:00'],"['2001/04/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['bp000162z [pii]', '10.1021/bp000162z [doi]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2001 Mar-Apr;17(2):326-35. doi: 10.1021/bp000162z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These sequences include the enhancer and sequences between the enhancer and promoter (DEN). In a previous study we showed that a virus missing the DEN region in its LTR was severely attenuated in its ability to induce thymic lymphoma. In this study we observed that a virus with an LTR consisting of DEN but no enhancer sequences was pathogenic. We compared the pathogenicity of this DEN virus with other LTR mutant MCF13 viruses that contained a single enhancer (1R) or a single enhancer plus DEN (1R + DEN). All LTR mutant viruses generated thymic lymphoma, however, at a much lower incidence and with a longer latency compared with wild-type (WT) MCF13 virus. DEN virus replication in the thymus was the lowest compared with the 1R and 1R + DEN viruses. Viral replication in a different thymic subpopulation could not explain the decreased pathogenicity of the LTR mutant viruses compared with WT virus. However, lower levels of mutant virus replication in the thymus compared with WT during the preleukemic period may contribute to the attenuation of pathogenicity. The phenotype of tumors induced by the mutant viruses was similar and differed from tumors induced by WT virus by the presence of CD3(-)CD4(-)CD8(-) cells. Analysis of LTR sequences of infectious virus rescued from tumors induced by the 1R and 1R + DEN viruses showed that amplification of enhancer sequences had occurred during tumor development. The lack of DEN virus expression by tumor cells led us to propose that DEN sequences may play a role at an early step in tumorigenesis.","['Yoshimura, F K', 'Wang, T']","['Yoshimura FK', 'Wang T']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Wayne State University, 540 E.

By cotransfection of a synthetic gene encoding a tRNA(Pro)-like RNA with a match to PBS-X2, the activity of this vector could be restored to a transduction efficiency slightly lower than that of the wild-type vector.

The importance of tRNA backbone identity was further analyzed by complementing the PBS-X2 vector with a gene for a matching x2 primer with a tRNA backbone, which led to three- to fourfold-higher titers than those observed for the x2 primer with the tRNA(Pro) backbone.

However, insertion of the locus control regions (LCRs) derived from the beta-globin gene locus or the CD2 gene into MLV vectors frequently led to vector rearrangement. Since the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequence diverges significantly from the MLV sequence, we tested whether the LCR sequence is more stable in the context of an HIV vector. Clones derived from human fibrosarcoma line HT1080 cells transduced with an HIV vector containing the T-cell-specific CD2 LCR exhibit the same wide range of transgene expression as clones lacking the LCR. In contrast, Jurkat and primary T-cell clones derived from the transduction of the LCR-containing vector show, on average, a three- to fourfold increase in transgene expression relative to that of the control vector. This is consistent with previous observations that the CD2 LCR contains a T-cell-specific enhancer. In addition, the clones derived from the LCR-containing vector have a much lower clonal variation in transgene expression than those derived from the control vector. We also demonstrate that the level of transgene expression is proportional to the vector copy number. These results suggest that the human CD2 LCR sequence is compatible with HIV vector sequences and confers enhanced integration site-independent and copy number-dependent expression of the transgene. Thus, HIV vectors may represent the ideal vehicle to deliver genes controlled by various cis-acting elements such as LCRs.","['Kowolik, C M', 'Hu, J', 'Yee, J K']","['Kowolik CM', 'Hu J', 'Yee JK']","['Department of Virology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['CD2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Globins/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Locus Control Region', '*Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.10.4641-4648.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 May;75(10):4641-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.10.4641-4648.2001.,['AI46030/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC114217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recombinant SU-immunoadhesins were used as probes to investigate the cellular binding of FIV SU. In agreement with the host cell range properties of both viruses, binding of 34TF10 gp95-Fc was observed for all cell lines tested, whereas PPR gp95-Fc bound only to primary feline T cells. 34TF10 gp95-Fc also bound to Jurkat and HeLa cells, consistent with the ability of FIV to use human CXCR4 as a fusion receptor. As expected, 34TF10 gp95-Fc binding to Jurkat cells was blocked by addition of stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha), as was binding to the 3201 feline lymphoma cell line. However, SDF-1alpha, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, and heparin all failed to inhibit the binding of either gp95-Fc to primary T cells, suggesting that a non-CXCR4 receptor is involved in the binding of FIV SU. In this regard, an unidentified 40-kDa protein species from the surface of primary T cells but not Jurkat and 3201 cells specifically coprecipitated with both gp95-Fc. Yet another type of binding of 34TF10 gp95-Fc to adherent kidney cells was noted. SDF-1alpha failed to block the binding of 34TF10 gp95-Fc to either HeLa, Crandel feline leukemia, or G355-5 cells. However, binding was severely impaired in the presence of soluble heparin, as well as after enzymatic removal of surface heparans or on cells deficient in heparan expression. These overall findings suggest that in addition to CXCR4, a non-CXCR4 receptor and cell-surface heparans also play an important role in FIV gp95 cell surface interactions on specific target cells.","['de Parseval, A', 'Elder, J H']","['de Parseval A', 'Elder JH']","['Department of Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. aymeric@scripps.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heparitin Sulfate/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*metabolism/physiology', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.10.4528-4539.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 May;75(10):4528-39. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.10.4528-4539.2001.,"['R01 AI025825/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI25825/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC114206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have performed interference assays with M813 and viruses from four interference groups of MuLV. The infection efficiency of M813 was not compromised in cells expressing any one of the other MuLVs, demonstrating that M813 must use a distinct receptor for cell entry. The entire M813 env coding region was molecularly cloned. Sequence analysis revealed high similarity with other MuLVs but with a unique receptor-binding domain. Substitution of M813 env sequences in Moloney MuLV resulted in a replication-competent virus with a host range and interference profile similar to those of the biological clone M813.

Among these factors, Ets1, Erg1 and Fli1 are expressed in endothelial cells during angiogenesis in normal and pathological development. The expression of these transcription factors is regulated by angiogenic factors in cultured endothelial cells, as well as by various stresses occurring during angiogenesis. Transfection experiments and transgenic mice analysis revealed that Ets family members are involved in the transcriptional regulation of endothelial specific genes such as those encoding Tie1 and -2, VEGFR1 and -2 and VE-Cadherin. In vitro studies plead for a role of Ets family members in endothelial cell adhesion, spreading and motility. Gene inactivation experiments show that Ets1 is dispensable for embryonic development. The phenotype of knocked-out embryos indicates that Tel is required for maintenance of the developing vascular network in the yolk sac. Altogether, we suggest that Ets family members act both positively and negatively during the different steps of the angiogenic process. The regulation of the initiation of gene transcription arises from the combined activity of different transcriptional regulators. Therefore very few transcription factors are specific for a physiological process, or a given cell type. The transcriptional network that regulates blood vessel formation involves transcription factors which are expressed in a variety of situations. The Lung Kruppel Like Factor (LKLF) which is required for blood vessel stabilisation during murine development is also expressed in the primitive vertebrae and in the lung of the adult (C.T. Kuo, M.L. Veselits, K.P. Barton, M.M. Lu, C. Clendenin, J.M. Leiden, The LKLF transcription factor is required for normal tunica media formation and blood vessel stabilisation during murine embryogenesis, Genes Dev. 11 (22) (1997) 2996-3006). Scl/Tal1 which is essential for angiogenic remodelling of the yolk sac capillary network (J.E. Visvader, Y. Fujiwara, S.H. Orkin, Unsuspected role for the T-cell leukemia protein SCL/tal-1 in vascular development, Genes Dev. 12 (4) (1998) 473-479), is involved in blood cell development and is also expressed in the developing brain. The EPAS transcription factor which was thought to be endothelial cell specific in the mouse embryo (H. Tian, S.L. McKnight, D.W. Russell, Endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1), a transcription factor selectively expressed in endothelial cells, Genes Dev. 11 (1) (1997) 72-82) is also expressed in the liver, kidney and cells of the sympathetic nervous system of the chick embryo (J. Favier, H. Kempf, P. Corvol, J.M. Gasc, Cloning and expression pattern of EPAS1 in the chicken embryo. Colocalization with tyrosine hydroxylase, FEBS Lett. 462 (1-2) (1999) 19-24). Ets1, which expression was originally detected in lymphoid cells of adult tissues, has been the first transcription factor to be identified in endothelial cells during angiogenesis in the embryo (B. Vandenbunder, L. Pardanaud, T. Jaffredo, M.A. Mirabel, D. Stehelin, Complementary patterns of expression of c-etsl, c-myb and c-myc in the blood-forming system of the chick embryo, Development 107 (1989) 265-274 [5]) and in tumours (N. Wernert, M.B. Raes, P. Lassalle, M.P. Dehouck, B. Gosselin, B. Vandenbunder, D. Stehelin, The c-ets 1 proto-oncogene is a transcription factor expressed in endothelial cells during tumor vascularisation and other forms of angiogenesis in man, Am. J. Path. 140 (1992) 119-127 [6]). Since then, the Ets family has extended and this review will emphasise the relationships between these factors and angiogenesis.","['Lelievre, E', 'Lionneton, F', 'Soncin, F', 'Vandenbunder, B']","['Lelievre E', 'Lionneton F', 'Soncin F', 'Vandenbunder B']","['Institut de Biologie de Lille, 1, rue du Professeur Calmette, BP 447, 59021, Lille Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endothelium/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(01)00025-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(01)00025-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2001 Apr;33(4):391-407. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(01)00025-5.,,,,,,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increase in capsaicin concentration to 10 microM inhibited Ca(2+) clearance from the cytosol, but did not affect the amplitude of intracellular Ca(2+) elevation. In DRG neurons, 10 microM capsaicin also produced a significant drop in mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi), as measured with the mitochondria-specific potentiometric fluorescent dye JC-1. Similar loss of mitochondrial potential upon application of capsaicin was observed in non-neuronal primary (human lymphocytes) and transformed (human myeloid leukaemia cell line, HL-60) cells. The EC(50) values for capsaicin-induced mitochondrial depolarisation were 6.9 microM (DRG neurons), 200 microM (human lymphocytes) and 150 microM (HL-60 cells). Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or an application of the antioxidant trolox attenuated capsaicin-induced dissipation of Deltapsi in DRG neurons, but not in human lymphocytes and HL-60 cells. Rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and oligomycin, an inhibitor of F(0)F(1)-ATPase, significantly enhanced the mitochondrial depolarisation produced by capsaicin in DRG neurons. In human lymphocytes and HL-60 cells, only oligomycin potentiated the effect of capsaicin. From our results, we suggest that, in DRG neurons and non-neuronal cells, capsaicin dissipates Deltapsi, possibly due to a direct inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The presence of vanilloid receptor-1 in DRG neurons makes their mitochondria 20-30-fold more sensitive to the depolarising effect of capsaicin compared with non-neuronal cells lacking vanilloid receptor-1. The higher sensitivity of DRG neurons to capsaicin may underlie a selective neurotoxicity of capsaicin towards sensory neurons.","['Dedov, V N', 'Mandadi, S', 'Armati, P J', 'Verkhratsky, A']","['Dedov VN', 'Mandadi S', 'Armati PJ', 'Verkhratsky A']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. vadimd@pharm.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Capsaicin/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Neurons/metabolism/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Receptors, Drug/*physiology']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0306452200005406 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(00)00540-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2001;103(1):219-26. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(00)00540-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variations in survival in relation to age, country, histologic subtype and period of diagnosis (1978--1992) were examined. These are rare malignancies and survival can be studied reliably only by examination of data from a very large population (in this case EUROCARE). 5 years after diagnosis, overall survival was 44% (95% CI 33--55) for CML and 37% (95% CI 32--43) for ANLL. For both types of leukaemia, survival was slightly better for girls and worse in children under 5 years of age. Consistent with clinical literature, the ANLL subtypes with poorer prognosis were monocytic, megakaryocytic and erythroleukaemia. For ANLL, 5-year survival was better in Finland, the UK, The Netherlands and Germany (> or =40%); for CML, 5-year survival was highest in Italy, although the 95% CI were wide. The risk of death from ANLL and CML fell by 7% per year and 5% per year, respectively, after adjustment for age, gender and country.

Data on 13344 newly diagnosed children (0--14 years) with ALL were included in the EUROCARE study and were collected were collected by 34 population-based cancer registries (four comprising only childhood malignancies), operating in 17 countries (four in Scandinavia, two in Southern Europe, three in Eastern Europe, six in Continental Europe and two in the UK). Age-specific crude survival rates were estimated for boys and girls according to country for the period 1985--1989 and in adjusted form to attain comparability. Overall pooled and weighted rates were estimated as European standards. Children dead at diagnosis or diagnosed only through a death certificate were excluded. Geographical variation was also estimated by calculating the relative death rate with respect to the pooled overall European rate. After adjustment for age, gender and country, a Cox regression analysis was used to estimate time trends in survival. Survival was compared with that in the USA, Japan, Canada and Australia. During 1985--1989, the 1-year survival rate varied from 99 to 79%, the 5-year survival rate from over 80 to 56% (with the exception of Estonia; 34%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 20--52) among the various countries; the European weighted means were 90 (95% CI 87--93) and 72% (95% CI 69--75), respectively. Survival was particularly favourable in (south) Sweden, Finland, Germany and The Netherlands and rather unfavourable in Estonia and (surprisingly) France, where only 4% of its population was covered by the participating registries. Compared with the period 1978--1981, the hazard ratio for the period 1986--1989 decreased to 0.59 (95% CI 0.54--0.64) and -- in a smaller set of registries -- to 0.49 (0.45--0.55) for 1990-1992, an annual decrease in this rate of approximately 3.5%. During 1985--1989, the 5-year survival rates for European children were largely similar to those found in the USA, Canada and Australia, but markedly better than those in Japan. Higher survival rates were found for countries with 'good' access to centrally organised diagnostic and treatment facilities which stimulated 'aggressive' treatments according to a protocol. However, a subdivision according to risk profiles, e.g. according to the initial white blood cell count at diagnosis, could not be made and this might have explained partially the geographical differences in survival, because a positive association appeared between incidence at age 1--4 years and 5-year survival in most countries.","['Coebergh, J W', 'Pastore, G', 'Gatta, G', 'Corazziari, I', 'Kamps, W']","['Coebergh JW', 'Pastore G', 'Gatta G', 'Corazziari I', 'Kamps W']","['Dutch Childhood Leukaemia Study Group, PO Box 43515, 2504 AM, The Hague, The Netherlands. coebergh@wxs.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate/trends']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(01)00013-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(01)00013-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2001 Apr;37(6):687-94. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(01)00013-2.,,,,,,,,['EUROCARE Working Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first systematic evaluation of survival after childhood cancer on a large scale in Europe: approximately 45,000 cases were included, diagnosed between 1978 and 1992 (34,814 cases diagnosed in 1978--1989 and an additional set of 9495 cases diagnosed in 1990--1992) and followed-up until 1995. Data were provided from 34 population-based registries (four specialised for childhood cancer registrations and one specialised registry for childhood leukaemia) in 17 countries of Europe (where there was national coverage in 10 countries). Quality of the data was fairly good, given the general differences among the countries and their health systems, thereby allowing for comparisons between them. Among cases diagnosed in 1978--1989, overall 2.0% were lost to follow-up, 91.8% were microscopically diagnosed and 93.4% of alive cases had at least 5 years of observation. Survival proportions (observed survival) were calculated for each of the countries involved, by age group (0, 1--4, 5--9, 10--14 years), gender, different time periods and selected diagnostic groups. Age-standardised cumulative survival rates and European averages (weighted and pooled) were also computed. Cox regression models were used to evaluate geographical and temporal differences. The EUROCARE database represents a unique source of information on survival of childhood cancer patients in Europe, intercountry differences and time trends in survival.","['Magnani, C', 'Gatta, G', 'Corazziari, I', 'Kramarova, E', 'Pastore, G', 'Viscomi, S', 'Stiller, C']","['Magnani C', 'Gatta G', 'Corazziari I', 'Kramarova E', 'Pastore G', 'Viscomi S', 'Stiller C']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont -- Cancer Epidemiology Unit of the Centre for Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention (CPO-Piemonte), ASO S.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein (e.g. I-P-L-D-P-V-A-G-Y-K) reveals that it is bovine fetuin, a fetal protein functioning to control embryogenesis. The apoptosis-inducing activity of fetuin is totally dependent on zinc. Depletion of zinc ion from fetuin or substitution of zinc ion by barium ion completely abolished the apoptosis-inducing activity of fetuin. Interestingly, while the fetuin isolated from fetal serum selectively induces apoptosis in cancer without affecting normal cells, the fetuin isolated from mature serum is completely inactive. This suggests that the biological activity of fetuin is under developmental regulation. In vivo, tumor animal model studies showed that fetuin enhanced survival by up to 141% in P388 leukemia animal model in mice. Fetuin was also found to inhibit prostate cancer formation in a PC-3 prostate cancer model in mice.","['Yu, C L', 'Tsai, M H']","['Yu CL', 'Tsai MH']","['Ambryx Biotechnology Inc., Oak Park, CA 91377, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '24GP945V5T (Barium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Barium', 'Cations, Divalent', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(01)00417-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00417-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2001 May 26;166(2):173-84. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00417-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compounds were evaluated for growth inhibitory properties in P388 leukemia, Lewis lung carcinoma, and wild-type (JL(C)) and mutant (JL(A) and JL(D)) forms of human Jurkat leukemia with low levels of topoisomerase II (topo II). The compounds all had IC(50) ratios of <1 in the resistant Jurkat lines, consistent with topo II inhibition not being the primary mechanism of action. Analogues joined by an (CH(2))(2)NR(CH(2))(2)NR(CH(2))(2) linker were extremely potent cytotoxins, with selectivity toward the human cell lines, but absolute potencies declined sharply from R = H through R = Me to R = Pr and Bu. In contrast, (CH(2))(2)NR(CH(2))(3)NR(CH(2))(2) compounds showed reverse effects, with the R = Me analogue being more potent than the R = H one as well as being the most potent in the series [IC(50) in JL(C) cells 0.08 nM; superior to that for the clinical bis(naphthalimide) LU 79553]. Overall, the IC(50)s of analogues with linker chains (CH(2))(n)NH(CH(2))(m)NH(CH(2))(n) were inversely proportional to linker length. Constraining the rigidity of the linker chain by incorporating a piperazine ring did not decrease potency significantly. A representative compound bound tightly to DNA with high selectivity for GC sites, compatible with recent work suggesting that compounds of this type place their side chains in the major groove, making specific contacts with guanine bases. Representative compounds were susceptible to transport mediated resistance, being much less effective in cells that overexpressed P-glycoprotein. Overall the results suggest these compounds have a similar mode of action, mediated primarily by poisoning of topo I (possibly with some involvement of topo II). The bis(9-methylphenazine-1-carboxamides) show very high in vitro growth inhibitory potencies compared to their monomeric analogues. Two compounds showed in vivo activity in murine colon 38 syngeneic and HT29 human colon tumor xenograft models using intraperitoneal dosing.","['Gamage, S A', 'Spicer, J A', 'Finlay, G J', 'Stewart, A J', 'Charlton, P', 'Baguley, B C', 'Denny, W A']","['Gamage SA', 'Spicer JA', 'Finlay GJ', 'Stewart AJ', 'Charlton P', 'Baguley BC', 'Denny WA']","['Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1000, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenazines)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Amides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cations, Divalent', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/chemistry', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/chemistry', 'DNA, Superhelical/chemistry', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phenazines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['jm0003283 [pii]', '10.1021/jm0003283 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2001 Apr 26;44(9):1407-15. doi: 10.1021/jm0003283.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the requirements for functional Ikaros proteins, we overexpressed Ik7, a dominant negative Ikaros protein, in human cell lines and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Ik7 is known to block the normal function of other Ikaros family members in human and mouse cells. Retroviral-mediated overexpression of Ik7 affected two distinct, migratory properties of the CEM T-cell line. Ik7 down-regulated L-selectin cell-surface expression, an effect not a result of increased shedding but of a decrease in L-selectin mRNA levels. Ik7 also reduced the spontaneous migration of CEM T cells in 3-D collagen gels. A reduction in L-selectin, cell-surface expression was also induced by Ik7 in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. In contrast, the Reh B cell line showed an up-regulation of L-selectin, cell-surface levels when expressing Ik7. For the first time, this study defines an effect of Ikaros proteins in the control of migration-related properties and shows that intact Ikaros proteins are important in a cell type-specific manner for the normal regulation of L-selectin expression.","['Christopherson, I', 'Piechoki, M', 'Liu, G', 'Ratner, S', 'Galy, A']","['Christopherson I', 'Piechoki M', 'Liu G', 'Ratner S', 'Galy A']","['Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gels)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Collagen', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gels', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'L-Selectin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2001 Apr;69(4):675-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of the water solubilities, the DNA binding affinities, the RNA synthesis inhibitory activities, the anticancer activities of actinomycin D (AMD), and the crystal structures of DNA-AMD complexes, it becomes clear that AMD is extremely well designed as an effective poison produced by micro-organisms. The anticancer activity of AMD is mainly due to its selective inhibition of RNA synthesis. We have hypothesized that a modification on the AMD structure at a site not involved in DNA interaction can either increase or decrease the diffusion rate of the analogue into certain cancer cells. Since the i-propyl groups of the D-valine residues at the 2,2'-positions and N-methyl-L-valine residues at the 5,5'-positions in the depsipeptides do not participate in interaction with DNA, these amino acid residues were replaced with other D-amino acid residues and N-methyl-L-amino acid residues, respectively.

With several cell lines. GI50 values of 10-75 nM were observed. The mechanism of antitumor action with the new sulfonamides reported here remains obscure, but may involve inhibition of CA isozymes which predominate in tumor cell membranes (CA IX and CA XII), perhaps causing acidification of the intercellular milieu, or inhibition of intracellular isozymes which provide bicarbonate for the synthesis of nucleotides and other essential cell components (CA II and CA V). Optimization of these derivatives from the SAR point of view, might lead to the development of effective novel types of anticancer agents.","['Supuran, C T', 'Briganti, F', 'Tilli, S', 'Chegwidden, W R', 'Scozzafava, A']","['Supuran CT', 'Briganti F', 'Tilli S', 'Chegwidden WR', 'Scozzafava A']","['Universita degli Studi, Laboratorio di Chimica Inorganica e Bioinorgainica, Florence, Italy. cts@bio.chim.unifi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfonamides/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(00)00288-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(00)00288-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2001 Mar;9(3):703-14. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(00)00288-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This disease is often found in middle-aged men with the typical manifestations of pancytopenia and splenomegaly. While tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) stain of the neoplastic cells in peripheral blood smear is positive in 90% cases, bone marrow examination is still necessary for diagnosis. For treatment, splenectomy and interferon have been the standard strategies. Recently, newly-developed purine analogues, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine) and 2'-deoxycorfomycin (pentostatin), were found to achieve long lasting complete remission. Here we reported a 48-year-old men who was found to have splenomegaly and bicytopenia incidentally at routine physical checkup. Although the TRAP staining of peripheral blood showed negative result, hairy cell leukemia was finally diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy. The following splenectomy showed a typical picture of hairy cell leukemia on pathology, but cytopenia recovered only partially after surgery. One course of chemotherapy with cladribine (0.1 mg/kg/day continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days) was given after recovery from major surgery. The white cell and platelet counts normalized after treatment and he carried a stable condition thereafter. Since the disease is rare and purine analogues are newly developed, there has been no report on using 2-clorodeoxy-adenosine against hairy cell leukemia in our country.

Several compounds from diverse sources stabilize microtubules and arrest cell division similarly to the antitumour drug Taxol. We have investigated the subcellular location of the Taxol binding sites, employing a fluorescent taxoid (FLUTAX) that reversibly interacts with the Taxol binding sites of microtubules and induces cellular effects similar to Taxol. The specific binding of FLUTAX to a fraction of the available cellular binding sites effectively inhibits division of cultured human tumour cells at G(2)/M, and triggers apoptotic death. The loci of reversible binding, directly imaged in intact U937 cells treated with cytotoxic doses of fluorescent taxoid are the centrosomes, with a few associated microtubules in interphase cells, and the spindle pole microtubules in mitotic cells, instead of uniformly labelling the microtubule cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal lesions induced and visualized with FLUTAX consist of microtubule bundles and abnormal mitoses, including monopolar spindles and highly fluorescent multipolar spindles. The multiple asters and monopolar spindles mark arrested U937 leukaemia and OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma cells on their path to apoptosis (as well as K562, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells). Depending on the FLUTAX treatment, OVCAR-3 cells died from abnormal mitosis or from a subsequent interphase with double chromatin content and lobulated nuclei (micronuclei), indicating impairment of centrosome separation. Fragmented centrosomes could be observed in FLUTAX-treated non-transformed 3T3.A31 cells, which developed micronuclei but were resistant to apoptosis. These results strongly suggest that centrosomal impairment by taxoid binding during interphase, in addition to the suppression of the kinetochore microtubule dynamics in the mitotic spindle, is a primary cause of cell cycle de-regulation and cell death.","['Abal, M', 'Souto, A A', 'Amat-Guerri, F', 'Acuna, A U', 'Andreu, J M', 'Barasoain, I']","['Abal M', 'Souto AA', 'Amat-Guerri F', 'Acuna AU', 'Andreu JM', 'Barasoain I']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton,Cell motility and the cytoskeleton,8605339,"[""0 (7-O-(N-(4'-fluoresceincarbonyl)alanyl)taxol)"", '0 (Taxoids)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Centrosome/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubules/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Taxoids', 'U937 Cells/drug effects']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/cm.1016 [pii]', '10.1002/cm.1016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 2001 May;49(1):1-15. doi: 10.1002/cm.1016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cytologic and immunophenotypic study of 33 cases.,151-9,"INTRODUCTION: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) accounts for 10-20% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the United States. In this study, the authors reviewed the cytologic and immunophenotypic findings of 33 fine-needle aspirations (FNAs) of PTCL. METHODS: Thirty-three FNAs from 26 patients (12 females and 14 males) with PTCL were identified during 1991-1999. The patients' age ranged from 19 to 96 years. Immunophenotyping was performed in 24 cases by using either flow cytometry (FC; 21 cases) or immunocytochemistry (IC; 3 cases). Follow-up included review of prior or current histology and clinical records. RESULTS: Nine cases were associated with mycosis fungoides, three cases were classified as T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and two were angioimmunoblastic adenopathy (AILD)-like T-cell lymphoma. The remaining 19 were classified as PTCL, not otherwise specified. The latter consisted of eight mixed cell variant, eight large cell variant, and three anaplastic variant. One of the mixed cell variant and one of the large cell variants contained numerous epithelioid histiocytes (Lennert lymphoma). Thirty (91%) cases had a definitive diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Twenty-two cases (2 IC and 20 FC) showed a predominant population of T lymphocytes without a monoclonal B-cell population. In addition, FC revealed an aberrant expression of T-cell markers in 13 cases. Two cases were interpreted as ""atypical lymphoid population""; one case was an AILD-like T-cell lymphoma, and the other case was PTCL, large cell type. One case initially was interpreted as granulomatous lymphadenitis; subsequent biopsy revealed PTCL, Lennert type. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of lesions with diverse cytomorphology. Cytologic analysis and immunophenotyping is an accurate method of diagnosing peripheral T-cell lymphoma.","['Yao, J L', 'Cangiarella, J F', 'Cohen, J M', 'Chhieng, D C']","['Yao JL', 'Cangiarella JF', 'Cohen JM', 'Chhieng DC']","['Department of Pathology, New York University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.9022 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Apr 25;93(2):151-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.9022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many distinct types are known to carry predictable prognoses and warrant specific therapy. Distinction between lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, most often made by flow cytometry, is crucially important. Several advances in flow cytometry, including availability of new monoclonal antibodies, improved gating strategies, and multiparameter analytic techniques, have all dramatically improved the utility of flow cytometry in the diagnosis and classification of leukemia. Acute leukemias reflect the pattern of antigen acquisition seen in normal hematopoietic differentiation, yet invariably demonstrate distinct aberrant immunophenotypic features. Detailed understanding of these phenotypic patterns of differentiation, particularly in myeloid leukemia, allows for more precise classification of leukemia than does morphology alone. However, morphologic and differentiation-based classifications of leukemia are limited in their prognostic value; cytogenetics and molecular genetics appear to be most important for identifying entities with distinct prognoses and clinical behavior. Increasingly, many of these genetically distinct subgroups of leukemia have been found to be closely associated with distinct immunophenotypes. For example, translocations such as t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and t(1;19) and t(12;21) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have distinctive immunophenotypic profiles.

BLM, the protein defective in BS, is a RecQ-like helicase, presumed to function in DNA replication, recombination, or repair. BLM localizes to promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies and is expressed during late S and G2. We show, in normal human cells, that the recombination/repair proteins hRAD51 and replication protein (RP)-A assembled with BLM into a fraction of PML bodies during late S/G2. Biochemical experiments suggested that BLM resides in a nuclear matrix-bound complex in which association with hRAD51 may be direct. DNA-damaging agents that cause double strand breaks and a G2 delay induced BLM by a p53- and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated independent mechanism. This induction depended on the G2 delay, because it failed to occur when G2 was prevented or bypassed. It coincided with the appearance of foci containing BLM, PML, hRAD51 and RP-A, which resembled ionizing radiation-induced foci. After radiation, foci containing BLM and PML formed at sites of single-stranded DNA and presumptive repair in normal cells, but not in cells with defective PML. Our findings suggest that BLM is part of a dynamic nuclear matrix-based complex that requires PML and functions during G2 in undamaged cells and recombinational repair after DNA damage.","['Bischof, O', 'Kim, S H', 'Irving, J', 'Beresten, S', 'Ellis, N A', 'Campisi, J']","['Bischof O', 'Kim SH', 'Irving J', 'Beresten S', 'Ellis NA', 'Campisi J']","['Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720, USA..']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RPA1 protein, human)', '0 (Replication Protein A)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Bloom syndrome protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bloom Syndrome/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Rad51 Recombinase', 'RecQ Helicases', 'Replication Protein A', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'X-Rays']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.153.2.367 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2001 Apr 16;153(2):367-80. doi: 10.1083/jcb.153.2.367.,"['R01 CA085867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085867-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AG11658/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC2169463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of the FPGS gene appears controlled by both tissue/lineage-specific and proliferation-dependent mechanisms. Four alternative exon 1 splice variants of the FPGS gene have been described previously, but their significance in gene regulation has not been determined. Furthermore, alternative splicing of the human FPGS gene in normal or transformed cells in vivo has not been reported. We have examined the mRNA expression of these FPGS splice variants in primary human leukemia cells, cell lines, and normal human hematopoietic progenitors using reverse transcription-PCR. Specific primers were designed to amplify splice variants 1, 1A, 1B, and 1C; and full-length FPGS mRNA was amplified using primers for exons 14 and 15 at the 3' end of the gene. In this study, we demonstrate that all four alternative exon 1 variants are expressed in all primary leukemia cells and cell lines (ALL and AML), as well as in normal human hematopoietic progenitors. No significant differences in mRNA expression were detected in primary cells or cell lines for the four exon 1 splice variants. Normal circulating human lymphocytes (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) also expressed mRNA amplified from full-length FPGS and the four exon 1 splice variants, although no detectable FPGS activity was found. Using Western immunoblotting, we show that FPGS protein is expressed in these peripheral blood mononuclear cells; thus, we propose that posttranslational modification(s) is required for expression of a functional FPGS protein in human lymphohematopoietic cells. In addition, poly(A)(+) RNA from normal human adult and fetal tissues and leukemia cell lines was analyzed by Northern blot methodology. Total FPGS mRNA expression showed tissue-specificity, and higher levels were observed in human fetal tissues compared with adult tissues. The data presented herein demonstrate the existence of these FPGS mRNA splice variants in normal and transformed human hematopoietic cells and indicate that alternative splicing of the 5' end of the human FPGS gene does occur in primary cells in vivo. However, its role in regulating the expression of its mRNA remains to be determined.","['Leclerc, G J', 'Barredo, J C']","['Leclerc GJ', 'Barredo JC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line', 'Exons', 'Fetus/enzymology', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Peptide Synthases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Apr;7(4):942-51.,['CA72734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VEGFR-2 plays a role in de novo blood vessel formation and hematopoietic cell development. Recently, we found that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of VEGF. Therefore, we sought to investigate the role of VEGFR-2 in CLL. Using Western blot analysis, we first determined that VEGFR-2 is present in peripheral blood CLL cells. We then quantified the cellular levels of VEGFR-2 protein using a solid-phase radioimmunoanalysis in peripheral blood cells from 216 patients with CLL. As control, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) from 31 hematologically normal individuals. The median of VEGFR-2 levels detected in the control samples was assigned a value of 1.0, and VEGFR-2 protein levels were normalized to the control median value. The median level of VEGFR-2 in CLL cells was 1.57. Patients with VEGFR-2 levels higher than 1.57 had elevated lymphocyte counts, severe anemia, elevated beta(2)-microglobulin and advanced-stage disease. Elevated VEGFR-2 levels were also associated with statistically significantly shorter survival (35.4 versus 60.1 months; P < 0.01). Our data indicate that cellular VEGFR-2 levels may serve as a prognostic factor in CLL. Further studies should investigate the biological implications of these findings and the effect of the interaction between VEGF and VEGFR-2 on CLL cell proliferation.","['Ferrajoli, A', 'Manshouri, T', 'Estrov, Z', 'Keating, M J', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Lerner, S', 'Beran, M', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Freireich, E J', 'Albitar, M']","['Ferrajoli A', 'Manshouri T', 'Estrov Z', 'Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Lerner S', 'Beran M', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Freireich EJ', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

In the present study, the pharmacological and functional properties of PEA and AEA uptake have been investigated in mouse Neuro-2a neuroblastoma and, for comparison, in rat RBL-2H3 basophilic leukaemia cells. Saturable uptake of PEA and AEA into both cell lines were demonstrated with apparent K(M) values of 28 microM (PEA) and 10 microM (AEA) in Neuro-2a cells, and 30 microM (PEA) and 9.3 microM (AEA) in RBL-2H3 cells. Both PEA and AEA uptake showed temperature-dependence but only the AEA uptake was sensitive to treatment with Pronase and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The AEA uptake was inhibited by AM404, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), R1- and S1-methanandamide, arachidonic acid and olvanil with similar potencies for the two cell types. PEA, up to a concentration of 100 microM, did not affect AEA uptake in either cell line. AEA, 2-AG, arachidonic acid, R1-methanandamide, (9)-THC, and cannabidiol inhibited PEA transport in both cell lines. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin inhibited the AEA uptake but had very weak effects on the uptake of PEA. From these data, it can be concluded that PEA is transported in to cells both by passive diffusion and by a facilitated transport that is pharmacologically distinguishable from AEA uptake.","['Jacobsson, S O', 'Fowler, C J']","['Jacobsson SO', 'Fowler CJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, SE-901 87 Umea, Sweden. stig.jacobsson@pharm.umu.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Ethanolamines)', '0 (Palmitic Acids)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '57KD15003I (Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride)', '6R8T1UDM3V (palmidrol)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Pronase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Amides', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cannabinoids/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'Ethanolamines', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/*metabolism', 'Palmitic Acids/*metabolism', 'Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride/pharmacology', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Pronase/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/20 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/04/20 10:00'],"['2001/04/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0704029 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2001 Apr;132(8):1743-54. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0704029.,,,,,,,PMC1572744,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) analysis using cells in interphase is performed, for example, to monitor the effect of interferon on chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. The weak point of this method is that approximately 2% of false-positive cells are inevitable.

Polymerase chain reaction(PCR) method using genomic DNA is performed for limited types of diseases such as lymphoma with bcl-2/IgH fusion gene. Reverse transcription(RT)-PCR method can detect fusion gene transcripts with high sensitivity. This method is useful for detecting minimal residual diseases after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. To perform quantitative analysis, real-time PCR or competitive PCR must be done.

Nothing matches, however, the international significance of the success of Lance Armstrong in winning the Tour de France for the second time. It brings home the message of how complete the cure of this disease is and the need for more to be done to educate people about this success and encourage us to seek to discover the scientific basis for why this cancer is so different from all other cancers. The discovery that Lance Armstrong's brain metastases were totally necrotic at day 21 after the first treatment, taken with a report on the use of day 21 computed tomograph response to predict outcome, reinforces that message. With a second report suggesting that there are regions of the world that may have escaped the environmental damage to fertility that is now increasingly accepted as the most significant risk factor for development of this disease, we also need to remember the importance of germ cells as a weather vane of the environment. The first breakthrough in identifying a specific genetic region on the X chromosome with susceptibility to germ cell cancer of the testis by its association with development of undescended testis was one of the scientific landmarks of this past year. Clinically, with such high cure rates after salvage treatments, most of the controversy focuses now on early management of this disease. Debate continues regarding the need for orchidectomy or node dissection before chemotherapy in patients with metastases. There is also considerable debate concerning the need for any adjuvant treatment in stage 1 disease, whether surgical, chemotherapeutic, or radiotherapeutic. With reviews on late events highlighting the possibility that cisplatin dosage may be critical in synergizing with etoposide in causing leukemia and late cardiovascular events and reports suggesting that circulating cisplatin can be detected in the plasma as long as 20 years after treatment, the message of the year is clearly how to safely minimize the amount of treatment.","['Oliver, R T']",['Oliver RT'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, St Barts & Royal London School of Medicine, London, UK. e.m.davies@mds.qmw.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Humans', 'Male', '*Testicular Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/therapy']",2001/04/18 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/04/18 10:00'],"['2001/04/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-200105000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2001 May;13(3):191-8. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200105000-00011.,,,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NCPE is a clinical syndrome characterized by simultaneous presence of severe hypoxemia, bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest radiograph, and no evidence of left atrial hypertension/congestive heart failure. The diagnosis of drug-related NCPE relies upon documented exclusion of any infectious, metabolic, or cancer-related causes. The time proximity to therapy with drugs that are known to precipitate NCPE, any preceding episodes of flu-like symptoms during previous chemotherapy courses and possible response to corticosteroids may further support such a diagnosis. Cancer therapeutic agents clearly associated with NCPE are cytarabine, gemcitabine, and interleukin-2, as well as all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, while a few other compounds have rarely or occasionally been implicated. The pathophysiology of lung injury in drug-induced NCPE remains unclear. There are indications suggesting that both a direct cytotoxic insult to the lung epithelial cells and induction of a cytokine-triggered inflammatory response may be involved in its pathogenesis. By distinction to drug-induced pulmonary pneumonitis that may lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis, NCPE if not fatal, can be reversed upon prompt recognition, following immediate discontinuation of the offensive drug and start of intensive supportive treatment and intravenous corticosteroids.","['Briasoulis, E', 'Pavlidis, N']","['Briasoulis E', 'Pavlidis N']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, 45110, Greece. ebriasou@otenet.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Pulmonary Edema/*chemically induced/diagnosis/therapy']",2001/04/18 10:00,2001/07/06 10:01,['2001/04/18 10:00'],"['2001/04/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.6-2-153 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2001;6(2):153-61. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.6-2-153.,,,,,,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies on human osteosarcoma cells demonstrate that CDDO induces mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Overexpression of the caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA blocked CDDO-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. By contrast, overexpression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) protein blocked CDDO-induced cytochrome c release, but only partly inhibited caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. In concert with these findings, we demonstrate that CDDO: 1) activates caspase-8 and thereby caspase-3 by a cytochrome c-independent mechanism and 2) induces cytochrome c release by caspase-8-dependent cleavage of Bid. The results also demonstrate that treatment of osteosarcoma cells with CDDO induces differentiation, as assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production, and that this response is abrogated in cells that overexpress CrmA.

The current report describes the activity of a more recently synthesized member of this class, 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-2-(methylamino)carbonylhydrazine (101M). 101M was active in mice against the i.p. implanted L1210 leukemia over a wide range of doses and produced long-term survivors when administered as a single i.p. bolus of 10, 20, 40, 60, or 80 mg/kg, demonstrating a wider margin of safety than the nitrosourea, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). Curative therapy was achieved with doses of 101M that did not produce depression of the bone marrow. 101M was also highly effective against the L1210 leukemia when administered by the oral route. The ability of 101M to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and eradicate leukemia cells in the brain was remarkable (>6 log kill). This agent was also curative against L1210 variants resistant to cyclophosphamide, BCNU, or melphalan. Mice implanted with the murine C26 colon carcinoma were also cured by two injections of 10 or 20 mg/kg of 101M. Administration of 101M by two different well-tolerated regimens caused complete regression of established human glioblastoma U251 xenografts in 100% of treated mice, and significant responses were also obtained with 101M against advanced murine M109 lung carcinomas in mice. The broad spectrum of anticancer activity of the sulfonylhydrazine prodrug 101M coupled with the wide range of therapeutic safety exhibited by this agent, makes 101M particularly attractive for further development and clinical evaluation.","['Finch, R A', 'Shyam, K', 'Penketh, P G', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Finch RA', 'Shyam K', 'Penketh PG', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl),1-(2-chloroethyl)-2-(methylamino)carbonylhydrazine)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Nitroso Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '64057-51-8 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosoacetamide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carmustine/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nitroso Compounds/pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2001/04/18 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/18 10:00'],"['2001/04/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Apr 1;61(7):3033-8.,['CA-74970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predicted protein sequence of CLLD6 revealed no homology with known proteins. However, both CLLD7 and CLLD8 predicted proteins contain known functional domains. CLLD7 has both an RCC1 and a BTB domain, and could thus be involved in cell cycle regulation by chromatin remodeling. CLLD8 contains a methyl-CpG binding, a preSET and a SET domain, suggesting that CLLD8 might be associated with methylation-mediated transcriptional repression. Mutation analysis of hematopoietic tumor cell lines and B-CLL tumor samples revealed no point mutations within the coding region of these three novel genes.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 13,488 patients who received cosmetic breast implants at 18 plastic surgery practices in six geographic areas was conducted to assess long-term health effects. After an average of 12 years of follow-up, questionnaires were administered to subjects located and alive (78% of eligible population). Attempts were made to obtain death certificates for deceased subjects and medical verification for all reported cancers. Expected numbers of cancers were derived using general population cancer incidence rates and an internal comparison series of 3936 patients who received other types of plastic surgery at the same practices as the implant patients. RESULTS: A total of 359 malignancies was observed versus 295.95 expected based on general population rates, resulting in a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.4]. Individual malignancies for which incidence was significantly elevated included cancers of the stomach (SIR = 2.65), cervix (SIR = 3.18), vulva (SIR = 2.51), brain (SIR = 2.16), and leukemia (SIR = 2.19). No excess risks were observed for other hematopoietic malignancies, including multiple myeloma. The internal analyses, however, based on cancer rates derived among the comparison patients, showed no increased cancer risk among the implant patients [relative risk (RR) = 1.00, 95% CI 0.8-1.2], as well as no statistically significant elevations for most individual sites. Cervical cancer continued to be elevated (RR = 1.78), although to a lesser extent than in the external analyses, while the risk for respiratory cancers was higher (RR = 2.40). Non-significant elevations in risk persisted in this analysis for liver cancer (RR = 2.65), brain cancer (RR = 2.83), and leukemia (RR = 1.83). Many of the cancers showing excesses were defined on the basis of death certificates, requiring caution in interpretation. The histologies of the leukemias were quite varied, which makes a biologic relationship appear unlikely. However, respiratory cancers showed some evidence of increasing risk with follow-up time and both respiratory and brain cancers were elevated in the mortality analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Although excesses of cervical and vulvar cancer among implant patients might be attributable to lifestyle factors, reasons for excesses of respiratory and brain cancers were less apparent.","['Brinton, L A', 'Lubin, J H', 'Burich, M C', 'Colton, T', 'Brown, S L', 'Hoover, R N']","['Brinton LA', 'Lubin JH', 'Burich MC', 'Colton T', 'Brown SL', 'Hoover RN']","['Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-7234, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', '*Breast Implantation', 'Breast Implants/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Life Style', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology', 'Respiratory Tract Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Vulvar Neoplasms/epidemiology']",2001/04/18 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/04/18 10:00'],"['2001/04/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1047-2797(00)00223-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1047-2797(00)00223-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2001 May;11(4):248-56. doi: 10.1016/s1047-2797(00)00223-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigations with the functional efficacy of such compartments revealed significant improvement of cytotoxic efficacy and phagocytic burst at the high density compartment (HDC) level. The high density compartment was found to be more responsive towards the BRMs compared to the cells of the low density compartment (LDC).

The group with AN showed marked hypoperfusion of temporal, parietal, occipital, and orbitofrontal lobes compared to the contrast group. rCBF was not correlated to body mass index in any of the groups. Results suggest that, even long after re-feeding has occurred, AN may be associated with moderate to severe cerebral blood flow hypoperfusion in the temporoparietal (or temporoparietooccipital) region and in the orbitofrontal region.

However, this may need to be confirmed by a histopathological investigation, which includes immunohistochemical stains. In contrast to generalized histiocytoses, the prognosis of juvenile xanthogranuloma is excellent: the cutaneous tumour disappears spontaneously in one to six years.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with CLL (n = 40) or other mature B-cell lymphoid leukemias (n = 10) were treated with four weekly infusions of rituximab. The first dose was 375 mg/m(2) for all patients; dose- escalation began with dose 2 but was held constant for each patient. Escalated doses were from 500 to 2,250 mg/m(2). RESULTS: Toxicity with the first dose (375 mg/m(2)) was noted in 94% of patients but was grade 1 or 2 in most, predominantly fever and chills. Six patients (12%) experienced severe toxicity with the first dose, including fever, chills, dyspnea, and hypoxia in all six patients, hypotension in five, and hypertension in one. Toxicity on subsequent doses was minimal until a dose of 2,250 mg/m(2) was achieved. Eight (67%) of 12 patients had grade 2 toxicity, including fever, chills, nausea, and malaise, although no patient had grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Severe toxicity with the first dose was significantly more common in patients with other B-cell leukemias, occurring in five (50%) of 10 patients versus one (2%) of 40 patients with CLL (P <.001). The overall response rate was 40%; all responses in patients with CLL were partial remissions. Response rates were 36% in CLL and 60% in other B-cell lymphoid leukemias. Response was correlated with dose: 22% for patients treated at 500 to 825 mg/m(2), 43% for those treated at 1,000 to 1,500 mg/m(2), and 75% for those treated at the highest dose of 2,250 mg/m(2) (P =.007). The median time to disease progression was 8 months. Myelosuppression and infections were uncommon. CONCLUSION: Rituximab has significant activity in patients with CLL at the higher dose levels. Severe first-dose reactions were uncommon in patients with CLL, even with high circulating lymphocyte counts, but were frequent in patients with other mature B-cell leukemias in which CD20 surface expression is increased. Efficacy of rituximab was also significant in this group of patients.","[""O'Brien, S M"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Thomas, D A', 'Giles, F J', 'Freireich, E J', 'Cortes, J', 'Lerner, S', 'Keating, M J']","[""O'Brien SM"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Thomas DA', 'Giles FJ', 'Freireich EJ', 'Cortes J', 'Lerner S', 'Keating MJ']","['Leukemia Department, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Chills/chemically induced', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Dyspnea/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/chemically induced', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2165 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Apr 15;19(8):2165-70. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study sought to decrease the initial toxicity and optimize the pharmacokinetics with an alternative treatment schedule. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty three patients with SLL/CLL received dose 1 of rituximab (100 mg) over 4 hours. In cohort I (n = 3; 250 mg/m(2)) and cohort II (n = 7; 375 mg/m(2)) rituximab was administered on day 3 and thereafter three times weekly for 4 weeks using a standard administration schedule. Cohort III (n = 23; 375 mg/m(2)) administered rituximab similar to cohort II for the first two treatments and then over 1 hour thereafter. RESULTS: A total of 33 CLL/SLL patients were enrolled; only one patient discontinued therapy because of infusion-related toxicity. Thirteen patients developed transient hypoxemia, hypotension, or dyspnea that were associated with significant changes in baseline interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma compared with those not experiencing such reactions. Infusion-related toxicity occurred more commonly in older (median age 73 v 62 years; P =.02) patients with no other pretreatment clinical or laboratory features predicting occurrence of these events. The overall response rate was 45% (3% CR, 42% PR; 95% CI 28% to 64%). Median response duration for these 15 patients was 10 months (95% CI, 6.8-13.2; range, 3 to 17+). CONCLUSION: Rituximab administered thrice weekly for 4 weeks demonstrates clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity. Initial infusion-related events seem to be cytokine mediated and resolve by the third infusion making rapid administration possible. Future combination studies of rituximab with other therapies in CLL seem warranted.","['Byrd, J C', 'Murphy, T', 'Howard, R S', 'Lucas, M S', 'Goodrich, A', 'Park, K', 'Pearson, M', 'Waselenko, J K', 'Ling, G', 'Grever, M R', 'Grillo-Lopez, A J', 'Rosenberg, J', 'Kunkel, L', 'Flinn, I W']","['Byrd JC', 'Murphy T', 'Howard RS', 'Lucas MS', 'Goodrich A', 'Park K', 'Pearson M', 'Waselenko JK', 'Ling G', 'Grever MR', 'Grillo-Lopez AJ', 'Rosenberg J', 'Kunkel L', 'Flinn IW']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine and the Department of Clinical Investigation, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA. byrd-2@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Dyspnea/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypotension/chemically induced', 'Hypoxia/chemically induced', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2153 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Apr 15;19(8):2153-64. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2153.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular pharmacokinetics was investigated to seek a relationship between response and accumulation of ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP) in circulating leukemia cells and to evaluate biochemical modulation of cellular ara-GTP metabolism by fludarabine triphosphate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine of the 13 total patients had indolent leukemias, including six whose disease failed prior fludarabine therapy. Two patients had T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, one had chronic myelogenous leukemia, and one had mycosis fungoides. Nelarabine (1.2 g/m(2)) was infused on days 1, 3, and 5. On days 3 and 5, fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)) was administered 4 hours before the nelarabine infusion. Plasma and cellular pharmacokinetic measurements were conducted during the first 5 days. RESULTS: Seven patients had a partial or complete response, six of whom had indolent leukemias. The disease in four responders had failed prior fludarabine therapy. The median peak intracellular concentrations of ara-GTP were significantly different (P =.001) in responders (890 micromol/L, n = 6) and nonresponders (30 micromol/L, n = 6). Also, there was a direct relationship between the peak fludarabine triphosphate and ara-GTP in each patient (r = 0.85). The cellular elimination of ara-GTP was slow (median, 35 hours; range, 18 to > 48 hours). The ratio of ara-GTP to its normal counterpart, deoxyguanosine triphosphate, was higher in each patient (median, 42; range, 14 to 1,092) than that of fludarabine triphosphate to its normal counterpart, deoxyadenosine triphosphate (median, 2.2; range, 0.2 to 27). CONCLUSION: Fludarabine plus nelarabine is an effective, well-tolerated regimen against leukemias. Clinical responses suggest the need for further exploration of nelarabine against fludarabine-refractory diseases. Determination of ara-GTP levels in the target tumor population may provide a prognostic test for the activity of nelarabine.","['Gandhi, V', 'Plunkett, W', 'Weller, S', 'Du, M', 'Ayres, M', 'Rodriguez, C O Jr', 'Ramakrishna, P', 'Rosner, G L', 'Hodge, J P', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Keating, M J']","['Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Weller S', 'Du M', 'Ayres M', 'Rodriguez CO Jr', 'Ramakrishna P', 'Rosner GL', 'Hodge JP', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating MJ']","['Departments of Experimental Therapeutics, Biostatistics, and Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. vgandhi@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)', ""72490-81-4 (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanosine 5'-triphosphate)"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleotides/analysis/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Female', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2142 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Apr 15;19(8):2142-52. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2142.,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: At transplantation, 56 patients had treatment-related secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 15 had refractory anemia with excess blasts in transition (RAEB-T), 23 had refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 15 had refractory anemia (RA), and two had refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). Conditioning regimens were total-body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy for 60 patients, busulfan (BU) 14 to 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg (BUCY) for 27 patients, BU targeted to 600 to 900 ng/mL plasma steady-state concentration with 120 mg/kg CY (BUCY-t) for 22 patients, and miscellaneous chemotherapy for two patients. The donors were HLA-identical or partially identical family members for 69 patients and unrelated donors for 42 patients. RESULTS: The 5-year disease-free survival was 8% for TBI, 19% for BUCY, and 30% for BUCY-t (P =.006). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 40% for secondary AML, 40% for RAEB-T, 26% for RAEB, and 0% for RA or RARS (P =.0009). The 5-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality after TBI was 58%; after BUCY, 52%; and after BUCY-t, 42% (P =.02). CONCLUSION: Patients at risk for treatment-related leukemia or myelodysplasia should be followed closely and be considered for stem-cell transplantation early in the course of myelodysplasia using conditioning regimens such as BUCY-t designed to reduce nonrelapse mortality.","['Witherspoon, R P', 'Deeg, H J', 'Storer, B', 'Anasetti, C', 'Storb, R', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Witherspoon RP', 'Deeg HJ', 'Storer B', 'Anasetti C', 'Storb R', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Clinical Research Division of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. rwithers@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*therapy', 'Mortality', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2134 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Apr 15;19(8):2134-41. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2134.,"['AI33484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP51027/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon treatment of U937 cells with 50 microM of As2O3, complete inactivation of the kinases ERK1 and ERK2 was detected within 30 min. p38 was activated within 3 hr, and the maximum activity was detected at 6 hr, when DNA fragmentation remained undetectable. Experiments with transfected cells that expressed constitutively activated MEK1 and a specific inhibitor of p38 also suggested that inactivation of ERKs and activation of p38 might be associated with the induction of apoptosis by As2O3. In contrast to the inactivation of ERKs and the activation of p38, activation of JNK by As2O3 appeared to protect cells against the induction of apoptosis. Treatment of U937 cells with As2O3 also caused the Ca2+-dependent production of superoxide and intracellular acidification and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential at the early stages of induction of apoptosis by As2O3. These changes preceded the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-3. It should be possible to exploit the unusual characteristics of the mechanism of induction of apoptosis by As2O3 in U937 cells by making use of synergistic effects of this compound with other inducers of apoptosis.","['Iwama, K', 'Nakajo, S', 'Aiuchi, T', 'Nakaya, K']","['Iwama K', 'Nakajo S', 'Aiuchi T', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', '*MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ijc.1220 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1220 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 May 15;92(4):518-26. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1220.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unique probes (plasmids, PAC), specific for centromeric or subtelomeric chromosomal regions, can replace the painting probes in M-FISH to address specific issues, such as the identification of marker chromosomes and aneuploidies. A set of plasmid probes carrying repetitive sequences specific for the alpha-satellite region of all human chromosomes were combined in a metaphase assay and an interphase assay, allowing identification of aneuploidies in one hybridization step, on a single cytogenetic slide. The fluorophore-dUTP and the labeled antibodies required to label and detect the DNA probes can be prepared in any laboratory.

Recent studies have also suggested that VEGF can promote macrophage migration, which is critical for atherosclerosis. We have reported that VEGF is remarkably expressed in activated macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells within human coronary atherosclerotic lesions, and we have proposed the significance of VEGF in the progression of atherosclerosis. To clarify the mechanism of VEGF expression in atherosclerotic lesions, we examined the regulation of VEGF expression by oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL), which is abundant in atherosclerotic arterial walls. A recent report has revealed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is expressed not only in adipocytes but also in monocytes/macrophages and has suggested that PPARgamma may have a role in the differentiation of monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, 9- and 13-hydroxy-(S)-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (9- and 13-HODE, respectively), the components of Ox-LDL, may be PPARgamma ligands. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of PPARgamma in the regulation of VEGF by Ox-LDL. PPARgamma expression was detected in human monocyte/macrophage cell lines, human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells, and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). Ox-LDL (10 to 50 microg/mL) upregulated VEGF secretion from THP-1 dose-dependently. VEGF mRNA expression in HCAECs was also upregulated by Ox-LDL. The mRNA expression of VEGF in THP-1 cells and HCAECs was also augmented by PPARgamma activators, troglitazone (TRO), and 15-deoxy-(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ2). In contrast, VEGF expression in another monocyte/macrophage cell line, human histiocytic lymphoma cells (U937), which lacks PPARgamma expression, was not augmented by TRO or PGJ2. We established the U937 cell line, which permanently expresses PPARgamma (U937T). TRO and Ox-LDL augmented VEGF expression in U937T. In addition, VEGF production by THP-1 cells was significantly increased by exposure to 9-HODE and 13-HODE. In conclusion, Ox-LDL upregulates VEGF expression in macrophages and endothelial cells, at least in part, through the activation of PPARgamma.","['Inoue, M', 'Itoh, H', 'Tanaka, T', 'Chun, T H', 'Doi, K', 'Fukunaga, Y', 'Sawada, N', 'Yamshita, J', 'Masatsugu, K', 'Saito, T', 'Sakaguchi, S', 'Sone, M', 'Yamahara Ki', 'Yurugi, T', 'Nakao, K']","['Inoue M', 'Itoh H', 'Tanaka T', 'Chun TH', 'Doi K', 'Fukunaga Y', 'Sawada N', 'Yamshita J', 'Masatsugu K', 'Saito T', 'Sakaguchi S', 'Sone M', 'Yamahara Ki', 'Yurugi T', 'Nakao K']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)']",IM,"['Arteriosclerosis/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism/physiology', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.atv.21.4.560 [doi]'],ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2001 Apr;21(4):560-6. doi: 10.1161/01.atv.21.4.560.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparison of the excess relative risk coefficients derived from published information for each study with the excess relative risk coefficient in comparable (age at exposure, time since exposure, sex) matched subsets of the Japanese A-bomb survivor cancer incidence and mortality data. RESULTS: Sixty-five studies of persons who have received appreciable doses of ionizing radiation in the course of treatment and for whom there is adequate ascertainment of cancer incidence or mortality are identified, from which 116 cancer-site-specific estimates of excess relative risk are derived. Relative risks tend to be lower in the medical series than in the Japanese A-bomb survivors. The most marked discrepancies between the relative risks in the medical series and in the A-bomb survivors are for leukaemia, where 12 of the 17 medical studies have significantly lower relative risks than those observed in the Japanese data. However, the ratio between the relative risks in the medical studies and in the Japanese data tends to diminish with increasing average or maximal therapy dose. This is observed for all cancer sites and is particularly marked for leukaemia. After taking account of cell sterilization and dose fractionation the apparent differences between the relative risks for leukaemia in the Japanese A-bomb survivors and in the medical series largely disappear. This suggests that cell sterilization largely accounts for the discrepancy between the relative risks in the Japanese data and the medical studies. Other factors, such as the differences in underlying cancer risks between the Japanese A-bomb survivors and the medical series, and dose-fractionation effects, may also contribute. CONCLUSIONS: The relative risks of cancer in studies of persons exposed to appreciable doses of ionizing radiation in the course of treatment for a variety of malignant and non-malignant conditions are generally less than those in comparable subsets of the Japanese A-bomb survivor cancer incidence and mortality data. Cell sterilization effects can largely explain the discrepancy between the Japanese and the medical series.","['Little, M P']",['Little MP'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College School of Medicine, Norfolk Place, London, UK. mark.little@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000010022634 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2001 Apr;77(4):431-64. doi: 10.1080/09553000010022634.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Int J Radiat Biol 2001 Jun;77(6):745-60'],,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exchange aberrations were detected in the first mitosis after irradiation of human lymphocytes with 3 and 5 Gy gamma-rays of 60Co. Two-colour repeated FISH with two differently chemically modified probes in each hybridization was applied. The microscope stage positions of each mitosis were recorded after the first hybridization and used for the automatic scanning of images after all successive experiments. Five images were obtained for each mitosis differing in visualized pairs of chromosomes. Comparing these images, exchanges among 10 chromosomes could be detected. Painting of the p arm of chromosome 21 with the painting probe for chromosome 22 also made it possible to detect exchanges of this chromosome with other chromosomes of the selected group. RESULTS: Frequencies of exchange aberrations induced in chromosomes of the selected group as well as interchanges between many pairs of chromosomes of this group were roughly proportional to the DNA content of chromosomes. Higher frequencies of interchanges than expected according to the model of linear proportionality were found between several chromosomes involved in translocations frequent in different subtypes of leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Frequencies of interchanges among 11 chromosomes of human lymphocytes induced by gamma-rays do not indicate as clearly as fast neutrons the non-random arrangement of chromosomes in the cell nucleus. The interaction of a large number of chromosomes in exchange aberrations suggests that the chromatin in the territory of one chromosome is accessible for several other chromosomes.","['Cafourkova, A', 'Luka ova, E', 'Kozubek, S', 'Kozubek, M', 'Govorun, R D', 'Koutna, I', 'Bartova, E', 'Skalnikova, M', 'Jirsova, P', 'Pasekova, R', 'Krasavin, E A']","['Cafourkova A', 'Luka ova E', 'Kozubek S', 'Kozubek M', 'Govorun RD', 'Koutna I', 'Bartova E', 'Skalnikova M', 'Jirsova P', 'Pasekova R', 'Krasavin EA']","['Institute of Biophysics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA/analysis', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*radiation effects/ultrastructure']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000010029141 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2001 Apr;77(4):419-29. doi: 10.1080/09553000010029141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long duration of therapy and high activities of radioiodine are often necessary to induce remission of metastatic disease. The curative potential of radioiodine therapy, in particular in younger patients, has not yet been determined. In this retrospective study we evaluated the therapeutic outcome, total radioiodine activities and associated side-effects in 107 patients with initial bone metastases. Eight of the 107 patients were younger than 45 (37.5+/-7.3) years, and were classified as group 1 (stage II, ""low risk"", WHO classification). The remaining 99 patients were older than 45 (64.1+/-9.5) years, and formed group 2 (stage IV, ""high risk"", WHO classification). Total or partial remission was more frequently achieved in group 1 than in group 2 (62.5% vs 49.5%). Lower activities were needed in group 1 (18.89+/-15.08 GBq vs 41.97+/-31.25 GBq), and there were less marked alterations in the blood count in this group. In group 1, blood count alterations reached only grade I or II (WHO classification), whereas grade III and grade IV alterations as well as acute leukaemia were observed in group 2. In group 1, complete remission was achieved with radioiodine therapy (11.1 GBq) in three out of four patients with < or =3 bone metastases. Additional pulmonary metastases (present in 44 out of 107 patients) did not influence prognosis. We conclude that initial bone metastases in differentiated thyroid carcinoma can be treated with curative intent by means of radioiodine therapy, and that this approach has a particularly realistic chance of success in younger patients and those with a small number of metastases.","['Petrich, T', 'Widjaja, A', 'Musholt, T J', 'Hofmann, M', 'Brunkhorst, T', 'Ehrenheim, C', 'Oetting, G', 'Knapp, W H']","['Petrich T', 'Widjaja A', 'Musholt TJ', 'Hofmann M', 'Brunkhorst T', 'Ehrenheim C', 'Oetting G', 'Knapp WH']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hannover University Medical School, Germany.

Fears about transformation of these disorders into acute myeloblastic leukemia probably relate to the underlying natural history of these disorders rather than to their treatment.","['Smith, M A', 'Smith, J G']","['Smith MA', 'Smith JG']","['Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases/blood/drug therapy/etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200105000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2001 May;8(3):165-9. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200105000-00007.,,,,,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Subjects of the study (n=2480) were men aged 40-75 at death during 1960-89 in the parishes surrounding four sulfate mills. Exposure assessment was based on information from the personnel files in the mills- 35% of the subjects were recognised there, and work categories were created. RESULTS: Among all sulfate mill workers, the odds ratio (OR) (90% confidence interval (90% CI)) for death from lung cancer was 1.6 (1.1 to 2.3), pleural mesotheliomas 9.5 (1.9 to 48), brain tumours 2.6 (1.2 to 5.3), and liver or biliary tract cancer 2.3 (1.0 to 5.2). There was an increased mortality from leukaemia among workers in the soda recovery plant (5.9 (2.6 to 13)) and bleaching plant and digester house (2.8 (1.0 to 7.5)). CONCLUSIONS: Sulfate mill workers were at increased risk of dying from lung cancer and pleural mesotheliomas, probably due to exposure to asbestos. Increased risks of brain tumours and cancers of the liver or biliary tract were also found but the aetiology is not obvious.","['Andersson, E', 'Hagberg, S', 'Nilsson, T', 'Persson, B', 'Wingren, G', 'Toren, K']","['Andersson E', 'Hagberg S', 'Nilsson T', 'Persson B', 'Wingren G', 'Toren K']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, St Sigfridsgatan 85B, S-412 66 Goteborg, Sweden. eva.andersson@ymk.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['0 (Sulfates)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Sulfates/*adverse effects', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.58.5.321 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2001 May;58(5):321-4. doi: 10.1136/oem.58.5.321.,,,,,,,PMC1740130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The mortality experienced by a cohort of 83 997 employees of the former Central Electricity Generating Board of England and Wales was investigated for the period 1973-97. All employees were employed for at least 6 months with some employment in the period 1973-82. Computerised work histories were available for 79 972 study subjects for the period 1971-93. Detailed calculations were performed by others to enable a novel assessment to be made of exposures to magnetic fields. Two analytical approaches were used, indirect standardisation (n=83 997) and Poisson regression (n=79 972). RESULTS: Based on serial mortalities for England and Wales, the standardised mortality ratio of 84 for all leukaemias (observed 111, expected 132.3) was similar to that of 83 for all causes (observed 14 845, expected 17 918). No significant positive trends were found for the risks of various types of leukaemia (chronic lymphatic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, all leukaemia) either with lifetime cumulative exposure to magnetic fields or with such exposures received in the most recent 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: There are no discernible excess risks of leukaemia as a consequence of occupational exposure to magnetic fields in United Kingdom electricity generation and transmission workers.","['Harrington, J M', 'Nichols, L', 'Sorahan, T', 'van Tongeren, M']","['Harrington JM', 'Nichols L', 'Sorahan T', 'van Tongeren M']","['Institute of Occupational Health, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Poisson Distribution', '*Power Plants', 'Software', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.58.5.307 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2001 May;58(5):307-14. doi: 10.1136/oem.58.5.307.,,,,,,,PMC1740133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, Trolox, suppressed apoptosis in Jurkat cells induced by NO donor glycerol trinitrate. Here we demonstrate that this antiapoptotic effect of Trolox occurred despite massive release of the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c into the cytosol and mitochondrial damage. Incubation with Trolox caused a profound reduction of intracellular ATP concentration in Jurkat cells treated by NO. Trolox prevented cardiolipin degradation and caused its accumulation in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, Trolox markedly downregulated the NO-mediated activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Caspase-9 is known to be activated by released cytochrome c and together with caspase-3 is considered the most proximal to mitochondria. Our results suggest that the targets of the antiapoptotic effect of Trolox are located downstream of the mitochondria and that caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis could be blocked even in the presence of cytochrome c released from the mitochondria.","['Umansky, V', 'Ratter, F', 'Lampel, S', 'Bucur, M', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Ushmorov, A']","['Umansky V', 'Ratter F', 'Lampel S', 'Bucur M', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Ushmorov A']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, German Cancer Research Center, D-69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

On the other hand, Zincphyrin apparently reduced tumor growth after intraperitoneal injection at doses of 12.5-50 mg/kg with light irradiation of 75.48 mW x min/cm2 for 10 min in sarcoma-180-bearing mice. Although no mice treated with Zincphyrin died, Hp did cause the death of mice. In B-16 melanoma-bearing mice, both Zincphyrin and Hp had a similar phototherapic effect. Further improvement of the phototherapic effect was observed with the continuous administration of Zincphyrin at 12.5 mg/kg per day for 3 days. The concentration of Zincphyrin in the serum reached a maximum level of 16 microg/ml within 20 min, and the concentration remained at 4.2 microg/ml at 1 hour after the onset of treatment, indicating its rapid action in the body. No animals died after the intraperitoneal administration of Zincphyrin at 100 mg/kg plus exposure to light of 10 mW x min/cm2 for 2 hours, and the body weight of the mice did not decrease. In contrast, all animals receiving 100 mg/kg of Hp under the same conditions died. These results indicate that Zincphyrin would be a useful photosensitizer with low phototoxicity.","['Toriya, M', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Saeki, K', 'Fujii, Y', 'Matsumoto, K']","['Toriya M', 'Yamamoto M', 'Saeki K', 'Fujii Y', 'Matsumoto K']","['Institute for Life Science Research, Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Tagata-gun, Shizuoka, Japan. toriya.mb@om.asahi-kasei.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",9205717,"['0 (Coproporphyrins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '14643-66-4 (coproporphyrin III)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coproporphyrins/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Sarcoma 180/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/17 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/04/17 10:00'],"['2001/04/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1271/bbb.65.363 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2001 Feb;65(2):363-70. doi: 10.1271/bbb.65.363.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission of acute promyelocytic leukemia can be obtained by treating patients with all-trans retinoic acid, and PML-RARalpha plays a major role in mediating retinoic acid effects in leukemia cells. A main model proposed for acute promyelocytic leukemia is that PML-RARalpha exerts its oncogenic effects by repressing the expression of retinoic acid-inducible genes critical to myeloid differentiation. By applying subtraction cloning to acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, we identified a retinoic acid-induced gene, PRAM-1 (PML-RARalpha target gene encoding an Adaptor Molecule-1), which encodes a novel adaptor protein sharing structural homologies with the SLAP-130/fyb adaptor. PRAM-1 is expressed and regulated during normal human myelopoiesis. In U937 myeloid precursor cells, PRAM-1 expression is inhibited by expression of PML-RARalpha in the absence of ligand and de novo superinduced by retinoic acid. PRAM-1 associates with other adaptors, SLP-76 and SKAP-55HOM, in myeloid cell lines and with protein tyrosine kinase lyn. By providing the first evidence that PML-RARalpha dysregulates expression of an adaptor protein, our data open new insights into signaling events that are disrupted during transformation by PML-RARalpha and induced by retinoic acid during de novo differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.","['Moog-Lutz, C', 'Peterson, E J', 'Lutz, P G', 'Eliason, S', 'Cave-Riant, F', 'Singer, A', 'Di Gioia, Y', 'Dmowski, S', 'Kamens, J', 'Cayre, Y E', 'Koretzky, G']","['Moog-Lutz C', 'Peterson EJ', 'Lutz PG', 'Eliason S', 'Cave-Riant F', 'Singer A', 'Di Gioia Y', 'Dmowski S', 'Kamens J', 'Cayre YE', 'Koretzky G']","['Unite INSERM 417, Hopital Saint-Antoine, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75012 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PRAM1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M011683200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)78516-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jun 22;276(25):22375-81. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M011683200.

Genes encoding these proteins are mutated or deleted in many types of cancer. For example, 20%-30% of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) have deletions in the CKI known as INK4a. The contribution of INK4a deletions to the progression of B-lineage ALL is uncertain, partially due to a paucity of data on expression in normal B-cell precursors. We therefore conducted a comparative analysis of normal and leukemic human B-cell development for the expression of cyclins, CDK, and CKI. Specific stages of human B-cell development from normal bone marrow were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The sorted populations and B-lineage ALL cell lines (BLIN-1, 2, 3, 4) were examined for expression of cyclins, CDK, and CKI by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting.RT-PCR analysis showed that cyclin D2, cyclin D3, CDK4, and CDK6 were ubiquitously expressed in normal B-cell development and in the BLIN ALL cell lines. The p19(INK4d) CKI was the most commonly expressed member of the INK4 family, whereas p16(INK4a) was more weakly and variably expressed. Expression of the p57(KIP2) CKI varied as a function of the stage of B-cell development. Analysis of normal B-cell precursors by Western blotting indicated that CDK4, CDK6, p19(INK4d), and p57(KIP2) were expressed, whereas p16(INK4a) was not detected. Cyclin D/CDK expression in normal and leukemic human B-cell precursors is similar to expression of these proteins in human and murine mature B cells. In contrast, the ubiquitous expression of p19(INK4d) has not been previously described in human or murine B-lineage cells. Our results suggest that loss of INK4a may only minimally contribute to tumor cell progression in B-lineage ALL, since expression of INK4d could provide a compensatory function as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.","['Fink, J R', 'LeBien, T W']","['Fink JR', 'LeBien TW']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, 420 Delaware Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2D protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (KIP2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Motor Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian', '*Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Molecular Motor Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00619-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00619-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Apr;29(4):490-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00619-1.,"['CA31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI07313/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize T cells that mediate the GVL effect on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), we studied T-cell repertoire in peripheral blood (PB) of two patients treated with DLI for relapsed CML after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained at 2-week intervals following DLI and examined for the presence of antigen-driven T-cell proliferation using complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 size spectratyping of T-cell receptor beta chain subfamilies. Both patients exhibited transient proliferation of a limited number of T cells at a certain point in time (day 132 for patient 1 and day 75 for patient 2) after DLI in association with a decrease in the proportion of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive cells. In patient 2, who showed expansion of a BV16(+) T cell in PB, expansion of BV16(+) T cells with a similar CDR3 motif containing QDR to that of PB was demonstrated in the bone marrow (BM) sampled on day 33 and in the buccal mucosal tissue, showing chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) on day 138 after DLI. When PBMCs obtained from patient 2 in remission were cultured with cryopreserved CML cells for 2 weeks, proliferation of a BV16(+) T cell with a CDR3 motif of QIR was induced in vitro. These findings indicate that transient proliferation of a limited number of T cells detected in PB 3-5 months after DLI probably reflects the GVL response against CML cells and may serve as a marker for the appearance of the GVL effect induced by DLI.","['Kondo, Y', 'Shiobara, S', 'Nakao, S']","['Kondo Y', 'Shiobara S', 'Nakao S']","['Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan 920-8641.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', '*Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', '*Complementarity Determining Regions/analysis/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Mouth Mucosa/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00615-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00615-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Apr;29(4):471-6. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00615-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of the HS-5 human bone marrow stromal cell line on cultured primary leukemia cell survival and chemosensitivity.A total of 30 bone marrow (BM) samples from untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were cultured for 96 hours with serum and growth factors, without HS-5, or in direct contact with HS-5 monolayers, or with HS-5 separated from AML cells by transwell inserts. In some experiments, cytosine arabinoside or daunomycin was added for the last 18 hours of culture. Apoptosis frequencies, bcl-2 protein expression, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and cell cycle distributions were determined in four-color flow cytometry analyses of CD45(+) leukemia cells. In comparison to control growth conditions, direct contact with HS-5 significantly inhibited culture-induced and drug-induced apoptosis of AML cells. Direct contact of AML cells with HS-5 significantly increased short-term proliferation and viability, and colony formation of primary AML cells. HS-5-mediated apoptosis inhibition was not consistently associated with increased bcl-2 protein in AML cells. Noncontact conditions inhibited drug-induced apoptosis significantly less than direct contact with HS-5. Coculture of AML cells on HS-5 monolayers improved in vitro leukemia cell survival and attenuated chemotherapy-induced leukemia cell killing. This has practical significance, increasing the fraction of primary AML samples that can be analyzed in vitro, and allows drug sensitivity testing in growth conditions more similar to the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Garrido, S M', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Willman, C L', 'Banker, D E']","['Garrido SM', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Willman CL', 'Banker DE']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, D-100, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00612-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00612-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Apr;29(4):448-57. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00612-9.,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effects of bisphosphonates on the osteoclast stimulatory activity (OSA) that is present in the marrow of patients with multiple myeloma, even before the bone disease is detectable, are unknown. Therefore, we examined the effects of ibandronate (IB) treatment prior to the development of bone disease in a murine model of human myeloma. Sublethally irradiated severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were transplanted with ARH-77 cells on day 0. These ARH-77 mice were treated daily with subcutaneous injections of IB started before or at different times after tumor injection as follows: group 1 was started on day -7; group 2 on day 0; group 3 on day +7; group 4 on day +14 after IB administration; and group 5 (control) received no IB. Mice were sacrificed after they developed paraplegia. The onset of paraplegia was delayed in group 1 vs all other groups (mean day 27 vs day 32; p = 0.0098). The number of lytic lesions and the bone surface area of resorption (mm(2)) were significantly decreased in groups 1, 2, and 3, which were treated early with IB, when compared with groups 4 and 5 (p = 0.003 and 0.002, respectively). OSA, as measured by the capacity of bone marrow plasma from ARH-77 mice to induce osteoclast (OCL) formation in human bone marrow cultures, was decreased proportionally to the length of IB treatment. Group 1 had the lowest OSA compared with the other groups (p = 0.003). However, all mice eventually developed paraplegia, and at time of sacrifice, tumor burden was not grossly different among the groups. Interestingly, macroscopic abdominal tumors were more frequent in mice treated with IB. These data demonstrate that early treatment of ARH-77 mice with IB prior to development of myeloma bone disease decreases OSA and possibly retards the development of lytic lesions, but not eventual tumor burden.","['Cruz, J C', 'Alsina, M', 'Craig, F', 'Yoneda, T', 'Anderson, J L', 'Dallas, M', 'Roodman, G D']","['Cruz JC', 'Alsina M', 'Craig F', 'Yoneda T', 'Anderson JL', 'Dallas M', 'Roodman GD']","['Department of Medicine, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', 'UMD7G2653W (Ibandronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Diseases/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diphosphonates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/etiology/prevention & control', 'Ibandronic Acid', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/physiology', 'Osteolysis/prevention & control', 'Paraplegia/etiology/prevention & control', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00618-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00618-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Apr;29(4):441-7. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00618-x.,"['CA40035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To more clearly understand Leridistim's function at the molecular level, binding to both IL-3R and G-CSFR and subsequent signaling characteristics have been delineated. The affinity of Leridistim for the human G-CSFR was found to be comparable to that of native G-CSF (IC(50) = 0.96 nM and 1.0 nM, respectively). Both Leridistim and G-CSF induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation to a similar maximal level. Compared with native recombinant human IL-3 (rhIL-3), Leridistim was found to possess higher affinity for the IL-3R alpha chain (IL-3Ralpha) (IC(50) = 85 nM and 162 nM, respectively). However, the increase in Leridistim binding affinity to the functional, high-affinity heterodimeric IL-3Ralphabeta(c) receptor is lower than that observed with rhIL-3 (85 nM and 14 nM vs 162 nM and 3.5 nM, respectively). Leridistim induced tyrosine phosphorylation of beta(c) to a level comparable to native IL-3, and the level of JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing both IL-3R and G-CSFR was comparable to that observed with IL-3 or G-CSF alone. The ability of Leridistim to interact with IL-3R and G-CSFR simultaneously was demonstrated using surface plasmon resonance analysis. These studies were extended to demonstrate that Leridistim exhibited a higher affinity for the IL-3R on cells that express both the IL-3Ralphabeta(c) and the G-CSFR (IC(50) = 2 nM) compared with cells that contain the IL-3Ralphabeta(c) alone (IC(50) = 14 nM). Leridistim binds to both IL-3R and G-CSFR simultaneously and has been shown to activate both receptors. The bivalent avidity may explain the unique biologic effects and unexpected potency of Leridistim in hematopoietic cells compared with rhIL-3 or G-CSF alone or in combination.","['Monahan, J B', 'Hood, W F', 'Welply, J K', 'Shieh, J J', 'Polazzi, J O', 'Li, X']","['Monahan JB', 'Hood WF', 'Welply JK', 'Shieh JJ', 'Polazzi JO', 'Li X']","['Discovery Research, Pharmacia Corporation, 700 Chesterfield Village Parkway, Chesterfield, MO 63017, USA. joseph.b.monahan@monsanto.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '193700-51-5 (leridistim)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00611-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00611-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Apr;29(4):416-24. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00611-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate the presence of P-gp in intracellular vesicles in certain AML cell lines and show localization of DNR to a similar subcellular compartment(s) that can be altered in the presence of P-gp inhibitors. Analysis of leukaemic cell lines and 50 AML patient samples showed that the level of P-gp mRNA or total P-gp protein correlated better with drug efflux than surface P-gp protein, suggesting that intracellular P-gp may contribute to MDR in AML. Therefore, the level of total P-gp protein or mRNA may be a better indicator of MDR than surface P-gp protein.

The synthesis of these biogenic amines is regulated by histidine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase, respectively. In other mammalian tissues, an interplay between histamine and polyamine metabolisms has been suspected. In this report, the interplay between histamine and ornithine-derived polyamines was studied in a non-transformed mouse mast cell line (C57.1) treated with phorbol ester and dexamethasone, a treatment previously used to increase histidine decarboxylase expression in mastocytoma and basophilic leukemia. Treatment with phorbol ester and dexamethasone increased histidine decarboxylase expression and intracellular histamine levels in C57.1 mast cells to a greater extent than those found for other transformed basophilic models. The treatment also induced a reduction in ornithine decarboxylase expression, intracellular polyamine contents, and cell proliferation. These results indicate that the treatment induces a co-ordinate response of polyamine metabolism and proliferation in mast cells and other immune-related cells. The decrease in the proliferative capacity of mast cells caused by phorbol ester and dexamethasone was simultaneous to an increase in histamine production. Our results, together with those reported by other groups working with polyamine-treated mast cells, indicate an antagonism between histamine and polyamines in basophilic cells.","['Fajardo, I', 'Urdiales, J L', 'Medina, M A', 'Sanchez-Jimenez, F']","['Fajardo I', 'Urdiales JL', 'Medina MA', 'Sanchez-Jimenez F']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Malaga, Campus of Teatinos, 29071 Malaga, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.22 (Histidine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Diamines/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Histidine Decarboxylase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(01)00567-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00567-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 May 1;61(9):1101-6. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00567-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nineteen cats met the inclusion criteria for this retrospective study. Doxorubicin was given at a dosage of 25 mg/m2 (n = 8) or 1 mg/kg (n = 11) IV, every 3 weeks for a total of 5 treatments. Four of 16 tested cats were positive for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and all 16 cats tested negative for feline immunodeficiency virus. Eight of the 19 cats (42%) responded to doxorubicin for a median duration of 64 days (range, 35-575 days). Five cats (26%) achieved a complete response (CR) to doxorubicin for a median duration of 92 days (range, 54-575 days). Partial response was observed in 3 cats. Institution was the only significant prognostic indicator for response, with cats treated at Colorado State University being more likely to achieve CR than cats treated at Tufts University. Cats that achieved CR to doxorubicin and FeLV-negative cats had significantly longer survival times.

This technique combines immunohistochemistry with whole mouse sectioning. It lets one see the exact distribution of tumor cells throughout an animal and how effectively these cells are eliminated by cancer therapeutics. We used this technique to assess the efficacy of a T cell-specific immunotoxin in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse model of human T-cell leukemia. Severe combined immunodeficient mice were injected with one of two human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (Molt 3 and Molt 13) and were either left untreated or were treated with DA7, an immunotoxin specific for the T cell-associated antigen CD7. Mice were sacrificed after tumor cell injection and immunotoxin therapy, whole mouse cross-sections were prepared, and tumor cells in the sections were visualized by immunohistochemistry. No tumor cells were detected in DA7-treated mice injected with Molt 3, consistent with the long-term survival of this group and the sensitivity of Molt 3 to DA7 in vitro. In contrast, DA7 treatment did not visibly eliminate tumor cells in mice challenged with Molt 13, nor did it result in their long-term survival. Furthermore, tumor cells were detected in areas that may have otherwise been overlooked, and their distribution differed from that of mice injected with Molt 13 alone. These analyses indicate that whole mouse sectioning will be a valuable tool for assessing residual disease in the preclinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics.","['Erickson, H A', 'Reinhardt, R L', 'Hermanson, J B', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A', 'Pennell, C A']","['Erickson HA', 'Reinhardt RL', 'Hermanson JB', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Pennell CA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, The University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Immunotoxins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD7/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotoxins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Mar;7(3 Suppl):890s-894s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study analyzed the sera of patients with AML and CML for the presence of antibodies to full-length and truncated WT1 proteins. Sixteen of 63 patients (25%) with AML had serum antibodies reactive with WT1/full-length protein. Serum antibodies from all 16 were also reactive with WT1/NH2-terminal protein. By marked contrast, only 2 had reactivity to WT1/COOH-terminal protein. Thus, the level of immunological tolerance to the COOH terminus may be higher than to the NH2 terminus. The WT1/COOH-terminal protein contains four zinc finger domains with homology to other self-proteins. By implication, these homologies may be related to the increased immunological tolerance. Results in patients with CML were similar with antibodies reactive to WT1/full-length protein detectable in serum of 15 of 81 patients (19%). Antibodies reactive with WT1/NH2-terminal protein were present in the serum of all 15, whereas antibodies reactive with WT1/COOH-terminal protein were present in only 3. By contrast to results in leukemia patients, antibodies reactive with WT1/full-length protein were detected in only 2 of 96 normal individuals. The greater incidence of antibody in leukemia patients provides strong evidence that immunization to the WT1 protein occurred as a result of patients bearing malignancy that expresses WT1. These data provide further stimulus to test therapeutic vaccines directed against WT1 with increased expectation that the vaccines will be able to elicit and/or boost an immune response to WT1.","['Gaiger, A', 'Carter, L', 'Greinix, H', 'Carter, D', 'McNeill, P D', 'Houghton, R L', 'Cornellison, C D', 'Vedvick, T S', 'Skeiky, Y A', 'Cheever, M A']","['Gaiger A', 'Carter L', 'Greinix H', 'Carter D', 'McNeill PD', 'Houghton RL', 'Cornellison CD', 'Vedvick TS', 'Skeiky YA', 'Cheever MA']","['Corixa Corporation, Seattle, Washington 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies/*blood', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/immunology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/immunology/mortality', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Mar;7(3 Suppl):761s-765s.,"['R37 CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43 CA81752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1992 and July 1996, 3934 new cases of adults with acute leukemia were recorded in GIMEMA Archive of Adult Acute Leukemia (2964 AML, 901 ALL, 69 acute leukemia expressing both myeloid and lymphoid surface markers). RESULTS: Two hundred patients (5.1%) presented with a history of previous malignancy (21 of them were affected by ALL and 179 by AML). Among sAML, 37 patients (29%) had a previous breast cancer. They consisted of 36 females and 1 male, median age 56 years, range 34-87. The median latency between the 2 malignancies was 54 months (range 5-379). Twenty-seven patients received chemo- and/or radiotherapy for breast cancer (7 only chemotherapy, 6 only radiotherapy, and 14 combined treatment). All patients were surgically treated but in 10 patients surgical debridement was the sole therapy for breast cancer. The drugs most frequently employed were alkylating agents (18 patients), topoisomerase II inhibitors (9 patients), antimetabolites (20 patients) (CMF, CEF and MMM combinations). At onset of sAML the median WBC count was 7.7 x 10(9)/l (0.8-153) and the median platelet count was 33.5 x 10(9)/l (3-305). Considering morphological features, FAB subtypes were 4 M0, 5 M1, 11 M2, 5 M3, 8 M4, 3 M5, and 1 M6. Cytogenetic study was performed on 28 patients and 12 of them presented abnormalities. It is noteworthy that chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities (typically observed in those patients treated with alkylating agents) were present only in three cases. Thirty-four patients received chemotherapy for sAML, and twenty-five of them achieved a CR (74%), with a median duration of twenty-eight weeks (5-280+). The overall survival was 8 months (1-80+). DISCUSSION: The high number of sAML we observed in patients with a previous breast cancer, may be due to the fact that this malignancy is the most frequent neoplasm in women and by the high probability of cure with a consequent long disease-free survival. Our results suggest that the risk of sAML after recovery from breast cancer is increasing due to the rise in the number of patients cured from breast cancer, and in the future could be a relevant problem for haematologists.","['Pagano, L', 'Pulsoni, A', 'Mele, L', 'Tosti, M E', 'Cerri, R', 'Visani, G', 'Melillo, L', 'Candoni, A', 'Clavio, M', 'Nosari, A', 'Petti, M C', 'Martino, B', 'Mele, A', 'Levis, A', 'Allione, B', 'Almici, C', 'Equitani, F', 'Leone, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Pagano L', 'Pulsoni A', 'Mele L', 'Tosti ME', 'Cerri R', 'Visani G', 'Melillo L', 'Candoni A', 'Clavio M', 'Nosari A', 'Petti MC', 'Martino B', 'Mele A', 'Levis A', 'Allione B', 'Almici C', 'Equitani F', 'Leone G', 'Mandelli F']","['epartment of Haematology, Catholic University, Roma, Italy. lpagano@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male/complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008318816244 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)47286-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2001 Feb;12(2):203-7. doi: 10.1023/a:1008318816244.,,,,,,,,"[""Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adults""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Among 12 cell lines examined, mRNA transcripts were expressed only in B-lymphoblastic and myeloma cell lines. Myeloma cells and malignant cell lines derived from mature B cells expressed more transcript than cell lines derived from immature B cells. Transcript levels, however, showed no association with chromosomal translocations. Expression in B-cell fractions from healthy donors was much less than in the malignant cells. In addition, MUM1/IRF4 mRNA expressed in samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia derived from B cells but not T cells.

RESULTS: CGH revealed four types of del(20q), and, in addition, detected a tiny terminal del(3p) in one of the cases. The size of the smallest deleted segment, clearly visible by eye on the CGH metaphase image, was estimated to range between 5 and 7 Mbp. CONCLUSION: Visual determination was shown to have a stronger resolving power in CGH than software used for the analysis in one case, while in another one, the results obtained from the ratio profiles would have been considered insignificant without the knowledge of the hybridization pattern on the corresponding CGH metaphase images.

PD 98059, the specific inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 was found to inhibit calcitriol-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.

As early as 24 hours after As2O3 treatment, we began to observe the alteration of nuclear matrix proteins and apoptosis in tumor cells by TUNEL assay but not by DNA ladder. An increase expression of Hsc in nuclear matrix proteins of 2 microM As2O3 treated cells was also noted. Our results also showed that before a mass range of apoptosis occurred, the composition of nuclear matrix proteins had altered.

When Artepillin C was applied to human leukemia cell lines of different phenotypes, namely, lymphocytic leukemia (7 cell lines of T-cell, 5 cell lines of B-cell), myeloid and monocytic leukemia and non-lymphoid non-myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro, Artepillin C exhibited potent cytocidal effects and induced marked levels of apoptosis in all the cell lines. The most potent effects were observed in the T-cell lines. Apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation were induced in the cell lines after exposure to Artepillin C. DNA synthesis in the leukemia cells was clearly inhibited and disintegration of the cells was confirmed microscopically. Apoptosis of the leukemia cells may be partially associated with enhanced Fas antigen expression and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast, although Artepillin C inhibited the growth of pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-stimulated normal blood lymphocytes, it was not cytocidal to normal unstimulated lymphocytes. These results suggested that Artepillin C, an active ingredient of Brazilian propolis, has anti-leukemic effects with limited inhibitory effects on normal lymphocytes.","['Kimoto, T', 'Aga, M', 'Hino, K', 'Koya-Miyata, S', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Micallef, M J', 'Hanaya, T', 'Arai, S', 'Ikeda, M', 'Kurimoto, M']","['Kimoto T', 'Aga M', 'Hino K', 'Koya-Miyata S', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Micallef MJ', 'Hanaya T', 'Arai S', 'Ikeda M', 'Kurimoto M']","['Fujisaki Institute, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories Inc., Fujisaki 675-1, Okayama 702-8006, Japan. fujisaki@hayashibara.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylpropionates)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '72944-19-5 (artepillin C)', '9009-62-5 (Propolis)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brazil', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Medicine, Traditional', 'Phenylpropionates/*pharmacology', 'Propolis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2001 Jan-Feb;21(1A):221-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

U937 myelomonocytic leukemia cells are sensitive to TNF-alpha and about 20% of these cells undergo apoptosis within 6 hours after treatment. Co-treatment of these cells with actinomycin D or cycloheximide enhances TNF-alpha induced apoptosis, suggesting that some TNF-alpha-derived signals can augment apoptosis. We investigated whether mitosis-activating protein kinases (MAPKs) had an influence on TNF-alpha induced apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U937 cells were treated by TNF-alpha with or without MEK or p38MAPK inhibitors. Apoptosis was assessed morphologically by fluorescence microscopy and caspase-3 was studied by immunoblotting. Expression of apoptosis-inhibitory proteins was studied by RT-PCR whilst the activation of JNKs was investigated by detecting their phosphorylation. RESULTS: TNF-alpha treatment induced apoptosis in about 23% of the cells, while pretreatment with a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) caused 69% of the cells to undergo apoptosis. The inhibition of p38MAPK by SB203580 scarcely enhanced apoptosis, although another p38MAPK inhibitor (PD169316) induced apoptosis in 37% of the cells. Simultaneous pretreatment of cells with PD98059 and PD169316 resulted in the highest level of TNF-alpha induced apoptosis and 90% of the cells underwent apoptosis after 6 hours. In cells pretreated with PD98059 plus PD169316, caspase-3 was completely cleaved at 6 hours and early induction of c-IAP2/HIAP 1 mRNA was not observed. JNKs showed rapid and extensive phosphorylation in these cells. CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha induced apoptosis was potentiated by the inhibition of either MEK alone, or MEK plus p38MAPK, suggesting that the MAPK pathway may be a promising target for cancer therapy.","['Nakada, S', 'Kawano, T', 'Saito-akita, S', 'Iwase, S', 'Horiguchi-Yamada, J', 'Ohno, T', 'Yamada, H']","['Nakada S', 'Kawano T', 'Saito-akita S', 'Iwase S', 'Horiguchi-Yamada J', 'Ohno T', 'Yamada H']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Institute of DNA Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-Shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8461, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GX3Y2V80CV (2-(4-nitrophenyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazole)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2001/04/13 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2001 Jan-Feb;21(1A):167-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these lines, p53, p21WAF1, and bcl-2 levels were measured by ELISA. Results show that P21WAF1 upregulation following p53 induction did not occur, suggesting that p53 function may be lost. Moreover, the data imply that upregulation of bcl-2 is critical in the development of resistance to ara-C and ASNase in these leukemic lines. In the CEM/0 parent line, p53 maintained its ability to interact with its DNA binding site as documented by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). But in one single- and one double-resistant leukemic cell line examined, p53 was not shown to maintain this ability.

As controls, 19 healthy subjects with the age range equivalent were studied. The enumeration of CD3+ lymphocytes and their CD4+ and CD8+ subsets were defined by monoclonal antibodies and NK cell cytotoxicity towards K562 target cells were evaluated by single cell-assay. The results showed in family members low percentage of total T cells (CD3+), and their CD4+ subset and impairment of CD4/CD8 ratio in relation to control group. All family members presented percentage of NK-target cell conjugate formation below the minimum value observed in control group. Thirteen people were examined and followed up during five years, in order to assure that there was no undiagnosed or unsuspected disease at the moment of evaluation. One of them developed osteoblastoma and other malignant melanoma. Two cancer patients, with glioblastoma and chronic myelocytic leukemia were studied during illness. All the corresponding values were comparable. The persistence of low percentage of conjugate formation may be related to a defect on adhesion molecules expression in the surface of NK cells that was probably responsible for the low activity of these cells presented by the family group. Thus, the inheritance mechanism of low adherence of NK cells should have a prognostic value in determining the risk of developing tumors.","['Montelli, T C', 'Peracoli, M T', 'Gabarra, R C', 'Soares, A M', 'Kurokawa, C S']","['Montelli TC', 'Peracoli MT', 'Gabarra RC', 'Soares AM', 'Kurokawa CS']","['Departamento de Neurologia e Psiquiatria, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brasil. montelli@laser.com.br']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Arq Neuropsiquiatr,Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,0125444,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology', 'Pedigree', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2001/04/12 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/04/12 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0004-282X2001000100003 [pii]', '10.1590/s0004-282x2001000100003 [doi]']",ppublish,Arq Neuropsiquiatr. 2001 Mar;59(1):6-10. doi: 10.1590/s0004-282x2001000100003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten cDNA fragments upregulated by Epo were isolated. The ribonuclease protection assay confirmed differential expression between Epo-stimulated and Epo-deprived cells for one of these, provisionally named ERIC-1.

In addition to erythroid precursor cells, ERIC-1/TACC3 is expressed at high levels in the testes, at moderate levels in the thymus and peripheral leucocytes, and at lower levels in the spleen and intestinal tissue.

We sought to test the hypothesis that HLA-DP functions in a manner similar to that of other class II genes by measuring the risk of clinically severe grades III-IV acute graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) associated with recipient HLA-DP disparity after haematopoietic cell transplantation. HLA-DPB1 exon 2 was sequenced in 205 patients who underwent transplantation from HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 allele-matched unrelated donors. HLA-DPB1 mismatched recipients experienced a significantly increased risk of acute GVHD compared with HLA-DP-identical transplants. Patients who were mismatched for a single HLA-DPB1 allele had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.0 (0.5, 2.2; P = 0.99) and patients who were mismatched for two alleles had an OR of 2.2 (1.0, 4.9; P = 0.06) for developing acute GVHD. Compared with matched and single-allele mismatched transplants, patients who were mismatched for two DPB1 alleles had an OR of 2.2 (1.2, 4.1; P = 0.01). HLA-DP plays an important role in the alloimmune response. A threshold effect of multiple HLA-DP disparities is evident in determining the risk of acute GVHD after haematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors.","['Petersdorf, E W', 'Gooley, T', 'Malkki, M', 'Anasetti, C', 'Martin, P', 'Woolfrey, A', 'Smith, A', 'Mickelson, E', 'Hansen, J A']","['Petersdorf EW', 'Gooley T', 'Malkki M', 'Anasetti C', 'Martin P', 'Woolfrey A', 'Smith A', 'Mickelson E', 'Hansen JA']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue N, D4-100, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. epetersd@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk', 'Transplantation Immunology/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/04/12 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/12 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2655 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02655.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(4):988-94. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02655.x.,"['AI33484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective study included 21 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 15 with acute myelogenous leukaemia and one each with chronic myelogenous leukaemia, refractory anaemia with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). Those subjected to CBT during the first or second complete remission (CR) and MDS without blasts were assigned to the standard-risk (SR) group (n = 16). Patients in third or subsequent remission, relapse or partial remission with refractory leukaemia at the time of CBT were considered to be in advanced phase, and placed in the high-risk (HR) group (n = 11). JMML and the second CR after a relapse (n = 8), or bone marrow failure after a rejection (n = 3), following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the first CR were included in the high-risk group. Kaplan-Meier estimates for neutrophil and platelet recovery were 83.7 +/- 12.2 at d 60 and 55.4 +/- 16.6% at d 100 respectively. The incidence of grades II-VI acute graft-versus-host disease was 58.5 +/- 16.8%. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was 49.2 +/- 16.6. From multivariate analysis, the most important factor influencing EFS was disease status at CBT: SR patients had a 3-year EFS of 75.0 +/- 21.6%, compared with 29.6 +/- 20.6% for those with HR disease (P = 0.013, RR 4.746, 95% CI 1.382-16.298).

The intrinsic characteristics that permit this accumulation have been extensively studied and described. However, it is possible that proliferation and survival of this malignant clone is facilitated by a disruption in the interaction between B and T cells that normally regulate the immune system. In this study, using flow cytometry and cell culture techniques, marked abnormalities of the expression of certain key activation and interaction molecules on the peripheral blood T cells of patients with B-CLL were demonstrated. In particular, on comparison with normal controls, there was a marked reduction in the number of circulating T cells expressing CD25 (interleukin 2 receptor) (P = 0.007), CD28 (P = 0.01) and CD152 (CTLA-4) (P = 0.001).

These results suggest that there is a profound T-cell dysregulation that may contribute to the survival of the malignant B cells in patients with B-CLL and to the related autoimmune phenomena of the disease.","['Scrivener, S', 'Kaminski, E R', 'Demaine, A', 'Prentice, A G']","['Scrivener S', 'Kaminski ER', 'Demaine A', 'Prentice AG']","['Derriford Combined Laboratory, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, Devon PL6 8DH, UK. sophie.scrivener@phnt.swest.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)']",IM,"['Abatacept', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'CD28 Antigens/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2001/04/12 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/12 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2672 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02672.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(4):959-64. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02672.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have screened 98 Japanese patients with leukaemia and lymphoma for expression of the PRAME gene using semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Forty-one patients (42%) showed high levels of PRAME expression. Eight of these patients were then monitored using real-time PCR for a period of 10-37 months. Significant reductions in the PRAME expression were observed in all patients after chemotherapy. An increased expression was detected in the two patients who relapsed, one of which was before cytological diagnosis. These changes were correlated with those of other known genetic markers, such as the bcr-abl gene. Therefore, quantitative monitoring of the PRAME gene using real-time PCR method may be useful for detecting minimal residual disease and to predict subsequent relapse, especially in patients without known genetic markers. In addition, a PRAME-positive leukaemia cell line and fresh leukaemic cells were found to be susceptible to lysis by PRAME-specific CTLs established from a patient with melanoma, suggesting that the PRAME peptide can also be a target leukaemia antigen for T cells.","['Matsushita, M', 'Ikeda, H', 'Kizaki, M', 'Okamoto, S', 'Ogasawara, M', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Kawakami, Y']","['Matsushita M', 'Ikeda H', 'Kizaki M', 'Okamoto S', 'Ogasawara M', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kawakami Y']","['Division of Cellular Signalling, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2001/04/12 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/12 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2670 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02670.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(4):916-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02670.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively surveyed all French haematology centres for adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases diagnosed between January 1990 and July 1996 who were found to be HIV-seropositive before or at the time of AML diagnosis. Medical charts were reviewed to determine the stage of HIV infection, the characteristics of AML and the response of AML to chemotherapy. Sixteen cases of AML (13 men, three women) were reported by 12 haematology units. Based on assumptions on the size, age and sex distribution of the HIV-infected population in France, the estimated risk of AML in 1990 to 1996 among HIV-infected adults was twice that of the general population (standardized incidence ratio = 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.34). Two other cases occurring before 1990 were spontaneously notified to the authors and were included in the clinical analysis. At AML diagnosis, the median CD4+ cell count was 275 x 106/l and nine patients had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Fifteen patients were scheduled for remission-induction therapy of AML. No deaths were related to AML treatment. Complete remission was obtained in 11 out of 15 patients. Three patients were long-term survivors: two remain alive in complete remission at 8 years and 9 years, respectively, and the third died of AIDS at 8 years. A CD4+ cell count above 200 x 106/l at AML diagnosis was predictive of longer survival (log-rank test: P = 0.004). Like many other malignancies, the incidence of AML appears to be increased in HIV-infected patients. Our results show a twofold higher incidence, although this needs to be confirmed in a specifically designed prospective epidemiological study. Such patients, especially those with CD4+ cell counts above 200 x 106/l at AML diagnosis, should receive remission-induction therapy, which can confer long-term survival.","['Sutton, L', 'Guenel, P', 'Tanguy, M L', 'Rio, B', 'Dhedin, N', 'Casassus, P', 'Lortholary, O']","['Sutton L', 'Guenel P', 'Tanguy ML', 'Rio B', 'Dhedin N', 'Casassus P', 'Lortholary O']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, 47 Boulevard de l'Hopital, 75651 Paris Cedex 13, France. laurent.sutton@psl.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/04/12 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/12 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2661 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02661.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(4):900-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02661.x.,,,,,,,,['French Study Group on Acute Myeloid Leukaemia in HIV-Infected Patients'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the role of NKG2D in the natural cytolysis mediated by NK cell clones. The role of NKG2D varied depending on the type of target cells analyzed. Lysis of various tumors appeared to be exclusively natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) dependent. In contrast, killing of another group of target cells, including not only the epithelial cell lines HELA and IGROV-1, but also the FO-1 melanoma, the JA3 leukemia, the Daudi Burkitt lymphoma and even normal PHA-induced lymphoblasts, involved both NCR and NKG2D. Notably, NK cell clones expressing low surface densities of NCR (NCR(dull)) could lyse these tumors in an exclusively NKG2D-dependent fashion. Remarkably, not all of these targets expressed MICA/B, thus implying the existence of additional ligands recognized by NKG2D, possibly represented by GPI-linked molecules.

The aim of our study was to assess the possible correlation between cytogenetic findings and clinical characteristics. Thirty patients with previously untreated early-onset B-CLL were recruited. The incidence of trisomy 12, and observations of 13q14.2 and 14q32 was analyzed in unstimulated bone marrow cells by means of multicolor interphase FISH. No correlation was found between trisomy 12 and the patients' clinical characteristics. The analysis of the patients with trisomy 12 and observations of 13q14.2 and 14q32 revealed heterogeneity of the leukemic cell population, thus indicating that these chromosomal abnormalities are probably a secondary event in CLL leukemogenesis. The finding of RB1 gene nullisomy and 14q32 deletions in patients at an advanced clinical stage suggests a possible correlation between these rearrangements and disease progression. Multicolor FISH analysis in B-CLL provides important diagnostic, clinical, and prognostic information that may help in assessing prognosis and making treatment decisions.","['Doneda, L', 'Castorina, P', 'Tedeschi, A', 'Intropido, L', 'Morra, E', 'Montillo, M', 'Larizza, L']","['Doneda L', 'Castorina P', 'Tedeschi A', 'Intropido L', 'Morra E', 'Montillo M', 'Larizza L']","['Department of Biology and Genetics Medical Faculty, University of Milan, Via Viotti 3/5 20133, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', '*Interphase', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology']",2001/04/12 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/12 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(00)00362-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00362-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Feb;125(1):63-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00362-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study of 54 cases with hematological disorders.",30-40,"Trisomy 8 and monosomy 7 are the two most frequent aneuploidies found in hematological disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, primed in situ labeling (PRINS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetic approaches were used to investigate 54 cases of hematopoietic disorders. Of these cases, there were 22 cases of trisomy 8, 2 cases of tetrasomy 8, 14 cases of monosomy 7, and 16 cases with two copies of both chromosomes 7 and 8. PRINS was carried out in interphase nuclei of bone marrow samples using primers that can specifically detect alpha-satellite DNA sequences of chromosomes 7 and 8. In parallel, using the alpha-satellite probes for chromosomes 7 and 8, FISH was performed for all the cases. PRINS and FISH techniques showed similar specificity and sensitivity. In comparison to FISH, PRINS is more advantageous since it is a faster, easier, and more cost-effective technique. Additionally, for most of the cases, a higher proportion of aneuploidy was detected in metaphases using conventional cytogenetics, as compared to the one found in interphase nuclei identified with PRINS and FISH techniques. In other words, for these cases, the cells with trisomy 8 or monosomy 7, had a distinct proliferative advantage compared to the disomic cell population. Therefore, to better quantify the proportion of aneuploid cells in bone marrow, we recommend to investigate the frequency of aneuploidy in nuclei using PRINS, rather than studying only the dividing cells as detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques.","['Yan, J', 'Zhang, X X', 'Fetni, R', 'Drouin, R']","['Yan J', 'Zhang XX', 'Fetni R', 'Drouin R']","[""Division of Pathology, Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, and Unite de Recherche en Genetique Humaine et Moleculaire, Hopital Saint-Francois d'Assise, CHUQ, 10 de l'Espinay, G1L 3L5, Quebec, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', '*Trisomy']",2001/04/12 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/12 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(00)00355-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00355-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Feb;125(1):30-40. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00355-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In case 2, it was accompanied by a double Ph, trisomy 18 and disomy Y and was found in 68% of metaphase cells. However, FISH and PRINS techniques revealed the coexistence of tetrasomy 8 and trisomy 8 in interphase nuclei of both cases. When the proportion of cells with tetrasomy 8 was compared between metaphases and interphase nuclei, it showed a much higher percentage of cells with tetrasomy 8 in metaphases than in interphase nuclei. Moreover, in case 2, although multi-PRINS and FISH-PRINS techniques showed other populations of interphase nuclei with different combinations of chromosome anomalies with respect to the copy numbers for chromosomes 8, 18, Y and Ph, only cells that contained either a single Ph or tetrasomy 8 plus trisomy 18, disomy Y, and double Ph could be seen in metaphases.

The data demonstrate that RGS4 inhibited responses by PAFR (i.e., phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization) but not by FR or CXCR1. An N-terminal 33 amino acid deletion mutant of RGS4 (DeltaRGS4), deficient in GAP (GTPase activating protein) activity and plasma membrane localization, had no effect on either PAFR, FR, or CXCR1. RGS4, but not DeltaRGS4, also blocked phosphorylation of PAFR by platelet-activating factor (PAF) and, unexpectedly, by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA); it also blocked cross-phosphorylation by formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP). A point mutant of RGS4 (N88S), deficient in GAP activity but not membrane localization, partially blocked PAFR phosphorylation but had no effect on PAFR-mediated PI hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization. Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of PAFR (mPAFR) resulted in a loss of its susceptibility to inhibition by RGS4. Taken together, the data indicate that of the receptors studied, RGS4 selectively inhibited responses to PAFR, which preferentially couples to Gq. At the level of expression studied, RGS4 did not inhibit FR or CXCR1 which activates Gi to transduce cellular signals. Since the tail-deleted mutant of PAFR was not affected by RGS4, and RGS4 blocked homologous as well as heterologous phosphorylation of this receptor, it is possible that RGS4 interferes sterically with the cytoplasmic tail of PAFR. Thus, in addition to stimulating the GTPase activity of Galpha, RGS4 prevents G protein activation by PAFR and the homologous and heterologous phosphorylation of this receptor.","['Richardson, R M', 'Marjoram, R J', 'Barr, A J', 'Snyderman, R']","['Richardson RM', 'Marjoram RJ', 'Barr AJ', 'Snyderman R']","['Departments of Medicine and Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. richa021@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RGS Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', '175335-35-0 (RGS4 protein)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cytoplasm/genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/chemical synthesis', 'Hydrolysis', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'RGS Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Rats', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Immunologic/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/12 10:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/04/12 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['bi0019242 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0019242 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2001 Mar 27;40(12):3583-8. doi: 10.1021/bi0019242.,"['AI-38910/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-03738/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We further investigated the antitumor effect of this compound on HAL-01-bearing nude mice. Treatment with Phx markedly reduced the tumor growth rate in the experimental group, as compared with the control group. Moreover, Phx was found to have few adverse effects on weight loss and WBC count. In addition, we examined the effects of Phx on human normal hematopoietic progenitor cells by a clonogenic assay, and we observed less suppression of normal progenitor cells than of leukemic progenitors.

NSC 72151 and 268965 were equitoxic for both populations. NSC 94889, 638850, and 630938 were more cytotoxic in rapidly growing cells. In in vitro time exposure studies, four compounds, NSC 268965, 280074, 281613, and 281817, were maximally cytotoxic with as little as 3 h exposure time. From an analysis comparing the p53 genotype of the 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Drug Screen with the cytotoxicity profiles for the 16 putative renal compounds, 13 compounds were classified as likely to be indifferent to p53 status. We also developed a panel specificity detection method for the NCI Drug Screen database to evaluate the prevalence of renal sensitive compounds. Of the 16 studied compounds, 14 were among those identified as renal sensitive by the statistical analysis. Lastly, we found reduced tumor growth in mice with established renal human tumor xenografts after treatment with two of the renal active compounds. These studies describe compounds with potential renal activity that are candidates for preclinical development for renal cell carcinoma.","['Mertins, S D', 'Myers, T G', 'Hollingshead, M', 'Dykes, D', 'Bodde, E', 'Tsai, P', 'Jefferis, C A', 'Gupta, R', 'Linehan, W M', 'Alley, M', 'Bates, S E']","['Mertins SD', 'Myers TG', 'Hollingshead M', 'Dykes D', 'Bodde E', 'Tsai P', 'Jefferis CA', 'Gupta R', 'Linehan WM', 'Alley M', 'Bates SE']","['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. smertins@box-s.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*drug therapy', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Design', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/12 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/04/12 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Mar;7(3):620-33.,['N01-CM-47000/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A role for retroviruses in the etiopathogenesis of some cases of schizophrenia has been postulated on the basis of clinical and epidemiological observations. We found sequences homologous to retroviral pol genes in the cell-free cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs) of 10 of 35 (29%) individuals with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Retroviral sequences also were identified in the CSFs of 1 of 20 individuals with chronic schizophrenia. However, retroviral sequences were not identified in any of the CSFs obtained from 22 individuals with noninflammatory neurological diseases or from 30 individuals without evidence of neurological or psychiatric diseases (chi(2) = 19.25, P < 0.001). The nucleotide sequences identified in the CSFs of the individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were related to those of the human endogenous retroviral (HERV)-W family of endogenous retroviruses and to other retroviruses in the murine leukemia virus genus. Transcription of RNA homologous to members of the HERV-W family of retroviruses also was found to be up-regulated differentially in the frontal cortex regions of brains obtained postmortem from individuals with schizophrenia, as compared with corresponding tissue from individuals without psychiatric diseases. The transcriptional activation of certain retroviral elements within the central nervous system may be associated with the development of schizophrenia in at least some individuals. The further characterization of retroviral elements within the central nervous system of individuals with schizophrenia might lead to improved methods for the diagnosis and management of this disorder.","['Karlsson, H', 'Bachmann, S', 'Schroder, J', 'McArthur, J', 'Torrey, E F', 'Yolken, R H']","['Karlsson H', 'Bachmann S', 'Schroder J', 'McArthur J', 'Torrey EF', 'Yolken RH']","['Stanley Division of Developmental Neurovirology, Department of Pediatrics, and Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. hakan.karlsson@neuro.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Viral/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Schizophrenia/cerebrospinal fluid/*virology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.061021998 [doi]', '98/8/4634 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Apr 10;98(8):4634-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.061021998.,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Apr 10;98(8):4293-4.

Most human acute leukemias contain high levels of the wild-type transcript, while a minority have point mutations, raising the possibility that this tumor suppressor might have a paradoxical oncogenic effect in some hematopoietic cells. Using high titer retroviral infection, we demonstrate that WT1 triggers rapid growth arrest and lineage-specific differentiation in primary hematopoietic progenitors and differentiation-competent leukemia cell lines, while it induces cellular quiescence in a primitive subset of primary precursors. Growth arrest by WT1 is associated with induction of p21(CIP1), but expression of this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor alone is insufficient for either cellular differentiation or primitive cell preservation. The effects of WT1 are enhanced by co-expression of its naturally occurring isoforms, and are correlated with the physiological expression pattern of WT1 in vivo. Our observations suggest a role for WT1 in the differentiation of human hematopoietic cells, and provide a functional model that supports its capacity as a tumor suppressor in human acute leukemia.","['Ellisen, L W', 'Carlesso, N', 'Cheng, T', 'Scadden, D T', 'Haber, D A']","['Ellisen LW', 'Carlesso N', 'Cheng T', 'Scadden DT', 'Haber DA']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins', '*Wilms Tumor']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/20.8.1897 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Apr 17;20(8):1897-909. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.8.1897.,"['CA58596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL044851/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK002761/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL44851/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82831/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50234/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA058596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK02761/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK050234/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA058596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC125233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Xenotransplantation of primary human CML cells into immunodeficient mice allows investigation into the nature of the most primitive repopulating cells in this leukemia, but the system is limited by variability and difficulty with experimental manipulation. Accordingly, a large effort has been invested in developing models of CML through expression of the BCR/ABL oncogene in the hematopoietic system of laboratory mice. Despite numerous attempts, an accurate transgenic mouse model of CML has not been produced, possibly because of the toxicity of BCR/ABL. Conditional transgenic mice are a promising new approach to this problem. A more successful strategy is retroviral transduction of BCR/ABL into mouse bone marrow in vitro, followed by transplantation into syngeneic or immunodeficient recipient mice. Recipients of marrow transduced with p210 BCR/ABL develop a fatal myeloproliferative illness that closely resembles human CML.

This review focuses on classes of agents under laboratory and clinical evaluation as antiproliferative or differentiating agents: polyamine inhibitors, vitamin D and its analogs, metabolites of vitamin A, the short-chain fatty acid, phenylbutyrate, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Because differentiation therapies offer a reduced toxicity profile and have potential for preventing or slowing cancer progression, they may offer an alternative to chemotherapy for men with advanced PCa, or may be useful as low-toxicity agents given chronically for chemoprevention in men at high risk for PCa.

We studied the effects of NH(2)Cl on the cell death induced by etoposide, a widely used anticancer agent that is directed to DNA topoisomerase II. Jurkat T cells, a human acute T cell leukemia cell line, were pretreated with 70 microM of NH(2)Cl for 10 min. After 24 h, 5-30 microM of etoposide was added to the NH(2)Cl pretreated and control cells, and their apoptosis, caspase activity, cell morphology, and cellular DNA contents were measured. NH(2)Cl pretreatment significantly inhibited apoptosis and caspase activation induced by etoposide or camptothecin, a DNA topoisomerase I poison, but not by staurosporine or Fas stimulation. The apoptosis inhibition actually resulted in the proliferation of the survived cells and, notably, the survived cells showed more aberrant morphology, such as variation in nuclear size, nuclear fragments, and multinucleated cells. DNA content analysis of the survived cells showed an increase in aneuploid nuclei. Cell cycle analysis after 24 h of NH(2)Cl treatment showed a significant decrease in S phase cells with a concurrent increase in G(0)/G(1) phase cells, which suggested that NH(2)Cl induced G(1) arrest. Using synchronized Jurkat cells, etoposide and camptothecin were found to be particularly cytotoxic to S phase cells, whereas staurosporine and Fas stimulation were not. Thus NH(2)Cl-induced G(1) arrest was a likely cause of the observed resistance to etoposide. These observations suggested that inflammation-derived oxidants may make the tumor cells more resistant to etoposide and increase the risk of tumor progression and the development of secondary tumors by increasing the survival of DNA damage-bearing cells.","['Than, T A', 'Ogino, T', 'Omori, M', 'Okada, S']","['Than TA', 'Ogino T', 'Omori M', 'Okada S']","['Department of Pathology, Okayama University Medical School, Faculty of Medicine, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Chloramines)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (anti-Fas monoclonal antibody)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'KW8K411A1P (chloramine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chloramines/*pharmacology', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Etoposide/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0891584901004968 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00496-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2001 Apr 15;30(8):932-40. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00496-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated that HNE, at micromolar concentrations, induces dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in a leukemic cell line (CEM-C7). Interestingly, much higher concentrations of HNE (> 15-fold) were required to induce apoptosis in leukocytes obtained from normal individuals. We also demonstrate that HNE causes a decrease in clonogenicity of CEM-C7 cells. Furthermore, our data characterize the caspase cascade involved in HNE-induced apoptosis in CEM-C7 cells. Using specific fluorogenic substrates and irreversible peptide inhibitors, we demonstrate that caspase 2, caspase 3, and caspase 8 are involved in HNE-induced apoptosis, and that caspase 2 is the first initiator caspase that activates the executioner caspase 3, either directly or via activation of caspase 8. Our studies also suggest the involvement of another executioner caspase, which appears to be similar to caspase 8 but not caspases 2 and 3, in its specificity. The demonstration of decreased clonogenicity by HNE in the leukemic cells, and their higher susceptibility to HNE-induced apoptosis as compared to the normal cells, suggests that such compounds may have potential for leukemia chemotherapy.","['Zhang, W', 'He, Q', 'Chan, L L', 'Zhou, F', 'El Naghy, M', 'Thompson, E B', 'Ansari, N H']","['Zhang W', 'He Q', 'Chan LL', 'Zhou F', 'El Naghy M', 'Thompson EB', 'Ansari NH']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-0647, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '109710-37-4 (4-hydroxyhexenal)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0891584901004658 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00465-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2001 Mar 15;30(6):699-706. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00465-8.,['EY 13014/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of the p21 and p27 genes increased transiently and decreased quickly in the proliferation, suggesting that other genes may contribute to the growth arrest of the cell line after reduction of the p21 and p27 genes. The mac25 gene was isolated as a gene associated with cellular senescence and growth suppression. Despite a previous report that retinoic acid (RA) induced the mac25 gene, the mac25 gene did not increase in U937 cells treated with RA but did increase in the cells treated with 1alpha,25(OH)2-D3. The high level of the expression of the mac25 gene was detected for four days after the 1alpha,25(OH)2-D3 treatment. Therefore, mac25 may contribute to the growth arrest of U937 cells treated with 1,25-D3. The growth responses to 1alpha,25(OH)2-D3 and the expression of the mac25 gene of three other cancer cell lines (Saos-2, U2OS and MCF7) were studied. Although the growth suppression was observed in MCF7 cells treated with 1alpha,25(OH)2-D3 dose-dependently (1-100 nM of 1alpha,25(OH)2-D3), the treatment of 100 nM of 1alpha,25(OH)2-D3 had no effect on the growth of Saos-2 and U2OS cells. The expression of the mac25 gene was up-regulated in MCF7 cells treated with 100 nM of 1alpha,25(OH)2-D3, whereas no transcript of the mac25 gene was detected in Saos-2 and U2OS cells even when they were treated with 100 nM of 1alpha,25(OH)2-D3.

This inhibition can be achieved either by naturally occurring biological proteins or by small molecule compounds. They cause cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis depending upon the specificity and efficacy of the inhibitor in question. We have reported earlier that specific pyridopyrimidines (novel Cdk inhibitors) cause cell cycle arrest in mink lung epithelial cells and the arrest is abrogated by over-expression of Cdk4. In contrast, we show here that one of these inhibitors effectively maintains cell cycle arrest in a leukemic or a breast cancer cell line even after the respective cells over-express an oncogene, either Bcl-2 or cyclin D1. However, in the leukemic cells, Bcl-2 over-expression suppresses apoptosis induced by the pyridopyrimidine. Thus, novel Cdk inhibitors can prove to be useful chemical genetics tools for understanding the underlying mechanisms of growth arrest and/or apoptosis in normal versus tumor cells. This could also lead to the development of improved inhibitors of cell proliferation.","['Soni, R', 'Chaudhuri, B']","['Soni R', 'Chaudhuri B']","['Leicester School of Pharmacy, Hawthorn Building, De Montfort University, The Gateway, Leicester, LE1 9BH, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/physiology']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.18.5.1035 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 May;18(5):1035-40. doi: 10.3892/ijo.18.5.1035.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although they have been shown to prevent apoptotic cell death in certain cell lines, we have previously reported that a novel derivative (HS-1030) of UDCA significantly inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in cancer cells. To develop more effective agents, we synthesized several derivatives, named HS-1183, HS-1199 and HS-1200, based on the structure of UDCA and CDCA, and investigated them for anti-proliferative activity in Jurkat cells, a human leukemic T cell line. Whereas UDCA and CDCA had no significant effects on the growth of Jurkat cells in the concentration range tested, both HS-1199 and HS-1200 completely inhibited the cell proliferation, and HS-1183 showed only a weak inhibitory activity. Furthermore, chromatin condensation, DNA ladder formation and proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were observed after treatment of novel bile acids, indicating the occurrence of apoptotic cell death, which was associated with down-regulation of caspase-3 and -8. The apoptotic manifestations such as PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation were abolished in the presence of the tripeptide caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk or the specific caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-fmk.

Its receptor complex consists of a ligand-binding component, CNTF receptor (CNTFR), associated with two signaling receptor components, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Striking phenotypic differences between CNTF- and CNTFR-deficient mice suggest that CNTFR serves as a receptor for a second developmentally important ligand. We recently demonstrated that cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) associates with the soluble orphan receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF) to form a heterodimeric cytokine that displayed activities only on cells expressing the tripartite CNTF receptor on their surface. In this present study we examined the membrane binding of the CLC/CLF composite cytokine and observed a preferential interaction of the cytokine with the CNTFR subunit. Signaling pathways recruited by the CLC/CLF complex in human neuroblastoma cell lines were also analyzed in detail. The results obtained showed an activation of Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2) leading to a tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp130 and LIFR. The phosphorylated signaling receptors served in turn as docking proteins for signal transducing molecules such as STAT3 and SHP-2. In vitro analysis revealed that the gp130-LIFR pathway could also stimulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In contrast to that reported before for CNTF, soluble CNTFR failed to promote the action CLC/CLF, and an absolute requirement of the membrane form of CNTFR was required to generate a functional response to the composite cytokine. This study reinforces the functional similarity between CNTF and the CLC/CLF composite cytokine defining the second ligand for CNTFR.","['Lelievre, E', 'Plun-Favreau, H', 'Chevalier, S', 'Froger, J', 'Guillet, C', 'Elson, G C', 'Gauchat, J F', 'Gascan, H']","['Lelievre E', 'Plun-Favreau H', 'Chevalier S', 'Froger J', 'Guillet C', 'Elson GC', 'Gauchat JF', 'Gascan H']","[""INSERM EMI-9928, CHU d'Angers, 4 rue Larrey, 49003 Angers, France and the Centre d'Immunologie Pierre Fabre, 5 avenue Napoleon III, 74164 Saint Julien en Genevois, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (cytokine-like factor-1)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M101681200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)78529-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jun 22;276(25):22476-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M101681200.

RNA transcripts are seen predominantly in the brain, and Western analysis shows a major peptide that migrates as a 72-kDa band.

In mesenchymal stem cells, the staining concentrates at nuclear dots that stain positively for the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Expression of SpbetaIVSigma5 fused to green fluorescence protein in cells produces nuclear dots that include all PML bodies, which double in number in transfected cells.

Na+/Pi cotransport activities of the BBM vesicles were also determined. Ischemia caused a significant decrease (about 40%, P < 0.05) in all forms of NaPi-2 in the BBM, despite a significant increase (31+/-3%, P < 0.05) in the Na+/Pi cotransport activity. After reperfusion, both NaPi-2 expression and Na+/Pi cotransport activity returned to control levels. In contrast with Na+/Pi cotransport, ischemia significantly decreased Na+-dependent glucose cotransport but did not affect Na+-dependent proline cotransport. Reperfusion caused further decreases in both Na+/glucose (by 60%) and Na+/proline (by 33%) cotransport. Levels of NaPi-2 were more reduced in the BBM than in cortex homogenates, suggesting a relocalization of NaPi-2 as a result of ischemia. After reperfusion, NaPi-2 levels returned to control values in both BBM and homogenates. These data indicate that the NaPi-2 protein and BBM Na+/Pi cotransport activity respond uniquely to reversible renal ischemia and reperfusion, and thus may play an important role in maintaining and restoring the structure and function of the proximal tubule.","['Xiao, Y', 'Desrosiers, R R', 'Beliveau, R']","['Xiao Y', 'Desrosiers RR', 'Beliveau R']","['Laboratoire de medicine moleculaire, H pital Saint-Justine, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0372712,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc20a1 protein, rat)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Kidney/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microvilli/*metabolism', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Reperfusion Injury/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 2001 Mar;79(3):206-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hybrid viruses that combine the high transduction efficiency of adenoviral vectors and the integrative capacity of other vectors, such as adenoassociated viruses, have been designed. Massive repopulation of the liver by transplanted hepatocytes can be achieved if a mitotic stimulus to the transplanted cells is combined with prevention of proliferation of the host hepatocytes. Treatment with a plant alkaloid or retrorsine, or preparative irradiation of the liver can be used to inhibit host hepatocellular proliferation, while partial hepatectomy, expression of Fas ligand, or thyroid hormone administration can be used as a mitotic stimulus to the transplanted cells.","['Guha, C', 'Roy-Chowdhury, N', 'Jauregui, H', 'Roy-Chowdhury, J']","['Guha C', 'Roy-Chowdhury N', 'Jauregui H', 'Roy-Chowdhury J']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Japan,J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg,Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,9431940,,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hepatocytes/*transplantation', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases/*therapy']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s005340170050 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg. 2001;8(1):51-7. doi: 10.1007/s005340170050.,"['P30-DK 41296/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK 39137/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK 46057/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complications of cytostatic therapy are a cause of extensive research of their pharmacological interactions and side effects. The immunologic and biochemical changes accompanying tumours are the factor that is most responsible for the worsening of the physiology of the host. Regimens containing carnitine and it's acetyl-derivative are used in many cases, among others even for preventing hepatotoxicity. Our hypothesis was to verify the supporting metabolic effects of acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride (ALC) in combined therapy with mitoxantrone (MX) and hepatotoxic cytostatic drugs including alkylating agents. This present report describes the effect of ALC in combination with MX on DBA/2 male mice bearing a transplantable L1210 leukemia resistant to MX. The criterion for evaluation of effect was the length of survival time of experimental animals. The proportional-hazards model quadratic in the drug dose (7) was used for survival time evaluation and optimal dose calculation. The hazard functions and the index of relative hazard were determined using Weibull distribution after logarithmic transformation of the entered data in each particular group. The dose-response curve was represented by a second-degree polynomial without absolute term. The combination therapy revealed that the optimal dose of ALC was 186 mg/kg s.c. This relation is shown in Fig.1. A significant effect of ALC (s.c.) in combined therapy with MX (6 mg/kg i.v.) given to animals bearing an experimental form of leukemia L1210/MX resistant to MX was proven at a level of probability p < or = 0.001. The effect of ALC in monotherapy was not demonstrable.","['Niang, M', 'Melka, M']","['Niang M', 'Melka M']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Charles University Prague, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove. niang@lfhk.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove),Acta medica (Hradec Kralove),9705947,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6DH1W9VH8Q (Acetylcarnitine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acetylcarnitine/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove). 2000;43(4):125-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be useful to investigate the interaction between A beta and mast cells in a simple in vitro model system in order to determine the cellular mechanism by which exposure to A beta peptides results in mast cell degranulation. In the present study, the effect of A beta(1-42) upon the release of granular hexosaminidase and serotonin has been investigated using the cognate rat mast cell line, RBL-2H3. Sensitization of these cells for 1 h with anti-DNP IgE (monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl) results in a large release of hexosaminidase and serotonin due to degranulation when the cells are exposed to DNP-HSA (albumin, human dinitrophenyl). Pretreatment overnight with A beta(1-42) (10 and 30 microM) did not affect either the basal or antigen-stimulated release of hexosaminidase or serotonin. A similar lack of effect of A beta(25-35) and the lipid peroxidation product HNE upon antigen-stimulated release of hexosaminidase or serotonin was also found.

All cases expressed monotypic immunoglobulin light chain, and most were positive for CD5. All t(11;14)-positive neoplasms were CD23- and uniquely positive for cyclin D1. Cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 19; in all 19, the karyotype was complex, indicating clonal evolution and genomic instability. The most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in de novo PLL involved chromosome 7 in 4 cases. Trisomy 12 or add(12p) was present in 4 cases of PLL-HxCLL. We conclude that mature B-cell leukemias with more than 55% prolymphocytes are a heterogeneous group that includes t(11;14)-positive neoplasms, which we suggest are best classified as mantle cell lymphoma. We also suggest that prolymphocytic morphologic features are a common end-stage of transformation for several B-cell neoplasms.","['Schlette, E', 'Bueso-Ramos, C', 'Giles, F', 'Glassman, A', 'Hayes, K', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Schlette E', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Giles F', 'Glassman A', 'Hayes K', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis', 'Trisomy/pathology']",2001/04/11 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/11 10:00'],"['2001/04/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1309/PPK0-TJUK-1UAR-3194 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2001 Apr;115(4):571-81. doi: 10.1309/PPK0-TJUK-1UAR-3194.,,['Am J Clin Pathol. 2001 Nov;116(5):781-2.

The recently proposed World Health Organization (WHO) classification of neoplastic diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues includes a classification of AMLs. The proposed WHO classification of AMLs includes traditional FAB-type categories of disease, as well as additional disease types that correlate with specific cytogenetic findings and AML associated with myelodysplasia. This system includes a large number of disease categories, many of which are of unknown clinical significance, and there seems to be substantial overlap between disease groups in the WHO proposal. Some disease types in the WHO proposal cannot be diagnosed without detailed clinical information, or they are diagnosed only by the cytogenetic findings. In this report, a realistic pathologic classification for AML is proposed that includes disease types that correlate with specific cytogenetic translocations and can be recognized reliably by morphologic evaluation and immunophenotyping and that incorporates the importance of associated myelodysplastic changes.

In this report we demonstrate that the concentration of A-MuLV injected into murine thymi influences the selection of the transformation target. Thus, concentrated A-MuLV gives rise to Thy-1+ B220- thymomas. In contrast, dilute virus induces B220+ thymomas that also express low levels of Thy-1 (Thy-1lo), a phenotype that is similar to marrow-derived progenitor B-lymphoid cells (pro-B cells) that are highly susceptible to A-MuLV transformation in vitro. However, rare B220+ lymphoid cells isolated from normal adult thymi were not transformed by A-MuLV in vitro, while B220+ cells isolated from bone marrow were highly susceptible to transformation by A-MuLV. The Thy-1lo B220+ population in the primary thymomas had not rearranged TCRgamma, TCRbeta, or Igkappa genes, but contained subpopulations that assembled Ig DJ(H) or VDJ(H) genes and were therefore similar to transformed pro- and pre-B cells obtained from A-MuLV infected fetal liver and adult bone marrow, respectively. However, unlike A-MuLV-transformed pro- and pre-B cells, many (40-70%) of the Thy-1lo B220+ transformed thymoma cells had not rearranged Igh genes, and therefore appear to represent undifferentiated lymphoid cells.

Mutants with inactive DNA-PKcs remove the majority of DNA DSBs utilizing a slow, DNA-PKcs-independent pathway that does not utilize genes of the RAD52 epistasis group, is error-prone and can therefore be classified as a form of NHEJ (termed basic or B-NHEJ). We studied the role of DNA ligase IV in these pathways of NHEJ. Although biochemical studies show physical and functional interactions between the DNA-PKcs/Ku and the DNA ligase IV/Xrcc4 complexes suggesting operation within the same pathway, genetic evidence to support this notion is lacking in mammalian cells. Primary human fibroblasts (180BR) with an inactivating mutation in DNA ligase IV, rejoined DNA DSBs predominantly with slow kinetics similar to those observed in cells deficient in DNA-PKcs, or in wild-type cells treated with wortmannin to inactivate DNA-PK. Treatment of 180BR cells with wortmannin had only a small effect on DNA DSB rejoining and no effect on cell radiosensitivity to killing although it sensitized control cells to 180BR levels. This is consistent with DNA ligase IV functioning as a component of the D-NHEJ, and demonstrates the unperturbed operation of the DNA-PKcs-independent pathway (B-NHEJ) at significantly reduced levels of DNA ligase IV. In vitro, extracts of 180BR cells supported end joining of restriction endonuclease-digested plasmid to the same degree as extracts of control cells when tested at 10 mM Mg(2+). At 0.5 mM Mg(2+), where only DNA ligase IV is expected to retain activity, low levels of end joining ( approximately 10% of 10 mM) were seen in the control but there was no detectable activity in 180BR cells. Antibodies raised against DNA ligase IV did not measurably inhibit end joining at 10 mM Mg(2+) in either cell line. Thus, in contrast to the situation in vivo, end joining in vitro is dominated by pathways with properties similar to B-NHEJ that do not display a strong dependence on DNA ligase IV, with D-NHEJ retaining only a limited contribution. The implications of these observations to studies of NHEJ in vivo and in vitro are discussed.","['Wang, H', 'Zeng, Z C', 'Perrault, A R', 'Cheng, X', 'Qin, W', 'Iliakis, G']","['Wang H', 'Zeng ZC', 'Perrault AR', 'Cheng X', 'Qin W', 'Iliakis G']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Experimental Radiation Oncology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIG4 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'DNA Ligase ATP', 'DNA Ligases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Plasmids/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance/drug effects', 'Recombination, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin', 'X-Rays']",2001/04/09 10:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/04/09 10:00'],"['2001/04/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/29.8.1653 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Apr 15;29(8):1653-60. doi: 10.1093/nar/29.8.1653.,"['P30 CA056036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '42026/PHS HHS/United States', '56706/PHS HHS/United States', 'P30-CA56036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC31316,,,,,,,,,,['NASA'],['Non-programmatic'],,,

Membrane fractions prepared from a stably transfected hCD13-positive murine NIH/3T3 cell line were used to immunize BALB/c mice, with the intention that hCD13 would be the major immunogenic molecule recognized by the immune system. Spleen RNA from the immunized mice served to generate a combinatorial scFv phage display library. The library was adsorbed against non-transfected NIH/3T3 or Sf21 insect cells to eliminate nonrelevant binders. The supernatant was then used for panning with either hCD13-transfected Sf21 insect cells or a hCD13-expressing human leukemia-derived cell line. Therefore, the key concepts of the procedure were the presentation of hCD13 as the sole human antigen on murine NIH/3T3 cells and a screening strategy where hCD13 was the major common antigen of the material used for immunization and panning. Two different hCD13-reactive phages were isolated and the soluble scFvs were expressed in E. coli and purified. The two scFvs, anti-hCD13-1 and anti-hCD13-3, differed at four amino acid positions in their V(H) regions and both had high affinities for hCD13 as determined by surface plasmon resonance (K(D)=7 and 33x10(-10) M, respectively). Both efficiently recognized hCD13 on intact cells. Therefore, the procedure allowed the production of high affinity scFvs reacting with a desired antigen in its native conformation without requiring extensive purification of the antigen and should be useful for the preparation of scFvs against other conformation-sensitive cell-surface antigens.","['Peipp, M', 'Simon, N', 'Loichinger, A', 'Baum, W', 'Mahr, K', 'Zunino, S J', 'Fey, G H']","['Peipp M', 'Simon N', 'Loichinger A', 'Baum W', 'Mahr K', 'Zunino SJ', 'Fey GH']","['University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, D 91058, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibody Affinity', 'CD13 Antigens/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Library', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Spodoptera', 'Transfection']",2001/04/09 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/04/09 10:00'],"['2001/04/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0022175901002988 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00298-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2001 May 1;251(1-2):161-76. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00298-8.,,,,,,,PMC7172470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the polymerase chain reaction and primers designed to identify clonal antigen receptor gene rearrangements.

Secondary or reactive thrombocytosis (RT) can be observed in a number of clinical circumstances and may be related to persistent production of some thrombopoietic factors acting on megakaryocytes (MK). The goal of this study is to assess the serum concentrations of these cytokines in control subjects and patients with MPD associated with thrombocythemia, RT, and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ATP). Eleven patients with MPD, five with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), three with polycythemia vera (PCV), two with essential thrombocythemia (ET), one with myelofibrosis, 15 with RT, eight with ATP, and 12 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Serum interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), fibronectin, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and thrombomodulin (TM) were measured in these groups. Interleukin- 1beta, IL-6, and TNF levels were high in patients with RT and ATP, suggesting that these cytokines act on early uncommitted progenitors, promoting commitment along the MK lineage and leading to thrombocytosis or compensation for thrombocytopenia. TM was significantly increased in patients with MPD compared to all other groups, probably indicating the presence of subclinical endothelial damage. Fibronectin levels were high in MPD and RT patients. This finding can be secondary to high platelet turnover in these patients. We found that ICAM-1 levels were high in patients with clonal thrombocytosis. ICAM-1 can be one of the factors initiating the events ultimately leading to clonal thrombocytosis. Thrombocythemia associated with MPD is an autonomous phenomenon not regulated by cytokines.","['Cobankara, V', 'Oran, B', 'Ozatli, D', 'Haznedaroglu, I C', 'Kosar, A', 'Buyukasik, Y', 'Ozcebe, O', 'Dundar, S', 'Kirazli, S']","['Cobankara V', 'Oran B', 'Ozatli D', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Kosar A', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Ozcebe O', 'Dundar S', 'Kirazli S']","['Department of Rheumatology, School of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,9508125,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*blood/physiology', 'Cytokines/*blood/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/complications', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/blood/complications', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/*etiology']",2001/04/09 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/04/09 10:00'],"['2001/04/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/107602960100700209 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 2001 Apr;7(2):126-30. doi: 10.1177/107602960100700209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), a tumor analogue of mucosal mast cells, express the Syt homologues Syt II, Syt III and Syt V Expression of Syt I, the neuronal Ca2+ sensor, in the RBL cells, resulted in its targeting to secretory granules and in prominent potentiation and acceleration of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Syt II is localized to an amine-free lysosomal compartment, which is also subjected to regulated exocytosis. Lysosomal exocytosis is negatively regulated by Syt II: overexpression of Syt II inhibited Ca2+-triggered exocytosis of lysosomes, while suppression of Syt II expression markedly potentiated this release. These findings implicate Syt homologues as key regulators of mast cell function.","['Baram, D', 'Mekori, Y A', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, R']","['Baram D', 'Mekori YA', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (R-SNARE Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SNAP25 protein, human)', '0 (SNARE Proteins)', '0 (Snap25 protein, rat)', '0 (Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '134193-27-4 (Synaptotagmins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Signaling', '*Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Exocytosis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Membrane Lipids/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Phospholipids/physiology', 'R-SNARE Proteins', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'SNARE Proteins', 'Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25', 'Synaptotagmins', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Vesicular Transport Proteins']",2001/04/09 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/04/09 10:00'],"['2001/04/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-065x.2001.790103.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2001 Feb;179:25-34. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-065x.2001.790103.x.,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While cytotoxic in the Brown Norway (BN) rat leukemia model, growth inhibition in other murine and human tumor xenografts is predominantly cytostatic. Its specific mechanism of action remains unknown. Following CI-994 administration, inhibition of both histone deacetylation and cellular proliferation at the G1 to S transition phase of the cell cycle are observed. This Phase 1 study in patients with solid tumors was carried out to determine a maximum tolerated daily oral dose (MTD) for CI-994 administered on a chronic basis. METHODS: Fifty-three patients received CI-994 daily for treatment durations ranging from 2 to 10 weeks. Dosage escalation proceeded in 2 phases; an Acute Dosing Phase (n = 11) to define the MTD for CI-994 administered over 2 weeks and a Chronic Dosing Phase (n = 29) to define the MTD for daily administration for 8 weeks. Upon completion of the Chronic Dosing Phase, a third cohort of patients (n = 13) received CI-994 at the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule with 2 additional single doses of drug administered separated by a 1-week washout to assess the effect of food on CI-994 pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia was dose limiting at the MTD of 8 mg/m2/day for 8 weeks. Other toxicities included fatigue and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and mucositis. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that peak plasma levels and AUC's generally increased with dose and that food intake did not affect the rate or extent of drug absorption. One patient with heavily pre-treated adenocarcinoma of the lung achieved a Partial Response (PR) lasting over 2 years and 3 additional patients achieved Stable Disease (SD), 1 each with non-small cell lung, colorectal, and renal cancer.

This notion is supported by the fact that structurally unrelated drugs antagonize the H1-receptor and provide clinical benefit. However, H1-receptor antagonism may not be their sole mechanism of action in treating allergic rhinitis. On the basis of in vitro and animal experiments, drugs classified as H1-receptor antagonists have long been recognized to have additional pharmacological properties. Most first-generation H1-antihistamines have anticholinergic, sedative, local anaesthetic, and anti-5-HT effects, which might favourably affect the symptoms of the allergic response but also contribute to side-effects. These additional properties are not uniformly distributed among drugs classified as H1-receptor antagonists. Azatadine, for example, inhibits in vitro IgE-mediated histamine and leukotriene (LT) release from mast cells and basophils. In human challenge models, terfenadine, azatadine, and loratadine reduce IgE-mediated histamine release. Cetirizine reduces eosinophilic infiltration at the site of antigen challenge in the skin, but not the nose. In a nasal antigen challenge model, cetirizine pretreatment did not affect the levels of histamine and prostaglandin D2 recovered in postchallenge lavages, whereas the levels of albumin, N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME) esterase activity, and LTs were reduced. Terfenadine, cetirizine, and loratadine blocked allergen-induced hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. In view of the complexity of the pathophysiology of allergy, a number of H1 antagonists with additional properties are currently under development for allergic diseases. Mizolastine, a new H1-receptor antagonist, has been shown to have additional actions that should help reduce the allergic response. In animal models, mizolastine inhibits antigen-induced eosinophil infiltration into mouse skin and into the nasal cavity of guinea-pigs. Mizolastine also significantly inhibits antigen-induced neutrophil infiltration into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of guinea-pigs. In addition, it inhibits arachidonic acid-induced paw oedema in rats without affecting carrageenin-induced rat paw oedema, suggesting an effect on LT generation. In man, mizolastine inhibits early and late antigen-induced soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) levels in skin blisters. It also inhibits anaphylactic release of histamine from rodent mast cells, LTC4 and LTB4 release from mouse bone-marrow-derived mast cells, LTC4 release from rat intestinal mast cells, and 5-lipoxygenase activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils of guinea-pig intestines and rat basophilic leukaemia cells. It is clear that a number of H1-antihistamines have multiple effects on the allergic inflammatory response. It is equally clear that these antiallergic effects are not uniformly shared among all drugs of this class. The assessment of the clinical significance of these results and research regarding the parts of the molecules responsible for these activities are underway.","['Baroody, F M', 'Naclerio, R M']","['Baroody FM', 'Naclerio RM']","['Department of Surgery, Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA. fbaroody@surgery.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine H1)', '244O1F90NA (mizolastine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Receptors, Histamine H1/immunology', 'Rhinitis/drug therapy/immunology']",2001/04/09 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/09 10:00'],"['2001/04/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1398-9995.2000.00803.x [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy. 2000;55 Suppl 64:17-27. doi: 10.1034/j.1398-9995.2000.00803.x.,"['AI45583/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DC 02714/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results suggest that CLL could be associated with distinct class II alleles of the Caucasian haplotype HLA-DR4:DR53:DQ8, which has also been related to a susceptibility for several auto-immune diseases. The positive, though weak, association of CLL with HLA-DPB1*0301 might represent an independent susceptibility factor since no linkage disequilibrium existed with any of the other CLL-associated alleles. None of the previously reported associations with HLA class I antigens was confirmed. Our results suggest that factors within or close to the human MHC class II region confer susceptibility to CLL.","['Machulla, H K', 'Muller, L P', 'Schaaf, A', 'Kujat, G', 'Schonermarck, U', 'Langner, J']","['Machulla HK', 'Muller LP', 'Schaaf A', 'Kujat G', 'Schonermarck U', 'Langner J']","['Interbranch HLA Laboratory, Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin-Luther-University of Halle, Magdeburger Str. 16, D-06097 Halle, Germany. helmut.machulla@medizin.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ8 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR4 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR53)', '0 (HLA-DRB4 Chains)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Germany', 'HLA-DP Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen/*genetics', 'HLA-DRB4 Chains', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0215(200102)9999:9999<::AID-IJC1167>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(200102)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1167>3.0.co;2-a [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Apr 15;92(2):203-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(200102)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1167>3.0.co;2-a.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

MIBI accumulation was classified into three patterns: not detectable, mild accumulation, and clearly visualized accumulation. Clearly visualized accumulation was interpreted as abnormal. The mean uptake ratio of the femoral marrow to muscle was calculated. Forty-five patients who were in complete remission (CR) at the time of MIBI imaging had a follow-up study (mean interval, 23 months). Clearly visualized accumulation was demonstrated in 35 patients with acute leukemia: in 7 patients before starting induction chemotherapy, in 12 patients after relapse, and in 16 of the 49 patients in the CR group. Mild accumulation was demonstrated in 14 patients in the CR group and in 13 control group patients. No detectable accumulation was observed in 19 patients in the CR group and in 97 control patients. The marrow and muscle uptake ratio of patients before starting chemotherapy (2.29 +/- 0.26) was greater compared with that in patients after relapse (1.78 +/- 0.44, P < 0.02) and in patients with abnormal accumulation despite complete remission (1.84 +/- 0.36, P < 0.01). The uptake ratio in patients with abnormal accumulation despite CR was higher compared with patients with mild accumulation in CR (1.26 +/- 0.13, P < 0.001) and controls (1.23 +/- 0.10, P < 0.001) who had mild accumulation. Fifteen patients with abnormal accumulation despite CR had a markedly greater relapse rate (66.7% > 10.0%, P < 0.005), a higher mortality rate (46.7% > 6.7%, P < 0.01), and shorter remission time (8.7 +/- 10.2 months < 35.9 +/- 20.1 months, P < 0.001) compared with 30 patients without abnormal accumulation in CR. MIBI femoral marrow imaging may be a useful and simple method for monitoring levels of residual leukemic cells. Clearly visualized MIBI accumulation may be a marker for relapse.","['Wakasugi, S', 'Ohta, K', 'Hasegawa, Y', 'Tatumi, N', 'Nakamura, H']","['Wakasugi S', 'Ohta K', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Tatumi N', 'Nakamura H']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Nucl Med,Clinical nuclear medicine,7611109,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '971Z4W1S09 (Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Femur/*diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnostic imaging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging', 'Radionuclide Imaging', '*Radiopharmaceuticals/metabolism', '*Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi/metabolism']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003072-200104000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Nucl Med. 2001 Apr;26(4):325-30. doi: 10.1097/00003072-200104000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior studies have described antitumor efficacy in murine tumor models including L-1210 and P-388 leukemias, and B-16 melanoma. The current results extend these cell line observations to human tumors tested in the NCI panel of 56 cell lines, in freshly isolated tumors tested in colony-forming assays in soft agar and in several animal models. In the NCI panel, the overall mean 50% cell kill (LC50) for the unsubstituted azonafide, AMP-1, was 10(-5.53) M, with some selectivity noted in melanomas (10(-6.22) M). The mean LC50 for the 6-ethoxy substituted analog, AMP-53, was 10(-5.53) M, with some selectivity found in non-small cell lung cancer (10(-5.91)) and renal cell carcinoma (10(-5.84)). In freshly isolated human tumors tested in soft agar, there was marked activity (mean IC50 in microg/ml) for AMP-53 in four cell types: breast cancer (0.09), lung cancer (0.06), renal cell carcinomas (0.06) and multiple myeloma (0.03). These effects were superior to doxorubicin and to several other azonafides, including AMP-1, AMP-104 and the 6-hydroxyethoxy derivative, AMP-115. Compound AMP-1 was shown to be superior to amonafide in the mammary 16C breast cancer model in B6CF31 mice, but it had little activity in Colon-38 nor in M5076 ovarian sarcomas in vivo. Nine azonafides were evaluated in the Lewis lung cancer model in C57/bl mice, but only AMP-53 demonstrated significant efficacy with a treated/control x 100% (T/C) value of 30%. Because AMP-53 demonstrated the greatest breadth of activity, it was then evaluated in several human tumor cell lines growing in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). Only three tumors were sensitive (T/C<42%), including HL-60 leukemia (T/C=39%), MCF-7 breast cancer (T/C=39%) and A549 non-small cell lung cancer (T/C=37%). Overall, these results demonstrate that the 6-ethoxy substituted azonafide, AMP-53, has consistent (in vitro and in vivo) experimental antitumor activity in human breast and lung cancer, and could be considered for clinical testing in patients with MDR tumors.","['Dorr, R T', 'Liddil, J D', 'Sami, S M', 'Remers, W', 'Hersh, E M', 'Alberts, D S']","['Dorr RT', 'Liddil JD', 'Sami SM', 'Remers W', 'Hersh EM', 'Alberts DS']","['College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA. rtdorr@azcc.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imides)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (azonafide)', '1Q8D39N37L (amonafide)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imides/*pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Naphthalimides', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Organophosphonates', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200103000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2001 Mar;12(3):213-20. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200103000-00007.,['GM 49875/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is given to donors to mobilize stem cells and to recipients to ensure engraftment. Studies have shown that G-CSF promotes T-helper (Th)-2 immune deviation which, unlike Th1 responses, does not protect against intracellular pathogens and fungi. The effect of administration of G-CSF to recipients of mismatched hematopoietic transplants with respect to transplantation outcome and functional immune recovery was investigated. In 43 patients with acute leukemia who received G-CSF after transplantation, the engraftment rate was 95%. However, the patients had a long-lasting type 2 immune reactivity, ie, Th2-inducing dendritic cells not producing interleukin 12 (IL-12) and high frequencies of IL-4- and IL-10-producing CD4(+) cells not expressing the IL-12 receptor beta(2) chain. Similar immune reactivity patterns were observed on exposure of donor cells to G-CSF. Elimination of postgrafting administration of G-CSF in a subsequent series of 36 patients with acute leukemia, while not adversely affecting engraftment rate (93%), resulted in the anticipated appearance of IL-12-producing dendritic cells (1-3 months after transplantation versus > 12 months in transplant recipients given G-CSF), of CD4(+) cells of a mixed Th0/Th1 phenotype, and of antifungal T-cell reactivity in vitro. Moreover, CD4(+) cell counts increased in significantly less time. Finally, elimination of G-CSF-mediated immune suppression did not significantly increase the incidence of GVHD (< 15%). Thus, this study found that administration of G-CSF to recipients of T-cell-depleted hematopoietic transplants was associated with abnormal antigen-presenting cell functions and T-cell reactivity. Elimination of postgrafting administration of G-CSF prevented immune dysregulation and accelerated functional immune recovery.","['Volpi, I', 'Perruccio, K', 'Tosti, A', 'Capanni, M', 'Ruggeri, L', 'Posati, S', 'Aversa, F', 'Tabilio, A', 'Romani, L', 'Martelli, M F', 'Velardi, A']","['Volpi I', 'Perruccio K', 'Tosti A', 'Capanni M', 'Ruggeri L', 'Posati S', 'Aversa F', 'Tabilio A', 'Romani L', 'Martelli MF', 'Velardi A']","['Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-12)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aspergillus/immunology', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Candida/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Subunits', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-12', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Th2 Cells/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.8.2514 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55777-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2514-21. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.8.2514.,,['Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2194.

Although Myb is a target of retinoic acid, little is known about the mechanisms by which it may contribute to induced growth arrest in leukemia cells. Indeed, few Myb target genes are known to be linked to proliferation. Myeloblastin is involved in the control of proliferation in myeloid leukemia cells. It is expressed early during hematopoiesis and is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-responsive gene. Myeloblastin can confer factor-independent growth to hematopoietic cells, an early step in leukemia transformation. The myeloblastin promoter contains PU.1, C/EBP, and Myb binding sites, each of which are critical for constitutive expression in myeloid cells. Inhibition of myeloblastin expression in leukemia cells growth-arrested by retinoic acid is demonstrated to depend on Myb down-regulation. Myb is shown to induce myeloblastin expression and abolish its down-regulation by retinoic acid. Altogether, the data offer a clue as to how a myeloid-specific transcriptional machinery can be accessible to regulation by retinoic acid and point to myeloblastin as a novel target of Myb. This link between Myb and myeloblastin suggests a previously nonidentified Myb pathway through which growth arrest is induced by retinoic acid in myeloid leukemia cells.","['Lutz, P G', 'Houzel-Charavel, A', 'Moog-Lutz, C', 'Cayre, Y E']","['Lutz PG', 'Houzel-Charavel A', 'Moog-Lutz C', 'Cayre YE']","['Unite INSERM U417, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, myb', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloblastin', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.8.2449 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55770-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2449-56. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.8.2449.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to BCR/ABL, STI571 also inhibits v-Abl, TEL/ABL, the native platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)beta receptor, and c-KIT, but it does not inhibit SRC family kinases, c-FMS, FLT3, the epidermal growth factor receptor, or multiple other tyrosine kinases. ARG is a widely expressed tyrosine kinase that shares substantial sequence identity with c-ABL in the kinase domain and cooperates with ABL to regulate neurulation in the developing mouse embryo. As described here, ARG has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia as a fusion partner of TEL. A TEL/ARG fusion was constructed to determine whether ARG can be inhibited by STI571. When expressed in the factor-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3, the TEL/ARG protein was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins, and induced factor-independent proliferation. The effects of STI571 on Ba/F3 cells transformed with BCR/ABL, TEL/ABL, TEL/PDGFbetaR, or TEL/ARG were then compared. STI571 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation and cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR/ABL, TEL/ABL, TEL/PDGFbetaR, and TEL/ARG with an IC(50) of approximately 0.5 microM in each case, but it had no effect on untransformed Ba/F3 cells growing in IL-3 or on Ba/F3 cells transformed by TEL/JAK2. Culture of TEL/ARG-transfected Ba/F3 cells with IL-3 completely prevented STI571-induced apoptosis in these cells, similar to what has been observed with BCR/ABL- or TEL/ABL-transformed cells.

An internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain-coding sequence of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) is found in 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis. On the other hand, mutations of the c-KIT gene, which have been found in mast cell leukemia and AML, are clustered in 2 distinct regions, the JM domain and D816 within the activation loop. This study was designed to analyze the mutation of D835 of FLT3, which corresponds to D816 of c-KIT, in a large series of human hematologic malignancies. Several kinds of missense mutations were found in 30 of the 429 (7.0%) AML cases, 1 of the 29 (3.4%) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases, and 1 of the 36 (2.8%) acute lymphocytic leukemia patients. The D835Y mutation was most frequently found (22 of the 32 D835 mutations), followed by the D835V (5), and D835H (1), D835E (1), and D835N (1) mutations. Of note is that D835 mutations occurred independently of FLT3/ITD. An analysis in the 201 patients newly diagnosed with AML (excluding M3) revealed that, in contrast to the FLT3/ITD mutation (n = 46), D835 mutations (n = 8) were not significantly related to the leukocytosis, but tended to worsen disease-free survival. All D835-mutant FLT3 were constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and transformed 32D cells, suggesting these mutations were constitutively active. These results demonstrate that the FLT3 gene is the target most frequently mutated to become constitutively active in AML.","['Yamamoto, Y', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Nakano, Y', 'Suzuki, R', 'Kodera, Y', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Asou, N', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Yagasaki, F', 'Shimazaki, C', 'Akiyama, H', 'Saito, K', 'Nishimura, M', 'Motoji, T', 'Shinagawa, K', 'Takeshita, A', 'Saito, H', 'Ueda, R', 'Ohno, R', 'Naoe, T']","['Yamamoto Y', 'Kiyoi H', 'Nakano Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Kodera Y', 'Miyawaki S', 'Asou N', 'Kuriyama K', 'Yagasaki F', 'Shimazaki C', 'Akiyama H', 'Saito K', 'Nishimura M', 'Motoji T', 'Shinagawa K', 'Takeshita A', 'Saito H', 'Ueda R', 'Ohno R', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and the First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid/chemistry', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.8.2434 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55768-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2434-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.8.2434.,,['Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2193A-2193.

A new class of vitamin D(3) analogs, having 2 identical side chains attached to carbon-20, was synthesized and the anticancer effects evaluated. Four analogs were evaluated for their ability to inhibit growth of myeloid leukemia (NB4, HL-60), breast (MCF-7), and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cells. All 4 analogs inhibited growth in a dose-dependent manner. Most effective was 21-(3-methyl-3-hydroxy-butyl)-19-nor D(3) (Gemini-19-nor), which has 2 side chains and removal of the C-19. Gemini-19-nor was approximately 40 625-, 70-, 23-, and 380-fold more potent than 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in inhibiting 50% clonal growth (ED(50)) of NB4, HL-60, MCF-7, and LNCaP cells, respectively. Gemini-19-nor (10(-8) M) strongly induced expression of CD11b and CD14 on HL-60 cells (90%); in contrast, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (10(-8) M) stimulated only 50% expression. Annexin V assay showed that Gemini-19-nor and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. Gemini-19-nor (10(-8) M, 4 days) caused apoptosis in approximately 20% of cells, whereas 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) at the same concentration did not induce apoptosis. Gemini-19-nor increased in HL-60 both the proportion of cells in the G(1)/G(0) phase and expression level of p27(kip1). Moreover, Gemini-19-nor stimulated expression of the potential tumor suppressor, PTEN. Furthermore, other inducers of differentiation, all-trans-retinoic acid and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, increased PTEN expression in HL-60. In summary, Gemini-19-nor strongly inhibited clonal proliferation in various types of cancer cells, especially NB4 cells, suggesting that further studies to explore its anticancer potential are warranted. In addition, PTEN expression appears to parallel terminal differentiation of myeloid cells.","['Hisatake , J', ""O'Kelly, J"", 'Uskokovic, M R', 'Tomoyasu, S', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Hisatake J', ""O'Kelly J"", 'Uskokovic MR', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (21-(3-methyl-3-hydroxybutyl)-19-norvitamin D3)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Calcitriol/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.8.2427 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55767-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2427-33. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.8.2427.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address these issues, leukemia and lymphoma mice were treated with the combination of chemotherapy and systemic immunotherapy with recombinant soluble murine B7-immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules. In this report, 3 murine models were used, a radiation-induced SJL acute myeloid leukemia, a transplantable spontaneous SJL lymphoma, and the C57BL/6 EL-4 thymic lymphoma. Various treatment modalities were evaluated: single treatments with either B7-IgG or chemotherapy as well as combination therapies. The results demonstrate the following: (1) in all tumor models, the combination of chemotherapy and soluble B7-IgGs is more potent than either therapy alone, leading to cure of tumor-bearing animals; (2) the therapeutic responses are T-cell-dependent, because combined therapy is not efficacious in severe combined immunodeficient mice; (3) the rejection of tumor cells leads to the development of tumor-specific immunity, because cured mice are immune to the rejected tumor but not to a different syngeneic tumor; and (4) (51)Cr release assays show that rejection of tumor cells leads to the development of very potent tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that chemotherapy-mediated tumor reduction, together with consequent augmented tumor-antigen presentation to activated T cells, are primary mechanisms leading to curative responses. The safety profile of the B7-IgG fusion proteins and their synergy with chemotherapy strongly suggest that the combination regimen is a promising strategy in cancer treatment.","['Runyon, K', 'Lee, K', 'Zuberek, K', 'Collins, M', 'Leonard, J P', 'Dunussi-Joannopoulos, K']","['Runyon K', 'Lee K', 'Zuberek K', 'Collins M', 'Leonard JP', 'Dunussi-Joannopoulos K']","['Genetics Institute, Wyeth-Ayerst Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Memory', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.8.2420 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55766-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2420-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.8.2420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To directly examine the oncogenic potential of fgfr3, murine bone marrow (BM) cells were transduced with retroviral vectors containing either wild-type fgfr3 or an activated mutant form of the receptor, fgfr3-TD. Mice transplanted with FGFR3-TD-expressing BM developed a marked leukocytosis and lethal hematopoietic cell infiltration of multiple tissues within 6 weeks of transplantation. Secondary and tertiary recipients of spleen or BM from primary fgfr3-TD mice also developed tumors within 6 to 8 weeks. Analysis of the circulating tumor cells revealed a pre-B-cell phenotype in most mice, although immature T-lymphoid or mature myeloid populations also predominated in some animals. Enhanced lymphoid but not myeloid colony formation was observed in the early posttransplantation period and only interleukin 7 and FGF-responsive pre-B-cell lines could be established from tumors. Cell expansions in primary recipients appeared polyclonal, whereas tumors in later passages exhibited either clonal B- or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. Mice transplanted with wild-type FGFR3-expressing BM developed delayed pro-B-cell lymphoma/leukemias approximately 1 year after transplantation.

However, such cell line models may not represent all the features of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) caused by additional genetic abnormalities and differences in the biology of cell lines compared with primary hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells. A primary human hematopoietic progenitor cell model for CML was developed by the transduction of b3a2 BCR/ABL cDNA in normal CD34(+) cells. Adhesion of BCR/ABL-transduced CD34(+) cells to fibronectin was decreased, but migration over fibronectin was enhanced compared with that of mock-transduced CD34(+) cells. Adhesion to fibronectin did not decrease the proliferation of BCR/ABL-transduced CD34(+) cells but decreased the proliferation of mock-transduced CD34(+) cells. This was associated with elevated levels of p27(Kip) in p210(BCR/ABL)-expressing CD34(+) cells. In addition, the presence of p210(BCR/ABL) delayed apoptosis after the withdrawal of cytokines and serum. Finally, significantly more and larger myeloid colony-forming units grew from BCR/ABL than from mock-transduced CD34(+) cells. Thus, the transduction of CD34(+) cells with the b3a2-BCR/ABL cDNA recreates most, if not all, phenotypic abnormalities seen in primary CML CD34(+) cells. This model should prove useful for the study of molecular mechanisms associated with the presence of p210(BCR/ABL) in CML.","['Zhao, R C', 'Jiang, Y', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Zhao RC', 'Jiang Y', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Institute, and Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transfection', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.8.2406 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55764-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2406-12. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.8.2406.,"['R01-CA-74887/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK-53673/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-49930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that overexpression of PU.1 in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells inhibits growth and erythroid differentiation and induces apoptosis of the cells. In an effort to identify target genes of PU.1 concerning these phenomena by using a messenger RNA differential display strategy, we found that some myeloid-specific and lymphoid-specific genes, such as the osteopontin gene, are transcriptionally up-regulated in MEL cells after overexpression of PU.1. We then found that expression of several myelomonocyte-specific genes, including the CAAT-enhancer-binding protein-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor genes, was induced in MEL cells after overexpression of PU.1. B-cell-specific genes were also examined, and expression of the CD19 gene was found to be induced. Expression of the myelomonocyte-specific proteins CD11b and F4/80 antigen but not the B-cell-specific proteins B220 and CD19 was also induced. After overexpression of PU.1, MEL cells became adherent and phagocytic and showed enhanced nitroblue tetrazolium reduction activity. Expression of myelomonocyte-specific and B-cell-specific genes was not induced when a mutant PU.1 with part of the activation domain deleted (a change found to inhibit erythroid differentiation of MEL cells) was expressed. These results indicate that PU.1 induces a lineage switch in MEL cells toward myelomonocytic cells and that its activation domain is essential for this effect. The results also suggest that the pathway of the lineage switch is distinct from that of inhibition of erythroid differentiation in MEL cells.","['Yamada, T', 'Abe, M', 'Higashi, T', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Kihara-Negishi, F', 'Sakurai, T', 'Shirai, T', 'Oikawa, T']","['Yamada T', 'Abe M', 'Higashi T', 'Yamamoto H', 'Kihara-Negishi F', 'Sakurai T', 'Shirai T', 'Oikawa T']","['Department of Cell Genetics, Sasaki Institute, and the Department of Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Cell Size', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Subtraction Technique', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Zinc Compounds/pharmacology']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.8.2300 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55751-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2300-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.8.2300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes encoding CBFbeta (CBFB), and one of the DNA-binding CBFalpha subunits, Runx1 (also known as CBFalpha2, AML1, and PEBP2alphaB), are required for normal hematopoiesis and are also frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias in humans. Homozygous disruption of either the Runx1 or Cbfb gene in mice results in embryonic lethality at midgestation due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system, and severely impairs fetal liver hematopoiesis. Results of this study show that Cbfb-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate into primitive erythroid colonies in vitro, but are impaired in their ability to produce definitive erythroid and myeloid colonies, mimicking the in vivo defect. Definitive hematopoiesis is restored by ectopic expression of full-length Cbfb transgenes, as well as by a transgene encoding only the heterodimerization domain of CBFbeta. In contrast, the CBFbeta-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) fusion protein generated by the inv(16) associated with acute myeloid leukemias (M4Eo) cannot rescue definitive hematopoiesis by Cbfb-deficient ES cells. Sequences responsible for the inability of CBFbeta-SMMHC to rescue definitive hematopoiesis reside in the SMMHC portion of the fusion protein. Results also show that the CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion protein transdominantly inhibits definitive hematopoiesis, but not to the same extent as homozygous loss of Runx1 or Cbfb. CBFbeta-SMMHC preferentially inhibits the differentiation of myeloid lineage cells, while increasing the number of blastlike cells in culture.","['Miller, J D', 'Stacy, T', 'Liu, P P', 'Speck, N A']","['Miller JD', 'Stacy T', 'Liu PP', 'Speck NA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Cbfb protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Subunits', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v97.8.2248 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55745-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Apr 15;97(8):2248-56. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.8.2248.,"['CA75611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA58343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI07363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously developed a monoclonal antibody against a new thymocyte surface antigen, JL1, and showed that JL1 is expressed in the majority of acute leukemia cases. In this study, using multiparameter flow cytometric analyses, we found that JL1 was uniquely expressed in subpopulations of normal bone marrow (BM) cells, implying the association of JL1 with the differentiation and maturation process. Although CD34(+) CD10(+) lymphoid precursors and some of maturing myeloid cells express JL1, neither CD34(+) CD38(-/lo) nor CD34(+) AC133(+) noncommitted pluripotent stem cells do. As for the myeloid precursors, CD34(+) CD33(+) cells do not express JL1. During lymphopoiesis, JL1 on the earliest lymphoid precursors disappear in the CD20(+) sIgM(+) stage of B-cell development or after CD1a down-regulation in thymocytes. Despite the highly restricted expression of JL1 in normal BM cells, most of the leukemias express JL1 irrespective of their immunophenotypes. These results indicate that JL1 is not only a novel differentiation antigen of hematopoietic cells, but also a leukemia-associated antigen. Therefore, we suggest that JL1 be a candidate molecule in acute leukemia for the diagnosis and immunotherapy that spares the normal BM stem cells.","['Shin, Y K', 'Choi, E Y', 'Kim, S H', 'Chung, J', 'Chung, D H', 'Park, W S', 'Jung, K C', 'Kim, H S', 'Park, S', 'Kim, H J', 'Park, M H', 'Min, C K', 'Kim, C C', 'Park, S H']","['Shin YK', 'Choi EY', 'Kim SH', 'Chung J', 'Chung DH', 'Park WS', 'Jung KC', 'Kim HS', 'Park S', 'Kim HJ', 'Park MH', 'Min CK', 'Kim CC', 'Park SH']","['Department of Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 28 Yongon-dong, Chongno-gu, Seoul 110-799, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (JL1 antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/blood/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Fetal Blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*metabolism']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)64098-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64098-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2001 Apr;158(4):1473-80. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64098-9.,,,,,,,PMC1891901,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, highly purified primary human erythroid progenitors were subjected to stimuli known to induce megakaryocytic differentiation in erythroleukemic cells. Remarkably, the primary erythroid progenitors rapidly responded with morphological and immunophenotypic evidence of megakaryocytic differentiation, equivalent to that seen in erythroleukemic cells. Even erythroblasts expressing high levels of hemoglobin manifested partial megakaryocytic differentiation.

We have observed that it is expressed in non-tumoral proliferating human lung fibroblast cells whereas in HeLa cells, a tumoral cell line, ICBP90 was still present even when cells were at confluence. In the present study, we have determined the ICBP90 gene structure by screening of a human placenta genomic library and PCR analysis. We report that the ICBP90 gene spans about 35.8 kb and contains six coding exons named A to F. In the 5' upstream sequence of the region containing the coding exons, two additional exons (I and II) were found. Additionally, an internal splicing site was found in exon A. A promoter region, including three putative Sp1 binding sites between exons I and A, was identified by transient transfection. Northern blot analysis of several cancer cell lines revealed the existence of two ICBP90 mRNA species of 5.1 and 4.3 kb that are transcribed from the gene. The relative amounts of these mRNAs depended on the cell type. In MOLT-4 cells and Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells, the 4.3 kb or the 5.1 kb transcripts were mainly observed, respectively. In other cell lines, such as HL-60 cells, chronic myelogenous leukaemia K-562, lung carcinoma A549, HeLa or colorectal SW480, both 4.3 and 5.1 kb forms of ICBP90 mRNA could be detected. Interestingly, western blot analysis showed several ICBP90 protein bands in HeLa but only a single band in MOLT-4 cell extracts. Taken together our results are consistent with the ICBP90 gene exhibiting alternative splicing and promoter usage in a cell-specific manner.","['Hopfner, R', 'Mousli, M', 'Garnier, J M', 'Redon, R', 'du Manoir, S', 'Chatton, B', 'Ghyselinck, N', 'Oudet, P', 'Bronner, C']","['Hopfner R', 'Mousli M', 'Garnier JM', 'Redon R', 'du Manoir S', 'Chatton B', 'Ghyselinck N', 'Oudet P', 'Bronner C']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale/Universite Louis Pasteur, Communaute Urbaine de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (UHRF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'COS Cells', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genes/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Introns', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111901003717 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00371-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2001 Mar 21;266(1-2):15-23. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00371-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF220266', 'GENBANK/AF220267']",,,,,

The aim of this study was to identify this mast cell growth-enhancing factor (MCGEF) by screening a KCMH-1 cDNA library. We first established a polyclonal antibody raised against the partially purified factor obtained from KCMH-1-conditioned medium which neutralized the MCGEF activity in KCMH-1-conditioned medium. Expression cloning of 1 x 10(6) cDNAs from the KCMH-1 cDNA library led to 16 cDNAs. One of these cloned cDNAs was found to be leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Both LIF produced by COS cells and the recombinant protein obtained commercially showed MCGEF activity when added to mast cell/fibroblast cocultures. MCGEF activity in KCMH-1-conditioned medium was completely neutralized by an anti-LIF monoclonal antibody.

Ubiquitous exposures result from its presence in gasoline vapors, cigarette smoke, and industrial processes. Benzene increases the incidence of leukemia in humans when they are exposed to high doses for extended periods; however, leukemia risks in humans at low exposures are uncertain. The exposure-dose-response relationship of benzene in humans is expected to be nonlinear because benzene undergoes a series of metabolic transformations, detoxifying and activating, in the liver, resulting in multiple metabolites that exert toxic effects on the bone marrow. We developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for the uptake and elimination of benzene in mice to relate the concentration of inhaled and orally administered benzene to the tissue doses of benzene and its key metabolites, benzene oxide, phe nol, and hydroquinone. As many parameter values as possible were taken from the literature; in particular, metabolic parameters obtained from in vitro studies with mouse liver were used since comparable parameters are also available for humans. Parameters estimated by fitting the model to published data were first-order rate constants for pathways lacking in vitro data and the concentrations of microsomal and cytosolic protein, which effectively alter overall enzyme activity. The model was constrained by using the in vitro metabolic parameters (maximum velocities, first-order rate constants, and saturation parameters), and data from multiple laboratories and experiments were used. Despite these constraints and sources of variability, the model simulations matched the data reasonably well in most cases, showing that in vitro metabolic constants can be successfully extrapolated to predict in vivo data for benzene metabolism and dosimetry. Therefore in vitro metabolic constants for humans can subsequently be extrapolated to predict the dosimetry of benzene and its metabolites in humans. This will allow us to better estimate the risks of adverse effects from low-level benzene exposures.","['Cole, C E', 'Tran, H T', 'Schlosser, P M']","['Cole CE', 'Tran HT', 'Schlosser PM']","['CIIT Centers for Health Research, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709-2137, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Toxicol Environ Health A,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

All reported partner genes fused in-frame to MLL and the fusion cDNA encode chimeric MLL proteins with a significant portion derived from the partner genes. We analyzed one patient with de novo acute monoblastic leukemia with t(11;14)(q23;q24) and identified that a human homologue of gephyrin (human gephyrin) fused with MLL. Gephyrin is a rat glycine receptor-associated protein, which forms submembranous complexes and anchor glycine or gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors to microtubules. Alternative splicing of human gephyrin gene created two different forms of fusion cDNA. In one form, human gephyrin gene fused in-frame to MLL exon 9, and the chimeric product had COOH terminus of human gephyrin protein, including the tubulin binding site. In the other, the reading frame terminated shortly after the fusion point. As a result, only seven amino acids with no known function were attached to the NH2 terminus of MLL protein. The functional significance of this de facto truncated MLL gene product is not clear.","['Kuwada, N', 'Kimura, F', 'Matsumura, T', 'Yamashita, T', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Wakimoto, N', 'Ikeda, T', 'Sato, K', 'Motoyoshi, K']","['Kuwada N', 'Kimura F', 'Matsumura T', 'Yamashita T', 'Nakamura Y', 'Wakimoto N', 'Ikeda T', 'Sato K', 'Motoyoshi K']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mllt1 protein, rat)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (gephyrin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 15;61(6):2665-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneous, but not sequential, exposure of U937 cells to 100 nM FP and 10 nM PMA significantly increased apoptosis manifested by characteristic morphological features, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage while markedly inhibiting cellular differentiation, as reflected by diminished plastic adherence and CD11b expression. Enhanced apoptosis in U937 cells was associated with an early caspase-independent increase in cytochrome c release and accompanied by a substantial decline in leukemic cell clonogenicity. Moreover, PMA/FP cotreatment significantly increased apoptosis in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and in U937 cells ectopically expressing the Bcl-2 protein. In U937 cells, coadministration of FP blocked PMA-induced expression and reporter activity of the CDKI p21WAF/CIP1 and triggered caspase-mediated cleavage of the CDKI p27KIP1. Coexposure to FP also resulted in a more pronounced and sustained activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase cascade after PMA treatment, although disruption of this pathway by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 inhibitor U0126 did not prevent potentiation of apoptosis. FP accelerated PMA-mediated dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), an event followed by pRb cleavage culminating in the complete loss of underphosphorylated pRb (approximately Mr 110,000) by 24 h. Finally, gel shift analysis revealed that coadministration of FP with PMA for 8 h led to diminished E2F/pRb binding compared to the effects of PMA alone. Collectively, these findings indicate that FP modulates the expression/activity of multiple signaling and cell cycle regulatory proteins in PMA-treated leukemia cells and that such alterations are associated with mitochondrial damage and apoptosis rather than maturation. These observations also raise the possibility that combining CDKIs and differentiation-inducing agents may represent a novel antileukemic strategy.","['Cartee, L', 'Wang, Z', 'Decker, R H', 'Chellappan, S P', 'Fusaro, G', 'Hirsch, K G', 'Sankala, H M', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Cartee L', 'Wang Z', 'Decker RH', 'Chellappan SP', 'Fusaro G', 'Hirsch KG', 'Sankala HM', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Caspases/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'U937 Cells']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 15;61(6):2583-91.,"['CA 63573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, increasing evidence firmly suggests that the underlying mechanism for anthracycline cytotoxicity is the induction of apoptosis through intracellular-mediated signaling pathways. Whether drug/DNA interaction is necessary for such apoptosis signaling is unknown. We investigated the cellular effects of the anthracyclines daunorubicin (DNR) and doxorubicin (DOX) using the myeloid leukemia cell line U937. By comparing free drug against agarose bead-immobilized drug iDNR and iDOX (which cannot accumulate within the cell), we observed that whereas both free and immobilized anthracyclines were cytotoxic, only the former induced apoptosis; the latter induced necrosis. Indeed, we did not observe ceramide generation, neutral sphingomyelinase activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, or other apoptotic events with iDNR or iDOX. However, both free and immobilized drug were similarly capable of triggering nuclear factor kappaB activation. These observations demonstrate that whereas activation of certain cellular signaling pathways can be achieved solely through membrane interaction, apoptosis signaling requires anthracycline internalization. These results also show that the initiation of cell survival pathways (illustrated by nuclear factor kappaB activation) is independent of intracellular drug/target interaction.","['Maestre, N', 'Tritton, T R', 'Laurent, G', 'Jaffrezou, J P']","['Maestre N', 'Tritton TR', 'Laurent G', 'Jaffrezou JP']","['Institut Nationale de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Ceramides/biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Daunorubicin/*toxicity', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'U937 Cells']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 15;61(6):2558-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These gene fusions arise in utero and are similar to those found in leukemias secondary to chemotherapy with inhibitors of topoisomerase II (topo-II). This has led to the hypothesis that in utero exposures to chemicals may cause IAL via an effect on topo-II. We report a pilot case-control study of IAL across different countries and ethnic groups. Cases (n = 136) were population-based in most centers. Controls (n = 266) were selected from inpatients and outpatients at hospitals serving the same populations. MLL rearrangement status was derived by Southern blot analysis, and maternal exposure data were obtained by interviews using a structured questionnaire. Apart from the use of cigarettes and alcohol, very few mothers reported exposure to known topo-II inhibitors. Significant case-control differences were apparent for ingestion of several groups of drugs, including herbal medicines and drugs classified as ""DNA-damaging,"" and for exposure to pesticides with the last two being largely attributable, respectively, to one nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, dipyrone, and mosquitocidals (including Baygon). Elevated odds ratios were observed for MLL+ve (but not MLL-ve) leukemias (2.31 for DNA-damaging drugs, P = 0.03; 5.84 for dipyrone, P = 0.001; and 9.68 for mosquitocidals, P = 0.003). Although it is unclear at present whether these particular exposures operate via an effect on topo-II, the data suggest that specific chemical exposures of the fetus during pregnancy may cause MLL gene fusions. Given the widespread use of dipyrone, Baygon, and other carbamate-based insecticides in certain settings, confirmation of these apparent associations is urgently required.","['Alexander, F E', 'Patheal, S L', 'Biondi, A', 'Brandalise, S', 'Cabrera, M E', 'Chan, L C', 'Chen, Z', 'Cimino, G', 'Cordoba, J C', 'Gu, L J', 'Hussein, H', 'Ishii, E', 'Kamel, A M', 'Labra, S', 'Magalhaes, I Q', 'Mizutani, S', 'Petridou, E', 'de Oliveira, M P', 'Yuen, P', 'Wiemels, J L', 'Greaves, M F']","['Alexander FE', 'Patheal SL', 'Biondi A', 'Brandalise S', 'Cabrera ME', 'Chan LC', 'Chen Z', 'Cimino G', 'Cordoba JC', 'Gu LJ', 'Hussein H', 'Ishii E', 'Kamel AM', 'Labra S', 'Magalhaes IQ', 'Mizutani S', 'Petridou E', 'de Oliveira MP', 'Yuen P', 'Wiemels JL', 'Greaves MF']","['Department of Public Health Science, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Male', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Risk Factors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 15;61(6):2542-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No single biochemical or clinical parameter can reliably predict patient response to therapy or rapidity of disease progression. Peptide factors involved in major cancer growth pathways, such as tumor angiogenesis, are attractive candidates as markers of low- and high-risk HRPC patients. We analyzed prospectively collected urine specimens from 100 of 390 HRPC patients undergoing therapy with the growth factor antagonist suramin as part of CALGB 9480. Levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were assessed from day 1 of therapy (D1) and day 29 (D29) urine samples from this subset of 100 randomly selected patients. Growth factor levels were determined by standardized ELISA microtiter plate assays from a commercial (bFGF) or proprietary (VEGF) source. Pretreatment urine VEGF levels were predictive of survival. In univariate analysis, patients whose baseline urine VEGF level was < or =28 pg/ml (the median level) had an average survival of 17 months; those with baseline VEGF >28 pg/ml had a significantly shorter survival of 10 months (P = 0.024). This difference corresponded to a 60% increased risk of dying for the higher urine VEGF patients (hazard ratio, 1.62; P = 0.03) and remained significant in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.72, P = 0.02). No significant correlations between urine bFGF level or change in bFGF levels and survival were found.

Molecular quantification of response to therapy by PCR-based methods has been shown to improve risk assessment. Here, we report on the sensitive quantification of leukemia-specific TEL-AML1 fusion transcript levels normalized to beta-actin expression (sensitivity threshholds, 10(-5)) by a novel real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RQ-RT-PCR) based on fluorescent TaqMan technique providing early and rapid evidence on the treatment efficacy of children with initial or relapsed TEL-AML1+ ALL enrolled in frontline or relapse trials of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-Study Group. In initial ALL, TEL-AML1/beta-actin decrease was > or =10(5)-fold in 50% of patients after induction therapy (day 33) and stayed TEL-AML1-negative throughout therapy, which suggested high sensitivity of leukemic cells to antineoplastic therapy. The remaining patients were still TEL-AML1+ before reintensification (ratios, 0.7 x 10(-2):10(-4)). In relapsed ALL, TEL-AML1/beta-actin decrease was generally less pronounced at corresponding time points, and conversion to TEL-AML1 negativity was observed in 40% of patients. Most notably, subsequent relapses occurred only among molecular poor responders, whereas all early responders remain in their second complete remission. In conclusion, real-time quantification of TEL-AML1/beta-actin kinetics distinguishes distinct molecular response groups, and provides indications capable of directing therapeutic interventions for patients with TEL-AML1+ ALL. Before considering modification of therapy, results should be interpreted cautiously taking into account the long duration of remission associated with TEL-AML1+ ALL.","['Seeger, K', 'Kreuzer, K A', 'Lass, U', 'Taube, T', 'Buchwald, D', 'Eckert, C', 'Korner, G', 'Schmidt, C A', 'Henze, G']","['Seeger K', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Lass U', 'Taube T', 'Buchwald D', 'Eckert C', 'Korner G', 'Schmidt CA', 'Henze G']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Otto-Heubner-Centrum Berlin, Germany. karl.seeger@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 15;61(6):2517-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we demonstrated that ADM shows high binding affinity to the cytoplasmic proteasomes of L1210 mouse leukemia cells and that taken up ADM by the cells selectively binds to proteasomes. Nuclear targeting of proteasome in proliferating cells may be mediated by the nuclear localization signals that are found in several of the alpha-type subunits of the 20S proteasome. To confirm nuclear transport of the ADM-proteasome complex, we synthesized a photoactive ADM analogue, N-(p-azidohenzoyl)-ADM, and generated a photoaffinity-labeled proteasome complex. The 26S proteasome purified from the cytosol of L1210 cells had a high affinity to N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-ADM. SDS-PAGE analysis of the photoaffinity-labeled proteasome showed that low molecular weight bands (approximately 21-31 kDa) of 20S proteasome had the highest photoaffinity. The photoaffinity-labeled proteasome was distributed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized L1210 and B-16 mouse melanoma cells in the presence of the cytosolic fraction and ATP. The rate of nuclear translocation of the proteasome was low in the absence of ATP. These results suggest that the proteasome is a specific translocator of ADM from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and that 20S proteasome components are the dominant ADM-binding sites. The nuclear transport of ADM-proteasome complex is regulated by an ATP-dependent nuclear pore-mediated mechanism.","['Kiyomiya, K', 'Matsuo, S', 'Kurebe, M']","['Kiyomiya K', 'Matsuo S', 'Kurebe M']","['Department of Toxicology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan. kiyomiya@vet.osakafu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Affinity Labels/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Multienzyme Complexes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 15;61(6):2467-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In J2E erythroleukemic cells, Lyn coimmunoprecipitated with numerous proteins, including SHP-1, SHP-2, ras-GTPase-activating protein, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 5a, STAT5b, and mitogen-activated protein kinase; however, introduction of a dominant-negative Lyn (Y397F Lyn) inhibited the interaction of Lyn with all of these molecules except SHP-1. Cells containing the dominant-negative Lyn displayed altered intracellular phosphorylation patterns, including mitogen-actiated protein kinase, but not erythropoietin receptor, Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 2, or STAT5. As a consequence, erythropoietin-initiated differentiation and basal proliferation were severely impaired. Y397F Lyn reduced the protein levels of erythroid transcription factors erythroid Kruppel-like factor and GATA-1 up to 90%, which accounts for the inability of J2E cells expressing Y397F Lyn to synthesize hemoglobin. Although Lyn was shown to bind several sites on the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor, it was not activated when a receptor mutated at the JAK2 binding site was ectopically expressed in J2E cells indicating that JAK2 is the primary kinase in erythropoietin signaling and that Lyn is a secondary kinase. In normal erythroid progenitors, erythropoietin enhanced phosphorylation of Lyn; moreover, exogenous Lyn increased colony forming unit-erythroid, but not burst forming uniterythroid, colonies from normal progenitors, demonstrating a stage-specific effect of the kinase. Significantly, altering Lyn activity in J2E cells had a profound effect on the development of erythroleukemias in vivo: the mortality rate was markedly reduced and latent period extended when either wild-type Lyn or Y397F Lyn was introduced into these cells. Taken together, these data show that Lyn plays an important role in intracellular signaling in nontransformed and leukemic erythroid cells.","['Tilbrook, P A', 'Palmer, G A', 'Bittorf, T', 'McCarthy, D J', 'Wright, M J', 'Sarna, M K', 'Linnekin, D', 'Cull, V S', 'Williams, J H', 'Ingley, E', 'Schneider-Mergener, J', 'Krystal, G', 'Klinken, S P']","['Tilbrook PA', 'Palmer GA', 'Bittorf T', 'McCarthy DJ', 'Wright MJ', 'Sarna MK', 'Linnekin D', 'Cull VS', 'Williams JH', 'Ingley E', 'Schneider-Mergener J', 'Krystal G', 'Klinken SP']","['Laboratory for Cancer Medicine, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research, Royal Perth Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/*enzymology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Liver/cytology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 15;61(6):2453-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BMI-1 gene has been located on chromosome 10p13, a region involved in chromosomal translocations in infant leukemias, and amplified in occasional non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) and solid tumors. To determine the possible alterations of this gene in human malignancies, we have examined 160 lymphoproliferative disorders, 13 myeloid leukemias, and 89 carcinomas by Southern blot analysis and detected BMI-1 gene amplification (3- to 7-fold) in 4 of 36 (11%) mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) with no alterations in the INK4a/ARF locus. BMI-1 and p16INK4a mRNA and protein expression were also studied by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot, respectively, in a subset of NHLs. BMI-1 expression was significantly higher in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and MCL than in follicular lymphoma and large B cell lymphoma. The four tumors with gene amplification showed significantly higher mRNA levels than other MCLs and NHLs with the BMI-1 gene in germline configuration. Five additional MCLs also showed very high mRNA levels without gene amplification. A good correlation between BMI-1 mRNA levels and protein expression was observed in all types of lymphomas. No relationship was detected between BMI-1 and p16INK4a mRNA levels. These findings suggest that BMI-1 gene alterations in human neoplasms are uncommon, but they may contribute to the pathogenesis in a subset of malignant lymphomas, particularly of mantle cell type.","['Bea, S', 'Tort, F', 'Pinyol, M', 'Puig, X', 'Hernandez, L', 'Hernandez, S', 'Fernandez, P L', 'van Lohuizen, M', 'Colomer, D', 'Campo, E']","['Bea S', 'Tort F', 'Pinyol M', 'Puig X', 'Hernandez L', 'Hernandez S', 'Fernandez PL', 'van Lohuizen M', 'Colomer D', 'Campo E']","[""The Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Anatomic Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/04/06 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/06 10:00'],"['2001/04/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 15;61(6):2409-12.,,['Cancer Res. 2002 Jan 15;62(2):618-9.

Here, we report that murine bone marrow-derived DCs can be activated in vitro by exogenous signals received from apoptotic leukemia cells expressing on the cell surface a model tumor-associated antigen.

By single sustained skin contact, aqueous GA solutions of > or =45% are of moderate acute percutaneous toxicity, those of 25% are of slight toxicity and those of </=15% do not present an acute percutaneous hazard. Vapor generated at ambient temperature may cause sensory irritant effects to the eye and respiratory tract, but not acute respiratory tract injury. The 50% decrease in respiratory rate (rd(50)) is 13.86 ppm. A 0.1% solution of GA is not irritating to the eye; the threshold for conjunctival irritation is 0.2% and for corneal injury it is 1.0%. Eye injury is moderate at 2% and severe at > or =5%. Primary skin irritation depends on the duration and contact site, occlusion and solvent. By sustained contact, the threshold for skin irritation is 1%, above which erythema and edema are dose related. With 45% and higher, skin corrosion may occur. There is a low incidence of skin sensitizing reactions, with an eliciting threshold of 0.5% aqueous GA. However, GA is neither phototoxic nor photosensitizing. Subchronic repeated exposure studies by the peroral route show only renal physiological compensatory effects, secondary to reduced water consumption. Repeated skin contact shows only minor skin irritant effects without systemic toxicity. By subchronic vapor exposure, effects are limited to the nasal mucosa at 1.0 ppm, with a no-effect concentration generally at 0.1 ppm. There is no evidence for systemic target organ or tissue toxicity by subchronic repeated exposure by any route. A chronic drinking water study showed an apparent increase, in females only, of large granular cell lymphocytic leukemia but this was not dosage related. This is most likely the result of a modifying effect on the factor(s) responsible for the expression of this commonly occurring rat neoplasm. A chronic (2-year) inhalation toxicity/oncogenicity study showed inflammatory changes in the anterior nasal cavity but no neoplasms or systemic toxicity. In vitro genotoxicity studies--bacterial mutagenicity, forward gene mutation (HGPRT and TK loci), sister chromatid exchange, chromosome aberration, UDS and DNA repair tests--have given variable results, ranging from no effect through to weak positive. In vivo genotoxicity studies--micronucleus, chromosome aberration, dominant lethal and Drosophila tests--generally have shown no activity but one mouse intraperitoneal study showed bone marrow cell chromosome aberrations. Developmental toxicity studies show GA not to be teratogenic, and a two-generation study showed no adverse reproductive effects. Percutaneous pharmacokinetic studies showed low skin penetration, with lowest values measured in vitro in rats and human skin. Overexposure of humans produces typical sensory irritant effects on the eye, skin and respiratory tract. Some reports have described an asthmatic-like reaction by overexposure to GA vapor. In most cases this resembles reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, and the role of immune mechanisms is uncertain. Local mucosal effects may occur if medical instruments or endoscopes are not adequately decontaminated. Protection of individuals from the potential adverse effects of GA exposure requires that there be adequate protection of the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. The airborne concentration of GA vapor should be kept below the recommended safe exposure level (e.g. the threshold limit value) by the use of engineering controls. Those who work with GA should, through a training program, be aware of the properties of GA, its potential adverse effects, how to handle the material safely and how to deal with accidental situations involving GA. If effects develop in exposed workers, the reasons should be determined immediately and corrective methods initiated.

METHODS: In this dose-escalating pilot study, 58 patients were treated with STI571; 38 patients had a myeloid blast crisis and 20 had ALL or a lymphoid blast crisis. Treatment was given orally at daily doses ranging from 300 to 1000 mg. RESULTS: Responses occurred in 21 of 38 patients (55 percent) with a myeloid-blast-crisis phenotype; 4 of these 21 patients had a complete hematologic response. Of 20 patients with a lymphoid blast crisis or ALL, 14 (70 percent) had a response, including 4 who had complete responses. Seven patients with a myeloid blast crisis continue to receive treatment and remain in remission from 101 to 349 days after starting the treatment. All but one patient with a lymphoid blast crisis or ALL has relapsed. The most frequent adverse effects were nausea, vomiting, edema, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 is well tolerated and has substantial activity in the blast crises of CML and in Ph-positive ALL.","['Druker, B J', 'Sawyers, C L', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Resta, D J', 'Reese, S F', 'Ford, J M', 'Capdeville, R', 'Talpaz, M']","['Druker BJ', 'Sawyers CL', 'Kantarjian H', 'Resta DJ', 'Reese SF', 'Ford JM', 'Capdeville R', 'Talpaz M']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201, USA. drukerb@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/blood/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Pilot Projects', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['MJBA-441402 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJM200104053441402 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2001 Apr 5;344(14):1038-42. doi: 10.1056/NEJM200104053441402.,"['CA32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['N Engl J Med. 2001 Apr 5;344(14):1084-6.

Since tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the transforming function of BCR-ABL, an inhibitor of the kinase could be an effective treatment for CML. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalating trial of STI571 (formerly known as CGP 57148B), a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. STI571 was administered orally to 83 patients with CML in the chronic phase in whom treatment with interferon alfa had failed. Patients were successively assigned to 1 of 14 doses ranging from 25 to 1000 mg per day. RESULTS: Adverse effects of STI571 were minimal; the most common were nausea, myalgias, edema, and diarrhea. A maximal tolerated dose was not identified. Complete hematologic responses were observed in 53 of 54 patients treated with daily doses of 300 mg or more and typically occurred in the first four weeks of therapy. Of the 54 patients treated with doses of 300 mg or more, cytogenetic responses occurred in 29, including 17 (31 percent of the 54 patients who received this dose) with major responses (0 to 35 percent of cells in metaphase positive for the Philadelphia chromosome); 7 of these patients had complete cytogenetic remissions. CONCLUSIONS: STI571 is well tolerated and has significant antileukemic activity in patients with CML in whom treatment with interferon alfa had failed. Our results provide evidence of the essential role of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity in CML and demonstrate the potential for the development of anticancer drugs based on the specific molecular abnormality present in a human cancer.","['Druker, B J', 'Talpaz, M', 'Resta, D J', 'Peng, B', 'Buchdunger, E', 'Ford, J M', 'Lydon, N B', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Capdeville, R', 'Ohno-Jones, S', 'Sawyers, C L']","['Druker BJ', 'Talpaz M', 'Resta DJ', 'Peng B', 'Buchdunger E', 'Ford JM', 'Lydon NB', 'Kantarjian H', 'Capdeville R', 'Ohno-Jones S', 'Sawyers CL']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201, USA. drukerb@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Benzamides', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM200104053441401 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2001 Apr 5;344(14):1031-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM200104053441401.,"['CA32727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['N Engl J Med. 2001 Apr 5;344(14):1084-6.

In humans, PNP is the only route for degradation of deoxyguanosine, and genetic deficiency of this enzyme leads to profound T cell-mediated immunosuppression. This study reports the biological effects and mechanism of action of Imm-H on malignant T cell lines and on normal activated human peripheral T cells. Imm-H inhibits the growth of malignant T cell leukemia lines with the induction of apoptosis. Imm-H also inhibits activated normal human T cells after antigenic stimulation in vitro. However, Imm-H did not inhibit malignant B cells, colon cancer cell lines, or normal human nonstimulated T cells, demonstrating the selective activity of Imm-H. The effects on leukemia cells were mediated by the cellular phosphorylation of deoxyguanosine and the accumulation of dGTP, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase. Cells were protected from the toxic effects of Imm-H when deoxyguanosine was absent or when deoxycytidine was present. Guanosine incorporation into nucleic acids was selectively blocked by Imm-H with no effect on guanine, adenine, adenosine, or deoxycytidine incorporation. Imm-H may have clinical potential for treatment of human T cell leukemia and lymphoma and for other diseases characterized by abnormal activation of T lymphocytes. The design of Imm-H from an enzymatic transition-state analysis exemplifies a powerful approach for developing high-affinity enzyme inhibitors with pharmacologic activity.","['Kicska, G A', 'Long, L', 'Horig, H', 'Fairchild, C', 'Tyler, P C', 'Furneaux, R H', 'Schramm, V L', 'Kaufman, H L']","['Kicska GA', 'Long L', 'Horig H', 'Fairchild C', 'Tyler PC', 'Furneaux RH', 'Schramm VL', 'Kaufman HL']","['Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Deoxyguanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '426X066ELK (forodesine)', '8C2O37Y44Q (deoxyguanosine triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Deoxyguanine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Purine Nucleosides', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.071050798 [doi]', '071050798 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Apr 10;98(8):4593-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.071050798.

However, little is known about the pathophysiology of the latent period and the reservoir organs where polyclonal proliferation of cells harboring integrated provirus occurs. The availability of animal models would be useful to analyze the latent period of HTLV-1 infection. At 18 months after HTLV-1 infection of C3H/HeJ mice inoculated with the MT-2 cell line, which is an HTLV-1-producing human T-cell line, HTLV-1 provirus was detected in spleen DNA from eight of nine mice. No more than around 100 proviruses were found per 10(5) spleen cells. Cellular sequences flanking the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) and the clonalities of the cells which harbor integrated HTLV-1 provirus were analyzed by linker-mediated PCR. The results showed that the flanking sequences are of mouse genome origin and that polyclonal proliferation of the spleen cells harboring integrated HTLV-1 provirus had occurred in three mice. A sequence flanking the 5' LTR was isolated from one of the mice and revealed the presence of a 6-nucleotide duplication of cellular sequences, consistent with typical retroviral integration. Moreover, PCR was performed on DNA from infected tissues, with LTR primers and primers derived from seven novel flanking sequences of the three mice. Data revealed that the expected PCR products were found from lymphatic tissues of the same mouse, suggesting that the lymphatic tissues were the reservoir organs for the infected and proliferating cell clones. The mouse model described here should be useful for analysis of the carrier state of HTLV-1 infection in humans.","['Tanaka, M', 'Sun, B', 'Fang, J', 'Nitta, T', 'Yoshida, T', 'Kohtoh, S', 'Kikukawa, H', 'Hanai, S', 'Uchida, K', 'Miwa, M']","['Tanaka M', 'Sun B', 'Fang J', 'Nitta T', 'Yoshida T', 'Kohtoh S', 'Kikukawa H', 'Hanai S', 'Uchida K', 'Miwa M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Oncology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (pX protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Viral', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription Factors', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', '*Virus Integration', '*Virus Latency']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.9.4420-4423.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 May;75(9):4420-3. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.9.4420-4423.2001.,,,,,,,PMC114189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral titers of these chimeras indicate that exchange with homologous sequences could be tolerated, up to V17eco/T15ampho (crossover III). Constructs encoding the first 28 amino acids (aa) of ecotropic M-MuLV resulted in Env expression and binding to the receptor; however, the virus titer was reduced 5- to 45-fold, indicating a postbinding block. Additional exchange beyond the first 28 aa of ecotropic MuLV Env resulted in defective protein expression. These N-terminal chimeras were also introduced into the AE4 chimeric Env backbone containing the amphotropic receptor binding domain joined at the hinge region to the ecotropic SU C terminus. In this backbone, introduction of the first 17 aa of the ecotropic Env protein significantly increased the titer compared to that of its parental chimera AE4, implying a functional coordination between the N terminus of SU and the C terminus of the SU and/or transmembrane proteins. These data functionally dissect the N-terminal sequence of the MuLV Env protein and identify differential effects on receptor-mediated entry.","['Lu, C W', 'Roth, M J']","['Lu CW', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.9.4357-4366.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 May;75(9):4357-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.9.4357-4366.2001.,"['R01 CA049932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA49932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC114180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BPV1 L2 bound in vitro via its C-terminal 85 residues to purified L1 capsomers, but not with intact L1 virus-like particles in vitro. However, when the efficiency of BPV1 L1 coimmunoprecipitation with a series of BPV1 L2 deletion mutants was examined in vivo, the results suggested that residues 129 to 246 and 384 to 460 contain independent L1 interaction domains. An L2 mutant lacking the C-terminal L1 interaction domain was impaired for encapsidation of the viral genome. Coexpression of BPV1 L1 and a chimeric L2 protein composed of HPV16 L2 residues 1 to 98 fused to BPV1 L2 residues 99 to 469 generated infectious virions. However, inefficient encapsidation was seen when L1 was coexpressed with either BPV1 L2 with residues 91 to 246 deleted or with BPV1 L2 with residues 1 to 225 replaced with HPV16 L2. Impaired genome encapsidation did not correlate closely with impairment of the L2 proteins either to localize to promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic domains (PODs) or to induce localization of L1 or E2 to PODs. We conclude that the L1-binding domain located near the C terminus of L2 may bind L1 prior to completion of capsid assembly, and that both L1-binding domains of L2 are required for efficient encapsidation of the viral genome.","['Okun, M M', 'Day, P M', 'Greenstone, H L', 'Booy, F P', 'Lowy, D R', 'Schiller, J T', 'Roden, R B']","['Okun MM', 'Day PM', 'Greenstone HL', 'Booy FP', 'Lowy DR', 'Schiller JT', 'Roden RB']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (L1 protein, Bovine papillomavirus)', '0 (L2 protein, Bovine papillomavirus)', '0 (L2 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Bovine papillomavirus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Capsid/genetics/*metabolism', '*Capsid Proteins', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', '*Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Papillomaviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Virus Assembly/*physiology']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.9.4332-4342.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 May;75(9):4332-42. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.9.4332-4342.2001.,,,,,,,PMC114178,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although lentivirus vectors are efficiently pseudotyped by Env proteins from several different subtypes of murine leukemia virus (MuLV), the related protein from gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) does not form functional pseudotypes. We have determined that this arises because of an inability of GaLV Env to be incorporated into lentivirus vector particles. By exploiting the homology between the GaLV and MuLV Env proteins, we have mapped the determinants of incompatibility in the GaLV Env. Three modifications that allowed GaLV Env to pseudotype human immunodeficiency virus type 1 particles were identified: removal of the R peptide (C-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain), replacement of the whole cytoplasmic tail with the corresponding MuLV region, and mutation of two residues upstream of the R peptide cleavage site. In addition, we have previously proposed that removal of the R peptide from MuLV Env proteins enhances their fusogenicity by transmitting a conformational change to the ectodomain of the protein (Y. Zhao et al., J. Virol. 72:5392-5398, 1998). Our analysis of chimeric MuLV/GaLV Env proteins provides further evidence in support of this model and suggests that proper Env function involves both interactions within the cytoplasmic tail and more long-range interactions between the cytoplasmic tail, the membrane-spanning region, and the ectodomain of the protein.","['Christodoulopoulos, I', 'Cannon, P M']","['Christodoulopoulos I', 'Cannon PM']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, Norris Cancer Center, and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (R peptide)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hominidae', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Virion/metabolism']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.9.4129-4138.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 May;75(9):4129-38. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.9.4129-4138.2001.,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC114158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have described the development of recombinant parvovirus B19 vectors with which high-efficiency, erythroid lineage-restricted transduction can be achieved (S. Ponnazhagan, K. A. Weigel, S. P. Raikwar, P. Mukherjee, M. C. Yoder, and A. Srivastava, J. Virol. 72:5224-5230, 1998). However, since a low-level transduction of nonerythroid cells could also be detected and since P antigen is expressed in nonerythroid cells, we reevaluated the role of P antigen in the viral binding and entry into cells. Cell surface expression analyses revealed that approximately 75% of primary human bone marrow mononuclear erythroid cells and approximately 31% of cells in the nonerythroid population were positive for P antigen. Two human erythroleukemia cell lines, HEL and K562, and a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, were also examined for P antigen expression and binding and entry of the vector. HEL and K562 cells showed intermediate levels, whereas HL-60 cells demonstrated high levels of expression of P antigen. However, the efficiency of vector binding to these cells did not correlate with P antigen expression. Moreover, despite P antigen positivity and efficient viral binding, HEL, K562, and HL-60 cells could not be transduced with the vector. Low levels of P antigen expression could also be detected in two primary cell types, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF). In addition, vector binding occurred in both cell types and was inhibited by globoside, indicating the involvement of P antigen in virus binding to these cells. These primary cells could be efficiently transduced with the recombinant vector. These data suggest that (i) P antigen is expressed on a variety of cell types and is involved in binding of parvovirus B19 to human cells, (ii) the level of P antigen expression does not correlate with the efficiency of viral binding, (iii) P antigen is necessary but not sufficient for parvovirus B19 entry into cells, and (iv) parvovirus B19 vectors can be used to transduce HUVEC and NHLF. These studies further suggest the existence of a putative cellular coreceptor for efficient entry of parvovirus B19 into human cells.","['Weigel-Kelley, K A', 'Yoder, M C', 'Srivastava, A']","['Weigel-Kelley KA', 'Yoder MC', 'Srivastava A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Walther Cancer Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202-5120, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/metabolism/*physiology', 'Dependovirus/physiology', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism/*physiology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.9.4110-4116.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 May;75(9):4110-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.9.4110-4116.2001.,"['R01 HL058881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-58881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC114156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This resulted in the expression of the chimeric HIP1/PDGFbetaR protein, which oligomerizes, is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, and transforms the Ba/F3 murine hematopoietic cell line to interleukin-3-independent growth. Tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kDa protein (p130) correlates with transformation by HIP1/PDGFbetaR and related transforming mutants. We report here that the p130 band is immunologically related to the 125-kDa isoform of the Src homology 2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase, SHIP1. We have found that SHIP1 associates and colocalizes with the HIP1/PDGFbetaR fusion protein and related transforming mutants. These mutants include a mutant that has eight Src homology 2-binding phosphotyrosines mutated to phenylalanine. In contrast, SHIP1 does not associate with H/P(KI), the kinase-dead form of HIP1/PDGFbetaR. We also report that phosphorylation of SHIP1 by HIP1/PDGFbetaR does not change its 5-phosphatase-specific activity. This suggests that phosphorylation and possible PDGFbetaR-mediated sequestration of SHIP1 from its substrates (PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and Ins(1,3,4,5)P(4)) might alter the levels of these inositol-containing signal transduction molecules, resulting in activation of downstream effectors of cellular proliferation and/or survival.","['Saint-Dic, D', 'Chang, S C', 'Taylor, G S', 'Provot, M M', 'Ross, T S']","['Saint-Dic D', 'Chang SC', 'Taylor GS', 'Provot MM', 'Ross TS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Huntington Disease/genetics', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'src Homology Domains']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M008336200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)78681-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jun 15;276(24):21192-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M008336200.

While Ca(2+) influx is important for many biological processes, little is known about the types of SOCs, the nature of the depletion signal, or how the SOCs are activated. We recently showed that in addition to the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, both Jurkat T cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells express novel store-operated nonselective cation channels that we termed Ca(2+) release-activated nonselective cation (CRANC) channels. Here we demonstrate that activation of both CRAC and CRANC channels is accelerated by a soluble Ca(2+) influx factor (CIF). In addition, CRANC channels in inside-out plasma membrane patches are directly activated upon exposure of their cytoplasmic side to highly purified CIF preparations. Furthermore, CRANC channels are also directly activated by diacylglycerol. These results strongly suggest that the Ca(2+) store-depletion signal is a diffusible molecule and that at least some SOCs may have dual activation mechanisms.","['Su, Z', 'Csutora, P', 'Hunton, D', 'Shoemaker, R L', 'Marchase, R B', 'Blalock, J E']","['Su Z', 'Csutora P', 'Hunton D', 'Shoemaker RL', 'Marchase RB', 'Blalock JE']","['Departments of Physiology and Biophysics, Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Chronic bz exposure in vivo increases the frequency of aneuploid circulating lymphocytes in humans. However, there is no information about persistence of bz-associated aneuploidy in immature/primitive cells, at risk of leukemic transformation, after bz exposure in vivo. We explored the relationship between the induction and persistence of aneuploidy in primitive hemopoietic cells from mice that received oral doses of bz in vivo. Short- and long-term persistence of aneuploidy were evaluated in immature/primitive sub-populations (Lin(-)c-kit(+)Sca-1(+)), as well as lymphoid and myeloid cells, 6 days and 2-8 months after exposure. Mice receiving bz in a corn oil carrier, or corn oil alone, both have increased aneuploidy frequencies (1-5%, compared to <1% in untreated controls) in all sub-populations, 6 days after exposure. However, unlike bz-induced aneuploidy, corn oil-induced aneusomies are transient, with frequencies returning to background levels in lymphoid and myeloid cells, 9 weeks after exposure. The frequency (5-9%) of aneuploid lymphocytes and myeloid cells is higher at 9 weeks than at 6 days, suggesting that bz disrupts chromosomal segregation in differentiated cells and/or progenitors. About 8 months after bz exposure, the Lin(-)c-kit(+)Sca-1(+) sub-population contains up to 14% aneuploid cells with numerical chromosomal aberrations affecting chromosomes 2 or 11. These data demonstrate that bz induces DNA copy number changes in immature/primitive cells, and that these changes persist for long periods. Although, initial exposures are not leukemogenic, subsequent exposures of cells to genotoxins or oxidative radicals that induce additional genetic hits may increase the risk of transformation. The contribution of bz-induced aneuploidy in immature/primitive cells to leukemogenesis remains to be determined.","['Giver, C R', 'Wong, R', 'Moore, D H 2nd', 'Pallavicini, M G']","['Giver CR', 'Wong R', 'Moore DH 2nd', 'Pallavicini MG']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Radiation Oncology, Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco 94143, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/06/06 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1383571801001383 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00138-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2001 Apr 5;491(1-2):127-38. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00138-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between April 1983 and December 1997, 141 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in its first chronic phase received a bone marrow transplant from a matched sibling donor (n = 96) or an HLA-A,B/DRB1-matched unrelated donor (n = 45). The median age of matched sibling donor recipients was 38 years (range, 8 to 56 years) and of unrelated donor recipients was 35 years (range, 3 to 53 years; P = 0.03). The median follow-up was 6 years (range, 1 to 15 years) in matched sibling donor recipients and 5 years (range, 2 to 10 years) in unrelated donor recipients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the 5-year survival rates of matched sibling donor recipients [58%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 48% to 68%] and unrelated donor recipients (53%; 95% CI, 39% to 67%; P = 0.4). Among patients who underwent transplantation within 1 year after diagnosis, the 5-year survival rate of matched sibling donor recipients (76%; 95% CI, 65% to 87%) was not significantly different (P = 0.5) from that of unrelated donor recipients (70%; 95% CI, 52% to 88%). In multiple regression analysis, longer time from diagnosis to transplantation, T-cell depletion, and grades III or IV graft versus host disease were independently associated with poorer survival. Transplantation of unrelated donor bone marrow was not associated with mortality (relative risk, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6 to 2.1; P = 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of bone marrow from a matched sibling donor or an HLA-A,B/DRB1-matched unrelated donor produces equivalent outcomes in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, particularly if the transplant takes place within 1 year after diagnosis.","['Davies, S M', 'DeFor, T E', 'McGlave, P B', 'Miller, J S', 'Verfaillie, C M', 'Wagner, J E', 'Weisdorf, D J']","['Davies SM', 'DeFor TE', 'McGlave PB', 'Miller JS', 'Verfaillie CM', 'Wagner JE', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-B Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9343(01)00629-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(01)00629-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 2001 Apr 1;110(5):339-46. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(01)00629-5.,['CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Am J Med. 2001 Apr 1;110(5):404-5.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 11 patients with acute leukemia or primary intracerebral neoplasms undergoing irradiation with the standardized helmet technique, three-dimensional isodose distributions were evaluated with special respect to the dose to the cribriform plate and the ocular lenses. RESULTS: The average dose received by 95% of the cribriform plate with the standardized helmet technique was 85% of the prescribed dose. To enclose the cribriform plate by the 95% isodose (according to the ICRU 50 report) with a 10-mm safety margin allowing for deviations during treatment planning and delivery, the eye block had to be moved in the ventrocaudal direction with an average vector length of 13.6 mm.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1960 to 1991, 1524 pts with HD, Clinical Stage (CS) I--IV have been treated at the UFH. Overall treatment consisted of radiation alone (RT, 36%), chemotherapy alone (CHT, 21%), or both (RT + CHT, 43%). The cumulative probability (CP) of SMT, SST, and L was calculated for the whole series and for the different clinical and therapeutic subgroups, and the results compared with uni- and multivariate analysis (""internal"" comparison, IC). Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for different SMT types (estimated on the basis of gender, age, period specific incidence rates of the general population) have been also calculated (""external"" comparison, EC). The impact of the SMT-related mortality on the survival of the entire series has been estimated. RESULTS: A 14.9% 20-year CP of SMT was registered, along with a SIR of 2.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2--2.5). Both IC and EC showed a statistically significant relationship between L incidence and treatment with CHT, alone or in combination with RT. A significant excess of breast cancers has been observed in RT-treated patients with longer follow-up (SIR, 2.9); an excess of other common SST (lung, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas) is evident in pts treated with either RT, RT + CHT, or CHT. The actuarial long-term survival of the series would have been better of about 3%, in absence of the SMT mortality possibly due to HD treatment, which is almost equally divided between patients treated with RT alone, CHT alone, and RT + CHT. CONCLUSIONS: SMT represent an important late event in HD long-term survivors. The relationship between L and treatment with CHT seems to be the most clearly defined. The effect of SMT on the survival of the entire series, although not negligible, does not seem to justify by itself substantial alterations in the current standards for the treatment of HD at presentation.","['Cellai, E', 'Magrini, S M', 'Masala, G', 'Alterini, R', 'Costantini, A S', 'Rigacci, L', 'Olmastroni, L', 'Papi, M G', 'Spediacci, M A', 'Innocenti, F', 'Bellesi, G', 'Ferrini, P R', 'Biti, G']","['Cellai E', 'Magrini SM', 'Masala G', 'Alterini R', 'Costantini AS', 'Rigacci L', 'Olmastroni L', 'Papi MG', 'Spediacci MA', 'Innocenti F', 'Bellesi G', 'Ferrini PR', 'Biti G']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Florence University Hospital, Florence, Italy. e.cellai@dfc.unifi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(00)01513-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(00)01513-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Apr 1;49(5):1327-37. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(00)01513-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This concerns whether in rural areas (where the prevalence of susceptible individuals is likely to be higher) the risk is greater among the young children of men whose work involves contacts with many different people, particularly children, as noted in certain childhood infections. A positive trend was found in rural areas across 3 levels of increasing paternal occupational contact (as recorded at birth) by each of 2 previously defined classifications; no such effect was found in urban areas. The rural trend was more marked in that part of the study period with greater population mixing, but the difference from the period with less mixing was not itself significant, leaving open whether these rural findings reflect the extreme isolation of much of rural Scotland, or the effects in such areas of a degree of population mixing. In marked contrast, among the 850 cases and 2492 controls aged 5-14, those in rural areas in the higher population mixing period showed a significantly decreasing trend with increasing paternal occupational contact level. This would be consistent with immunity produced either by earlier infection at ages 0-4 years, or directly by low doses of the infective agent that were largely immunizing at these older ages. The findings overall provide further support for infection underlying childhood leukaemia and for the role of adults.","['Kinlen, L J', 'Bramald, S']","['Kinlen LJ', 'Bramald S']","['Department of Public Health, CRC Cancer Epidemiology Research Group, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, OX2 6HE, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Occupations', '*Parents', '*Rural Population', 'Scotland/epidemiology']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/bjoc.2001.1694 [doi]', 'S0007092001916945 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Apr 6;84(7):1002-7. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2001.1694.,,,,,,,PMC2363850,,['Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The reason for this increase in survival may be due to interference with the mechanism involved in the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR). In order to test this hypothesis, we induced resistance to doxorubicin in the K562 cell line by growing cells in increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (10-30 nM) in the presence and absence of dexrazoxane (20 nM). The doxorubicin sensitivity of all resultant sublines was measured using the MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to assess the MDR1 phenotype, measuring P-glycoprotein expression with MRK 16 antibody and drug accumulation in the presence and absence of PSC 833 for functional P-glycoprotein. Long-term growth in doxorubicin increased the cellular resistance (IC(50)) of K562 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (r(2 )= 0.908). Doxorubicin resistance was not induced in the presence of dexrazoxane (P< 0.0001) for several months. In parallel, the expression of functional P-glycoprotein was delayed after concomitant addition of dexrazoxane to the selecting medium (P< 0.001). Dexrazoxane did not act as a conventional modulator of P-glycoprotein. These results suggest that dexrazoxane may delay the development of MDR1, thus allowing responders to the FAC regime to continue to respond.","['Sargent, J M', 'Williamson, C J', 'Yardley, C', 'Taylor, C G', 'Hellmann, K']","['Sargent JM', 'Williamson CJ', 'Yardley C', 'Taylor CG', 'Hellmann K']","['Haematology Research, Pembury Hospital, Pembury, Kent TN2 4QJ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Razoxane/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/bjoc.2001.1697 [doi]', 'S0007092001916970 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Apr 6;84(7):959-64. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2001.1697.,,,,,,,PMC2363849,,['Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Very low dose of ionizing radiation also induces mechanisms whereby cell or tissue become better fit to cope with subsequent exposures of high doses. This phenomenon of low dose radiation is termed 'adaptive response'. This response has been reported to be true in many biological systems and confirmed by experiments on chromosomal and chromatid aberrations, micronucleus formation, sister chromatid exchange tests, DNA mutation and cell survival study and using many other biological end points, although there are quite a few exceptions. The adaptation induced by low doses of radiation has been attributed to the induction of an efficient chromosome break repair mechanism at molecular and biochemical level. It is also substantiated in whole animal systems. When mice are initially conditioned with very small adapting doses, incidence of a challenging dose induced thymic lymphoma is recorded, with delayed latency and reduced frequency. Similarly, appearance of a transplanted barcl-95 thymic tumor has been delayed when mice are preconditioned with a small dose of radiation. Appearance and development of a tumour following transplantation of in vitro irradiated barcl-95 tumour cells with a small dose of 1 cGy are also delayed and volume of the tumour is reduced. Latency period of radiation-induced leukemia is modified by prior treatment with an adapting dose of radiation. Neoplastic transformation of several human cultured cells is also significantly decreased by prior low dose exposure of radiation compared to non-exposed cells. These results indicate that an earlier exposure to a small dose of radiation also reduces the radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Various aspects of molecular mechanism underlying the radio-adaptation have been explained. However, the mechanism underlying the inhibition of carcinogenesis by low dose radiation is yet to be fully resolved.","['Bhattacharjee, D', 'Ito, A']","['Bhattacharjee D', 'Ito A']","['Department of Cancer Research, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological/*radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*physiopathology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Thymus Neoplasms/physiopathology']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/08/09 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/09 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 2001 Jan-Feb;15(1):87-92.,,,,,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 38,721 deaths among white and black hairdressers and barbers of both sexes, 9495 were from all malignant neoplasms. Mortality odds ratios were significantly elevated for all malignant neoplasms, lung cancer, and all lymphatic and hemopoietic cancers among black and white female hairdressers. White female hairdressers had significant excess mortality from cancers of the stomach, colon, pancreas, breast, and bladder and from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphoid leukemia; mortality from these cancers was also elevated among black female hairdressers. White male hairdressers had significantly elevated mortality from non-melanoma skin cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Mortality from all malignant neoplasms, although significantly elevated among both white and black female hairdressers, was significantly below the null for white male hairdressers. Black and white male barbers had significantly elevated mortality from stomach and pharyngeal cancer, respectively. A significant deficit in mortality from all neoplasms and cancers of the pancreas, lung, and prostate was noted for white male barbers. This large study of cancer mortality among hairdressers and barbers showed some differences in mortality patterns by gender and race. Further studies are required to determine if specific occupational exposures may explain some of the elevated cancer rates.","['Lamba, A B', 'Ward, M H', 'Weeks, J L', 'Dosemeci, M']","['Lamba AB', 'Ward MH', 'Weeks JL', 'Dosemeci M']","['Dennison Associates Inc., Falls Church, Va, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Occup Environ Med,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,9504688,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Barbering', '*Beauty Culture', 'Blacks', 'Death Certificates', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Occupations', 'United States', 'Whites']",2001/04/05 10:00,2001/07/31 10:01,['2001/04/05 10:00'],"['2001/04/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043764-200103000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,J Occup Environ Med. 2001 Mar;43(3):250-8. doi: 10.1097/00043764-200103000-00013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
