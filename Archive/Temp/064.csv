We describe four different rearrangements of the erythropoietin receptor gene EPOR in Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) ALL. All of these rearrangements result in truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of EPOR at residues similar to those mutated in primary familial congenital polycythemia, with preservation of the proximal tyrosine essential for receptor activation and loss of distal regulatory residues. This resulted in deregulated EPOR expression, hypersensitivity to erythropoietin stimulation, and heightened JAK-STAT activation. Expression of truncated EPOR in mouse B cell progenitors induced ALL in vivo. Human leukemic cells with EPOR rearrangements were sensitive to JAK-STAT inhibition, suggesting a therapeutic option in high-risk ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

SM antagonize inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins and simultaneously induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion to render cancers sensitive to TNF-induced killing. To enhance SM efficacy, we screened kinase inhibitors for their ability to increase TNF production of SM-treated cells. We showed that p38 inhibitors increased TNF induced by SM. Unexpectedly, even though p38 is required for Toll-like receptors to induce TNF, loss of p38 or its downstream kinase MK2 increased induction of TNF by SM. Hence, we show that the p38/MK2 axis can inhibit or promote TNF production, depending on the stimulus.

In total, 1529 subjects <60 years were randomized to receive: (1) a first course of induction therapy with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HAM) or with standard-dose cytarabine, daunorubicin and 6-thioguanine (TAD) followed by a second course of HAM; (2) granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or no G-CSF before induction and consolidation courses; and (3) high-dose therapy and an autotransplant or maintenance chemotherapy. In total, 1846 subjects 60 years were randomized to receive: (1) a first induction course of HAM or TAD and second induction course of HAM (if they had bone marrow blasts 5% after the first course); and (2) G-CSF or no G-CSF as above. Median follow-up was 7.4 years (range, 1 day to 14.7 years). Five-year event-free survivals (EFSs) for subjects receiving a first induction course of HAM vs TAD were 17% (95% confidence interval, 15, 18%) vs 16% (95% confidence interval 14, 18%; P=0.719). Five-year EFSs for subjects randomized to receive or not receive G-CSF were 19% (95% confidence interval 16, 21%) vs 16% (95% confidence interval 14, 19%; P=0.266). Five-year relapse-free survivals (RFSs) for subjects <60 years receiving an autotransplant vs maintenance therapy were 43% (95% confidence interval 40, 47%) vs 40 (95% confidence interval 35, 44%; P=0.535).

Here, we showed that EPCs are mobilized from the bone marrow (BM) to the peripheral blood at early stages of multiple myeloma (MM); and recruited to MM cell-colonized BM niches. Using EPC-defective ID1+/- ID3-/- mice, we found that MM tumor progression is dependent on EPC trafficking. By performing RNA-sequencing studies, we confirmed that endothelial cells can enhance proliferation and favor cell-cycle progression only in MM clones that are smoldering-like and have dependency on endothelial cells for tumor growth. We further confirmed that angiogenic dependency occurs early and not late during tumor progression in MM. By using a VEGFR2 antibody with anti-vasculogenic activity, we demonstrated that early targeting of EPCs delays tumor progression, while using the same agent at late stages of tumor progression is ineffective. Thus, although there is significant angiogenesis in myeloma, the dependency of the tumor cells on EPCs and vasculogenesis may actually precede this step. Manipulating vasculogenesis at an early stage of disease may be examined in clinical trials in patients with smoldering MM, and other hematological malignancies with precursor conditions.",,"['Moschetta, M', 'Mishima, Y', 'Kawano, Y', 'Manier, S', 'Paiva, B', 'Palomera, L', 'Aljawai, Y', 'Calcinotto, A', 'Unitt, C', 'Sahin, I', 'Sacco, A', 'Glavey, S', 'Shi, J', 'Reagan, M R', 'Prosper, F', 'Bellone, M', 'Chesi, M', 'Bergsagel, L P', 'Vacca, A', 'Roccaro, A M', 'Ghobrial, I M']","['Moschetta M', 'Mishima Y', 'Kawano Y', 'Manier S', 'Paiva B', 'Palomera L', 'Aljawai Y', 'Calcinotto A', 'Unitt C', 'Sahin I', 'Sacco A', 'Glavey S', 'Shi J', 'Reagan MR', 'Prosper F', 'Bellone M', 'Chesi M', 'Bergsagel LP', 'Vacca A', 'Roccaro AM', 'Ghobrial IM']","['Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy.', 'Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigaciones Medicas Aplicadas (CIMA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Zaragoza.

However, little is known about lysosomes and LMP in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Owing to drug resistance and toxicity in CLL patients, better treatment strategies are required. Our results show that CLL cells were sensitive to the lysosomotropic agent siramesine. Furthermore, this drug was more effective in CLL cells, regardless of prognostic factors, compared with normal B cells. Siramesine caused LMP, lipid peroxidation and transcription factor EB nuclear translocation followed by mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species release. Siramesine-induced cell death was blocked by lipid antioxidants, but not by soluble antioxidants or protease inhibitors. To determine whether CLL cells had altered lysosomes, we investigated sphingolipid metabolism as the lysosome is a hub for lipid metabolism. We found that CLL cells had more lysosomes, increased sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1 (SPP1) expression, and increased levels of sphingosine compared with normal B cells. Raising sphingosine levels increased LMP and cell death in CLL cells, but not in normal B cells. Together, these results show that excess sphingosine in CLL cells could contribute to their sensitivity toward LMP. Thus, targeting the lysosome could be a novel therapeutic strategy in CLL.",,"['Dielschneider, R F', 'Eisenstat, H', 'Mi, S', 'Curtis, J M', 'Xiao, W', 'Johnston, J B', 'Gibson, S B']","['Dielschneider RF', 'Eisenstat H', 'Mi S', 'Curtis JM', 'Xiao W', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson SB']","['Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology (formerly Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology), CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology (formerly Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology), CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology (formerly Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology), CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology (formerly Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology), CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology (formerly Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology), CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lu 28-179)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (SGPP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Membranes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/metabolism', 'Spiro Compounds/pharmacology']",,,2016/02/10 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/02/10 06:00'],"['2015/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20164 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Jun;30(6):1290-300. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.4.

The patient presented at age 28 with lymphocytosis, mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and massive splenomegaly, for which a splenectomy was performed. He was then followed expectantly. Over the next two decades, he suffered two symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia-related events. The first occurred twelve years after diagnosis (at age 40) when the patient developed fevers, night sweats, and moderate anemia. He was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The patient declined conventional therapy in favor of a diet, exercise, and supplement regimen, and recovered from the autoimmune hemolytic anemia though the underlying chronic lymphocytic leukemia remained evident. This is the first published case report of ""spontaneous"" recovery from secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemia in an adult. Over the second decade following chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis, serial bone marrow biopsies demonstrated increasing lymphocytosis, with minimal peripheral lymphocytosis. However, twenty years after diagnosis, peripheral lymphocytosis accelerated, with white blood cell counts rising to 55,000/microL. Because the patient continued to refuse conventional therapy, he was treated instead with a supplement regimen that included high doses of epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a green tea extract. Peripheral lymphocytosis resolved. More remarkably, a bone marrow examination, including flow cytometry, showed no evidence of a malignant clone. Two years later (at age 51), the peripheral blood and bone marrow were without molecular evidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or any malignancy.

Disease relapse after initial remission remains one of the most pressing therapeutic challenges in the treatment of AML. Relapsed disease is often resistant to cytarabine and subsequent salvage therapy is ineffective. Recent studies have shown that some microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with prognosis, but have not yet explored the role of miRNAs in cellular response to cytarabine. We identified 20 miRNAs that associate with the in vitro cytarabine chemo-sensitivity or apoptotic response of eight AML cell lines. Out of the 20 miRNAs, data on 18 miRNAs was available in AML patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Our stepwise-integrated analyses (step 1 - miRNA-target mRNA that were significantly correlated in AML patients; step 2 - mRNAs from step 1 with significant association with overall survival (OS)) identified 23 unique miRNA-mRNA pairs predictive of OS in AML patients. As expected HOX genes (HOXA9, HOXB7, and HOXA10) were identified to be regulated by miRs as well as predictive of worse OS. Additionally, miR107-Myb, miR-378-granzyme B involved in granzyme signaling and miR10a-MAP4K4 were identified to be predictive of outcome through integrated analysis. Although additional functional validations to establish clinical/pharmacologic importance of miRNA-mRNA pairs are needed, our results from RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed binding of miR-10a, miR-378, and miR-107 with their target genes GALNT1, GZMB, and MYB, respectively.

Tandem bromodomains selectively tether BET proteins to chromatin by engaging cognate acetylated histone marks, and the extraterminal (ET) domain is the focal point for recruiting a range of cellular and viral proteins. BET proteins guide gamma-retroviral integration to transcription start sites and enhancers through bimodal interaction with chromatin and the gamma-retroviral integrase (IN). We report the NMR-derived solution structure of the Brd4 ET domain bound to a conserved peptide sequence from the C terminus of murine leukemia virus (MLV) IN. The complex reveals a protein-protein interaction governed by the binding-coupled folding of disordered regions in both interacting partners to form a well-structured intermolecular three-stranded beta sheet. In addition, we show that a peptide comprising the ET binding motif (EBM) of MLV IN can disrupt the cognate interaction of Brd4 with NSD3, and that substitutions of Brd4 ET residues essential for binding MLV IN also impair interaction of Brd4 with a number of cellular partners involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. This suggests that gamma-retroviruses have evolved the EBM to mimic a cognate interaction motif to achieve effective integration in host chromatin. Collectively, our findings identify key structural features of the ET domain of Brd4 that allow for interactions with both cellular and viral proteins.",,"['Crowe, Brandon L', 'Larue, Ross C', 'Yuan, Chunhua', 'Hess, Sonja', 'Kvaratskhelia, Mamuka', 'Foster, Mark P']","['Crowe BL', 'Larue RC', 'Yuan C', 'Hess S', 'Kvaratskhelia M', 'Foster MP']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Center for Retrovirus Research and College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Campus Chemical Instrument Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Proteome Exploration Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research and College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; foster.281@osu.edu.']",['eng'],"['R21 AI124463/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI062520/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI124463/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI062520/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI109522/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Humans', 'Integrases/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4776507,,2016/02/10 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2016/02/10 06:00'],"['2016/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1516813113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1516813113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Feb 23;113(8):2086-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1516813113.

The CD38 molecule, with its high expression on multiple myeloma cells, appears a suitable target for antibody therapy. Prompted by this, we used three different CD38 antibody sequences to generate second-generation retroviral CD38-chimeric antigen receptor constructs with which we transduced T cells from healthy donors and multiple myeloma patients. We then evaluated the preclinical efficacy and safety of the transduced T cells. Irrespective of the donor and antibody sequence, CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells proliferated, produced inflammatory cytokines and effectively lysed malignant cell lines and primary malignant cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and multi-drug resistant multiple myeloma in a cell-dose, and CD38-dependent manner, despite becoming CD38-negative during culture. CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells also displayed significant anti-tumor effects in a xenotransplant model, in which multiple myeloma tumors were grown in a human bone marrow-like microenvironment. CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells also appeared to lyse the CD38(+) fractions of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, and to a lesser extent T and B cells but did not inhibit the outgrowth of progenitor cells into various myeloid lineages and, furthermore, were effectively controllable with a caspase-9-based suicide gene.

Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the neurodevelopmental trajectory in this vulnerable population. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the St. Jude Total Therapy Study XV, which omitted prophylactic cranial radiation therapy in all patients, completed comprehensive neuropsychological assessments at induction (n = 142), end of maintenance (n = 243), and 2 years after completion of therapy (n = 211). We report on longitudinal change in neurocognitive function and predictors of neurocognitive outcomes 2 years after completing therapy. RESULTS: Neurocognitive function was largely age appropriate 2 years after completing therapy; however, the overall group demonstrated significant attention deficits and a significantly greater frequency of learning problems as compared with national normative data (all P </= .005). Higher-intensity CNS-directed chemotherapy conferred elevated risk for difficulties in attention, processing speed, and academics (all P </= .01). The rate and direction of change in performance and caregiver-reported attention difficulties differed significantly by age at diagnosis and sex. End-of-therapy attention problems predicted lower academic scores 2 years later, with small to moderate effect sizes ( vertical liner vertical line= 0.17 to 0.25, all P </= .05). CONCLUSION: Two years after chemotherapy-only treatment, neurocognitive function is largely age appropriate.

We investigated the mechanism by which histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors targeted RAD51 and HR to sensitize acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells to sapacitabine. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified the role of HDACs in silencing miR-182 in AML. Immunoblotting, gene expression, overexpression, or inhibition of miR-182 and luciferase assays established that miR-182 directly targeted RAD51. HR reporter assays, apoptotic assays, and colony-forming assays established that the miR-182, as well as the HDAC inhibition-mediated decreases in RAD51 inhibited HR repair and sensitized cells to sapacitabine. RESULTS: The gene repressors, HDAC1 and HDAC2, became recruited to the promoter of miR-182 to silence its expression in AML. HDAC inhibition induced miR-182 in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. miR-182 targeted RAD51 protein both in luciferase assays and in AML cells. Overexpression of miR-182, as well as HDAC inhibition-mediated induction of miR-182 were linked to time- and dose-dependent decreases in the levels of RAD51, an inhibition of HR, increased levels of residual damage, and decreased survival after exposure to double-strand damage-inducing agents. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings define the mechanism by which HDAC inhibition induces miR-182 to target RAD51 and highlights a novel pharmacologic strategy that compromises the ability of AML cells to conduct HR, thereby sensitizing AML cells to DNA-damaging agents that activate HR as a repair and potential resistance mechanism.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with CMML-1 were included without regard to previous therapy. Key exclusion criteria included an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.25 x 10(3) cells/dL and a platelet count <35 x 10(3) cells/dL. Four cohorts were enrolled using a ""rolling six"" study design, with doses ranging from 5 to 20 mg twice daily of ruxolitinib in 5-mg dose escalations. RESULTS: Between March 2013 and January 2015, 20 patients were enrolled and treated with ruxolitinib. Seventy percent of patients had the proliferative subtype and 47% had higher risk disease by the Global MD Anderson Scoring System. Eight patients (42%) received a prior hypomethylating agent. No dose-limiting toxicities for ruxolitinib were identified. One subject had grade (G)3 thrombocytopenia with no other drug-associated G3 or G4 adverse events. The mean duration of therapy was 122 days (range, 28-409 days). Four had hematologic improvement and one patient had a partial response per 2006 International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Five of 9 patients with splenomegaly had a reduction in spleen size. Ten of 11 patients with reported disease-related symptoms had clinically meaningful or complete resolution. When combining IWG and spleen responses, a total response rate of 35% (n = 7) was identified. Correlative analysis demonstrated a reduction in inflammatory cytokines and GM-CSF-dependent STAT5 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase II dose of ruxolitinib is 20 mg twice daily. We demonstrate that ruxolitinib has promising activity in CMML with particular benefit in those with disease-related B symptoms that warrants further study. Clin Cancer Res; 22(15); 3746-54.

Mice lacking CLC:CLF-1 die soon after birth due to a suckling defect and show reduced numbers of motor neurons. Humans carrying mutations in CLC:CLF-1 develop similar disorders, known as Sohar-Crisponi or cold-induced sweating syndrome, and have a high risk of early death. It is well known that CLC binds the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha (CNTFRalpha) and is a prerequisite for signaling through the gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta (LIFRbeta) heterodimer, whereas CLF-1 serves to promote the cellular release of CLC. However, the precise role of CLF-1 is unclear. Here, we report that CLF-1, based on its binding site for CLC and on two additional and independent sites for CNTFRalpha and sorLA, is a key player in CLC and CNTFRalpha signaling and turnover. The site for CNTFRalpha enables CLF-1 to promote CLC:CNTFRalpha complex formation and signaling. The second site establishes a link between the endocytic receptor sorLA and the tripartite CLC:CLF-1:CNTFRalpha complex and allows sorLA to downregulate the CNTFRalpha pool in stimulated cells. Finally, sorLA may bind and concentrate the tripartite soluble CLC:CLF-1:CNTFRalpha complex on cell membranes and thus facilitate its signaling through gp130/LIFRbeta.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Larsen et al.'],"['Larsen, Jakob Vejby', 'Kristensen, Anders Mejer', 'Pallesen, Lone Tjener', 'Bauer, Johannes', 'Vaegter, Christian Bjerggaard', 'Nielsen, Morten Schallburg', 'Madsen, Peder', 'Petersen, Claus Munck']","['Larsen JV', 'Kristensen AM', 'Pallesen LT', 'Bauer J', 'Vaegter CB', 'Nielsen MS', 'Madsen P', 'Petersen CM']","['The MIND Center, Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark jvl@biomed.au.dk cmp@biomed.au.dk.', 'The MIND Center, Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The MIND Center, Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The MIND Center, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The MIND Center, Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The MIND Center, Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The MIND Center, Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The MIND Center, Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark jvl@biomed.au.dk cmp@biomed.au.dk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (LDL-Receptor Related Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (SORL1 protein, human)', '0 (cardiotrophin-like cytokine)', '0 (cytokine-like factor-1)']",IM,"['Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'LDL-Receptor Related Proteins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC4836274,,2016/02/10 06:00,2016/09/13 06:00,['2016/02/10 06:00'],"['2015/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00917-15 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00917-15 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2016 Mar 31;36(8):1272-86. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00917-15.

Methods Oral mucosal biopsies, blood and swabs were collected from cats presenting with oral lesions. The tissue sections were submitted for histopathology and immunohistochemical analysis for feline calicivirus (FCV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). The swabs were subjected to PCR analysis for FCV, and blood for FeLV and FIV. Results The main clinical findings were dysphagia (88.2%), halitosis (76.5%), sialorrhea (47.1%), weight loss (41.2%), intense oral discomfort (35.3%), oral hemorrhage (17.6%), and lackluster and fragile coat (11.8%). Gross inspection revealed bilateral lesions across the palatoglossal fold to the lateral tongue base. The lesions were diffuse, proliferative, intensely red and friable, and bled easily upon examination in 80.8% of cases. In 23.1% of cases, the lesions were multifocal to coalescent, at times forming multiple vesicles on a reddened, edematous palatoglossal fold. Microscopic examination showed that 15.4% of lesions had moderate (grade 2) and 84.6% had severe (grade 3) inflammation. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of FeLV antigens in the epithelium and the inflammatory infiltrate of 30.8% of the cats with FCG. FCV antigens were not detected in the FCG lesions. Conclusions and relevance The FCG cases analyzed could not be correlated with FCV.

The advent of UCB transplantation (UCBT) using two grafts successfully circumvents this obstacle, despite the engraftment of only one unit. Preclinical models suggested that the addition of UCB T cells at the time of transplant can enhance engraftment. We tested whether ex vivo activation by CD3/CD28 costimulation and expansion of T cells from a single UCB graft would be safe and feasible in adults with advanced hematologic malignancies, with an overall objective of optimizing engraftment in single unit UCBT. In this phase 1 study, recipients of single UCB units were eligible if the unit was stored in two adequate fractions. Dose limiting toxicity was defined as grade 3 or grade 4 GVHD within 90 days of UCBT. Four patients underwent UCBT; all were treated at the first dose level (10(5) cells/kg). At the 10(5) cells/kg dose level two subjects experienced grade 3 intestinal GVHD, thus meeting stopping criteria. For three subjects, neutrophil engraftment was early (12, 17, and 20 days), while one subject experienced primary graft failure. We observed early donor T cell trafficking and found that expanded T cells produced supraphysiologic levels of cytokines relevant to engraftment and to lymphoid differentiation and function. Taken together, these preliminary data suggest rapid engraftment in recipients of a single UCBT combined with relatively low doses of activated T cells, though potentially complicated by severe GVHD.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hexner, Elizabeth O', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Reshef, Ran', 'Jeschke, Grace R', 'Mangan, James K', 'Frey, Noelle V', 'Frank, Dale M', 'Richman, Lee P',

Eighteen one-month-old mice were divided into 6 groups and sacrificed separately at 45 minutes, 2 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after 0.1Gy X-ray irradiation (mice without receiving ionizing irradiation served as control). After perfusion fixation, testes were removed, sectioned, and followed by staining of gammaH2AX, 53BP1, Caspase 3, and promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) for analysis among the different groups. The staining was observed by immunofluorescence visualized by confocal laser scanning. After low-dose irradiation, only 53BP1, but not Caspase3 or gammaH2AX was upregulated in PLZF positive SSCs within 45 minutes. The expression level of 53BP1 gradually decreased 24 hours after irradiation. Moreover, low-dose irradiation had no effect on the cell number and apoptotic status of SSCs. However other spermatogenic cells highly expressed gammaH2AX shortly after irradiation which was dramatically reduced following the events of DNA repair. It appears that low-dose ionizing irradiation may cause the DNA DSB of mouse spermatogenic cells. 53BP1, but not gammaH2AX, is involved in the DNA repair for DSB in SSCs. Our data indicates that 53BP1 plays an important role in the pathophysiological repair of DNA DSB in SSCs. This may open a new avenue to understanding the mechanisms of DNA repair of SSCs and male infertility.",,"['Le, Wei', 'Qi, Lixin', 'Li, Jiaxuan', 'Wu, DengIong', 'Xu, Jun', 'Zhang, Jinfu']","['Le W', 'Qi L', 'Li J', 'Wu D', 'Xu J', 'Zhang J']","['a Department of Urology , Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China.', 'b Department of Reproduction , Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China.', 'a Department of Urology , Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China.', 'a Department of Urology , Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China.', 'a Department of Urology , Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China.', 'c Department of Stem Cells Center , Tongji University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China.', 'd Department of Urology , Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Syst Biol Reprod Med,Systems biology in reproductive medicine,101464963,"['0 (H2AX protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Trp53bp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult Germline Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Count', 'DNA/*radiation effects', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Stem Cells', 'Testis/cytology', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1/*metabolism', 'X-Rays']",,,2016/02/10 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/10 06:00'],"['2016/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/19396368.2015.1125561 [doi]'],ppublish,Syst Biol Reprod Med. 2016;62(2):106-13. doi: 10.3109/19396368.2015.1125561.

However, translation of this approach in humans has been hampered by the paucity of molecularly defined human MiHAs. Using a novel proteogenomic approach, we have analyzed cells from 13 volunteers and discovered a vast repertoire of MiHAs presented by the most common HLA haplotype in European Americans: HLA-A*02:01;B*44:03. Notably, out of >6000 MiHAs, we have identified a set of 39 MiHAs that share optimal features for immunotherapy of HCs. These 'optimal MiHAs' are coded by common alleles of genes that are preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells. Bioinformatic modeling based on MiHA allelic frequencies showed that the 39 optimal MiHAs would enable MiHA-targeted immunotherapy of practically all HLA-A*02:01;B*44:03 patients. Further extension of this strategy to a few additional HLA haplotypes would allow treatment of almost all patients.",,"['Granados, D P', 'Rodenbrock, A', 'Laverdure, J-P', 'Cote, C', 'Caron-Lizotte, O', 'Carli, C', 'Pearson, H', 'Janelle, V', 'Durette, C', 'Bonneil, E', 'Roy, D C', 'Delisle, J-S', 'Lemieux, S', 'Thibault, P', 'Perreault, C']","['Granados DP', 'Rodenbrock A', 'Laverdure JP', 'Cote C', 'Caron-Lizotte O', 'Carli C', 'Pearson H', 'Janelle V', 'Durette C', 'Bonneil E', 'Roy DC', 'Delisle JS', 'Lemieux S', 'Thibault P', 'Perreault C']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Informatics and Operational Research, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Informatics and Operational Research, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],['CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-B44 Antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'HLA-B44 Antigen', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*therapeutic use', 'Proteogenomics/*methods']",,,2016/02/10 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/02/10 06:00'],"['2015/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201622 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.22 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Jun;30(6):1344-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.22.

In contrast, 60% experience return of detectable disease and have to restart treatment, thus highlighting the need for an improved method of identifying patients with the lowest likelihood of relapse. Here we describe the validation of a personalized DNA-based digital PCR (dPCR) approach for quantifying very low levels of residual disease, which involves the rapid identification of t(9;22) fusion junctions using targeted next-generation sequencing coupled with the use of a dPCR platform. t(9;22) genomic breakpoints were successfully mapped in samples from 32 of 32 patients with early stage disease. Disease quantification by DNA-based dPCR was performed using the Fluidigm BioMark platform on 46 follow-up samples from 6 of the 32 patients, including 36 samples that were in deep molecular remission. dPCR detected persistent disease in 81% of molecular-remission samples, outperforming both RT-dPCR (25%) and DNA-based quantitative PCR (19%). We conclude that dPCR for BCR-ABL1 DNA is the most sensitive available method of residual-disease detection in chronic myeloid leukemia and may prove useful in the management of tyrosine kinase inhibitor withdrawal.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Cytogenetic abnormalities provide the basis for risk stratification into clinically favourable, intermediate, and unfavourable groups. There are additional genetic mutations, which further influence the prognosis of patients with AML. Most of these result in molecular aberrations whose downstream target is MYC. It is therefore logical to study the relationship between MYC protein expression and cytogenetic risk groups. We studied MYC expression by immunohistochemistry in a large cohort (n = 199) of AML patients and correlated these results with cytogenetic risk profile and overall survival (OS). We illustrated differential expression of MYC protein across various cytogenetic risk groups (p = 0.03). Highest expression of MYC was noted in AML patients with favourable cytogenetic risk group. In univariate analysis, MYC expression showed significant negative influence of OS in favourable and intermediate cytogenetic risk group (p = 0.001). Interestingly, MYC expression had a protective effect in the unfavourable cytogenetic risk group. In multivariate analysis, while age and cytogenetic risk group were significant factors influencing survival, MYC expression by immunohistochemistry methods also showed some marginal impact (p = 0.069). In conclusion, we have identified differential expression of MYC protein in relation to cytogenetic risk groups in AML patients and documented its possible impact on OS in favourable and intermediate cytogenetic risk groups. These preliminary observations mandate additional studies to further investigate the routine clinical use of MYC protein expression in AML risk stratification.

NK cells were evaluated for their cytotoxicity in a standard (51)Cr-release assay against target cells and also analyzed for their receptors expression using flow cytometry. Early after transplant, we found higher percentage of CD56(bright) NK cells, increased levels of NKG2A and NCRs as well as decreased levels of KIRs expression on NK cells associated with an impaired cytotoxicity of these cells. All the abnormalities were normalized by one year after HSCT when CD56(bright) NK cells gradually differentiated into CD56(dim) subset. Collectively, we confirmed a gradual increase of CD56(dim) NK cells expressing NCRs with the significant decrease in NKG2A expression on NK cells.

Three major translocations (ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL, and AF4-MLL) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been shown to affect treatment outcome. This study is aimed at assessing the relationship between these translocations and the presence of other indicators of disease severity (white cell count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and hematocrit) in ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty chemotherapy naive patients aged between 9 months and 54 years had their marrow samples analyzed for the prevalent mutations. Their clinical and laboratory details on presentation were also obtained. RESULTS: Abnormal genes detected were BCR/ABL1 major transcript in 5 (12.5%), ETV6/RUNX1 in 2 (5.0%), MLL/AF4 none and none of the patients had more than one fusion gene. There was no relationship between the presence of these fusion genes and the clinical and laboratory features of ALL. An association exists between the fusion genes and ethnic origin of the patients (P = 0.005). There is no significant association between the abnormal fusion genes detected and some laboratory features of prognostic importance, which include total white blood cell count (P = 0.416) and FAB subtype (P = 0.576).

The younger age of onset and increased incidence of CML in Indians leads to higher chances of encountering it in pregnancy. Pregnancy in CML is a complex situation as first line therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), is fraught with multiple fetal safety issues. The fetal aspects have been elucidated in literature, but there is scarcity of information on the obstetric outcome per se in presence of CML, excluding the influence of TKI. Obstetric outcomes of 5 pregnancies in four patients with CML are being reported. Literature on interplay of CML and bleeding or thrombotic manifestations is reviewed. The major complications encountered were antepartum (APH) and postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), preterm labour, intrauterine growth retardation and intrauterine fetal death. Patients in the reproductive age group with diagnosis of CML should be carefully counseled regarding the effect of disease and TKI on the maternal-fetal health.

The cells of different groups were collected at 24, 48 and 72 h post-incubation for further detection. Their morphological changes were observed after Wright stain. MTT method was used to assay the growth inhibition rate and flow cytometry to detect CD11b expression level and the early stage apoptosis ratio. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the apoM gene expression levels. As expected 0.5 muM ATRA did not affect proliferation or apoptosis, strongly induced differentiation and decreased apoM expression. 10SV inhibited proliferation, increased apoptosis, induced differentiation and increased apoM expression in a time-dependent manner. The addition of ATRA to SV did not increase the effect of SV on proliferation and apoptosis, but increased the effect of SV on differentiation.

In this study, we aimed to good results with low toxicity in elderly patients. We retrospectively analyzed the AML and MDS-RAEB2 patients who received azacitidine monotherapy and azacitidine and LDL-ara-c combination therapy for a comparison of their response to therapy, survival rates, and toxicity rates and for determining the factors that could affect their overall survival. A total of 27 patients who were diagnosed with de novo AML and MDS-RAEB2 and who received at least four cycles of chemotherapy were included in the study, and the data were evaluated retrospectively.

A statistically significant difference was not detected between the groups regarding the response to therapy ratios (p = 0.161) (42.9 and 57.1 %, respectively). No difference was detected between the groups regarding therapy-related toxicity. Infections were the most common complication. Progression-free survival was 30.3 % for the azacitidine monotherapy group and 66.7 % for the combination (azacitidine + LD-ara-c) group. The factors influencing the overall survival rate were determined based on the response to the first-line therapies, more than a grade 2 infection, fever, and relapse in a multi-variance analysis.

Forty (52 %) patients developed cGVHD; 24 (60 %) extensive stage while 16 (40 %) limited stage. Oral cavity was the commonest site of involvement (25 patients) followed by liver, skin and lung. We found that female donor to male recipient transplant and diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were the only factors associated with increased risk of cGVHD.

Therefore, by overexpressing Mcl-1 in CD8 T cells we asked whether limiting levels of Mcl-1 promote contraction of effectors and constrain CD8 T-cell memory. Mcl-1 overexpression failed to affect CD8 T-cell expansion, contraction or the magnitude of CD8 T-cell memory. Strikingly, high Mcl-1 levels enhanced mTOR phosphorylation and augmented the differentiation of terminal effector cells and effector memory CD8 T cells to the detriment of poly-cytokine-producing central memory CD8 T cells.

The mechanism of action of these enzyme drugs is associated with their capacity to deplete the amino acid l-asparagine from the blood. However, clinical use of bacterial l-asparaginases is complicated by their dual l-asparaginase and l-glutaminase activities. The latter, even though representing only approximately 10% of the overall activity, is partially responsible for the observed toxic side effects. Hence, l-asparaginases devoid of l-glutaminase activity hold potential as safer drugs. Understanding the key determinants of l-asparaginase substrate specificity is a prerequisite step toward the development of enzyme variants with reduced toxicity. Here we present crystal structures of the Erwinia chrysanthemi l-asparaginase in complex with l-aspartic acid and with l-glutamic acid. These structures reveal two enzyme conformations-open and closed-corresponding to the inactive and active states, respectively. The binding of ligands induces the positioning of the catalytic Thr15 into its active conformation, which in turn allows for the ordering and closure of the flexible N-terminal loop. Notably, l-aspartic acid is more efficient than l-glutamic acid in inducing the active positioning of Thr15.

However, little information is available regarding the frequency, natural history, characteristics and prognosis of ALL in Noonan syndrome or RASopathies in general. Cross-referencing data from a large prospective cohort of 1176 patients having a molecularly confirmed RASopathy with data from the French childhood cancer registry allowed us to identify ALL in 6 (0.5%) patients including 4/778 (0.5%) with a germline PTPN11 mutation and 2/94 (2.1%) with a germline SOS1 mutation. None of the patients of our series with CFC syndrome (with germline BRAF or MAP2K1/MAP2K2 mutation - n = 121) or Costello syndrome (with HRAS mutation - n = 35) had an ALL. A total of 19 Noonan-ALL were gathered by adding our patients to those of the International Berlin-Munster-Frankfurt (I-BFM) study group and previously reported patients. Strikingly, all Noonan-associated ALL were B-cell precursor ALL, and high hyperdiploidy with more than 50 chromosomes was found in the leukemia cells of 13/17 (76%) patients with available genetics data. Our data suggest that children with Noonan syndrome are at higher risk to develop ALL. Like what is observed for somatic PTPN11 mutations, NS is preferentially associated with the development of hyperdiploid ALL that will usually respond well to chemotherapy. However, Noonan syndrome patients seem to have a propensity to develop post therapy myelodysplasia that can eventually be fatal. Hence, one should be particularly cautious when treating these patients.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Moreover, increased levels of mitochondria-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote survival of transformed cells and contribute to the disease progression both in solid tumors and leukemia. Consequently, interfering with mitochondrial metabolism has been used as a strategy to specifically target leukemic cells. SAM50 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in the formation of mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex. Although the importance of SAM50 in maintaining MIB integrity and in the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes has been described, its specific role in the normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells remains unknown. We observed that human leukemic cells display a specific dependency on SAM50 expression, as downregulation of SAM50 in BCR-ABL-expressing, but not normal CD34(+) human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) caused a significant decrease in growth, colony formation, and replating capacity. Mitochondrial functions of BCR-ABL-expressing HSPCs were compromised, as seen by a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration. This effect of SAM50 downregulation was recapitulated in normal HSPCs exposed to cytokine-rich culture conditions that stimulate proliferation. Both oncogene-transduced and cytokine-stimulated HSPCs showed increased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ROS levels compared to their normal counterparts. Therefore, we postulate that human leukemic HSPCs are highly dependent on the proper functioning of mitochondria and that disruption of mitochondrial integrity may aid in targeting leukemic cells.",,"['Capala, Marta E', 'Pruis, Maurien', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Capala ME', 'Pruis M', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen , Groningen, The Netherlands .', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen , Groningen, The Netherlands .', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen , Groningen, The Netherlands .', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG), University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen , Groningen, The Netherlands .']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Precursor Protein Import Complex Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (SAMM50 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Precursor Protein Import Complex Proteins', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology']",,,2016/02/09 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2016/02/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2015.0151 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2016 Mar 1;25(5):427-37. doi: 10.1089/scd.2015.0151.

Despite high incidence, HCoV infections are grossly understudied. We here report a case of HCoV infection in a leukemia patient with fatal ARDS despite successful virus elimination by pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha). CASE: The 27-year-old female pre-T-ALL patient was treated according to the German-Multicenter Trial for Adult ALL protocol. No relevant infectious complications were seen until day 35 when the neutropenic patient developed fever without any clinical focus. Antibiotic prophylaxis was switched to meropenem. The patient deteriorated rapidly with respiratory failure due to ARDS. Anti-infectious therapy was escalated to additional linezolid and liposomal amphotericine-B. BAL revealed a significant viral load of HCoV-NL63. Based on successful application of PEG-IFN against the related SARS coronavirus in animal experiments, a single injection of 180 mug PEG-IFN-alpha2b was applied. Despite immediate initiation of treatment and elimination of virus in subsequent tests, the progressive lung failure led to death 7 d after onset of fever with massive lung bleeding as a consequence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the fatal consequences of common respiratory virus infections in immunocompromised patients. HCoV-NL63 replication can be reduced by treatment with peg-IFN if diagnosed early.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In particular, hydrocarbon stapling of peptides to generate constrained helices can improve binding affinity and other peptide properties, but determining the best stapled peptide variant often requires laborious trial and error. Here, we describe the rapid discovery and optimization of a stapled-helix peptide that binds to Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic protein that is overexpressed in many chemoresistant cancers. To accelerate discovery, we developed a peptide library synthesis and screening scheme capable of identifying subtle affinity differences among Mcl-1-binding stapled peptides. We used our method to sample combinations of non-natural amino-acid substitutions that we introduced into Mcl-1 inhibitors in the context of a fixed helix-stabilizing hydrocarbon staple that increased peptide helical content and reduced proteolysis. Peptides discovered in our screen contained surprising substitutions at sites that are conserved in natural binding partners. Library-identified peptide M3d is the most potent molecule yet tested for selectively triggering mitochondrial permeabilization in Mcl-1 dependent cell lines. Our library approach for optimizing helical peptide inhibitors can be readily applied to the study of other biomedically important targets.",,"['Rezaei Araghi, Raheleh', 'Ryan, Jeremy A', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Keating, Amy E']","['Rezaei Araghi R', 'Ryan JA', 'Letai A', 'Keating AE']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 77 Massachusetts Ave. Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston, Massachusetts 02215, United States.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston, Massachusetts 02215, United States.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School , Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 77 Massachusetts Ave. Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States.', 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM110048/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD016326/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Discovery', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary']",PMC4874891,['NIHMS759132'],2016/02/09 06:00,2017/04/05 06:00,['2016/02/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acschembio.5b01002 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2016 May 20;11(5):1238-44. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.5b01002.

We recently found that in the absence of MOZ HAT activity, p16(INK4a) transcriptional levels are significantly increased, triggering an early entrance into replicative senescence. Because oncogenic fusion proteins must bypass cellular safeguard mechanisms, such as senescence and apoptosis, to induce leukemia, we hypothesized that this repressive activity of MOZ over p16(INK4a) transcription could be preserved, or even reinforced, in MOZ leukemogenic fusion proteins, such as MOZ-TIF2. We describe here that, indeed, MOZ-TIF2 silences expression of the CDKN2A locus (p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF)), inhibits the triggering of senescence and enhances proliferation, providing conditions favorable to the development of leukemia. Furthermore, we describe that abolishing the MOZ HAT activity of the fusion protein leads to a significant increase in expression of the CDKN2A locus and the number of hematopoietic progenitors undergoing senescence. Finally, we report that inhibition of senescence by MOZ-TIF2 is associated with increased apoptosis, suggesting a role for the fusion protein in p53 apoptosis-versus-senescence balance. Our results underscore the importance of the HAT activity of MOZ, preserved in the fusion protein, for repression of the CDKN2A locus transcription and the subsequent block of senescence, a necessary step for the survival of leukemic cells.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, these reports arrived at non-conclusive and even conflicting results regarding the association between two common MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T and A1298C) and CML risk. Thus, a meta-analysis was carried out to clarify a more precise association between these two polymorphisms and the CML risk by updating the available publications. METHODS: Pooled odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and stratification analysis were performed to estimate the relationship between MTHFR polymorphisms and the risk of CML under different genetic comparison models. RESULTS: Data from the meta-analysis showed no significant association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and CML risk. However, significant associations were found between MTHFR A1298C variants and CML risk under homozygous comparison model (CC vs AA, OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.11-2.36, p=0.01) and dominant comparison model (CC+AC vs AA, OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.17-2.43, p=0.005) in overall population; especially more obvious impacts were noticed for Asian populations in subgroup analysis for homozygous model (CC vs AA, OR=2.00, 95% CI=1.25-3.21, p=0.004) and dominant model (CC+AC vs AA, OR=2.49, 95% CI=1.42-4.36, p=0.001), but this did not apply in Caucasian populations. CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggested no significant association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and CML risk, while an increased CML risk was noticed for 1298C variant carriers, especially in Asian populations but not in Caucasian populations, which suggested ethnicity differences between MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms and risk of CML.",,"['Li, Chen', 'Yichao, Jin', 'Jiaxin, Lin', 'Yueting, Zhang', 'Qin, Lu', 'Tonghua, Yang']","['Li C', 'Yichao J', 'Jiaxin L', 'Yueting Z', 'Qin L', 'Tonghua Y']","['Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Asians/genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/ethnology/etiology/*genetics', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Publication Bias', 'Risk', 'Whites/genetics']",,,2016/02/09 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2016/02/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2015 Nov-Dec;20(6):1534-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar signs and symptoms can also be found in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, and inflammatory processes have been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of MPNs. Signal transduction pathways involving JAK1, JAK2, STAT3 and STAT5 are causally involved in driving both the malignant cells and the inflammatory process. Moreover, anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating drugs have been used successfully in the treatment of MPNs. However, to date, many unresoved issues remain. These include the role of somatic mutations that are present in addition to JAK2V617F, CALR and MPL W515 mutations, the interdependency of malignant and nonmalignant cells and the means to eradicate MPN-initiating and -maintaining cells. It is imperative for successful therapeutic approaches to define whether the malignant clone or the inflammatory cells or both should be targeted. The present review will cover three aspects of the role of inflammation in MPNs: inflammatory states as important differential diagnoses in cases of suspected MPN (that is, in the absence of a clonal marker), the role of inflammation in MPN pathogenesis and progression and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs for MPNs. The findings emphasize the need to separate the inflammatory processes from the malignancy in order to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of patients with Philadelphia-negative MPNs.",,"['Koschmieder, S', 'Mughal, T I', 'Hasselbalch, H C', 'Barosi, G', 'Valent, P', 'Kiladjian, J-J', 'Jeryczynski, G', 'Gisslinger, H', 'Jutzi, J S', 'Pahl, H L', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Maria Vannucchi, A', 'Cervantes, F', 'Silver, R T', 'Barbui, T']","['Koschmieder S', 'Mughal TI', 'Hasselbalch HC', 'Barosi G', 'Valent P', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Jeryczynski G', 'Gisslinger H', 'Jutzi JS', 'Pahl HL', 'Hehlmann R', 'Maria Vannucchi A', 'Cervantes F', 'Silver RT', 'Barbui T']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Tufts University Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Roskilde Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', ""Center for the Study and Treatment of Myelofibrosis, Biotechnology Research Laboratories, Fondazione IRCCS 'Policlinico San Matteo', Pavia, Italy."", 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Clinical Investigations Center (INSERM CIC 1427), Hopital Saint-Louis and Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood Coagulation, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood Coagulation, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital Freiburg, Center for Clinical Research, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM) and Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital Freiburg, Center for Clinical Research, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'CRIMM, Centro di Ricerca e Innovazione e Laboratorio Congiunto per le Malattie Mieloproliferative, Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Clinica, Centro Denothe, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Universita degli Studi, Firenze, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Center, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Clinical Research Center and Hematology, Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology']",,,2016/02/09 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2016/02/09 06:00'],"['2015/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201612 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.12 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 May;30(5):1018-24. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.12.

We aimed to identify actionable easy-to-screen alterations that would allow better diagnostics and/or treatment of this deadly disease. By performing whole-exome sequencing of four EITL tumor-normal pairs, followed by amplicon deep sequencing of 42 tumor samples, frequent alterations of the JAK-STAT and G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways were discovered in a large portion of samples. Specifically, STAT5B was mutated in a remarkable 63% of cases, JAK3 in 35% and GNAI2 in 24%, with the majority occurring at known activating hotspots in key functional domains. Moreover, STAT5B locus carried copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity resulting in the duplication of the mutant copy, suggesting the importance of mutant STAT5B dosage for the development of EITL. Dysregulation of the JAK-STAT and GPCR pathways was also supported by gene expression profiling and further verified in patient tumor samples. In vitro overexpression of GNAI2 mutants led to the upregulation of pERK1/2, a member of MEK-ERK pathway. Notably, inhibitors of both JAK-STAT and MEK-ERK pathways effectively reduced viability of patient-derived primary EITL cells, indicating potential therapeutic strategies for this neoplasm with no

Nevertheless, no profound study has been conducted on cell differentiation regulation by this molecule through signaling on essential biological functions. We sought to demonstrate that NO positively regulates the pluripotency transcriptional core, enforcing changes in the chromatin structure, in addition to regulating cell proliferation, and signaling pathways with key roles in stemness. Culturing mESCs with 2 muM of the NO donor diethylenetriamine/NO (DETA/NO) in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induced significant changes in the expression of 16 genes of the pluripotency transcriptional core. Furthermore, treatment with DETA/NO resulted in a high occupancy of activating H3K4me3 at the Oct4 and Nanog promoters and repressive H3K9me3 and H3k27me3 at the Brachyury promoter. Additionally, the activation of signaling pathways involved in pluripotency, such as Gsk3-beta/beta-catenin, was observed, in addition to activation of PI3 K/Akt, which is consistent with the protection of mESCs from cell death. Finally, a decrease in cell proliferation coincides with cell cycle arrest in G2/M. Our results provide novel insights into NO-mediated gene regulation and cell proliferation and suggest that NO is necessary but not sufficient for the maintenance of pluripotency and the prevention of cell differentiation.

Nevertheless, its direct contribution to the disease pathogenesis is not very well understood. Recent data indicate that CD38 may promote CLL pathogenesis by enhancing proliferation in synergy with B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and by supporting migration and homing of CLL cells to secondary lymphoid organs, where the malignant cells receive support from the tumor microenvironment. CD38 may also contribute to a suppressed anticancer immune response through the production of tolerogenic compounds. This review first shortly summarizes the biology, expression, and function of CD38 in general and in CLL cells in more detail. Next, the current literature and open questions regarding a direct contribution of CD38 to CLL pathogenesis are critically reviewed. Finally, I discuss the potential of CD38 as therapeutic target in light of its possible roles in CLL and the promising results of clinical trials with CD38 antibodies in multiple myeloma (MM).",,"['Burgler, Simone']",['Burgler S'],"[""Experimental Infectious Diseases and Cancer Research, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8008 Zurich, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Immunol,Critical reviews in immunology,8914819,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2016/02/09 06:00,2016/11/12 06:00,['2016/02/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['3cf9880e7437a8b5,506e1a4f3d4f25c9 [pii]', '10.1615/critrevimmunol.v35.i5.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Immunol. 2015;35(5):417-32. doi: 10.1615/critrevimmunol.v35.i5.50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to assess the outcome of early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in patients from the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology Oncology (AIEOP) centres treated with AIEOP-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (AIEOP-BFM) protocols. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we included all children aged from 1 to less than 18 years with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia immunophenotype diagnosed between Jan 1, 2008, and Oct 31, 2014, from AIEOP centres. Early T-cell precursors were defined as being CD1a and CD8 negative, CD5 weak positive or negative, and positive for at least one of the following antigens: CD34, CD117, HLADR, CD13, CD33, CD11b, or CD65. Treatment was based on AIEOP-BFM acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 2000 (NCT00613457) or AIEOP-BFM acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 2009 protocols (European Clinical Trials Database 2007-004270-43). The main differences in treatment and stratification of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia between the two protocols were that in the 2009 protocol only, pegylated L-asparaginase was substituted for Escherichia coli L-asparaginase, patients with prednisone poor response received an additional dose of cyclophosphamide at day 10 of phase IA, and high minimal residual disease at day 15 assessed by flow cytometry was used as a high-risk criterion. Outcomes were assessed in terms of event-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival. FINDINGS: Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was diagnosed in 49 patients. Compared with overall T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, it was associated with absence of molecular markers for PCR detection of minimal residual disease in 25 (56%) of 45 patients; prednisone poor response in 27 (55%) of 49 patients; high minimal residual disease at day 15 after starting therapy in 25 (64%) of 39 patients (bone marrow blasts >/= 10%, by flow cytometry); no complete remission after phase IA in 7 (15%) of 46 patients (bone marrow blasts >/= 5%, morphologically); and high PCR minimal residual disease (>/= 5 x 10(-4)) at day 33 after starting therapy in 17 (85%) of 20 patients with markers available. Overall, 38 (78%) of 49 patients are in continuous complete remission, including 13 of 18 after haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, with three deaths in induction, five deaths after haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, and three relapses. Severe adverse events in the 2009 study were reported in 10 (30%) of 33 patients with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia versus 24 (15%) of 164 patients without early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and life-threatening events in induction phase IA occurred in 4 (12%) of 33 patients with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia versus 7 (4%) of 164 patients without early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. No difference was seen in the subsequent consolidation phase IB of protocol I. INTERPRETATION: Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is characterised by poor early response to conventional induction treatment. Consolidation phase IB, based on cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, and ara-C at conventional (non-high) doses is effective in reducing minimal residual disease. Although the number of patients and observational time are limited, patients with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with current BFM stratification and treatment strategy have a favourable outcome compared with earlier reports. The role of innovative therapies and haemopoietic stem cell therapy in early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia needs to be assessed. FUNDING: None.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There is paucity of data on the prevalence of malnutrition in pediatric cancer patients and the impact of cancer treatment on nutritional status of Indian children. AIMS: The study was conducted to look at the prevalence of malnutrition and assess the impact of treatment on nutritional status of pediatric cancer patients. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on the weight of pediatric cancer patients <16 years of age treated at Cancer Institute, Chennai, from January 2013 to May 2014 were analyzed at systematic time points in therapy. Patients' weight were plotted on the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) growth charts. Patients were defined to be undernourished if their weight for age was </=3rd centile in CDC growth charts and obese if their weight for age was >/=97th centile on CDC growth charts. RESULTS: A total of 295 patient case records were analyzed. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the most common malignancy. At diagnosis, under-nutrition was seen in 44% patients, this increased to 46% midway during treatment (end of induction in acute leukemia and completion of 50% of planned treatment in solid tumors) and decreased to 27% at the end of treatment (beginning of maintenance in acute leukemia and completion of planned treatment in solid tumors) (P = 0.0005).

The objective of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the morbidity pattern and outcome of therapy in undernourished (UN) children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of impact of weight for age was performed in children treated for ALL. The IAP & CDC criteria for undernutrition were used in the two different time periods of analysis. RESULTS: There were two cohorts in the study: Between 1995 and 2005, 360 children were evaluated where the weight for age was classified using the Indian Academy of Pediatrics criteria for undernourishment (Group A). Group B of the study included 373 children treated from 2007 to 2011, who were graded as per the Centers for Disease Control criteria for weight for age. In Group A, 35% of the children were malnourished at presentation. The morbidity and supportive care needed in the well-nourished and UN group were similar. The event-free survival and mortality were similar in both groups. Analysis of Group B showed an overall survival of 62.6% with a greater survival in children with a weight of >/=10th centile for age compared to children at the <10th centile, (P = 0.026) with a higher mortality (P = 0.011) in the UN group. CONCLUSION: Our data have yielded conflicting results. The older cohort did not show a significant difference in survival using malnutrition as a risk factor. However, in the subsequent cohort, a difference in survival was noted. This could be due to the reason that different criteria for classification of undernutrition were applied in the two groups. This analysis lays the foundation for a future prospective analysis to evaluate nutrition as an independent risk factor nutrition as an independent risk factor in the outcome of childhood malignancies.",,"['Trehan, A', 'Prabhu, V', 'Bansal, D']","['Trehan A', 'Prabhu V', 'Bansal D']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Advanced Pediatric Centre, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/complications/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",,,2016/02/09 06:00,2016/11/03 06:00,['2016/02/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2015_52_2_203_175835 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.175835 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2015 Apr-Jun;52(2):203-6. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.175835.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the exact underlying mechanisms are not known. AIMS: The study was done to assess the role of biomarkers of obesity in acute leukemia survivors. SETTINGS AND DESIGNS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences in survivors of acute leukemia who had completed treatment at least 1 year before enrollment in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Obesity was studied by determining the body mass index. Potential biomarkers were studied by assessing serum leptin, resistin, and adiponectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, and the results were compared in obese versus nonobese survivors. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive analysis for baseline demographic factors and Student's t-test for comparing the mean levels of biomarkers among the obese and nonobese survivors. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-nine acute leukemia patients were enrolled in this study with a median follow-up of 36.8 months. The median age was 10 (range: 3-18) years, and 123 (77.3%) patients were males. The overall prevalence of overweight/obesity was 26.4%, and this was similar in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia sub-groups (26.2% vs. 27.3%, P = 0.9). Mean serum leptin and resistin were similar in obese and nonobese leukemia survivors (3.7 vs. 2.85 pg/mL, P = 0.064; 8.01 vs. 9.33 ng/mL, P = 0.36). However, mean serum adiponectin was significantly lower in obese leukemia survivors (7.97 vs. 11.5 mug/mL, P = 0.023).

As evidence suggests that some genetic variants may increase susceptibility to both AR and asthma, the objective of this study was to identify asthma susceptibility variants associated with AR in the Chinese population. METHODS: A cohort of 402 individuals with physician-diagnosed AR and 416 healthy controls were recruited from the Han Chinese population in Beijing. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood and a total of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shown to be associated with asthma in Japanese subjects were selected for genotyping using the SequenomMassARRAY technology platform. RESULTS: Analysis of frequency differences of allele between the AR patients and control subjects showed that the C allele of rs204993 in the pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 2 (PBX2) gene from the 6p21.3 locus was significantly associated with AR (p = 0.0006, pcorrected = 0.0340). Genotype analysis further confirmed the difference in distribution of this variant between AR patients and controls in the both the dominant (pT/C+C/C vs T/T = 7.37x10(-5) ) and co-dominant (pT/C vs T/T = 1.98 x 10(-4) , pC/C vs T/T = 0.004) models.

IGF2BP1 is also overexpressed in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the biological significance of this phenomenon has not been addressed so far. We have identified leukemia fusion gene ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA to be highly enriched in immunoprecipitated fraction of endogenous IGF2BP1 from a model cell line REH and t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL samples. Furthermore, downregulation of IGF2BP1 by two-fold has resulted in a corresponding decrease of ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA validating this transcript as a target of IGF2BP1 protein in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL.

Acquired telomerase reverse transcriptase gene promoter (TERTp) mutations are among the most frequent somatic non-coding mutations in cancers. In this study, the prevalence of TERTp mutations in 24 MCL and 21 other lymphoid neoplasias (oLN) was investigated. Eight MCL samples (33%) carried TERTp mutations, two homozygous and six heterozygous (seven C228T and one C250T), which directly correlated with higher TERT transcription, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and IGHV mutational status in MCL neoplastic cells. TERTp mutations were not found in oLN. TERTp mutations correlated with more lymphoma proliferation and tumor burden, as suggested by the higher number of lymphoma cells circulating in peripheral blood, and tended to associate with longer MCL telomeres, especially in homozygous mutants, although not statistically significant. Telomere-biology genes were overexpressed in MCL cells in comparison to healthy lymphocytes, but were not influenced by mutation status. The findings described for the first time that acquired TERTp mutations are common in MCL but not in other lymphoid neoplasms. It was also demonstrated that TERTp mutations are associated with higher TERT mRNA expression in MCL cells in vivo and higher tumor burden, suggesting these mutations as a driver event in MCL development and progression.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Panero, Julieta', 'Alves-Paiva, Raquel M', 'Roisman, Alejandro', 'Santana-Lemos, Barbara A', 'Falcao, Roberto P', 'Oliveira, Gustavo', 'Martins, Diego', 'Stanganelli, Carmen', 'Slavutsky, Irma', 'Calado, Rodrigo T']","['Panero J', 'Alves-Paiva RM', 'Roisman A', 'Santana-Lemos BA', 'Falcao RP', 'Oliveira G', 'Martins D', 'Stanganelli C', 'Slavutsky I', 'Calado RT']","['Laboratorio de Genetica de Neoplasias Linfoides, Instituto de Medicina Experimental, CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, C1425AUM, Argentina.', 'Divisao De Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Centro de Terapia Celular, Fundacao de Amparo A Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica de Neoplasias Linfoides, Instituto de Medicina Experimental, CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, C1425AUM, Argentina.', 'Divisao De Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Centro de Terapia Celular, Fundacao de Amparo A Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Divisao De Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Centro de Terapia Celular, Fundacao de Amparo A Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Divisao De Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Divisao De Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Division Patologia Molecular, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, C1425AUM, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica de Neoplasias Linfoides, Instituto de Medicina Experimental, CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, C1425AUM, Argentina.', 'Divisao De Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Centro de Terapia Celular, Fundacao de Amparo A Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14048-900, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Telomere/ultrastructure', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Burden', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/genetics']",,,2016/02/08 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2016/02/08 06:00'],"['2015/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24324 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2016 May;91(5):481-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24324.

The expression of Alox-5 and Nanog genes was downregulated and that of Mdr-1 was upregulated in K562 cells. The Lucena cell line contained a higher number of megakaryocytes than the non-MDR, but this number was not altered by PMA, as well as Mdr-1 gene expression. However, Alox-5 expression was downregulated. Alox-5, Mdr-1, Nanog, Oct-4 and Sox-2 basal expression was also evaluated in the K562, Lucena and FEPS (also MDR) cell lines. The transcription factors gene expression was similar in MDR cell lines. The expression of Alox-5 was higher in the non-MDR cell line, while FEPS had the lowest expression of this gene.

METHODS: We studied non-thyroid cancer incidence in a cohort of about 12,000 individuals from Belarus exposed under age of 18 years to Chernobyl fallout (median age at the time of Chernobyl accident of 7.9 years). During 15 years of follow-up from1997 through 2011, 54 incident cancers excluding thyroid were identified in the study cohort with 142,968 person-years at risk. We performed Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) analysis of all solid cancers excluding thyroid (n=42), of leukemia (n=6) and of lymphoma (n=6). RESULTS: We found no significant increase in the incidence of non-thyroid solid cancer (SIR=0.83, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.61; 1.11), lymphoma (SIR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.26; 1.33) or leukemia (SIR=1.78, 95% CI: 0.71; 3.61) in the study cohort as compared with the sex-, age- and calendar-time-specific national rates. These findings may in part reflect the relatively young age of study subjects (median attained age of 33.4 years), and long latency for some radiation-related solid cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of statistically significant increases in solid cancer, lymphoma and leukemia incidence 25 years after childhood exposure in the study cohort; however, it is important to continue follow-up non-thyroid cancers in individuals exposed to low-level radiation at radiosensitive ages.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The GFI1B-D262N mutant functionally antagonizes the transcriptional activity of wild-type GFI1B. GFI1B-D262N promoted myelomonocytic versus erythroid output from primary human hematopoietic precursors and enhanced cell survival of both normal and MDS derived precursors. Re-analysis of AML transcriptome data identifies a distinct group of patients in whom expression of wild-type GFI1B and SPI1 (PU.1) have an inverse pattern. In delineating this GFI1B-SPI1 relationship we show that (i) SPI1 is a direct target of GFI1B, (ii) expression of GFI1B-D262N produces elevated expression of SPI1, and (iii) SPI1-knockdown restores balanced lineage output from GFI1B-D262N-expressing precursors.

The approach utilizes the background cancer risk and the background (endogenous) concentration of a cancer-related exposure biomarker in specific target tissues. After allowing for statistical uncertainty in these two parameters, the ratio of the background risk to background exposure provides a conservative slope factor estimate that can be utilized to bound the added risk that may be associated with incremental exogenous exposures. Our original bottom-up estimates were markedly smaller than those obtained previously by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) with a conventional top-down approach to modeling nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia mortality data from a US worker cohort. Herein we provide updated bottom-up estimates of risk for these two cancers that are smaller still, and rely upon more robust estimates of endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde-DNA adducts in monkeys and a more robust estimate of the DNA adduct elimination half-life in rats, both obtained very recently. We also re-examine the worker mortality data used by USEPA in developing its estimate of human leukemia incidence from lifetime exposure to 1 ppm airborne formaldehyde. Finally, we compare a new bottom-up slope estimate of the risk of rat nasal cancer with conventional top-down estimates obtained with empirical dose-response modeling of rat nasal cancer bioassay data.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

During T-cell activation, the antiviral effect of the innate factor SAMHD1 is neutralized through phosphorylation at T592, allowing HIV-1 infection. Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used for treating chronic myeloid leukemia, has been described to control HIV-1 replication through its negative effect on T-cell proliferation and viral entry. We demonstrate that Dasatinib can actually interfere with SAMHD1 phosphorylation in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, preserving its antiviral activity against HIV-1. Dasatinib prevented SAMHD1 phosphorylation in vitro and ex vivo, impairing HIV-1 reverse transcription and proviral integration. This was the major mechanism of action because the presence of Vpx, which degrades SAMHD1, in HIV-1 virions impeded the inhibitory effect of Dasatinib on HIV-1 replication. In fact, infection with VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions and fusion of BlaM-Vpr-containing HIV-1 viruses with activated PBMCs in the presence of Dasatinib suggested that Dasatinib was not acting at fusion level. Finally, PBMCs from patients on chronic treatment with Dasatinib showed a lower level of SAMHD1 phosphorylation in response to activating stimuli and low susceptibility to HIV-1 infection ex vivo. Consequently, Dasatinib is a compound currently used in clinic that preserves the antiviral function of SAMHD1. Using Dasatinib as adjuvant of antiretroviral therapy during early primary HIV-1 infection would contribute to reduce viral replication and spread, prevent reservoir seeding, and preserve CD4 counts and CTL responses. These events would create a more favorable virologic and immunologic environment for future interventional studies aiming at HIV-1 eradication.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH, i.e., both copies of a chromosomal pair or their parts originate from one parent) might contribute to increased genomic instability in the bone-marrow cells of patients with MDS. The pathological potential of CN-LOH, which arises as a clonal aberration in a proportion of somatic cells, consists of tumor suppressor gene and oncogene homozygous mutations. The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of CN-LOH at 17p in bone-marrow cells of newly diagnosed MDS patients with complex chromosomal aberrations and to assess its correlation with mutations in the TP53 gene (17p13.1). CN-LOH was detected in 40 chromosomal regions in 21 (29%) of 72 patients analyzed. The changes in 27 of the 40 regions identified were sporadic. The most common finding was CN-LOH of the short arm of chromosome 17, which was detected in 13 (18%) of 72 patients. A mutational analysis confirmed the homozygous mutation of TP53 in all CN-LOH 17p patients, among which two frameshift mutations are not registered in the International Agency for Research on Cancer TP53 Database. CN-LOH 17p correlated with aggressive disease (median overall survival 4 months) and was strongly associated with a complex karyotype in the cohort studied, which might cause rapid disease progression in high-risk MDS. No other CN-LOH region previously recorded in MDS or AML patients (1p, 4q, 7q, 11q, 13q, 19q, 21q) was detected in our cohort of patients with complex karyotype examined at the diagnosis of MDS. The LOH region appeared to be balanced (i.e., with no DNA copy number change) when examined with conventional and molecular cytogenetic methods. Therefore, a microarray that detects single-nucleotide polymorphisms is an ideal method with which to identify and further characterize CN-LOH. Our data should specify the prognosis and should lead to the identification of potential targets for therapeutic interventions.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

While cumulative doses of osteotoxic chemotherapy for ALL have been reported to adversely impact bone density, the timing of onset of this effect as well as other changes to bone structure is not well characterized. We therefore conducted a prospective cohort study in pre-adolescent and adolescent patients (10-21years) newly diagnosed with ALL (n=38) to explore leukemia-related changes to bone at diagnosis and the subsequent impact of the first phase of chemotherapy (""Induction""). Using quantitative computerized tomography (QCT), we found that pre-chemotherapy bone properties were similar to age- and sex-matched controls. Subsequently over the one month Induction period, however, cancellous volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) decreased markedly (-26.8%, p<0.001) with sparing of cortical vBMD (tibia -0.0%, p=0.860, femur -0.7%, p=0.290). The tibia underwent significant cortical thinning (average cortical thickness-1.2%, p<0.001; cortical area-0.4%, p=0.014), while the femur was less affected. Areal BMD (aBMD) concurrently measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) underestimated changes from baseline as compared to vBMD. Biochemical evidence revealed prevalent Vitamin D insufficiency and a net resorptive state at start and end of Induction. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that significant alterations to cancellous and cortical bone develop during the first month of treatment, far earlier during ALL therapy than previously considered. Given that osteotoxic chemotherapy is integral to curative regimens for ALL, these results provide reason to re-evaluate traditional approaches toward chemotherapy-associated bone toxicity and highlight the urgent need for investigation into interventions to mitigate this common adverse effect.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Endothelial cells from multiple vascular beds are able to prevent spontaneous or therapy-induced apoptosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts. Marrow-derived endothelial cells from leukemia patients have not been well-characterized, and in this work, endothelial cells were purified from marrow aspirates from normal subjects or from newly diagnosed AML patients to compare these cells phenotypically and functionally. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, these cells express CD31, Tie-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), supporting endothelial origin. They take up acetyl low-density lipoprotein and are able to form tubular structures. Culture of AML cells with endothelial cells from both normal and AML subjects supported adhesion, transmigration, and leukemia colony-forming unit outgrowth. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed 130 genes significantly up- or downregulated in AML-derived endothelial cells as compared with those derived from normal marrow. The genes differentially expressed (p < 0.001) were included in biological function categories involving cancer, cell development, cell growth and proliferation, cell signaling, inflammatory response, and cell death and survival. Further pathway analysis revealed upregulation of c-Fos and genes involved in chemotaxis such as CXCL16. AML-derived endothelial cells are similar in phenotype and function to their normal marrow-derived counterparts, but genomic analysis suggests a differential signature with altered expression of genes, which could play a role in leukemogenesis or leukemia cell maintenance in the marrow microenvironment.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here we examined mechanisms underlying interactions between the NAE inhibitor pevonedistat (MLN4924) and the approved HDAC inhibitor belinostat in AML/MDS cells. MLN4924/belinostat coadministration synergistically induced AML cell apoptosis with or without p53 deficiency or FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), whereas p53 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown or enforced FLT3-ITD expression significantly sensitized cells to the regimen. MLN4924 blocked belinostat-induced antiapoptotic gene expression through nuclear factor-kappaB inactivation. Each agent upregulated Bim, and Bim knockdown significantly attenuated apoptosis. Microarrays revealed distinct DNA damage response (DDR) genetic profiles between individual vs combined MLN4924/belinostat exposure. Whereas belinostat abrogated the MLN4924-activated intra-S checkpoint through Chk1 and Wee1 inhibition/downregulation, cotreatment downregulated multiple homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining repair proteins, triggering robust double-stranded breaks, chromatin pulverization, and apoptosis. Consistently, Chk1 or Wee1 shRNA knockdown significantly sensitized AML cells to MLN4924. MLN4924/belinostat displayed activity against primary AML or MDS cells, including those carrying next-generation sequencing-defined poor-prognostic cancer hotspot mutations, and CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) populations, but not normal CD34(+) progenitors. Finally, combined treatment markedly reduced tumor burden and significantly prolonged animal survival (P < .0001) in AML xenograft models with negligible toxicity, accompanied by pharmacodynamic effects observed in vitro. Collectively, these findings argue that MLN4924 and belinostat interact synergistically by reciprocally disabling the DDR in AML/MDS cells. This strategy warrants further consideration in AML/MDS, particularly in disease with unfavorable genetic aberrations.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Zhou, Liang', 'Chen, Shuang', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Kmieciak, Maciej', 'Leng, Yun', 'Li, Lihong', 'Lin, Hui', 'Rizzo, Kathryn A', 'Dumur, Catherine I', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez, Andrea', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Povirk, Lawrence', 'Chalasani, Sri', 'Berger, Allison J', 'Dai, Yun', 'Grant, Steven']","['Zhou L', 'Chen S', 'Zhang Y', 'Kmieciak M', 'Leng Y', 'Li L', 'Lin H', 'Rizzo KA', 'Dumur CI', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez A', 'Rahmani M', 'Povirk L', 'Chalasani S', 'Berger AJ', 'Dai Y', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA;', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA;', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA;', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA;', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and the Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA;

DNA sequencing experiments have shown that about 30% of CLL patients have stereotyped antigen-specific B-cell receptors (BCRs) with a high level of sequence homology in the variable domains of the heavy and light chains. These include many of the most aggressive cases that haveIGHV-unmutated BCRs whose sequences have not diverged significantly from the germ line. This suggests a personalized therapy strategy in which a toxin or immune effector function is delivered selectively to the pathogenic B-cells but not to healthy B-cells. To execute this strategy, serum-stable, drug-like compounds able to target the antigen-binding sites of most or all patients in a stereotyped subset are required. We demonstrate here the feasibility of this approach with the discovery of selective, high affinity ligands for CLL BCRs of the aggressive, stereotyped subset 7P that cross-react with the BCRs of several CLL patients in subset 7p, but not with BCRs from patients outside this subset.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Sarkar, Mohosin', 'Liu, Yun', 'Qi, Junpeng', 'Peng, Haiyong', 'Morimoto, Jumpei', 'Rader, Christoph', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Kodadek, Thomas']","['Sarkar M', 'Liu Y', 'Qi J', 'Peng H', 'Morimoto J', 'Rader C', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Kodadek T']","['From the Departments of Chemistry.', 'The Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York 11030.', 'Cancer Biology, and.', 'Cancer Biology, and.', 'From the Departments of Chemistry.', 'Cancer Biology, and Molecular Therapeutics, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, Florida 33458 and.', 'The Karches Center for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York 11030.', 'From the Departments of Chemistry, Cancer Biology, and kodadek@scripps.edu.']",['eng'],"['DP3 DK094309/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA181258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4817184,,2016/02/07 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2016/02/07 06:00'],"['2015/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)41310-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.701656 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Apr 1;291(14):7558-70. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.701656.

RESULTS: Pre-treatment with DAC restores cellular sensitivity in Ara-C-resistant AML cells. In contrast, DAC/Ara-C combinations are antagonistic in other Ara-C-sensitive AML cells.

In the present study, we compared the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of resveratrol with FEHH4-1 on Jurkat T-cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation and viability were monitored by 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide assay, annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycin D staining and western blot. To induce interleukin-2 (IL2) expression, cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/phytohemagglutinin. IL2 production was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL2 promoter activity was studied by a Jurkat T-cell line containing an IL2 promoter luciferase reporter construct. RESULTS: Both polyphenols inhibited proliferation, induced apoptotic cell death and blocked IL2 synthesis in Jurkat T-cells. Most importantly, FEHH4-1 was three-to four-times more potent than resveratrol.

A YNPC031312-B-Hypoxia cell line was established by maintaining YNPC031312-B cells under tumor-like hypoxic conditions (1% O2).

Here, we addressed whether cell ontogeny and hierarchy influence the reprogramming efficiency of the B-cell compartment. We demonstrate that human fetal liver (FL)-derived CD19 + B cells are 110-fold easier to reprogram into iPSCs than those from CB/PB. Similarly, FL-derived CD34+CD19 + B progenitors are reprogrammed much easier than mature B cells (0.46% vs. 0.11%). All FL B-cell iPSCs carry complete VDJH rearrangements while 55% and 45% of the FL B-progenitor iPSCs carry incomplete and complete VDJH rearrangements, respectively, reflecting the reprogramming of developmentally different B progenitors (pro-B vs. pre-B) within a continuous differentiation process. Finally, our data suggest that successful B-cell reprogramming relies on active cell proliferation, and it is MYC-dependent as identical nonintegrative polycistronic SeV lacking MYC (OSKL or OSKLN) fail to reprogram B cells.

The specific biological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment following ALL remain largely unclear, but previous studies consistently demonstrate significant white matter pathology. We aimed to extend this literature by examining the organization of the white matter connectome in young patients with a history of ALL treated with chemotherapy only. We applied graph theoretical analysis to diffusion tensor imaging obtained from 31 survivors of ALL age 5-19 years and 39 matched healthy controls. Results indicated significantly lower small-worldness (p = 0.007) and network clustering coefficient (p = 0.019), as well as greater cognitive impairment (p = 0.027) in the ALL group. Regional analysis indicated that clustered connectivity in parietal, frontal, hippocampal, amygdalar, thalamic, and occipital regions was altered in the ALL group. Random forest analysis revealed a model of connectome and demographic variables that could automatically classify survivors of ALL as having cognitive impairment or not (accuracy = 0.89, p < 0.0001). These findings provide further evidence of brain injury in young survivors of ALL, even those without a history of central nervous system (CNS) disease or cranial radiation.

METHOD: Clinical-epidemiological, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. The study included new cases of patients with AML, diagnosed between 2004 and 2012, younger than 15 years. RESULTS: Of the 51 patients studied, 84% were white; 45% were females and 55%, males. Regarding age, 8% were younger than 1 year, 47% were aged between 1 and 10 years, and 45% were older than 10 years. The main signs/symptoms were fever (41.1%), asthenia/lack of appetite (35.2%), and hemorrhagic manifestations (27.4%). The most affected extra-medullary site was the central nervous system (14%). In 47% of patients, the white blood cell (WBC) count was below 10,000/mm(3) at diagnosis. The minimal residual disease (MRD) was less than 0.1%, on the 15th day of treatment in 16% of the sample. Medullary relapse occurred in 14% of cases. When comparing the bone marrow MRD with the vital status, it was observed that 71.42% of the patients with type M3 AML were alive, as were 54.05% of those with non-M3 AML. The death rate was 43% and the main proximate cause was septic shock (63.6%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the majority of patients were male, white, and older than 1 year. Most patients with WBC count <10,000/mm(3) at diagnosis lived. Overall survival was higher in patients with MRD <0.1%. The prognosis was better in patients with AML-M3.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier', 'Editora Ltda.

To gain more insight into the anatomy of these abnormalities, at first we studied 9p24.1 alterations in 18 leukemia/lymphoma cases using cytogenetic and molecular techniques. The aberrations comprised structural (nine cases) and numerical (nine cases) alterations. The former lesions were heterogeneous but shared a common breakpoint region of 200 kb downstream of JAK2. The rearrangements predominantly targeted the PDL locus. We have identified five potential partner genes of PDL1/2: PHACTR4 (1p34), N4BP2 (4p14), EEF1A1 (6q13), JAK2 (9p24.1), and IGL (22q11). Interestingly, the cryptic JAK2-PDL1 rearrangement was generated by a microdeletion spanning the 3'JAK2-5'PDL1 region. JAK2 was additionally involved in a cytogenetically cryptic IGH-mediated t(9;14)(p24.1;q32) found in two patients. This rare but likely underestimated rearrangement highlights the essential role of JAK2 in B-cell neoplasms. Cases with amplification of 9p24.1 were diagnosed as primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (five cases) and T-cell lymphoma (four cases). The smallest amplified 9p24.1 region was restricted to the JAK2-PDL1/2-RANBP6 interval. In the next step, we screened 200 cases of classical Hodgkin lymphoma by interphase FISH and identified PDL1/2 rearrangement (CIITA- and IGH-negative) in four cases (2%), what is a novel finding. Forty (25%) cases revealed high level amplification of 9p24.1, including four cases with a selective amplification of PDL1/2.

Prognostic factors, such as bone marrow fibrosis, lactate dehydrogenase and 2-microglobulin elevation have been described, but treatment is mainly based in the International Prognostic Scoring System. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our aim was to analyze serum's erythropoietin at diagnosis in de novo myelodysplastic syndromes patients, through its impact in overall survival and possible implementation as prognostic marker. Clinical and laboratorial data from 102 patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes diagnosed between October/2009 and March/2014 were collected. Survival analysis was performed according to serum erythropoietin level stratification, using Kaplan-Meier methodology. RESULTS: Our 102 patients had a median age of 74 years, with a male:female ratio of 0.8. Mean erythropoietin was significantly lower in refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia patients in contrast with the higher values observed in 5q- syndrome (p < 0.05). Eleven patients progressed to acute leukaemia; these have higher mean erythropoietin values (p < 0.05). In addition, elevated serum erythropoietin was associated with lower survival rates (p = 0.0336). Predictive value of serum erythropoietin was maintained after Cox regression adjustment. In multivariate analysis, serum erythropoietin is an independent survival predictor (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Serum erythropoietin is a predictive factor for response to therapy with subcutaneous erythropoietin, and patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with higher values of erythropoietin have poorer response to administration of erythropoietin even at higher doses. Our sample shows that serum erythropoietin also has prognostic value, and in all myelodysplastic syndromes subtypes. Moreover, alone or in combination with other factors or prognostic indices, erythropoietin may enhance the prognostic indices such as the International Prognostic Scoring System, since high levels are associated with progression to acute leukemia and hence lower survival. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that increased erythropoietin levels at diagnosis can by itself be a poor prognosis factor inmyelodysplastic syndromes patients, with higher values in patients with progression to acute leukaemia and decreased overall survival.",,"['Cortesao, Emilia', 'Tenreiro, Rita', 'Ramos, Sofia', 'Pereira, Marta', 'Cesar, Paula', 'Carda, Jose P', 'Gomes, Marilia', 'Rito, Luis', 'Magalhaes, Emilia', 'Goncalves, Ana C', 'Silva, Nuno C E', 'Geraldes, Catarina', 'Pereira, Amelia', 'Ribeiro, Leticia', 'Nascimento Costa, Jose M', 'Ribeiro, Ana B Sarmento']","['Cortesao E', 'Tenreiro R', 'Ramos S', 'Pereira M', 'Cesar P', 'Carda JP', 'Gomes M', 'Rito L', 'Magalhaes E', 'Goncalves AC', 'Silva NC', 'Geraldes C', 'Pereira A', 'Ribeiro L', 'Nascimento Costa JM', 'Ribeiro AB']","['Servico de Hematologia Clinica.

Profiling of cellular miRNAs on Adult T cell Leukemia (ATL) cells by Yamagishi et al. showed a strong decrease in expression for 96.7% of cellular miRNAs in ATL cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate the expression of miRNAs in ATL cells are still largely unknown. In this study, we compared the expression of 12 miRs previously described for being overexpress by Tax and the expression of several key components of the miRNAs biogenesis pathways in different HBZ expressing cell lines as well as in primary CD4 (+) cells from acute ATL patients. We showed that the expression of miRNAs and Dicer1 were downregulated in cells lines expressing HBZ as well as in fresh CD4 (+) cells from acute ATL patients. Using qRT-PCR, western blotting analysis and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, we showed that dicer transcription was regulated by c-Jun and JunD, two AP-1 transcription factors.

This study aimed to optimize clinical grade production of a cytokine-activated NK-cell product. NK cells were isolated either by double depletion (CD3(-), CD19(-)) or by sequential depletion and enrichment (CD3(-,) CD56(+)) via CliniMACS from leukapheresis material and cultured in vitro with interleukin (IL)-2 or IL-15. Both NK cell isolation procedures yielded comparable recovery of NK cells and levels of T-cell contamination. After culture with cytokines, the CD3(-)CD56(+) procedure resulted in NK cells of higher purity, that is, less T cells and monocytes, higher viability, and a slightly higher yield than the CD3(-)CD19- procedure. CD69, NKp44, and NKG2A expression were higher on CD3(-)CD56(+) products, whereas lysis of Daudi cells was comparable. Five days of culture led to higher expression of CD69, NKp44, and NKp30 and lysis of K562 and Daudi cell lines. Although CD69 expression and lysis of Daudi cells were slightly higher in cultures with IL-2, T-cell contamination was lower with IL-15. Therefore, further experiments were performed with CD3(-)CD56(+) products cultured with IL-15. Cryopreservation of IL-15-activated NK cells resulted in a loss of cytotoxicity (>92%), whereas thawing of isolated, uncultured NK cells followed by culture with IL-15 yielded cells with about 43% of the original lytic activity.

CMML has overlapping features of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Clonal cytogenetic changes are seen in ~30%, whereas gene mutations are seen in >90% of patients. Common cytogenetic abnormalities include; trisomy 8, -Y, -7/del(7q), trisomy 21 and del(20q), with the Mayo-French risk stratification effectively risk stratifying patients based on cytogenetic abnormalities. Gene mutations frequently involve epigenetic regulators (TET2 ~60%), modulators of chromatin (ASXL1 ~40%), spliceosome components (SRSF2 ~50%), transcription factors (RUNX1 ~15%) and signal pathways (RAS ~30%, CBL ~15%). Of these, thus far, only nonsense and frameshift ASXL1 mutations have been shown to negatively impact overall survival. This has resulted in the development of contemporary, molecularly integrated (inclusive of ASXL1 mutations) CMML prognostic models, including Molecular Mayo Model and the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies model.

Surprisingly, complete loss of miR-155 (miR-155ko/ko) did not alter the tumor free survival of the mutant mice. However, we found increased infiltration of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in miR-155 deficient tumors. In addition, cytokine/chemokine array analysis revealed altered level of cytokines that are implicated in the recruitment of MDSCs. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBP-beta, a known miR-155 target, to regulate the expression of these cytokines in the miR-155-deficient cells. Furthermore, using an allograft model, we showed that inhibition of miR-155 in cancer cells suppressed in vivo growth, which was restored by the loss of miR-155 in the microenvironment. Taken together, we have uncovered a novel tumor suppressive function of miR-155 in the tumor microenvironment, which is also dependent on miR-155 expression in the tumor cells. Because of the oncogenic as well as tumor suppressive roles of miR-155, our findings warrant caution against a systemic inhibition of miR-155 for anticancer therapy.",,"['Kim, Sinae', 'Song, Jin Hoi', 'Kim, Seokho', 'Qu, Peng', 'Martin, Betty K', 'Sehareen, Waheed S', 'Haines, Diana C', 'Lin, Pengnian C', 'Sharan, Shyam K', 'Chang, Suhwan']","['Kim S', 'Song JH', 'Kim S', 'Qu P', 'Martin BK', 'Sehareen WS', 'Haines DC', 'Lin PC', 'Sharan SK', 'Chang S']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Aging Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology, Taejeon, South Korea.', 'Aging Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology, Taejeon, South Korea.', 'Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Pathology Histotechnology Laboratory, Leidos Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn155 microRNA, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', '*MicroRNAs', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*immunology', 'Oncogenes', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology']",PMC4905460,,2016/02/06 06:00,2017/12/07 06:00,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/07 06:00 [medline]']","['7150 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7150 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Mar 8;7(10):11094-112. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7150.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['C/EBP-beta', 'MDSC', 'breast cancer', 'cytokine', 'miR-155']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for 13 regions were used to ascertain survival trends of the 34 most frequent cancers diagnosed in AYAs compared with children and older adults. RESULTS: As of 2002 through 2006, the 5-year relative survival rate for all invasive cancers in AYAs was 82.5% (standard error, 0.2%). In AYAs, 14 cancers demonstrated evidence of a statistically significant improvement in their 5-year relative survival since 1992. Survival improved less in AYAs than in children for acute myeloid leukemia and medulloblastoma. Fourteen cancers had survival improvements that were found to be less in AYAs compared with older adults, including hepatic carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, high-grade astrocytoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, pancreatic carcinoma, low-grade astrocytoma, gastric carcinoma, renal carcinoma, cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian cancer, fibromatous sarcoma, other soft tissue sarcoma, and thyroid carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the survival of several cancer types that occur frequently in AYAs are encouraging. However, survival does not appear to be improving to the same extent in AYAs as in children or older adults for several cancers. Further investment in exploring the distinct biology of tumors in this age group, and of their hosts, must be a priority in AYA oncology.",['(c) 2016 American Cancer Society.'],"['Keegan, Theresa H M', 'Ries, Lynn A G', 'Barr, Ronald D', 'Geiger, Ann M', 'Dahlke, Deborah Vollmer', 'Pollock, Bradley H', 'Bleyer, W Archie']","['Keegan TH', 'Ries LA', 'Barr RD', 'Geiger AM', 'Dahlke DV', 'Pollock BH', 'Bleyer WA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, California.', 'Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Applied Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health, College Station, Texas.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California at Davis, Davis, California.', 'St. Charles Regional Cancer Center, Bend, Oregon.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.']",['eng'],"['HHSN261201200422P/PHS HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201300308P/PHS HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/02/06 06:00,2016/08/10 06:00,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29869 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2016 Apr 1;122(7):1009-16. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29869.

SRC has long been recognized as an important oncogene, but little attention has been given to its other family members. In this report, we have studied the role of FYN in FLT3 signaling in respect to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We observed that FYN displays a strong association with wild-type FLT3 as well as oncogenic FLT3-ITD and is dependent on the kinase activity of FLT3 and the SH2 domain of FYN. We identified multiple FYN binding sites in FLT3, which partially overlapped with SRC binding sites. To understand the role of FYN in FLT3 signaling, we generated FYN overexpressing cells. We observed that expression of FYN resulted in slightly enhanced phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and p38 in response to ligand stimulation. Furthermore, FYN expression led to a slight increase in FLT3-ITD-dependent cell proliferation, but potent enhancement of STAT5 phosphorylation as well as colony formation. We also observed that FYN expression is deregulated in AML patient samples and that higher expression of FYN, in combination with FLT3-ITD mutation, resulted in enrichment of the STAT5 signaling pathway and correlated with poor prognosis in AML. Taken together our data suggest that FYN cooperates with oncogenic FLT3-ITD in cellular transformation by selective activation of the STAT5 pathway. Therefore, inhibition of FYN, in combination with FLT3 inhibition, will most likely be beneficial for this group of AML patients.",,"['Chougule, Rohit A', 'Kazi, Julhash U', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Chougule RA', 'Kazi JU', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Division of Translational Cancer Research, and Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, and Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, and Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4891096,,2016/02/06 06:00,2017/01/17 06:00,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['7128 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7128 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Mar 1;7(9):9964-74. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7128.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'FLT3-ITD', 'FYN', 'STAT5', 'acute myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is largely unknown how these mutations contribute to the disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, which have been implicated in most human cancers due to their role in post transcriptional gene regulation. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of spliceosome mutations on the expression of miRNAs in a cohort of 34 MDS patients. In total, the expression of 76 miRNAs, including mirtrons and splice site overlapping miRNAs, was accurately quantified using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. The majority of the studied miRNAs have previously been implicated in MDS. Stably expressed miRNA genes for normalization of the data were identified using GeNorm and NormFinder algorithms. High-resolution melting assays covering all mutational hotspots within SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1 (U2AF35) were developed, and all detected mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Overall, canonical miRNAs were downregulated in spliceosome mutated samples compared to wild-type (P = 0.002), and samples from spliceosome mutated patients clustered together in hierarchical cluster analyses. Among the most downregulated miRNAs were several tumor-suppressor miRNAs, including several let-7 family members, miR-423, and miR-103a. Finally, we observed that the predicted targets of the most downregulated miRNAs were involved in apoptosis, hematopoiesis, and acute myeloid leukemia among other cancer- and metabolic pathways.

A pathognomonic reciprocal chromosomal translocation results in a fusion gene coding for a protein which derives its N-terminus from a FUS/EWS/TAF15 (FET) protein family member, commonly EWS, and C-terminus containing the DNA-binding domain of an ETS transcription factor, commonly FLI1. Nearly 85% of cases express the EWS-FLI protein which functions as a transcription factor and drives oncogenesis. As the primary genomic lesion and a protein which is not expressed in normal cells, disrupting EWS-FLI function is an attractive therapeutic strategy for Ewing sarcoma. However, transcription factors are notoriously difficult targets for the development of small molecules. Improved understanding of the oncogenic mechanisms employed by EWS-FLI to hijack normal cellular programming has uncovered potential novel approaches to pharmacologically block EWS-FLI function. In this review we examine targeting the chromatin regulatory enzymes recruited to conspire in oncogenesis with a focus on the histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 inhibitors are being aggressively investigated in acute myeloid leukemia and the results of early clinical trials will help inform the future use of LSD1 inhibitors in sarcoma. High LSD1 expression is observed in Ewing sarcoma patient samples and mechanistic and preclinical data suggest LSD1 inhibition globally disrupts the function of EWS-ETS proteins.",,"['Theisen, Emily R', 'Pishas, Kathleen I', 'Saund, Ranajeet S', 'Lessnick, Stephen L']","['Theisen ER', 'Pishas KI', 'Saund RS', 'Lessnick SL']","[""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."", 'Cancer Therapeutics Laboratory, Centre for Personalized Cancer Medicine, Discipline of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA140394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183776/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (EWS-FLI fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Histone Demethylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",PMC4951237,,2016/02/06 06:00,2017/02/12 06:00,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['7124 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7124 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Apr 5;7(14):17616-30. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7124.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EWS-FLI', 'Ewing sarcoma', 'LSD1', 'epigenetics', 'methylation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program through 2011 were used to ascertain incidence trends since the year 2000 of the 40 most frequent cancers in AYAs, including tumors with nonmalignant/noninvasive behavior. RESULTS: Seven cancers in AYAs exhibited an overall increase in incidence; in 4, the annual percent change (APC) exceeded 3 (kidney, thyroid, uterus [corpus], and prostate cancer); whereas, in 3, the APC was between 0.7 and 1.4 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and cancers of the colorectum and testis). Eight cancers exhibited statistically significant decreases in incidence among AYAs: Kaposi sarcoma (KS), fibromatous neoplasms, melanoma, and cancers of the anorectum, bladder, uterine cervix, esophagus, and lung, each with an APC less than -1. AYAs had a higher proportion of noninvasive tumors than either older or younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: An examination of cancer incidence patterns in AYAs observed over the recent decade reveal a complex pattern. Thyroid cancer by itself accounts for most of the overall increase and is likely caused by overdiagnosis. Reductions in cervix and lung cancer, melanoma, and KS can be attributed to successful national prevention programs. A higher proportion of noninvasive tumors in AYAs than in children and older adults indicates a need to revise the current system of classifying tumors in this population.",['(c) 2016 American Cancer Society.'],"['Barr, Ronald D', 'Ries, Lynn A G', 'Lewis, Denise R', 'Harlan, Linda C', 'Keegan, Theresa H M', 'Pollock, Bradley H', 'Bleyer, W Archie']","['Barr RD', 'Ries LA', 'Lewis DR', 'Harlan LC', 'Keegan TH', 'Pollock BH', 'Bleyer WA']","['Departments of Pediatrics, Pathology, and Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Applied Research Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, California.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California, Davis, Davis, California.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine and Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'SEER Program', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/02/06 06:00,2016/08/10 06:00,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2015/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29867 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2016 Apr 1;122(7):1000-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29867.

In this study, we took a new approach for establishing the basis of protective vaccines against HTLV-I. We show here the potential of a passively administered HTLV-I neutralizing monoclonal antibody of rat origin (LAT-27) that recognizes epitopes consisting of the HTLV-I gp46 amino acids 191-196. LAT-27 completely blocked HTLV-I infection in vitro at a minimum concentration of 5 mug/mL.

Here we show that eIF4B is a convergent substrate of JAK/STAT/Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in Abl transformants. Both pathways phosphorylated eIF4B in Abl-transformed cells, and such redundant regulation was responsible for the limited effect of single inhibitor on Abl oncogenicity. Persistent inhibition of one signaling pathway induced the activation of the other pathway and thereby restored the phosphorylation levels of eIF4B. Simultaneous inhibition of the two pathways impaired eIF4B phosphorylation more effectively, and synergistically induced apoptosis in Abl transformed cells and inhibited the growth of engrafted tumors in nude mice. Similarly, the survival of Abl transformants exhibited a higher sensitivity to the pharmacological inhibition, when combined with the shRNA-based silence of the other pathway. Interestingly, such synergy was dependent on the phosphorylation status of eIF4B on Ser422, as overexpression of eIF4B phosphomimetic mutant S422E in the transformants greatly attenuated the synergistic effects of these inhibitors on Abl oncogenicity. In contrast, eIF4B knockdown sensitized Abl transformants to undergo apoptosis induced by the combined blockage. Collectively, the results indicate that eIF4B integrates the signals from Pim and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways in Abl-expressing leukemic cells, and is a promising therapeutic target for such cancers.",,"['Chen, Ke', 'Yang, Jianling', 'Li, Jianning', 'Wang, Xuefei', 'Chen, Yuhai', 'Huang, Shile', 'Chen, Ji-Long']","['Chen K', 'Yang J', 'Li J', 'Wang X', 'Chen Y', 'Huang S', 'Chen JL']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing 100101, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing 100101, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Immune Mechanism and Intervention on Serious Disease in Hebei Province, Department of Immunology, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050017, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing 100101, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing 100101, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing 100101, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing 100101, China.', 'College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (eIF-4B)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4891105,,2016/02/06 06:00,2017/01/17 06:00,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['7164 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7164 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Mar 1;7(9):10073-89. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7164.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'Abl oncogene', 'Pim kinase', 'eIF4B', 'tumorigenesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

BTC exhibits a low response rate to cisplatin (CDDP) treatment, and therefore, an understanding of the mechanism of CDDP resistance is urgently needed. Here, we show that BTC cells develop CDDP resistance due, in part, to upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). Phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a natural compound found in watercress, could enhance the efficacy of CDDP by degrading Mcl-1. PEITC-CDDP co-treatment also increased the rate of apoptosis of cancer stem-like side population (SP) cells and inhibited xenograft tumor growth without obvious toxic effects. In vitro, PEITC decreased reduced glutathione (GSH), which resulted in decreased GSH/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio and increased glutathionylation of Mcl-1, leading to rapid proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1. Furthermore, we identified Cys16 and Cys286 as Mcl-1 glutathionylation sites, and mutating them resulted in PEITC-mediated degradation resistant Mcl-1 protein. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that CDDP resistance is partially associated with Mcl-1 in BTC cells and we identify a novel mechanism that PEITC can enhance CDDP-induced apoptosis via glutathionylation-dependent degradation of Mcl-1. Hence, our results provide support that dietary intake of watercress may help reverse CDDP resistance in BTC patients.",,"['Li, Qiwei', 'Zhan, Ming', 'Chen, Wei', 'Zhao, Benpeng', 'Yang, Kai', 'Yang, Jie', 'Yi, Jing', 'Huang, Qihong', 'Mohan, Man', 'Hou, Zhaoyuan', 'Wang, Jian']","['Li Q', 'Zhan M', 'Chen W', 'Zhao B', 'Yang K', 'Yang J', 'Yi J', 'Huang Q', 'Mohan M', 'Hou Z', 'Wang J']","['Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Institutes of Medical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Institutes of Medical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Institutes of Medical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Institutes of Medical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'The Wistar Institute, University of Pennsylvania and Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Institutes of Medical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Institutes of Medical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gallbladder Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nasturtium/chemistry', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4891119,,2016/02/06 06:00,2016/12/31 06:00,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['7171 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7171 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Mar 1;7(9):10271-82. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7171.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'PEITC', 'biliary tract cancer', 'cisplatin', 'glutathionylation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we demonstrated that miR-199b was significantly downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and targets podocalyxin and discoidin domain receptor 1. Herein we investigated the functional role of miR-199b in AML and its prognostic implications. METHODS: Major approaches include transduction of hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow transplantation, analyses of blood lineages, histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors, and molecular and clinical data analyses of AML patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RESULTS: We first examined the relative miR-199b expression in steady state hematopoiesis and showed CD33(+) myeloid progenitors had the highest miR-199b expression. Further, silencing of miR-199b in CD34(+) cells resulted in significant increases in CFU-GM colonies. Via TCGA we analyzed the molecular and clinical characteristics of 166 AML cases to investigate a prognostic role for miR-199b. The Kaplan-Meier curves for high and low expression values of miR-199b and the observed distribution of miRNA expression revealed the highly expressed group had significantly better survival outcomes (p < 0.016, log rank test). Additionally, there was significant difference between miR-199b expression across the AML subtypes with particularly low expression found in the FAB-M5 subtype. Furthermore, FAB-M5 subtype showed a poor prognosis with a 1-year survival rate of only 25 %, compared with 51 % survival in the overall sample (p < 0.024). Furthermore, significant inverse correlation of HoxA7 and HoxB6 expression with miR-199b was observed in FAB-M5 AML patients. Molecular mutations were analyzed among miR-199b high and low AML cases. Significant correlations in terms of association and survival outcomes were observed for NPMc and IDH1 mutations. Treatment of THP-1 cells (represents M5-subtype) with HDAC inhibitors AR-42, Panobinostat, or Decitabine showed miR-199b expression was significantly elevated upon AR-42 and Panobinostat treatment. To further understand the hematopathological consequences of decreased miR-199b, we employed a bone-marrow transduce/transplant (BMT) mouse model. Interestingly, in vivo miR-199b silencing per-se in HSCs did not result in profound perturbations. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of miR-199b can lead to myeloproliferation while HDAC inhibitors restore miR-199b expression and promote apoptosis. Low miR-199b in AML patients correlates with worse overall survival and has prognostic significance for FAB-M5 subtype.",,"['Favreau, Amanda J', 'McGlauflin, Rose E', 'Duarte, Christine W', 'Sathyanarayana, Pradeep']","['Favreau AJ', 'McGlauflin RE', 'Duarte CW', 'Sathyanarayana P']","['Center for Molecular Medicine, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, 81 Research Drive, Scarborough, ME 04074 USA ; The Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469 USA.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, 81 Research Drive, Scarborough, ME 04074 USA.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, 81 Research Drive, Scarborough, ME 04074 USA ; Department of Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA USA.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, 81 Research Drive, Scarborough, ME 04074 USA ; The Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469 USA ; Department of Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA USA.']",['eng'],"['P20 GM103465/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM106391/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC4740997,,2016/02/06 06:00,2016/02/06 06:01,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-016-0033-6 [doi]', '33 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2016 Feb 3;5:4. doi: 10.1186/s40164-016-0033-6. eCollection 2015.,,,,20160203,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Bone marrow transplant', 'FAB-M5', 'HSC', 'NPM1', 'miRNA-199b']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the endogenous modulators for mast cell activation and the underlying mechanism have yet to be elucidated. Endogenous cannabinoids such as palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide or AEA), were found in peripheral tissues and have been proposed to possess autacoid activity, implying that cannabinoids may downregulate mast cell activation and local inflammation. OBJECTIVE: In order to investigate the effect of cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) agonists on mast cell activation, AEA-derived compounds were newly synthesized and evaluated for their effect on mast cell activation. METHODS: The effects of selected compounds on FcepsilonRI-induced histamine and beta-hexosaminidase release were evaluated in a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3). To further investigate the inhibitory effects of CB1R agonist in vivo, an oxazolone-induced atopic dermatitis mouse model was exploited. RESULTS: We found that CB1R inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators without causing cytotoxicity in RBL-2H3 cells and that CB1R agonists markedly and dose-dependently suppressed mast cell proliferation indicating that CB1R plays an important role in modulating antigen-dependent immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mast cell activation. We also found that topical application of CB1R agonists suppressed the recruitment of mast cells into the skin and reduced the level of blood histamine. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that CB1R agonists down-regulate mast cell activation and may be used for relieving inflammatory symptoms mediated by mast cell activation, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis.",,"['Nam, Gaewon', 'Jeong, Se Kyoo', 'Park, Bu Man', 'Lee, Sin Hee', 'Kim, Hyun Jong', 'Hong, Seung-Phil', 'Kim, Beomjoon', 'Kim, Bong-Woo']","['Nam G', 'Jeong SK', 'Park BM', 'Lee SH', 'Kim HJ', 'Hong SP', 'Kim B', 'Kim BW']","['Department of Cosmetic Science and Technology, Seowon University, Cheongju, Korea.', 'CRID Center, NeoPharm Co., Ltd., Daejeon, Korea.', 'CRID Center, NeoPharm Co., Ltd., Daejeon, Korea.', 'CRID Center, NeoPharm Co., Ltd., Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Atopy and Asthma Center and Seoul Medical Research Institute, Seoul Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Dankook University Medical College, Cheonan, Korea.', 'Department of Dermatology, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Cosmetic Science and Technology, Seowon University, Cheongju, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Ann Dermatol,Annals of dermatology,8916577,,,,PMC4737832,,2016/02/06 06:00,2016/02/06 06:01,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5021/ad.2016.28.1.22 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Dermatol. 2016 Feb;28(1):22-9. doi: 10.5021/ad.2016.28.1.22.

We labeled AMG 110 with (89)Zr or near-infrared fluorescent dye (IRDye) 800CW to study its tumor targeting and tissue distribution. METHODS: Biodistribution and tumor uptake of (89)Zr-AMG 110 was studied up to 6 d after intravenous administration to nude BALB/c mice bearing high EpCAM-expressing HT-29 colorectal cancer xenografts. Tumor uptake of (89)Zr-AMG 110 was compared with uptake in head and neck squamous cell cancer FaDu (intermediate EpCAM) and promyelocytic leukemia HL60 (EpCAM-negative) xenografts. Intratumoral distribution in HT-29 tumors was studied using 800CW-AMG 110. RESULTS: Tumor uptake of (89)Zr-AMG 110 can be clearly visualized using small-animal PET imaging up to 72 h after injection. The highest tumor uptake of (89)Zr-AMG 110 at the 40-mug dose level was observed at 6 and 24 h (respectively, 5.35 +/- 0.22 and 5.30 +/- 0.20 percentage injected dose per gram; n = 3 and 4). Tumor uptake of (89)Zr-AMG 110 was EpCAM-specific and correlated with EpCAM expression. 800CW-AMG 110 accumulated at the tumor cell surface in viable EpCAM-expressing tumor tissue. CONCLUSION: PET and fluorescent imaging provided real-time information about AMG 110 distribution and tumor uptake in vivo.

Treatment of cells with miltirone resulted in apoptosis, mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) collapses, increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and cytochrome c release. Miltirone triggered the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress identified through several key molecules of the unfolded protein response, including phosphorylated PERK, eIF2a, GRP78, GRP94, and caspase-12. Miltrone treatment also resulted in the release of Ca(2+) from the ER stores and mitochondrial Ca(2+) loading in the cells. Further research revealed that miltirone resulted in dose-dependent decrease in complex III activity and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in these cells. Miltirone-induced apoptosis, dissipation of MMP and ER stress were dramatically blocked by pretreatment with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). In contrast, treatment with ER stress inhibitor TUDCA significantly attenuated miltirone-induced ROS and apoptosis in leukemia cells. Moreover, our in vivo findings showed that administration of miltirone markedly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in U937 xenograft model with low systemic toxicity.

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia often results in peripheral blood monocytosis and has an inherent tendency to transform to acute myeloid leukemia. Clonal cytogenetic changes are seen in approximately 30% of patients, and molecular abnormalities are seen in more than 90%. Gene mutations involving TET2 ( approximately 60%), SRSF2 ( approximately 50%), ASXL1 ( approximately 40%), and RAS ( approximately 30%) are frequent, with nonsense and frameshift ASXL1 mutations being the only mutations identified thus far to have an independent negative prognostic effect on overall survival. Contemporary molecularly integrated prognostic models (inclusive of ASXL1 mutations) include the Molecular Mayo Model and the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies model. Given the lack of formal treatment and response criteria, management of CMML is often extrapolated from MDS and MPN, with allogeneic stem cell transplant being the only curative option. Hydroxyurea and other cytoreductive agents have been used to control MPN-like features, while epigenetic modifiers such as hypomethylating agents have been used for MDS-like features. Given the relatively poor response to these agents and the inherent risks associated with hematopoietic stem cell transplant, newer drugs exploiting molecular and epigenetic abnormalities in CMML are being developed. The creation of CMML-specific response criteria is a much needed step in order to improve clinical outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

In the present study, we demonstrated that ADM signaling could be involved in the impaired cellular differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells to mature granulocytes or monocytes by modulating RAMPs/CRLR expression, PI3K/Akt cascade and the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. When exogenously administered to in vitro cultures of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, ADM was shown to exert a strong proliferative effect with minimal upregulation in the expression level of monocyte antigen CD14. Notably, the experimental inhibition of ADM signaling with inhibitor ADM22-52 promoted a differentiative stimulation towards monocytic and granulocytic lineages. Moreover, based on the expression of CD31 relative to CD38, we hypothesized that an excess of ADM in bone marrow (BM) niche could increase the transendothelial migration of leukemia cells while any inhibitory event of ADM activity could raise cell retention in hyaluronate matrix by upregulating CD38. Taken into consideration the above evidence, we concluded that ADM and ADM22-52 could differently affect the growth of leukemia cells by autocrine/paracrine mechanisms and may have clinical relevance as biological targets for the intervention of tumor progression.",,"['Di Liddo, Rosa', 'Bridi, Deborah', 'Gottardi, Michele', 'De Angeli, Sergio', 'Grandi, Claudio', 'Tasso, Alessia', 'Bertalot, Thomas', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Gherlinzoni, Filippo', 'Conconi, Maria Teresa']","['Di Liddo R', 'Bridi D', 'Gottardi M', 'De Angeli S', 'Grandi C', 'Tasso A', 'Bertalot T', 'Martinelli G', 'Gherlinzoni F', 'Conconi MT']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Haematology, General Hospital, Treviso, Italy.', 'Treviso Cord Blood Bank and Hematopoietic Cell Culture Laboratory, Transfusional Center, General Hospital, Treviso, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Institute of Haematology 'L. and A.

To investigate whether a molecular favourable-risk genotype can be identified, we investigated CEBPA, NPM1 and FLT3 status and prognostic impact in a cohort of 301 patients aged 60 years or more with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, all treated intensively. Overall survival (OS) at 1 year was highest in the 12 patients (4%) that were CEBPA(DM) compared to the 76 (28%) with a mutant NPM1 and wild-type FLT3 (NPM1(MUT) FLT3(WT) ) genotype or all other patients (75%, 54%, 33% respectively), with median survival 15.2, 13.6 and 6.6 months, although the benefit was short-term (OS at 3 years 17%, 29%, 12% respectively). Combination of the CEBPA(DM) and NPM1(MUT) FLT3(WT) genotype patients defined a molecular group with favourable prognosis (P < 0.0001 in multivariate analysis), with 57% of patients alive at 1 year compared to 33% for all other patients.

A similar risk was also suspected with nilotinib, another BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in patients with CML. Objective: To assess the risk of vascular occlusive events in patients with CML treated by new generations of TKIs and provide an overall assessment of the clinical benefit. Data Sources: Two independent reviewers selected studies from PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane library database from their inception to October 21, 2014. Abstracts published during the past 3 years at international congresses and a trial register were also searched. Study Selection: Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and titles against inclusion and exclusion criteria published previously in the PROSPERO 2014 protocol: CRD42014014147. Among the 249 abstracts identified, 10 studies fulfilled the established criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two investigators independently extracted data using a standard form. Main Outcomes and Measures: Information extracted included study and patients characteristics, type of intervention and data on vascular occlusive events, overall survival, and major molecular response (MMR). The meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were computed using the Peto method. Results: Ten randomized clinical trials (3043 patients) were analyzed. Risk of vascular occlusive events was increased with dasatinib (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.33-11.18), nilotinib (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 2.07-5.63), and ponatinib (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.23-9.78) compared with imatinib in patients with CML. No significant difference was found with bosutinib (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 0.39-19.77). New-generation TKIs increased the rate of MMR at 1 year compared with imatinib (overall OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.87 to 2.63). No statistical difference in overall survival at 1 year was found (overall OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.63-2.29). Inaccessibility to individual data and time-to-event data and differences in evaluation criteria between studies could have introduced bias. Conclusions and Relevance: Dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib increase vascular occlusive events. New-generation TKIs improve MMR but not the overall survival at 1 year in patients with CML.",,"['Douxfils, Jonathan', 'Haguet, Helene', 'Mullier, Francois', 'Chatelain, Christian', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Dogne, Jean-Michel']","['Douxfils J', 'Haguet H', 'Mullier F', 'Chatelain C', 'Graux C', 'Dogne JM']","['Department of Pharmacy, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences, University of Namur, Namur, Belgium.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences, University of Namur, Namur, Belgium.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences, CHU UCL Namur, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences, CHU UCL Namur, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences, CHU UCL Namur, Belgium.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences, University of Namur, Namur, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,,,,,2016/02/06 06:00,2016/02/06 06:01,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/06 06:01 [medline]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['2485185 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.5932 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2016 May 1;2(5):625-632. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.5932.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanisms of resistance are poorly understood, they may be related to the presence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Down-regulation of the miR-203 reportedly contributes to oncogenesis and chemo-resistance in multiple cancers. We found that miR-203 expression was down-regulated in CD34 + AML cells as compared with CD34- cells isolated from patients as well as in LSC-enriched (CD34 + CD38-) cell lines KG-1a or MOLM13. Additionally, re-expression of miR-203 led to decreased cell proliferation, self-renewal, and sphere formation in LSCs. Moreover, miR-203 was found to directly target the 3'un-translated regions of survivin and Bmi-1 mRNAs affecting proliferation and self-renewal in LSCs.

Next-generation sequencing-based comprehensive mutation studies have revealed recurrent somatic CCR4 mutations in ATLL, although clinicopathological findings associated with CCR4 mutations remain to be delineated. In the current study, 184 cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma, including 113 cases of ATLL, were subjected to CCR4 mutation analysis. This sequence analysis identified mutations in 27% (30/113) of cases of ATLL and 9% (4/44) of cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified. Identified mutations included nonsense (NS) and frameshift (FS) mutations. No significant differences in clinicopathological findings were observed between ATLL cases stratified by presence of CCR4 mutation. All ATLL cases with CCR4 mutations exhibited cell-surface CCR4 positivity. Semi-quantitative CCR4 protein analysis of immunohistochemical sections revealed higher CCR4 expression in cases with NS mutations of CCR4 than in cases with wild-type (WT) CCR4. Furthermore, among ATLL cases, FS mutation was significantly associated with a poor prognosis, compared with NS mutation and WT CCR4. These results suggest that CCR4 mutation is an important determinant of the clinical course in ATLL cases, and that NS and FS mutations of CCR4 behave differently with respect to ATLL pathophysiology.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Engineered over-expression of Hoxa10 in mice results in a myeloproliferative disorder that progresses to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) over time, and in humans over-expression is associated with poor outcomes in AML. Here, we report that loss of Hoxa10 expression in mice results in reduced platelet count and platelet production, but does not affect clotting efficiency. About 40% fewer platelets were found in Hoxa10 null animals in comparison to wild type littermates. We found a nearly 50% reduction in the percentage of reticulated platelets in Hoxa10 null mice, suggesting deficient platelet production. Furthermore, Hoxa10 null animals recovered less efficiently from induced thrombocytopenia, supporting our hypothesis of defective platelet production. This also correlated with reduced colony formation potential of stem and progenitor cells seeded in megakaryocyte-enhancing conditions in vitro. Together, our results indicate that HOXA10 is important for megakaryopoiesis and platelet biogenesis.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Konieczna, Iwona M', 'DeLuca, Teresa A', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A', 'Miller, William M']","['Konieczna IM', 'DeLuca TA', 'Eklund EA', 'Miller WM']","['Chemical and Biological Engineering Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Currently at Transplant Surgery Division, Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Chemical and Biological Engineering Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Hematology Oncology Division, Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Robert H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 86 cases diagnosed with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with isolated tr8 or with tr8 and other additional cytogenetic aberrations diagnosed and treated at the Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology between July 2002 and March 2013 were reviewed. RESULTS: The median survival of the entire group was 23.0 months, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) developed in 43% (37/86) patients within the follow up time. The univariate analysis revealed that overall survival (OS) was correlated with age, thrombocytopenia, absolute neutrophil count, marrow blasts, cytogenetic status and red blood cell transfusion at diagnosis, and the multivariate analysis revealed that age, marrow blasts, cytogenetic status and transfusion dependence were independent parameters for the OS. The cytogenetic complexity and marrow blasts had the strongest impact on the AML transformation by multivariate analysis. Comparing the two prognostic systems, both two systems could successfully discriminate risk groups for survival. IPSS-R was more refined than IPSS for predicting OS, but had no advantage in predicting the risk of AML development. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the influence of clinical factors on the prognosis of 86 Chinese MDS patients with trisomy 8. In addition, IPSS-R can further refine prognostic discrimination in the IPSS risk categories.",,"['Yue, Qing Fang', 'Chen, Lei', 'She, Xiao Mei', 'Hu, Bin', 'Hu, Yu', 'Zou, Ping', 'Liu, Xin Yue']","['Yue QF', 'Chen L', 'She XM', 'Hu B', 'Hu Y', 'Zou P', 'Liu XY']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, ShaanXi Provincial People's Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi, P.R.

Recently, we and others reported recurrent somatic BCOR loss-of-function mutations in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). However, the role of BCOR in normal hematopoiesis is largely unknown. Here, we explored the function of BCOR in myeloid cells using myeloid murine models with Bcor conditional loss-of-function or overexpression alleles. Bcor mutant bone marrow cells showed significantly higher proliferation and differentiation rates with upregulated expression of Hox genes. Mutation of Bcor reduced protein levels of RING1B, an H2A ubiquitin ligase subunit of PRC1 family complexes and reduced H2AK119ub upstream of upregulated HoxA genes. Global RNA expression profiling in murine cells and AML patient samples with BCOR loss-of-function mutation suggested that loss of BCOR expression is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and myeloid differentiation.

Using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, genome-wide DNA methylation and copy number analysis together with whole exome, targeted deep- and Sanger sequencing at diagnosis, we identified mutations in established chronic lymphocytic leukemia driver genes in nine patients (69%), non-coding mutations (PAX5 enhancer region) in three patients and genomic complexity in two patients. Branching evolutionary trajectories predominated (n=9/13), revealing intra-tumoural epi- and genetic heterogeneity and sub-clonal competition before therapy. Of the patients subsequently requiring treatment, two had sub-clonal TP53 mutations that would not be detected by standard methodologies, three qualified for the very-low-risk category defined by integrated mutational and cytogenetic analysis and yet had established or putative driver mutations and one patient developed progressive, therapy-refractory disease associated with the emergence of an IGHV-U clone.

GFI1, a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor, exerts its function by recruiting histone deacetylases to target genes. We present data that low expression of GFI1 is associated with an inferior prognosis of AML patients. To elucidate the mechanism behind this, we generated a humanized mouse strain with reduced GFI1 expression (GFI1-KD). Here we show that AML development induced by onco-fusion proteins such as MLL-AF9 or NUP98-HOXD13 is accelerated in mice with low human GFI1 expression. Leukemic cells from animals that express low levels of GFI1 show increased H3K9 acetylation compared to leukemic cells from mice with normal human GFI1 expression, resulting in the upregulation of genes involved in leukemogenesis. We investigated a new epigenetic therapy approach for this subgroup of AML patients. We could show that AML blasts from GFI1-KD mice and from AML patients with low GFI1 levels were more sensitive to treatment with histone acetyltransferase inhibitors than cells with normal GFI1 expression levels. We suggest therefore that GFI1 has a dose-dependent role in AML progression and development. GFI1 levels are involved in epigenetic regulation, which could open new therapeutic approaches for AML patients.",,"['Hones, J M', 'Botezatu, L', 'Helness, A', 'Vadnais, C', 'Vassen, L', 'Robert, F',

We examined trends in early death and survival among 3935 patients aged 0-39 years with de novo AML in California during 1988-2011 and investigated the associations between sociodemographic and selected clinical factors and outcomes. Early death declined from 9.7% in 1988-1995 to 7.1% in 2004-2011 (P = 0.062), and survival improved substantially over time. However, 5-year survival was still only 50% (95% confidence interval 47-53%) even in the most recent treatment period (2004-2011). Overall, the main factors associated with poor outcomes were older age at diagnosis, treatment at hospitals not affiliated with National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centres, and black race/ethnicity. For patients diagnosed during 1996-2011, survival was lower among those who lacked health insurance compared to those with public or private insurance.

Although most effort has been focused on development of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors, enrichment of these small-molecule inhibitors in the tumor tissue can also have a profound impact on treatment outcomes. Here, we report that a 2-hour exposure of the T315I-mutant CML cells to 10 mumol/L of the multikinase inhibitor TG101209 suppressed BCR-ABL-independent signaling and caused cell-cycle arrest at G2-M. Further increase in drug concentration to 17.5 mumol/L blocked phosphorylation of the mutant BCR-ABL kinase and its downstream JAK2 and STAT5. The effective dosage to overcome therapy resistance identified in an in vitro setting serves as a guidance to develop the proper drug formulation for in vivo efficacy. A targeted formulation was developed to achieve sustained bone marrow TG101209 concentration at or above 17.5 mumol/L for effective killing of CML cells in vivo Potent inhibition of leukemia cell growth and extended survival were observed in two murine models of CML treated with 40 mg/kg intravenously administered targeted TG101209, but not with the untargeted drug at the same dosage.

We initially studied 558 patients from diagnosis and found significant differences in median time to first treatment (TTFT) among Stage A patients and in overall survival (OS) for the whole cohort, between cases with <97% and 97-98.99% identity and between cases with 97-98.99% and >/=99% identity, when cases from the IGHV3-21 Stereotype Subset #2 were excluded. A significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) and OS between those with <97% and 97-98.99% identity, but not between those with 97-98.99% and >/=99% identity was also observed in a validation cohort comprising 460 patients in the UK CLL4 trial. Cox Regression analyses in the Stage A cohort revealed that a model which incorporated <97%, 97-98.99% and >/=99% identity as subgroups, was a better predictor of TTFT in CLL than using the 98% cut-off. Multivariate analysis selected the three mutational subgroups as independent predictors of TTFT in Stage A patients, and of OS in the diagnostic cohort.

However, contradictory data exists on whether Tetherin inhibits acute retrovirus infection in vivo. Previously, we reported that Tetherin-mediated inhibition of Friend retrovirus (FV) replication at 2 weeks post-infection correlated with stronger natural killer, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell responses. Here, we further investigated the role of Tetherin in counteracting retrovirus replication in vivo. FV infection levels were similar between wild-type (WT) and Tetherin KO mice at 3 to 7 days post-infection despite removal of a potent restriction factor, Apobec3/Rfv3. However, during this phase of acute infection, Tetherin enhanced myeloid dendritic cell (DC) function. DCs from infected, but not uninfected, WT mice expressed significantly higher MHC class II and the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 compared to Tetherin KO DCs. Tetherin-associated DC activation during acute FV infection correlated with stronger NK cell responses. Furthermore, Tetherin+ DCs from FV-infected mice more strongly stimulated FV-specific CD4+ T cells ex vivo compared to Tetherin KO DCs. The results link the antiretroviral and immunomodulatory activity of Tetherin in vivo to improved DC activation and MHC class II antigen presentation.",,"['Li, Sam X', 'Barrett, Bradley S', 'Guo, Kejun', 'Kassiotis, George', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Gibbert, Kathrin', 'Santiago, Mario L']","['Li SX', 'Barrett BS', 'Guo K', 'Kassiotis G', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Dittmer U', 'Gibbert K', 'Santiago ML']","['Department of Medicine, Aurora, University of Colorado Denver, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Aurora, University of Colorado Denver, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Aurora, University of Colorado Denver, CO 80045, USA.', 'The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, London, UK.', 'Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840, USA.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital in Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital in Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Aurora, University of Colorado Denver, CO 80045, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI116603/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI112418/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI052066/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001082/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (BST2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytidine Deaminase/deficiency/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/analysis/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism/*pathology/veterinary', 'Virus Replication']",PMC4742778,,2016/02/06 06:00,2017/01/11 06:00,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['srep20425 [pii]', '10.1038/srep20425 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Feb 5;6:20425. doi: 10.1038/srep20425.,,,,20160205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there have been improvements in the treatment of patients frequent relapse lead to a poor prognosis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether HOXA5 may be used as a target for gene therapy in leukemia in order to provide a new treatment. Mononuclear cells were extracted from the bone marrow according to the clinical research aims. After testing for ALL in the acute stage, the relative mRNA and protein expression of HOXA5 was detected in the ALL remission groups (n=25 cases per group) and the control group [n=20 cases, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)]. Gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) was used to investigate the effect of silencing HOXA5 after small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection to Jurkat cells. The HOXA5-specific siRNA was transfected to Jurkat cells using lipofectamine. The experiment was divided into the experimental group (liposomal transfection of HOXA5 targeting siRNA), the negative control group (liposomal transfection of cells with negative control siRNA) and the control group (plus an equal amount of cells and culture media only). Western blotting and quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QFPCR) were used to detect the relative HOXA5 mRNA expression and protein distribution in each cell group. Cell distribution in the cell cycle and the rate of cells undergoing apoptosis were determined using flow cytometry. The expression of HOXA5 at the mRNA and protein levels in the acute phase of ALL was significantly higher than that in ALL in the remission and control groups. In cells transfected with HOXA5-specific siRNA, the expression of HOXA5 at the mRNA and protein levels decreased significantly (P<0.05). The distribution of cells in the cell cycle was also altered. Specifically, more cells were present in the G0/G1 phase compared to the S phase (P<0.05). In addition, the apoptotic rate was significantly higher in cells transfected with HOXA5specific siRNA (P<0.05). In conclusion, high expression levels of HOXA5 mRNA and protein in children with ALL indicate that HOXA5 is closely associated with childhood ALL. In addition, HOXA5-specific siRNA effectively silences HOXA5 gene expression and induces apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in Jurkat cells, thus inhibiting cell proliferation.",,"['Huang, Hui-Ping', 'Liu, Wen-Jun', 'Guo, Qu-Lian', 'Bai, Yong-Qi']","['Huang HP', 'Liu WJ', 'Guo QL', 'Bai YQ']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sichuan Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan 646000, P.R.

Intention to treat (ITT) analysis indicated that the proportion of patients falling into optimal, warning and failure ELN categories were 89%, 6%, 6% at 3 months, 78%, 17% and 6% at 6 months, and 75%, 13% and 13% at 12 months, respectively. Rates of optimal response at 3 months were 75% for IM400, 90% for IM800, 89% for dasatinib and 97% for nilotinib; 41%, 80%, 86% and 89% at 6 months; and 47%, 77%, 76% and 87% at 12 months, respectively.

Malignant CLL cells characteristically accumulate in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen of CLL patients. There is evidence that CLL cells express Ang2 and Tie1, two central components of the Ang-Tie2 pro-angiogenic pathway. Central to blood vessel development and maintenance, at present it remains unclear how the Ang-Tie2 pathway modulates CLL pathophysiology. Here we evaluate the status of the Ang-Tie2 pathway in CLL cells and assess Ang1 levels in plasma/cell medium from CLL samples. To understand how angiopoietins in the microenvironment regulate the components of Ang-Tie2 pathway, survival, migration, and metabolic fitness of CLL cells, we exposed CLL cells to recombinant angiopoietins. CLL plasma and CLL cells in culture present significant lower levels of Ang1. CLL cells simultaneously express Ang1, Ang2, and Tie1 mRNA, but lack that of Tie2 and its regulator, VE-PTP. Exposure to Ang1 confers survival advantage in the long-term, whereas Ang2 and trebananib, an angiopoietin blocker, proved detrimental. Angiopoietins differentially modulate expression of Ang1, Ang2, and Tie1 transcripts. Ang2, but not Ang1, induces the concomitant and transient expression of Tie2 and VE-PTP mRNA. Both angiopoietins, particularly Ang2, increase CLL-Tie1 expression and Ang1 clearly induces chemotaxis and transendothelial-like migration of CLL cells. Besides, changes in caspase and ATP content corroborate the sensitivity of CLL cells to angiopoietin exposure. Altogether, this work shows that angiopoietins regulate the fate of CLL cells in a Tie2-independent manner and highlights the potential of the Ang-Tie2 pathway as a therapeutic target in CLL research.",,"['Aguirre Palma, Luis Mario', 'Flamme, Hanna', 'Gerke, Iris', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Aguirre Palma LM', 'Flamme H', 'Gerke I', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, Cologne, Germany.', 'Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, Cologne, Germany. karl-anton.kreuzer@uni-koeln.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Microenviron,Cancer microenvironment : official journal of the International Cancer Microenvironment Society,101322634,,,,PMC4842182,,2016/02/06 06:00,2016/02/06 06:01,['2016/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12307-016-0180-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12307-016-0180-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Microenviron. 2016 Apr;9(1):13-26. doi: 10.1007/s12307-016-0180-7.

A total of 147 pediatric ALL patients diagnosed by our hospital between January 2011 and December 2014 were included in the case group, and 102 healthy people who received a physical examination during the same time frame in our hospital were included in the control group. DNA sequencing was applied for site determination and genotyping of the DPYD 85T > C, 2194G > A, 1156G > T, and IVS14 + 1G > A polymorphisms. The genotype and allele frequencies of the two groups were compared. A significant difference was found in the comparison of the mutant gene and allele frequencies of the 85T > C polymorphism between the case and control groups (P < 0.05). The CT and CC genotypes in the 85T > C polymorphism were associated with the risk of the disease (OR = 1.592, 95 % CI = 1.010-2.509), suggesting that the recessive gene (85C) was more likely to lead to the occurrence of ALL compared with the dominant gene (85T) (P < 0.05). Patients carrying the C allele of the 85T > C polymorphism presented higher damage of their liver functions and higher infection rates compared with patients carrying the non-C allele (P < 0.05). A higher proportion of liver function damage and a higher infection rate were found in patients with the GA genotype in the IVS14 + 1G > A polymorphism compared with the GG genotype (P < 0.05). The complete remission (CR) rate in patients with the GG genotype in the IVS14 + 1G > A polymorphism was higher than in patients with the GA genotype (P = 0.020). After 5-fluorouracil/calcium folinate (5-FU/CF)-based chemotherapy, the event-free survival (EFS) rate of patients with the TT genotype was higher than patients with the CT and CC genotypes (P < 0.05). Our results revealed that the C allele of the 85T > C polymorphism might be associated with susceptibility to pediatric ALL. Patients carrying the C allele may have an increased risk of ALL.

Deviations in the folate flux resulting from single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding folate-dependent enzymes may affect the susceptibility to leukemia. This case-control study aimed to assess associations among MTHFR (C677T, A1298C) and TPMT (*2, *3A) mutations as well as to evaluate the synergistic effects of combined genotypes for both genes. Therefore, these genetic variants may lead to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility, in a Mexican population study. METHODS: DNA samples obtained from 70 children with ALL and 152 age-matched controls (range, 1-15 years) were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect MTHFR C677T and A1298C and TPMT*2 and TPMT*3A genotypes. RESULTS: The frequency of the MTHFR A1298C CC genotype was statistically significant (odds ratio [OR], 6.48; 95% 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.26-33.2; p=0.025). In addition, the combined 677CC+1298AC genotype exhibited a statistically significant result (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.82; p=0.023). No significant results were obtained from the MTHFR (C677T CT, C677T TT) or TPMT (*2, *3A) genotypes. More importantly, no association between the synergistic effects of either gene (MTHFR and/or TPMT) and susceptibility to ALL was found.

CASES: Two cases are presented, both male, with the first aged 31 years and the second aged 54 years. Both initially presented with chest pain and shortness of breath, and CT scans found an anterior mediastinal mass and left pleural effusion in both subjects. Cytological smears of pleural fluid in each case showed monotonous small-to-medium-sized lymphoid cells with moderate chromatin condensation and round-to-convoluted nuclei. There were prominent apoptotic bodies and mitosis in both cases. Immunohistochemistry of cell blocks demonstrated their T cell lineage and lymphoblastic nature. Diagnosis of T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma was determined by a 3-step algorithmic approach using complete panels of immunohistochemical markers (CD3, CD20, Ki-67, CD10, CD5, CD99, CD1a, CD34, CD4, CD8, TDT, CD7, CD2 and CD68).

We analyzed prognostic factors in a contemporary cohort of patients with unresectable MPM who received pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. METHODS: This single-institution analysis included patients with MPM who were managed nonsurgically from 2000 to 2013. Variables correlated with overall survival (OS) included sex, performance status (PS), asbestos exposure, tumor laterality, histology, clinical stage, initial positron emission tomography maximum standardized uptake value, hemoglobin level, platelet count, lymphocyte count, white cell and neutrophil counts, treatment type, and clinical benefit from treatment. OS was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and significance (p < 0.05) of prognostic factors was analyzed by the log-rank test and Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 191 patients met the study criteria: median age 71 years (range 46-90), 147 men (77%), 128 epithelioid tumors (67%), and 157 cases of stage III or IV MPM (82%). Median OS for all patients was 13.4 months. According to a univariate analysis, histology (p < 0.001), platelet count (< or = 450,000 versus >450,000, p < 0.001), initial PS (0-1 versus > or = 2), maximum standardized uptake value (< or = 8.1 versus >8.1, p = 0.037), and lymphocyte counts (p = 0.019) were associated with OS. According to a multivariable analysis, only histology, platelet count, and PS were independent prognostic factors. Epithelioid histology, PS, and elevated lymphocyte count at diagnosis were significantly associated with clinical benefit from first-line chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the significance of elements of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer prognostic scoring systems, identify factors associated with clinical benefit from chemotherapy, and emphasize the impact of histology and clinical benefit of chemotherapy on outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2015 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Whereas there are no current recommendations for the management of these relapses, the children's quality of life is an important issue. We studied the outcomes, including 1-year overall survival, complete remission, and quality of life, of 19 children with ALL who relapsed within the first year after their transplantation treated in the 5 participating centers between 2000 and 2011 Patients were distributed as follows: supportive care only (group A), outpatient treatment (mainly steroid and vincristine, group B), or intensive inpatient treatment (group C). There were no significant differences in 1-year overall survival (31.5% for the entire cohort) or remission rate for time between transplantation and relapse (< 6 months or 6 to 12 months), transplantation or disease characteristics, or treatment group. However, time spent in hospital (for treatment and complications) significantly differed between treatment groups B and C (20.8% +/- 13.0 versus 59.1% +/- 32.9, respectively; P < .05). No differences in organ toxicities, school attendance, or Lansky scores were found between treatment groups. Our sample size-limited data indicate, in a prepersonalized medicine era, that children treated with steroid and vincristine have the same prognosis as those treated with intensive therapy, but they may benefit from improved quality of life. Nevertheless, new therapeutic strategies are required and future prospective trials would help to establish recommendations.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We report our experience in 7 patients with DC who underwent allogeneic transplantation using a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) preparative regimen that contained chemotherapy only (no radiation). This RIC regimen, designed specifically for patients with DC, contained alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan (with melphalan at 50% reduced dosing), with the goal of decreasing toxicity and improving outcome. All 7 patients engrafted, with none developing mixed chimerism or rejection. Two patients experienced acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and 1 went on to develop limited chronic GVHD of the skin. Five patients remain alive and well at a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 14 to 57 months).

Previously, we reported that myeloid leukemic cells express a unique 82kDa-proMMP-9 variant on their cell surface that is not affected by its natural inhibitor. In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize 82kDa-proMMP-9. Flow cytometry analysis using these antibodies revealed significant surface expression of 82kDa-proMMP-9 in monocytes, but minimal amounts in T and B cells isolated from peripheral blood of nine healthy donors and 22 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In all AML patients, blasts expressed 82kDa-proMMP-9 at levels of 4%-46%, with significantly higher levels in patients with a better risk defined according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (rho = -0.748, p < 0.001) and favorable phenotype according to the French-American-British classification (p = 0.02) compared with patients with adverse prognoses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the diagnostic accuracy of 82kDa-proMMP-9 measurement in AML blasts (area under the curve: 0.893 [0.739-1.000], p = 0.019). It led us to define a cutoff value of 11.5% for identifying patients with lower NCCN risk (p = 0.005) and with a tendency toward a higher probability of response to anthracycline-based therapy (p = 0.109) and increased event-free survival (p = 0.24). Thus, 82kDa-proMMP-9 expression on blasts may represent a novel independent marker of prognosis in patients with AML.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies indicate that microRNAs may also play a role in up-regulating mRNA transcription levels, although a definitive mechanism has not been established. Double-helical DNA is capable of forming triple-helical structures through Hoogsteen and reverse Hoogsteen interactions in the major groove of the duplex, and we show physical evidence (i.e., NMR, FRET, SPR) that purine or pyrimidine-rich microRNAs of appropriate length and sequence form triple-helical structures with purine-rich sequences of duplex DNA, and identify microRNA sequences that favor triplex formation. We developed an algorithm (Trident) to search genome-wide for potential triplex-forming sites and show that several mammalian and non-mammalian genomes are enriched for strong microRNA triplex binding sites. We show that those genes containing sequences favoring microRNA triplex formation are markedly enriched (3.3 fold, p<2.2 x 10(-16)) for genes whose expression is positively correlated with expression of microRNAs targeting triplex binding sequences. This work has thus revealed a new mechanism by which microRNAs could interact with gene promoter regions to modify gene transcription.",,"['Paugh, Steven W', 'Coss, David R', 'Bao, Ju', 'Laudermilk,

At present, there are only two consolidation treatment alternatives: Chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of unrelated and related hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, versus chemotherapy consolidation in pediatric patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision tree was constructed with life-years gained as the outcome. Costs and probabilities were extracted from the literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and acceptability curves were computed. The cost-effectiveness threshold was three times the 2010 per capita gross domestic product. RESULTS: When compared to consolidation chemotherapy cycles, related and unrelated hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of COP$ 9,226,421 (USD$ 4,820) and COP$ 6,544,116 (USD$ 3,419) respectively, which are lower than the per capita gross domestic product (COP$ 12,047,418, USD$ 6,294). Transplant proved to be cost-effective in 70% of the simulations and had a higher probability of the willingness to pay being over than COP$ 7,200,000 (USD$ 3,762). CONCLUSION: In Colombia, related and unrelated hematopoietic stem-cell transplants are cost-effective alternatives to consolidation treatment for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia in pediatric patients.",,"['Garcia, Mario', 'Chicaiza, Liliana Alejandra', 'Quitian, Hoover', 'Linares, Adriana', 'Ramirez, Oscar']","['Garcia M', 'Chicaiza LA', 'Quitian H', 'Linares A', 'Ramirez O']","['Facultad de Ciencias Economicas, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, D.C, Colombia.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Economicas, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, D.C, Colombia.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, D.C, Colombia.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, D.C, Colombia.', 'Centro Medico Imbanaco, Unidad de Trasplante de Medula Osea, Cali, Colombia.']",['spa'],,['Journal Article'],Colombia,Biomedica,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,8205605,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Allografts/economics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colombia', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/*economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*economics/therapy', 'Models, Economic', 'Risk']",,,2016/02/06 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0120-41572015000400013 [pii]', '10.7705/biomedica.v35i4.2563 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomedica. 2015 Oct-Dec;35(4):549-56. doi: 10.7705/biomedica.v35i4.2563.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Costo-efectividad de los tratamientos de consolidacion para la leucemia mieloide aguda en ninos en riesgo alto en el sistema de salud colombiano.,,,,,

Hence, more transplants are performed in more affluent countries. The impact of economic factors on patient outcome is less defined. We analyzed retrospectively a defined cohort of 102,549 patients treated with an allogeneic (N = 37,542; 37%) or autologous (N = 65,007; 63%) HSCT. They were transplanted by one of 404 HSCT centers in 25 European countries between 1999 and 2006. We searched for associations between center-specific microeconomic or country-specific macroeconomic factors and outcome. Center patient-volume and center program-duration were significantly and systematically associated with improved survival after allogeneic HSCT (HR 0.87; 0.84-0.91 per 10 patients; p < 0.0001; HR 0.90;0.85-0.90 per 10 years; p < 0.001) and autologous HSCT (HR 0.91;0.87-0.96 per 10 patients; p < 0.001; HR 0.93;0.87-0.99 per 10 years; p = 0.02). The product of Health Care Expenditures by Gross National Income/capita was significantly associated in multivariate analysis with all endpoints (R(2) = 18%; for relapse free survival) after allogeneic HSCT. Data indicate that country- and center-specific economic factors are associated with distinct, significant, systematic, and clinically relevant effects on survival after HSCT.

The aim of our retrospective analysis was to assess the efficacy of azacitidine treatment in patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome and with acute myeloid leukemia who had received treatment in hospital and in an ambulatory care setting. Offsets in the course of azacitidine administration and discontinuations of treatment have a negative impact on patients' response to the therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 31 patients. Sixteen patients received azacitidine in an ambulatory care setting, 15 patients within their hospitalization. RESULTS: A hematologic response was achieved in 48% of the patients. Forty-one percent of the cycles were delayed. In an outpatient setting, 62% of the cycles were administered systematically, while during hospitalization the patients received 54% of cycles on time.

An early case capture (ECC) surveillance program was piloted in seven state cancer registries to register pediatric cancer cases within 30 days of diagnosis. We sought to determine the quality of ECC data and understand pilot implementation. METHODS: We used quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate ECC. We assessed data quality by comparing demographic and clinical characteristics from the initial ECC submission to a resubmission of ECC pilot data and to the most recent year of routinely collected cancer data for each state individually and in aggregate. We conducted telephone focus groups with registry staff to determine ECC practices and difficulties in August and September 2013. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded to identify themes. RESULTS: Comparing ECC initial submissions with submissions for all states, ECC data were nationally representative for age (9.7 vs. 9.9 years) and sex (673 of 1,324 [50.9%] vs. 42,609 of 80,547 [52.9%] male cases), but not for primary site (472 of 1,324 [35.7%] vs. 27,547 of 80,547 [34.2%] leukemia/lymphoma cases), behavior (1,219 of 1,324 [92.1%] vs. 71,525 of 80,547 [88.8%] malignant cases), race/ethnicity (781 of 1,324 [59.0%] vs. 64,518 of 80,547 [80.1%] white cases), or diagnostic confirmation (1,233 of 1,324 [93.2%] vs. 73,217 of 80,547 [90.9%] microscopically confirmed cases). When comparing initial ECC data with resubmission data, differences were seen in race/ethnicity (808 of 1,324 [61.1%] vs. 1,425 of 1,921 [74.2%] white cases), primary site (475 of 1,324 [35.9%] vs. 670 of 1,921 [34.9%] leukemia/lymphoma cases), and behavior (1,215 of 1,324 [91.8%] vs. 1,717 of 1,921 [89.4%] malignant cases). Common themes from focus group analysis included implementation challenges and facilitators, benefits of ECC, and utility of ECC data. CONCLUSIONS: ECC provided data rapidly and reflected national data overall with differences in several data elements. ECC also expanded cancer reporting infrastructure and increased data completeness and timeliness. Although challenges related to timeliness and increased work burden remain, indications suggest that researchers may reliably use these data for pediatric cancer studies.",,"['Puckett, Mary', 'Neri, Antonio', 'Rohan, Elizabeth', 'Clerkin, Castine', 'Underwood, J Michael', 'Ryerson, A Blythe', 'Stewart, Sherri L']","['Puckett M', 'Neri A', 'Rohan E', 'Clerkin C', 'Underwood JM', 'Ryerson AB', 'Stewart SL']","['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Epidemic Intelligence Service, Atlanta, GA; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Atlanta, GA.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Atlanta, GA.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Atlanta, GA.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Atlanta, GA.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Atlanta, GA.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Atlanta, GA.', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Atlanta, GA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Public Health Rep,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",9716844,,IM,"['Child', 'Data Accuracy', 'Data Collection/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC4716480,,2016/02/05 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2016/02/05 06:00'],"['2016/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/003335491613100119 [doi]'],ppublish,Public Health Rep. 2016 Jan-Feb;131(1):126-36. doi: 10.1177/003335491613100119.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on previous studies implicating ABCC4/MRP4 in the transport of nucleosides, we hypothesized that cytarabine is sensitive to ABCC4-mediated efflux, thereby decreasing its cytotoxic response against AML blasts. The uptake of cytarabine and its monophosphate metabolite was found to be facilitated in ABCC4-expressing vesicles and intracellular retention was significantly impaired by overexpression of human ABCC4 or mouse Abcc4 (P < 0.05). ABCC4 was expressed highly in AML primary blasts and cell lines, and cytotoxicity of cytarabine in cells was increased in the presence of the ABCC4 inhibitors MK571 or sorafenib, as well as after ABCC4 siRNA. In Abcc4-null mice, cytarabine-induced hematological toxicity was enhanced and ex vivo colony-forming assays showed that Abcc4-deficiency sensitized myeloid progenitors to cytarabine. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that ABCC4 plays a protective role against cytarabine-mediated insults in leukemic and host myeloid cells.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Our three-dimensional gene map demonstrates that a true tumour type may be divided into subtypes, each defined by a unique gene expression pattern. Clinical data analyses demonstrate that most cell samples of an identified subtype share similar survival times, survival indicators and International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores and indicate that distinct subtypes identified by our algorithms exhibit different overall survival times, survival ratios and IPI scores.

The vRNP complex is an important determinant of virus pathogenicity and host adaptation, implying that its function can be affected by host factors. In our study, we identified host protein Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) as an inhibitor of IAV replication, since depletion of MOV10 resulted in a significant increase in virus yield. MOV10 inhibited the polymerase activity in a minigenome system through RNA-mediated interaction with the NP subunit of vRNP complex. Importantly, we found that the interaction between MOV10 and NP prevented the binding of NP to importin-alpha, resulting in the retention of NP in the cytoplasm. Both the binding of MOV10 to NP and its inhibitory effect on polymerase activity were independent of its helicase activity. These results suggest that MOV10 acts as an anti-influenza virus factor through specifically inhibiting the nuclear transportation of NP and subsequently inhibiting the function of the vRNP complex. IMPORTANCE: The interaction between the influenza virus vRNP complex and host factors is a major determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity. Our study identified MOV10 as a novel host restriction factor for the influenza virus life cycle since it inhibited the viral growth rate. Conversely, importin-alpha has been shown as a determinant for influenza tropism and a positive regulator for viral polymerase activity in mammalian cells but not in avian cells. MOV10 disrupted the interaction between NP and importin-alpha, suggesting that MOV10 could also be an important host factor for influenza virus transmission and pathogenicity. Importantly, as an interferon (IFN)-inducible protein, MOV10 exerted a novel mechanism for IFNs to inhibit the replication of influenza viruses. Furthermore, our study potentially provides a new drug design strategy, the use of molecules that mimic the antiviral mechanism of MOV10.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, observational, single institutional study was conducted to evaluate the clinical features, microbiological aspects, risk factors influencing the outcome of high risk FN during intensive therapy in acute leukemia. RESULTS: Among 115 febrile episodes, though 94 (81.7%) had indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) at the time of diagnosis of FN, infective foci clinically were identified in 70.4% of episodes, with lung as the major site (25.2%) followed by CVC (17.4%). Microbiological documentation was possible in 33% (n = 40) episodes. Gram-negative bacteria isolates were 58.3% and Gram-positive isolates were 41.7% of which Pseudomonas was the predominant Gram-negative and Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolate. Piperacillin-tazobactam + amikacin were used as first line antibiotic in 93% episodes and second line antibiotics were necessary in 73% episodes. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor was used in 60.9% episodes of high risk FN mostly in acute myeloid leukemia consolidation patients. Eighteen episodes (15.7%) were assigned to have invasive fungal disease. Eleven (9.6%) out of 115 high risk FN had a fatal outcome. Presence of pulmonary infection predicted for fatal outcome (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study reports the outcome of high risk FN in patients with acute leukemia undergoing intensive chemotherapy. Gram-negative isolates are highly sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactum and hence in a cost restraint scenario, carbapenems needs to be judiciously used. Focus of Infection in lungs during FN predicted higher fatal outcomes.",,"['Rajendranath, R', 'Balasubramaniyum, V K K', 'Vijayakumar, V', 'Ganesan, P', 'Tenali, G S']","['Rajendranath R', 'Balasubramaniyum VK', 'Vijayakumar V', 'Ganesan P', 'Tenali GS']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA)Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Catheter-Related Infections/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lung Diseases/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/10/01 00:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2016/02/05 06:00'],"['2016/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2014_51_4_481_175303 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.175303 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2014 Oct-Dec;51(4):481-6. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.175303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: The aim was to study patterns of presentation, source of infection, management and outcome and to evaluate the factors which may correlate with outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospective data of FN patients at a tertiary care oncology teaching hospital in India between 2007 and 2012. A standardized form was filled for each patient. Patient management was at the discretion of the treating physician. Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score was retrospectively calculated. Failure of therapy was defined as death, organ failure, shifting from outpatient to inpatient or requirement of intensive care support. SPSS version 16 was used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 388 FN episodes were included: 256 in hematolymphoid and 132 in solid tumor patients. 156 episodes were high-risk by MASCC score. Focus of infection was clinical in 45% and radiologic in 16%. Blood cultures were positive in 18% cases, most commonly Gram-negative organisms (72%). 93% patients were treated with an antibiotic combination of third-generation cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor, with aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone. Antibiotic sensitivity to ceftriaxone was low at 38% while sensitivity to cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam ranged between 50% and 55% and for carbapenems 75%. Failure of therapy occurred in 156 episodes, most commonly due to the need for second line antibiotics. Mortality was 5.5%. On univariate analysis, MASCC score, age, type of malignancy, prophylactic growth factors, presence of focus of infection, hemoglobin and nadir platelet count correlated with FN complications. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteremia continues to be the predominant cause of FN in our setup.",,"['Noronha, V', 'Joshi, A', 'Patil, V M', 'Bhosale, B', 'Muddu, V K', 'Banavali, S', 'Kelkar, R', 'Prabhash, K']","['Noronha V', 'Joshi A', 'Patil VM', 'Bhosale B', 'Muddu VK', 'Banavali S', 'Kelkar R', 'Prabhash K']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*complications/microbiology', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/10/01 00:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2016/02/05 06:00'],"['2016/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2014_51_4_470_175306 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.175306 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2014 Oct-Dec;51(4):470-4. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.175306.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Opportunistic infections in these patients are commonly encountered. However, malignancies in such patients also do occur. AIM: The aim was to study the spectrum of malignancies in HIV-positive patients at a tertiary health care center. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases were retrieved from pathology record files at our Institute from January 2003 to December 2008. The follow-up was obtained from Medical oncology records. The morphology of each case was reviewed along with immunohistochemistry wherever done. RESULTS: There were 61 such cases (51 males, 10 females). The age range was 7-78 years with a median of 35 years. The clinical presentation varied according to the malignancy. The largest group was non-Hodgkin lymphoma (18 nodal, 23 extra-nodal). The others included carcinoma breast (4), chronic myeloid leukemia (3), Burkitt Leukemia (2), squamous cell carcinoma anal region (2), multiple myeloma (2) and one each of miscellaneous malignancies (7). CONCLUSION: Malignancies in HIV positive individual occurred in younger individuals. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, especially extra-nodal lymphomas, were the most common malignancy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of retrospective data was done from 2004 till 2012 from a single center. RESULTS: There were total 171 consecutive febrile episodes with 103 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and 63 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The highest number of febrile neutropenia episodes occurred during ALL and AML induction followed by consolidation treatment with high-dose cytarabine. In our study population, the most common organisms isolated were Gram-positive (20%) followed by Gram-negative (6.4%) organisms. The incidence of fungal sepsis was only 3%. In our study, it was seen that the recovery from febrile neutropenia depends upon the disease, ALL recovered rapidly compared to AML (P < 0.001) and also the on the phase of treatment, i.e consolidation recovered earlier than induction (P < 0.001). There was no death recorded in this study population during febrile neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of febrile neutropenia depends upon the type of haematological malignancy and the aggressiveness of therapy required treating the disease especially during induction.

MiRNA sponges against miR-19 or miR-155 inhibit the functions of these miRNAs and potentiate the induction of SOCS1 and p53 in mouse leukemia cells and in human myeloma cells. Adding a catalytic RNA motif of the hammerhead type within miRNA sponges against miR-155 leads to decreased miR-155 levels and increased their ability of inhibiting cell growth and cell migration in myeloma cells.

However, B1 cell-associated antibodies often cross-react with self-antigens, which leads to autoimmunity, and B1 cells have been implicated in cancer. How B1 cell activity is regulated remains unclear. We show that the Ikaros transcription factor is a major negative regulator of B1 cell development and function. Using conditional knock-out mouse models to delete Ikaros at different locations, we show that Ikaros-deficient mice exhibit specific and significant increases in splenic and bone marrow B1 cell numbers, and that the B1 progenitor cell pool is increased approximately 10-fold in the bone marrow. Ikaros-null B1 cells resemble WT B1 cells at the molecular and cellular levels, but show a down-regulation of signaling components important for inhibiting proliferation and immunoglobulin production. Ikaros-null B1 cells hyper-react to TLR4 stimulation and secrete high amounts of IgM autoantibodies. These results indicate that Ikaros is required to limit B1 cell homeostasis in the adult.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Macias-Garcia, Alejandra', 'Heizmann, Beate', 'Sellars, MacLean', 'Marchal, Patricia', 'Dali, Hayet', 'Pasquali, Jean-Louis', 'Muller, Sylviane', 'Kastner, Philippe', 'Chan, Susan']","['Macias-Garcia A', 'Heizmann B', 'Sellars M', 'Marchal P', 'Dali H', 'Pasquali JL', 'Muller S', 'Kastner P', 'Chan S']","['From the Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U964, CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch, France.', 'From the Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U964, CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch, France, heizmann@igbmc.fr.', 'From the Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U964, CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch, France.', 'From the Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U964, CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IBMC), CNRS UPR3572, 67000 Strasbourg, France.', 'From the Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U964, CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch, France, Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IBMC), CNRS UPR3572, 67000 Strasbourg, France, UFR Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, 67000 Strasbourg, France.', ""Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IBMC), CNRS UPR3572, 67000 Strasbourg, France, Institut d'Etudes Avancees, Universite de Strasbourg, 67000 Strasbourg, France, and."", 'From the Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U964, CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch, France, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, 67000 Strasbourg, France scpk@igbmc.fr.', 'From the Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U964, CNRS UMR 7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch, France, scpk@igbmc.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics/immunology']",PMC4861476,,2016/02/05 06:00,2016/11/04 06:00,['2016/02/05 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)41109-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.704239 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Apr 22;291(17):9073-86. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.704239.

The Rai and Binet staging systems described approximately 40 years ago have proven to be robust prognostic tools. Over the past 2 decades, several novel biological, genetic, and molecular markers have been shown to be useful adjuncts to the Rai and Binet staging systems. In this systematic review, we examined the role of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutation status and genetic abnormalities determined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in patients with newly diagnosed CLL. The cumulative evidence presented in this systematic review is sufficient to recommend that FISH and IGHV be performed as standard clinical tests for all patients with newly diagnosed CLL in those countries with the resources to do so. In addition to clinical stage, these parameters could represent the minimal standard initial prognostic evaluation for patients with CLL. This approach will allow the application of powerful, recently developed prognostic indices (all of which are dependent on IGHV and FISH results) to all patients with newly diagnosed CLL.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Parikh, Sameer A', 'Strati, Paolo', 'Tsang, Mazie', 'West, Colin P', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Parikh SA', 'Strati P', 'Tsang M', 'West CP', 'Shanafelt TD']","['Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, and Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",,,2016/02/05 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2016/02/05 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30276-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-10-620864 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Apr 7;127(14):1752-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-10-620864.

To explore whether benzene exposure has an effect on the expression of miR-221, a population based cross-sectional study was conducted in southern China, with 97 petrol station attendants as the exposure group and 103 general residents as the control group. Plasma benzene was analyzed by using GC\MS. miR-221 in peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured by qRT-PCR and the DeltaCt value for each sample was calculated by normalizing the Ct value for miR-221 with U6 RNA (i.e., DeltaCt = CtmiR-221 - CtU6). Potential confounding factors were taken into account. Pearson correlation, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed in statistical analysis. The results showed that the air concentrations of benzene were significantly higher in petrol stations than in control sites (P < 0.05); The levels of benzene and miR-221 in exposure group were both significantly higher than in control group (P < 0.05) and there was a significant positive correlation between the two indexes (r = 0.851, P < 0.05); An association between benzene levels and the DeltaCt values for miR-221 was identified by univariate and multivariate logistic analysis (OR 0.274; 95%CI 0.117, 0.396).

For this purpose, initially therapeutic agents with higher tyrosine kinase activity were introduced, which had the potential for inhibiting even mutant forms of Bcr-Abl. Furthermore, coupling imatinib with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands also showed beneficial effects in chronic myeloid leukemia cell proliferation. These combination protocols inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis as well as differentiation in chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines. In addition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligands increased imatinib uptake by upregulating the expression of human organic cation transporter 1.

One of the most common side effects of the drug in adults is high-grade hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis. Despite being almost always reversible and may not recur, clinicians may still be reluctant to continue with PEG-Asp in patients with liver toxicity, losing the benefit from multiple doses of the drug. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of adult ALL who developed PEG-Asp-related high grade liver toxicity. The rising hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis rapidly and permanently reversed using the amino-acid derivative L-carnitine. This case goes in line with similar observations in animal models and humans. CONCLUSION: L-Carnitine may show therapeutic benefit in PEG-Asp-related hepatotoxicity and should be considered in clinical trials of the drug.","['(c) 2016 S.

METHODS: A retrospective study of Pediatric Health Information System analyzing ED visits for children with cancer, including ED visits within 365 days from the first inpatient encounter with a discharge diagnosis code for malignancy. We defined frequent ED utilizers as those with four or more visits in the year (top 10th percentile). Patient characteristics and ED services (medications, laboratory, or imaging) for discharged children were assessed. Factors associated with being a frequent ED utilizer were examined with multivariable regression. RESULTS: Frequent utilizers accounted for 58% of ED visits. Frequent utilizers differed from infrequent utilizers in terms of type of cancer; 39.3% of frequent utilizers had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 16.0% had central nervous system (CNS) tumors compared with infrequent utilizers (21.9% had ALL and 24.8% CNS tumors, P-value < 0.001). Frequent utilization was associated with age 5-9 years (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.6) or 1-4 years (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.4) or <1 year (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.9-2.6) compared to 15-19 years and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5) compared to white, non-Hispanics, and urban residence (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7). Few children with cancer received no medication, laboratory, or imaging during their ED visit (frequent 11.0% vs. infrequent 12.5%, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The ED is integral to the care provided to children with cancer. The subset of frequent utilizers should be the focus of future research and quality improvement efforts.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mueller, Emily L', 'Hall, Matt', 'Carroll, Aaron E', 'Shah, Samir S', 'Macy, Michelle L']","['Mueller EL', 'Hall M', 'Carroll AE', 'Shah SS', 'Macy ML']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Pediatric and Adolescent Comparative Effectiveness Research, Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.', ""Children's Hospital Association, Overland Park, Kansas."", 'Pediatric and Adolescent Comparative Effectiveness Research, Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research, Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'Child Health Evaluation and Research (CHEAR) Unit, Division of General Pediatrics, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Ambulatory Care', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",,,2016/02/04 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2016/02/04 06:00'],"['2015/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25929 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 May;63(5):859-64. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25929.

Considerable improvement has been achieved with the introduction of the anti-CD20 antibodies, and chemoimmunotherapy has now become an established standard for patients without the high-risk features del(17p)/TP53 mutation. Also, the outcome of patients with these adverse genetic aberrations was dramatically improved with the introduction of the kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib. Different combinations of these and additional novel agents are currently evaluated in clinical trials. The combination of the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib with an anti-CD20 antibody is an attractive option, because both drugs act synergistically: ibrutinib redistributes the CLL cells from their homing organs to the peripheral blood, and obinutuzumab eliminates the leukemic cells in the blood with particular efficiency. Adding the Bcl-2 antagonist venetoclax could further intensify the treatment of CLL.

Imatinib produces acceptable responses in approximately 60% of patients, with approximately 20% discontinuing therapy because of intolerance and approximately 20% developing drug resistance. The advent of newer TKIs, such as nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib, has provided multiple options for patients. These agents are more potent, have unique adverse effect profiles, and are more likely to achieve relevant milestones, such as early molecular responses (3-6 months) and optimal molecular responses (12 months). The acquisition of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations is also reportedly lower with these drugs. Thus far, none of the randomized phase III clinical trials have shown a clinically significant survival difference between frontline imatinib versus newer TKIs. Cost and safety issues with the newer TKIs, such as vascular disease with nilotinib and ponatinib and pulmonary hypertension with dasatinib, have dampened the enthusiasm of using these drugs as frontline options. While the utility of new TKIs in the setting of imatinib failure or intolerance is clear, their use as frontline agents should factor in the age of the patient, additional comorbidities, risk stratification (Sokal score), and cost.

The calcium ionophore ionomycin is widely used as a degranulation induction agent for mast cell degranulation studies. In the present work, ionomycin-induced degranulation of RBL-2H3 basophilic leukemia cell line cells was investigated in vitro by high resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM). Ionomycin, which could increase the intracellular free Ca(2+) level and beta-Hexosaminidase release, was found to induce the formation of a kind of peculiar vesicles in the cytoplasm area of RBL-2H3 cells. Those vesicles induced by ionomycin would desintegrate to release a larger amount of granules surrounding RBL-2H3 cells by the controlling of F-actin. These results provide the precise morphological information of ionomycin-induced mast cell degranulation at nanoscale, which could benefit our understanding of ionomycin-induced mast cell anaphylaxis model and also validate the applicability of AFM for the detection of allergic inflammatory response in mast cells.

However, it is difficult to replicate the success in other cancers, such as solid tumors, in part because of the rapid renal clearance and dose-limiting toxicity. Nanotechnology is expected to overcome these disadvantages through altering its pharmacokinetics and concentrating the drug at the desired sites. Herein, we report a ""one-pot"" method to develop arsenic-based nanodrugs by in situ coating the as-prepared arsenic nanocomplexes with porous silica shells. This process can be easily reproduced and scaled up because no complicated synthesis and purification steps are involved. This core-shell embedding method endows nanodrugs with high loading capacity (57.9 wt%) and a prolonged pH-responsive releasing profile, which is crucial to increase the drug concentration at tumor sites and improve the drug efficacy. Based on these unique features, the nanodrugs significantly inhibit the growth of solid tumors without adverse side effects. Therefore, we anticipate that the arsenic-based nanodrugs generated by this facile synthetic route may be a powerful and alternative strategy for solid tumor therapy.",,"['Zhang, Zongjun', 'Liu, Hanyu', 'Zhou, Hualu', 'Zhu, Xianglong', 'Zhao, Zhenghuan', 'Chi, Xiaoqin', 'Shan, Hong', 'Gao, Jinhao']","['Zhang Z', 'Liu H', 'Zhou H', 'Zhu X', 'Zhao Z', 'Chi X', 'Shan H', 'Gao J']","['State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, The MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, and Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. jhgao@xmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, The MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, and Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. jhgao@xmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, The MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, and Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. jhgao@xmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, The MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, and Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. jhgao@xmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, The MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, and Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. jhgao@xmu.edu.cn.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Chronic Liver Disease and Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361004, China.', 'Department of Radiology, The Third Affiliated Hospital and Interventional Radiology Institute, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, The MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, and Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. jhgao@xmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Oxides)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Drug Liberation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Oxides/*chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Porosity', 'Silicon Dioxide/chemistry', 'Surface Properties', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,2016/02/04 06:00,2016/12/20 06:00,['2016/02/04 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c5nr07860a [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2016 Feb 21;8(7):4373-80. doi: 10.1039/c5nr07860a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using Cox proportional hazards models, we analyzed 5-year cumulative mortality in all patients registered in the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry diagnosed 1991-2006 below 16 years. Information on SES was extracted from the Swiss census by probabilistic record linkage. The study included 1602 children (33% with leukemia, 20% with lymphoma, 22% with central nervous system (CNS) tumors); with an overall 5-year survival of 77% (95%CI 75-79%). Higher SES, particularly parents' education, was associated with a lower 5-year cumulative mortality. Results varied by type of cancer with no association for leukemia and particularly strong effects for CNS tumor patients, where mortality hazard ratios for the different SES indicators, comparing the highest with the lowest group, ranged from 0.48 (95%CI: 0.28-0.81) to 0.71 (95%CI: 0.44-1.15).

Their affinities towards human full length vitamin D receptor (VDR) and metabolic stability against human vitamin D 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) were also tested. The analogues (PRI-1730, PRI-1731, PRI-1732, PRI-1733 and PRI-1734) contained 5,6-trans modification of the A-ring and of the triene system, additional hydroxyl or unsaturation at C-22 in the side chain and reversed absolute configuration (24-epi) at C-24 of 1,25D(2). As presented in this paper, introduction of selected structural modifications simultaneously in two distinct parts of the vitamin D molecule resulted in a divergent group of analogues. Analogues showed lower VDR affinity in comparison to that of the parent hormones, 1,25D(2) and 1,25D(3), and they caused effective HL60 cell differentiation only at high concentrations of 100 nM and above. Unexpectedly, introducing of a 5,6-trans modification combined with C-22 hydroxyl and 24-epi configuration switched off entirely the cell differentiation activity of the analogue (PRI-1734). However, this analogue remained a moderate substrate for CYP24A1, as it was metabolized at 22%, compared to 35% for 1,25D(2). Other analogues from this series were either less (12% for PRI-1731 and PRI-1733) or more (52% for PRI-1732) resistant to the enzymatic deactivation. Although the inactive analogue PRI-1734 failed to show VDR antagonism, when tested in HL60 cells, its structure might be a good starting point for our design of a vitamin D antagonist.",,"['Corcoran, Aoife', 'Nadkarni, Sharmin', 'Yasuda, Kaori', 'Sakaki, Toshiyuki', 'Brown, Geoffrey', 'Kutner, Andrzej', 'Marcinkowska, Ewa']","['Corcoran A', 'Nadkarni S', 'Yasuda K', 'Sakaki T', 'Brown G', 'Kutner A', 'Marcinkowska E']","['Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw, 14a Joliot-Curie, Wroclaw 50-383, Poland. aoifecorkie@hotmail.com.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Institute, 8 Rydygiera, Warsaw 01-793, Poland. s.nadkarni@ifarm.eu.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan. z02232@mail.pu-toyama.ac.jp.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Toyama Prefectural University, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama 939-0398, Japan. tsakaki@pu-toyama.ac.jp.', 'School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham, Vincent Drive, Edgbaston, Birmingham, West Midlands B15 2TT, UK.

This unit develops a method to increase the number of HSPCs in laboratory conditions by using cell-free matrices from bone marrow cells that mimic 'human-body-niche-like' conditions as biological scaffolds to support the ex vivo expansion of HSPCs. In this unit, we describe protocols for the isolation and characterization of HSPCs from UCB and their serum-free expansion on decellularized matrices.

Although it is an effective and biocompatible material, adverse reactions to metal debris (ARMD) have arisen in a minority of patients, particularly in those with metal-on-metal bearing hip replacements. There is currently no treatment for ARMD and once progressive, early revision surgery of the implant is necessary. Therapeutic agents to prevent, halt or reverse ARMD would therefore be advantageous. Cobalt ions activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an innate immune receptor responsible for inflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We hypothesised that anti-TLR4 neutralising antibodies, reported to inhibit TLR4-mediated inflammation, could prevent the inflammatory response to cobalt ions in an in vitro macrophage cell culture model. This study shows that a monoclonal anti-TLR4 antibody inhibited cobalt-mediated increases in pro-inflammatory IL8, CCL20 and IL1A expression, as well as IL-8 secretion. In contrast, a polyclonal antibody did not prevent the effect of cobalt ions on either IL-8 or IL1A expression, although it did have a small effect on the CCL20 response. Interestingly, both antibodies inhibited cobalt-mediated neutrophil migration although the greater effect was observed with the monoclonal antibody.

Complementary and alternative treatment options such as meditation practice or yoga are becoming popular by treating all aspects of the disease including physical and psychological symptoms. However, there is still unclear evidence about meditation's effectiveness, and how its practice affects the lives of haematologically-diseased patients. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to assess the benefits and harms of meditation practice as an additional treatment to standard care for adults with haematological malignancies. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 8, 2015), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2015), databases of ongoing trials, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/), conference proceedings of annual meetings of: the American Society of Hematology; American Society of Clinical Oncology; European Hematology Association; European Congress for Integrative Medicine; and Global Advances in Health and Medicine (2010 to 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using meditation practice for adult patients with haematological malignancies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data from eligible studies and assessed the risk of bias according to predefined criteria. We evaluated quality of life and depression. The other outcomes of overall survival, anxiety, fatigue, quality of sleep and adverse events could not be evaluated, because they were not assessed in the included trial. MAIN RESULTS: We included only one small trial published as an abstract article. The included study investigated the effects of meditation practice on patients newly hospitalised with acute leukaemia. Ninety-one participants enrolled in the study, but only 42 participants remained in the trial throughout the six-month follow-up period and were eligible for analysis. There was no information provided about the average age and sex of the study population. We found a high risk for attrition bias and unclear risk for reporting bias, performance and detection bias because of missing data due to abstract publication only, thus we judged the overall risk of bias as high. According to the GRADE criteria, we judged the overall quality of the body of evidence for all predefined outcomes as 'very low', due to the extent of missing data on the study population, and the small sample size.As the abstract publication did not provide numbers and results except P values, we are not able to give more details.Meditation practice might be beneficial for the quality of life of haematologically-diseased patients, with higher scores for participants in the mediation arms compared to the participants in the usual care control group (low quality of evidence). Levels of depression decreased for those practising meditation in both the spiritually-framed meditation group and the secularly-focused meditation group in comparison to the usual care control group, whose levels of depression remained constant (low quality of evidence). The influence of meditation practice on overall survival, fatigue, anxiety, quality of sleep and adverse events remained unclear, as these outcomes were not evaluated in the included trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: To estimate the effects of meditation practice for patients suffering from haematological malignancies, more high quality randomised controlled trials are needed. At present there is not enough information available on the effects of meditation in haematologically-diseased patients to draw any conclusion.",,"['Salhofer, Ines', 'Will, Andrea', 'Monsef, Ina', 'Skoetz, Nicole']","['Salhofer I', 'Will A', 'Monsef I', 'Skoetz N']","['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Depression/therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology', 'Meditation/*psychology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",PMC7088450,,2016/02/04 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2016/02/04 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Feb 3;2:CD011157. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD011157.pub2.,,,,20160203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, CREB represents a promising drug target for the treatment of AML, which carries a poor prognosis. In this study, we performed a high-throughput small molecule screen to identify compounds that disrupt CREB function in AML cells. We screened ~114,000 candidate compounds from Stanford University's small molecule library, and identified 5 molecules that inhibit CREB function at micromolar concentrations, but are non-toxic to normal hematopoietic cells.

Four plasmids containing three generation of CAR were constructed by cloning the CD19-CAR fragment into the lentiviral vector pCDH. CD3 positive T cells were successfully transduced and the CAR protein expression was confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blot. When cocultured with CD19 positive leukemia cell line Nalm-6 cells, CAR-T cells showed specific cytotoxicity: the percentage of target cells decreased to 0 in 24 hours; IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha produced in cocultured supernatants increased obviously; and the cytotoxicity reached more than 80%, still remarkable even when the E:T ratio was as low as 1:4.

KG1 cells are resistant to 1,25D-induced cell differentiation. These cells have the aberrant signal transduction resulting from a constitutively active fusion protein FOP2-FGFR1, a constitutively active STAT1 and a high level of interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs). METHODS: In this paper we report that in KG1 cells with constitutively activated protein FOP2-FGFR1 delivery of plasmid DNA disrupted FOP2-FGFR1 fusion gene. RESULTS: As a consequence, STAT1 signal transduction pathway became switched off, the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene was increased and sensitivity to 1,25D-induced differentiation was restored. The activation of ISGs in KG1 cells resulted in resistance to externally added IFNs, and also this effect was reversed in cells with disrupted FOP2-FGFR1 fusion gene. DISCUSSION: In this paper we have documented for the first time a link between constitutively active STAT1 signal transduction pathway, high level of ISGs and low expression of VDR gene. CONCLUSIONS: We show in this paper that delivery of plasmid DNA to the cells may disrupt fusion gene FOP2-FGFR1 which occurs in a disease entity called 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome.

The latter is overexpressed in various tumor entities and mediates therapy resistance. Here, we analyzed the crosstalk between Bcl-2 and TRPM2 channels in T cell leukemia cells during oxidative stress as conferred by ionizing radiation (IR). To this end, the effects of TRPM2 inhibition or knock-down on plasma membrane currents, Ca(2+) signaling, mitochondrial superoxide anion formation, and cell cycle progression were compared between irradiated (0-10 Gy) Bcl-2-overexpressing and empty vector-transfected Jurkat cells. As a result, IR stimulated a TRPM2-mediated Ca(2+)-entry, which was higher in Bcl-2-overexpressing than in control cells and which contributed to IR-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. TRPM2 inhibition induced a release from G2/M arrest resulting in cell death. Collectively, this data suggests a pivotal function of TRPM2 in the DNA damage response of T cell leukemia cells. Apoptosis-resistant Bcl-2-overexpressing cells even can afford higher TRPM2 activity without risking a hazardous Ca(2+)-overload-induced mitochondrial superoxide anion formation.",,"['Klumpp, Dominik', 'Misovic, Milan', 'Szteyn, Kalina', 'Shumilina, Ekaterina', 'Rudner, Justine', 'Huber, Stephan M']","['Klumpp D', 'Misovic M', 'Szteyn K', 'Shumilina E', 'Rudner J', 'Huber SM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Tubingen, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Tubingen, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Tubingen, 72076 Tubingen, Germany; Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, The University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Tubingen, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Cell Biology (Cancer Research), University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Tubingen, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPM2 protein, human)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superoxides/chemistry', 'TRPM Cation Channels/*metabolism']",PMC4709732,,2016/02/04 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/04 06:00'],"['2015/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/8026702 [doi]'],ppublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2016;2016:8026702. doi: 10.1155/2016/8026702.

Since remediation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may mitigate the adverse effects caused by exposure, we assessed the effects of As2O3 and its potential reversibility after exposure cessation or coadministration of NAC. Animals received 0.3 or 3.0 mg/Kg/day of As2O3 subcutaneously and 40 mM of NAC in tap water. As2O3 treatment impaired spermatogenesis and sperm motility and decreased seminal vesicle weight and testosterone serum levels; after suspension of treatment, these parameters remained altered. When NAC was administered, animals showed improvement in sperm parameters and seminal vesicle weight. In vitro epididymal contractility was increased in As2O3-treated animals.

The hDPSCs were expanded in knockout-embryonic stem cell (KO-ES) medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on gelatin-coated plates for 3-4 days. Then, the medium was replaced with KO-ES medium without LIF to allow the formation of the neurosphere for 4 days. The neurosphere was transferred into ITS medium, containing ITS (human insulin-transferrin-sodium) and fibronectin, to select for Nestin-positive cells for 6-8 days. The cells were then cultured in N-2 medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), FGF-8b, sonic hedgehog-N, and ascorbic acid on poly-l-ornithine/fibronectin-coated plates to expand the Nestin-positive cells for up to 2 weeks. Finally, the cells were transferred into N-2/ascorbic acid medium to allow for their differentiation into dopaminergic neurons for 10-15 days. The differentiation stages were confirmed by morphological, immunocytochemical, flow cytometric, real-time PCR, and ELISA analyses. The expressions of mesenchymal stem cell markers were observed at the early stages. The expressions of early neuronal markers were maintained throughout the differentiation stages. The mature neural markers showed increased expression from stage 3 onwards.

Recently, it was reported that 5-azacitidine administration upregulates the expression of CD20 in CD20-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we report a similar upregulation in a patient with follicular lymphoma who was treated with 5-azacitidine against secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old Japanese woman with follicular lymphoma with treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome was negative for the CD20 antibody at the time of her relapse. After treatment of 5-azacytidine for her myelodysplastic syndrome, CD20 expression was upregulated in the follicular lymphoma cells in her peripheral blood. We also observed follicular lymphoma cell stimulation in her peripheral blood due to 5-azacytidine. CONCLUSIONS: Although partial, CD20 expression was upregulated after treatment with 5-azacitidine. However, CD20 expression was not re-upregulated after a second administration of 5-azacitidine and we also observed the risk of lymphoma cell stimulation due to 5-azacitidine.",,"['Tsutsumi, Yutaka', 'Ohigashi, Hiroyuki', 'Ito, Shinichi', 'Shiratori, Souichi', 'Teshima, Takanori']","['Tsutsumi Y', 'Ohigashi H', 'Ito S', 'Shiratori S', 'Teshima T']","['Department of Hematology, Hakodate Municipal Hospital, 1-10-1, Minato-cho, Hakodate, 041-8680, Japan. yutsutsu@shore.ocn.ne.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Hakodate Municipal Hospital, 1-10-1, Minato-cho, Hakodate, 041-8680, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hakodate Municipal Hospital, 1-10-1, Minato-cho, Hakodate, 041-8680, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hakodate Municipal Hospital, 1-10-1, Minato-cho, Hakodate, 041-8680, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, N15 W7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-8638, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/*blood', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/blood/*drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC4739428,,2016/02/04 06:00,2016/10/13 06:00,['2016/02/04 06:00'],"['2015/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-016-0809-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-016-0809-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2016 Feb 2;10:27. doi: 10.1186/s13256-016-0809-7.,,,,20160202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of flow cytometry analysis indicated that the PA-Dau-AuNPs complex was efficiently internalized into target cells, but not into nontarget cells. The results of MTT assay were consistent with the internalization data. PA-Dau-AuNPs complex had less cytotoxicity in U266 cells compared to Dau alone and even Apt-Dau-AuNPs complex.

In present investigation, injectable vincristine sulfate loaded dextran microspheres (VCS-Dextran-MSs) were prepared and amalgamated with chitosan-beta-glycerophosphate gel (VCS-Dextran-MSs-Gel) to surmount the biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic limitations of VCS that consequently induced synergistic sustained release pattern of the drug. Particle size and zeta-potential of VCS-Dextran-MSs were measured to be 6.8 +/- 2.4 mum and -18.3 +/- 0.11 mV along with the encapsulation efficiency of about 60.4 +/- 4.5%. Furthermore, VCS-Dextran-MSs and VCS-Dextran-MSs-Gel exhibited slow release pattern and 94.7% and 95.8% of the drug was released in 72 h and 720 h, respectively. Results from cell viability assay and pharmacokinetic as well as histopathological analysis in mice indicated that VCS-Dextran-MSs-Gel offers superior therapeutic potential and higher AUClast than VCS-Dextran-MSs and drug solution. In conclusion, VCS-Dextran-MSs-Gel warrants further preclinical tumor growth study to scale up the technology.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that variations in vitamin C dietary intake as well as in genetic variability in vitamin C transporter gene SLC23A2 could explain some inconsistencies in the literature. METHODS: Fruit/vegetable/vitamin C consumption from food frequency questionnaires and six low-penetrance genetic susceptibility polymorphisms in vitamin C transporter gene SLC23A2 (rs1715364, rs6133175, rs1776948, rs6139587, rs369270 and rs6052937) were examined in 434 CLL cases and 1257 randomly selected controls from primary care centres with genetic data of whom 275 cases and 1094 controls having both diet and genetic information. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: CLL patients were more likely to have a higher fruit consumption than controls (highest versus lowest quartile in g/day OR: 1.48; 95 % CI: 1.00 to 2.18; P = 0.03), whereas no associations were found with vegetable or total vitamin C intake. Based on log-additive models, rs6133175_A > G (OR: 1.19, 95 % CI: 1.00 to 1.41; P = 0.05) and rs1776948_T > A (OR: 1.20; 95 %CI: 1.01 to 1.41; P = 0.04) were associated with CLL. The haplogenotype analysis (rs1715364, rs6133175) supported the genotype results. No gene-diet interactions in CLL remained statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that both fruit intake and genetic marker in SLC23A2 may play an independent role in CLL biology.",,"['Casabonne, Delphine', 'Gracia, Esther', 'Espinosa, Ana', 'Bustamante, Mariona', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Robles, Claudia', 'Costas, Laura', 'Alonso, Esther', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Tardon, Adonina', 'Dierssen-Sotos, Trinidad', 'Vazquez, Eva Gimeno', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Campo, Elies', 'Jimenez-Moleon, Jose J', 'Marcos-Gragera, Rafael', 'Castano-Vinyals, Gemma', 'Aragones, Nuria', 'Pollan, Marina', 'Kogevinas, Manolis', 'Urtiaga, Carmen', 'Amiano, Pilar', 'Moreno, Victor', 'de Sanjose, Silvia']","['Casabonne D', 'Gracia E', 'Espinosa A', 'Bustamante M', 'Benavente Y', 'Robles C', 'Costas L', 'Alonso E', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Tardon A', 'Dierssen-Sotos T', 'Vazquez EG', 'Aymerich M', 'Campo E', 'Jimenez-Moleon JJ', 'Marcos-Gragera R', 'Castano-Vinyals G', 'Aragones N', 'Pollan M', 'Kogevinas M', 'Urtiaga C', 'Amiano P', 'Moreno V', 'de Sanjose S']","[""Unit of Infections and Cancer (UNIC), Cancer Epidemiology Research Programme, IDIBELL, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Av.

The purpose of this study is to determine the characteristics and outcomes of AYA AML patients in comparison to older adult patients with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all AML patients treated at our institution from 1965 to 2009 who were aged 16 to 29 years. RESULTS: Among 3922 adult AML patients treated during this period, 432 (11%) were identified as AYA. Median age was 23 years (range, 16-29 years); 73 (17%) patients had core binding factor (CBF)-AML [inversion (16), translocation (8:21)], and 51 (12%) had acute promyelocytic leukemia. Complete remission (CR) rates were 93% for CBF AML, 78% for APL, 77% with diploid karyotype, and 68% for other AML. Univariate analysis demonstrated higher rates of CR, CR duration, and overall survival (OS) in the AYA group compared with older patients. On multivariate analysis, AYA age group was independently associated with improved CR rate and CR duration, with a trend for longer OS (P = .085). CONCLUSION: Outcome of AYA AML patients is overall better than for older adults with AML. Despite improvements in treatments and outcomes over time, there is still need for improvement in AYA with AML particularly for those with AML other than CBF and APL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We designed a combination of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell microtransplantation (MST) with chemotherapy for patients with MDS and tAML and evaluated its effects and toxicity. Patients were between 13 and 79 years old. Patients with MDS (n=21) were given HLA-mismatched MST combined with decitabine and cytarabine; patients with tAML (n=22) were given HLA-mismatched MST combined with decitabine and cytarabine, and also mitoxantrone. Patients in complete remission (CR) also received MST plus decitabine and medium-dose cytarabine chemotherapy without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The overall response rate of the patients with MDS was significantly higher than that of those with tAML (81% vs. 50%; p=.03). The CR rates were 52.4% and 36.4% in the two groups, respectively. There was no difference in the cytogenetic CR rate between the MDS and tAML groups (85.7% vs. 70%, respectively; p=.7). The 24-month overall survival of the patients with MDS was significantly higher than that of the patients with tAML (84.7% and 34.1%, respectively; p=.003). The median recovery times of neutrophils and platelets were, respectively, 14 and 17 days in the patients with MDS, and 16 and 19 days in those with tAML. The treatment-related mortality rates were 4.8% and 18.2%, respectively, in the MDS and tAML groups (p=.34). No GVHD was observed in any patient. Microtransplantation combined with decitabine and chemotherapy may provide a novel, effective, and safe treatment for high-risk MDS and tAML. SIGNIFICANCE: Microtransplantation (MST) refers to regular chemotherapy combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell infusion of human leukocyte antigen-mismatched donor cells without using immunosuppressive agents. It aims to support hematopoietic recovery and perform graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects but differs from traditional allogeneic stem cell transplantation because the rate of donor cell chimerism is low and there is and no graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risk. Thus, a trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MST in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and those with transformed acute myelogenous leukemia. Higher complete remission and cytogenetic complete response rates were observed, and the treatment improved disease progress-free survival, sped hematopoietic recovery, and avoided GVHD.",['(c)AlphaMed Press.'],"['Hu, Kai-Xun', 'Sun, Qi-Yun', 'Guo, Mei', 'Qiao, Jun-Xiao', 'Yu, Chang-Lin', 'Qiao, Jian-Hui', 'Dong, Zheng', 'Sun, Wan-Jun', 'Zuo, Hong-Li', 'Huang, Ya-Jing', 'Cai, Bo', 'Ai, Hui-Sheng']","['Hu KX', 'Sun QY', 'Guo M', 'Qiao JX', 'Yu CL', 'Qiao JH', 'Dong Z', 'Sun WJ', 'Zuo HL', 'Huang YJ', 'Cai B', 'Ai HS']","[""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China huishengai@163.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Stem Cells Transl Med,Stem cells translational medicine,101578022,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chimerism/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4798738,,2016/02/04 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2016/02/04 06:00'],"['2015/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['sctm.2015-0196 [pii]', '10.5966/sctm.2015-0196 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Transl Med. 2016 Apr;5(4):524-9. doi: 10.5966/sctm.2015-0196.

DNA was isolated from PB samples at the time of -1, 1, and 7 days of chemotherapy. Global methylation was determined by ELISA, and the CpG island DNA methylation profile of 5 genes using a DNA methylation PCR system. Our data demonstrated that patients with a high level of 5-mC had a poor prognosis after demethylation therapy and those who have low levels of 5-mC in PB achieved higher CR and better SO, but there was no significant correlation found between the 5-mC levels and other clinical features before treatment except the disease status. Higher methylation status of Sox2 and Oct4 genes was associated with differential response to demethylation therapy. A relatively low methylation percentage in one or both of these two genes was also associated with longer OS after decitabine based chemotherapy. We also suggest that global DNA and Oct-4/Sox2 methylation might impact on the pathogenesis of leukemia and play an important role in the initiation and progression.

Many approaches are implemented in the management of CLL from a watch and wait (WandW) strategy to chemotherapeutic regimens. We here reviewed our clinical practice for the relevance of the W and W strategy in Lebanese CLL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 95 patients with CLL diagnosed in four institutions in Lebanon, between 1992 and 2013, were selected and their files were reviewed. Characteristics of these patients were noted including age, sex, RAI and Binet scores, CBC values, presence of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, performance of bone marrow biopsy or peripheral blood flux cytometry for diagnosis, adoption of W and W strategy, different chemotherapeutic regimens and the indications for treatment. RESULTS: Some 38 patients (40%) diagnosed with CLL were women and 57 (60%) were men with a mean age of 65.1 years [36-89]. Of the total, 50.5%, 17.2%, 14%, 7.5% and 10.8% had an RAI score at diagnosis of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, while 65.6%, 17.2% and 17.2% had Binet scores of I, II and III. The mean lymphocyte count at diagnosis was 39885/mm3 [1596-290000], the mean hemoglobin level was 12.7 g/dl [6.2-17] and the mean platelet count was 191255/mm3 [14000-458000]. While 26.3% of patients with CLL had splenomegaly, only 7.4% had hepatomegaly. Some 33.7% had undergone a bone marrow biopsy, 66.3% flow cytometry of circulating blood and 5.3% a lymph node biopsy. Overall, the W and W was adopted in 62.4% (58) of patients with a mean duration of 37.7 months [3-216]. The W and W was used in 82.6%, 73.3%, 46.2%, 14.3% and 0% of patients having RAI scores of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, and, it was used in 80%, 46.7% and 6.25% with Binet scores of I, II and III. The most frequent indication for treatment was anemia and thrombocytopenia, accounting for 32.7% of cases. The most frequently used chemotherapeutical regimens were chlorambucil until the end of the last century and flufarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab during the last decade. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective review of CLL clinical practice showed an important implementation of the W and W strategy with a long duration, especially in early stage cases with low RAI or Binet scores.",,"['Lutfallah, Antoine Abi', 'Kourie, Hampig Raphael', 'Eid, Roland', 'Farhat, Fadi', 'Ghosn, Marwan', 'Kattan, Joseph']","['Lutfallah AA', 'Kourie HR', 'Eid R', 'Farhat F', 'Ghosn M', 'Kattan J']","['Hematology-Oncology Department, Hotel-Dieu de France University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon E-mail : hampig.kourie@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '142459-58-3 (FOE 5043)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/administration & dosage', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Hepatomegaly/diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lebanon', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Splenomegaly/diagnosis/pathology', 'Thiadiazoles/administration & dosage', 'Thrombocytopenia/diagnosis/pathology']",,,2016/02/04 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/02/04 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.1.215 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(1):215-7. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.1.215.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This does not preclude other etiological factors in the causation of this cancer. Exploratory studies on several oncogenic viruses have found varied associations with oral cancers. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the association of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus, (XMRV) a retrovirus recently implicated in oncogenesis in humans, with oral cancers. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The presence of XMRV proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was evaluated by standard nucleic acid amplification from DNA extracted from representative bits of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues from surgically resected specimens sent post-operatively for routine histopathological testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study comprised 109 patients with a provisional diagnosis of oral cancer who were operated at the Oral Oncology Department of Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, over a period of 10 months. RESULTS: XMRV was not found in any of the tumor tissues (squamous cell carcinomas - 98; verrucous carcinomas - 4) nor in any of the normal tissues. It is thus important that the absence of this oncogenic virus in all the cases makes the association of XMRV with oral cancers very unlikely. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to investigate potentially oncogenic viruses in other solid tumors and in larger sample sizes. Any such association could have implications in detecting, preventing and treating these cancers.",,"['Sinha, M', 'Shafiulla, M', 'Trupti, K', 'Namrata, N R', 'Nadimul, H', 'Sabitha, K S', 'Kumar, R V', 'Jayshree, R S']","['Sinha M', 'Shafiulla M', 'Trupti K', 'Namrata NR', 'Nadimul H', 'Sabitha KS', 'Kumar RV', 'Jayshree RS']","['Department of Microbiology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*pathology/*virology', 'Oncogenic Viruses/pathogenicity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*pathogenicity']",,,2016/02/04 06:00,2016/11/03 06:00,['2016/02/04 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2015_52_1_61_175595 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.175595 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2015 Jan-Mar;52(1):61-4. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.175595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a multifunctional intracellular adaptor protein that transmits extracellular signals to regulate malignant cell motility, metastasis, and cell-cycle progression, but is poorly characterized in hematologic malignancies. In this study, we investigated the role of ILK in the context of CLL and observed high ILK expression in patient samples, particularly in tumor cells harboring prognostic high-risk markers such as unmutated IGHV genes, high Zap70, or CD38 expression, or a signature of recent proliferation. We also found increased numbers of Ki67 (MKI67)-positive cells in regions of enhanced ILK expression in lymph nodes from CLL patients. Using coculture conditions mimicking the proliferative lymph node microenvironment, we detected a parallel induction of ILK and cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression in CLL cells that was dependent on the activation of NF-kappaB signaling by soluble TNFalpha. The newly synthesized ILK protein colocalized to centrosomal structures and was required for correct centrosome clustering and mitotic spindle organization. Furthermore, we established a mouse model of CLL in which B-cell-specific genetic ablation of ILK resulted in decelerated leukemia development due to reduced organ infiltration and proliferation of CLL cells. Collectively, our findings describe a TNFalpha-NF-kappaB-mediated mechanism by which ILK expression is induced in the lymph node microenvironment and propose that ILK promotes leukemogenesis by enabling CLL cells to cope with centrosomal defects acquired during malignant transformation.

KDM1A plays an important role in hematopoiesis and was identified as a dependency factor in leukemia stem cell populations. Therefore, we investigated the consequences of inhibiting KDM1A in a panel of cell lines representing all acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) subtypes using selective, reversible and irreversible KDM1A small-molecule inhibitors. Cell models of AML, CML, and T-ALL were potently affected by KDM1A inhibition, and cells bearing RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (AML1-ETO) translocations were especially among the most sensitive. RNAi-mediated silencing of KDM1A also effectively suppressed growth of RUNX1-RUNX1T1-containing cell lines. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of KDM1A resulted in complete abrogation of tumor growth in an AML xenograft model harboring RUNX1-RUNX1T1 translocations. We unexpectedly found that KDM1A-targeting compounds not only inhibited the catalytic activity of the enzyme, but evicted KDM1A from target genes. Accordingly, compound-mediated KDM1A eviction was associated with elevated levels of local histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation, and increased target gene expression, which was further accompanied by cellular differentiation and induction of cell death. Finally, our finding that KDM1A inhibitors effectively synergize with multiple conventional as well as candidate anti-AML agents affords a framework for potential future clinical application.

In this study, we clearly demonstrate that G0S2 opposes oncogene-induced transformation using G0s2-null immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). G0s2-null MEFs were readily transformed with HRAS or EGFR treatment compared with wild-type MEFs. Importantly, restoration of G0S2 reversed HRAS-driven transformation. G0S2 is known to regulate fat metabolism by attenuating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), but repression of oncogene-induced transformation by G0S2 was independent of ATGL inhibition. Gene expression analysis revealed an upregulation of gene signatures associated with transformation, proliferation, and MYC targets in G0s2-null MEFs. RNAi-mediated ablation and pharmacologic inhibition of MYC abrogated oncogene-induced transformation of G0s2-null MEFs. Furthermore, we found that G0S2 was highly expressed in normal breast tissues compared with malignant tissue. Intriguingly, high levels of G0S2 were also associated with a decrease in breast cancer recurrence rates, especially in estrogen receptor-positive subtypes, and overexpression of G0S2 repressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro. Taken together, these findings indicate that G0S2 functions as a tumor suppressor in part by opposing MYC activity, prompting further investigation of the mechanisms by which G0S2 silencing mediates MYC-induced oncogenesis in other malignancies.",['(c)2016 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Yim, Christina Y', 'Sekula, David J', 'Hever-Jardine, Mary P', 'Liu, Xi', 'Warzecha, Joshua M', 'Tam, Janice', 'Freemantle, Sarah J', 'Dmitrovsky, Ethan', 'Spinella, Michael J']","['Yim CY', 'Sekula DJ', 'Hever-Jardine MP', 'Liu X', 'Warzecha JM', 'Tam J', 'Freemantle SJ', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Spinella MJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.', 'Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.', 'Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.', 'Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

Our understanding of MA4-mediated transformation is very limited. Whole-genome sequencing studies revealed a silent mutational landscape, which contradicts the aggressive clinical outcome of this hematologic malignancy. Only RAS mutations were recurrently detected in patients and found to be associated with poorer outcome. The absence of MA4-driven B-ALL models further questions whether MA4 acts as a single oncogenic driver or requires cooperating mutations to manifest a malignant phenotype. We explored whether KRAS activation cooperates with MA4 to initiate leukemia in cord blood-derived CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC). Clonogenic and differentiation/proliferation assays demonstrated that KRAS activation does not cooperate with MA4 to immortalize CD34(+) HSPCs. Intrabone marrow transplantation into immunodeficient mice further showed that MA4 and KRAS(G12V) alone or in combination enhanced hematopoietic repopulation without impairing myeloid-lymphoid differentiation, and that mutated KRAS did not cooperate with MA4 to initiate leukemia. However, KRAS activation enhanced extramedullary hematopoiesis of MA4-expressing cell lines and CD34(+) HSPCs that was associated with leukocytosis and central nervous system infiltration, both hallmarks of infant t(4;11)(+) B-ALL. Transcriptional profiling of MA4-expressing patients supported a cell migration gene signature underlying the mutant KRAS-mediated phenotype. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that KRAS affects the homeostasis of MA4-expressing HSPCs, suggesting that KRAS activation in MA4(+) B-ALL is important for tumor maintenance rather than initiation.

The acquisition and selection of genomic aberrations may be critical to understanding the progression of this disease. In this study, we have extensively characterized the mutational status of TP53, SF3B1, BIRC3, NOTCH1, and ATM in 406 untreated CLL cases by ultra-deep next-generation sequencing, which detected subclonal mutations down to 0.3% allele frequency. Clonal dynamics were examined in longitudinal samples of 48 CLL patients. We identified a high proportion of subclonal mutations, isolated or associated with clonal aberrations. TP53 mutations were present in 10.6% of patients (6.4% clonal, 4.2% subclonal), ATM mutations in 11.1% (7.8% clonal, 1.3% subclonal, 2% germ line mutations considered pathogenic), SF3B1 mutations in 12.6% (7.4% clonal, 5.2% subclonal), NOTCH1 mutations in 21.8% (14.2% clonal, 7.6% subclonal), and BIRC3 mutations in 4.2% (2% clonal, 2.2% subclonal). ATM mutations, clonal SF3B1, and both clonal and subclonal NOTCH1 mutations predicted for shorter time to first treatment irrespective of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region gene (IGHV) mutational status. Clonal and subclonal TP53 and clonal NOTCH1 mutations predicted for shorter overall survival together with the IGHV mutational status. Clonal evolution in longitudinal samples mainly occurred in cases with mutations in the initial samples and was observed not only after chemotherapy but also in untreated patients. These findings suggest that the characterization of the subclonal architecture and its dynamics in the evolution of the disease may be relevant for the management of CLL patients.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Nadeu, Ferran', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Royo, Cristina', 'Baumann, Tycho', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Pinyol, Magda', 'Jares, Pedro', 'Navarro, Alba', 'Martin-Garcia, David', 'Bea, Silvia', 'Salaverria, Itziar', 'Oldreive, Ceri', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Suarez-Cisneros, Helena', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Alcoceba, Miguel', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Colado, Enrique', 'Puente, Xose S', 'Lopez-Otin, Carlos', 'Enjuanes, Anna', 'Campo, Elias']","['Nadeu F', 'Delgado J', 'Royo C', 'Baumann T', 'Stankovic T', 'Pinyol M', 'Jares P', 'Navarro A', 'Martin-Garcia D', 'Bea S', 'Salaverria I', 'Oldreive C', 'Aymerich M', 'Suarez-Cisneros H', 'Rozman M', 'Villamor N', 'Colomer D', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Gonzalez M', 'Alcoceba M', 'Terol MJ', 'Colado E', 'Puente XS', 'Lopez-Otin C', 'Enjuanes A', 'Campo E']","[""Lymphoid Neoplasm Program, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain;"", ""Lymphoid Neoplasm Program, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain;

The aims of the study were to quantify inter-individual differences in expression level, to determine the relationship between expression level and response to treatment, and to investigate the effect of expression level on interpretation of the RT-qPCR result. METHODS: BCR-ABL1 expression was studied in 248 samples from 65 patients with CML by determining the difference between MRD quantified by RT-qPCR and DNA-qPCR. The results were analysed statistically and by simple indicative modelling. RESULTS: Inter-individual levels of expression approximated a normal distribution with an SD of 0.36 log. Expression at diagnosis correlated with expression during treatment. Response to treatment, as measured by the number of leukaemic cells after 3, 6 or 12 months of treatment, was not related to the level of expression. Indicative modelling suggested that interpretation of RT-qPCR results in relation to treatment guidelines could be affected by variation in expression when MRD was around 10% at 3 months and by both expression variation and Poisson variation when MRD was around or below the limit of detection of RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Variation between individuals in expression of BCR-ABL1 can materially affect interpretation of the RT-qPCR when this test is used to make decisions on treatment.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

METHODS: Observational case report. RESULTS: A 57-year-old African American male with history of primary myelofibrosis, diagnosed by bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, believed to be in remission was referred to us for bilateral angle-closure glaucoma refractory to medical treatment and laser peripheral iridotomy. His fundus examination revealed serous retinal detachments, choroidal effusions, and Roth spots, and B-scan revealed his angle closure was due to annular anterior ciliochoroidal effusions. The patient was taken to surgery for a pars plana vitrectomy with radial sclerotomies performed to relieve the patient's eye pressure in the left eye. Cytologic analysis of the choroidal effusions revealed neutrophilic infiltrates with immature forms and erythroid precursors, suggesting a neoplastic infiltration from the patient's primary myelofibrosis. The patient's vision and ocular symptoms significantly improved after chemotherapy. Repeat bone marrow aspiration and biopsy confirmed the patient's primary myelofibrosis with no progression to acute leukemia despite his high leukocyte count. CONCLUSION: Neoplastic infiltration of primary idiopathic myelofibrosis into the eye and surrounding structures, which is scantly described in the current literature, may be an early sign of new onset or relapsing primary myelofibrosis.

Hemin is therefore an attractive disease-modifying option for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), a human prion disorder with no effective treatment. The hemin-PrP(C) interaction is also of interest in cerebral-hemorrhage (CH), a condition where potentially toxic hemin molecules come in contact with neuronal PrP(C). Interestingly, PrP(C) is upregulated in penumbric neurons surrounding CH and is known to confer neuroprotection in a dose-dependent manner. The underlying mechanism, however, is not clear. Here, we report that hemin binds PrP(C) on diverse cell lines, resulting in its aggregation or degradation in a cell-type specific manner. Surprisingly, the hemin-PrP(C) interaction upregulates Hb synthesis in hematopoietic cells, a response reversed by deleting the hemin-binding octa-peptide repeat region of PrP(C). A similar response is noted in brain organotypic cultures where exposure to hemin induces significantly more alpha-globin in wild-type (PrP(+/+)) relative to PrP-knock-out (PrP(-/-)) samples. Furthermore, red blood cells and brain tissue from PrP(-/-) mice show significantly less alpha-globin relative to PrP(+/+) controls, indicating a positive effect of PrP(C) on Hb synthesis under physiological conditions as well. Surprisingly, levels of alpha-globin are significantly higher in sCJD brain tissue relative to controls, suggesting compensatory upregulation of Hb synthesis by surviving neurons or misregulation in diseased brains.

This has been achieved by using Wiener filter along with Curvelet transform for image enhancement and noise elimination in order to elude false edges. We have also used combination of entropy filter, thresholding and mathematical morphology for obtaining image segmentation and boundary detection, whereas we have used back-propagation neural network for leukocyte classification into its sub classes.

OBJECTIVE: To further investigate the relationship between methylation of ATPsyn-beta gene, mRNA expression as well as chemoresistance in AML. METHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR and methylation specific PCR were performed to assess mRNA expression and methylation status of ATPsyn-beta gene on primary bone marrow nuclear cells (BMMCs), and cell proliferation assay was used to determine the sensitivity of BMMCs to adriamycin. RESULTS: Hypermethylation status of ATPsyn-beta gene promoter existed in those relapsed/refractory AML patients, and this hypermethylation of the gene was associated with a suppressed mRNA expression levels. Four patients at diagnosis and relapse underwent gene methylation status shift from hypermethylation to hypomethylation, which was accompanied by reduced mRNA expression of the gene. 5-azacitidine(5-Aza)- a demethylating agent, could restore ATPsyn-beta mRNA expression and increase the adriamycin sensitivity of primary leukemic cells from seven relapsed/ refractory AML patients.

In contrast, the Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I) has been classified in a separate class referred to as ""transactivating retroviruses"". Current views suggest that the viral encoded Tax protein transactivates expression of cellular genes leading to deregulated growth and transformation. However, if Tax-mediated transactivation was indeed sufficient for cellular transformation, a fairly high frequency of infected cells would eventually become transformed. In contrast, the frequency of transformation by HTLV-I is very low, likely less than 5%. This review will discuss the current understanding and recent discoveries highlighting critical functions of Tax in cellular transformation. HTLV-I Tax carries out essential functions in order to override cell cycle checkpoints and deregulate cellular division. In addition, Tax expression is associated with increased DNA damage and genome instability. Since Tax can inhibit multiple DNA repair pathways and stimulate unfaithful DNA repair or bypass checkpoints, these processes allow accumulation of genetic mutations in the host genome.

To determine the potential association between WT1 and a known marker of NB, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in this high risk group of patients. METHODS: A total of 141 random samples from 34 patients were obtained, at diagnosis (n=27), during therapy (n=95), in clinical remission (n=13), and at the time of relapse (n=6). Quantitative RT-PCR was used for the evaluation of the level of gene expression using specific primers. RESULTS: Although similar gene expressions were demonstrated in both controls when evaluating both genes, significant difference was found at each clinical time point. Furthermore, when comparing patient samples from diagnosis to clinical remission and diagnosis to clinical relapse, individual gene expression varied.

This represents a dramatic improvement since 50 years ago when the cure rate of childhood cancer was <25% in the pre-chemotherapy era. Over the past ten years, while improvement in overall survival (OS) has been marginal, progress in pediatric oncology lies with adopting risk-adapted therapeutic approach. This has been made possible through identifying clinical and biologic prognostic factors with rigorous research and stratifying patients using these risk factors, and subsequently modifying therapy according to risk group assignment. This review provides a perspective for eight distinct pediatric malignancies, in which significant advances in treatment were made in the last decade and are leading to changes in standard of care. This includes four hematologic malignancies [acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)] and four solid tumors [medulloblastoma (MB), low grade glioma (LGG), neuroblastoma (NB) and Ewing sarcoma (ES)]. Together, they comprise 60% of childhood cancer. Improved patient outcome is not limited to better survival, but encompasses reducing both short and long-term treatment-related complications which is as important as cure, given the majority of childhood cancer patients will become long-term survivors. Risk-adapted approach allows treatment intensification in the high-risk cohort while therapy can be de-escalated in the low-risk to minimize toxicity and late sequelae without compromising survival. Advances in medical research technology have also led to a rapid increase in the understanding of the genetics of childhood cancer in the last decade, facilitating identification of molecular targets that can potentially be exploited for therapeutic benefits. As we move into the era of targeted therapeutics, searching for novel agents that target specific genetic lesions becomes a major research focus. We provide an overview of seven novel agents (bevacizumab, bortezomib, vorinostat, sorafenib, tipifarnib, erlotinib and mTOR inhibitors), which have been most frequently pursued in childhood cancers in the last decade, as well as reporting the progress of clinical trials involving these agents.",,"['Saletta, Federica', 'Seng, Michaela S', 'Lau, Loretta M S']","['Saletta F', 'Seng MS', 'Lau LM']","[""1 Children's Cancer Research Unit, Kid's Research Institute, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia ; 2 Oncology Department, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia ; 3 Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""1 Children's Cancer Research Unit, Kid's Research Institute, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia ; 2 Oncology Department, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia ; 3 Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""1 Children's Cancer Research Unit, Kid's Research Institute, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia ; 2 Oncology Department, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia ; 3 Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",China,Transl Pediatr,Translational pediatrics,101649179,,,,PMC4729100,,2014/04/01 00:00,2014/04/01 00:01,['2016/02/03 06:00'],"['2016/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3978/j.issn.2224-4336.2014.02.01 [doi]', 'tp-03-02-156 [pii]']",ppublish,Transl Pediatr. 2014 Apr;3(2):156-82. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.2224-4336.2014.02.01.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'advances', 'childhood', 'molecular', 'pediatric', 'treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a life threatening disease commonly at 5 years old children. Research on FA is one of the fastest areas in medical research field. The identification of 15 different FA genes and the elucidation of the FA molecular pathways have translated into the understanding of the pathogenic mechanism and practically provided the directions for therapies. Studies on FA rendered invaluable information for the studies on cancers because FA possesses the unique features in many different biological aspects. Studies revealed the genetic linking between FA and cancers that FA genes are in cancers and cancers genes are in FA. As a result, FA is named as a paradigmatic disease for the understanding of cancer and aging. In clinical practice, an early and accurate diagnosis of FA before the stage of bone marrow failure, cancer/leukemia is crucial for the adequate treatment, the prevention of serious medical complications and also for the properly management in the other caring areas including paediatric, hematology, immunology, endocrinology, reproductive/IVF, obstetrics and surgery. However, an early and accurate diagnosis for FA is often difficult because FA is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disease. Diagnosis in more or less cases can be delayed until bone marrow failure or cancer/leukemia occurs. As a result that delayed or misdiagnosis even wrong treatment received for patients with FA are not uncommon events clinically in some regions or countries due to the lack of recognition of FA from the clinicians and the limitation in testing resource in laboratory.

The evidence for safety and efficacy of agents targeting AML-niche interactions is currently limited to preclinical and early phase clinical studies. Examples include CXCR4 inhibitors, hypoxia-inducible agents, and adhesion molecule inhibitors. Agents that target AML-stroma interactions differ from mutation-specific approaches that tend to be limited due to within-individual and between-individual genetic heterogeneity.

The impending loss of patent exclusivity for imatinib has the potential to reduce costs for payers. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to estimate the economic impact of the loss of patent exclusivity for branded imatinib and to calculate the relative impact of requiring prior authorization (PA) for the use of generic imatinib before a branded TKI. The secondary objective was to evaluate the potential relative cost impact of using a preferred branded TKI in addition to the PA requirement for generic imatinib before a branded TKI. METHODS: A Microsoft Excel-based model was developed from the perspective of a US payer (commercial and Medicare) for a 2-year period. Data on utilization, patient out-of-pocket cost, and market share were obtained from an analysis of Truven Health MarketScan claims. It was assumed that the cost of generic imatinib would be 47.8% of the price of branded imatinib. It was assumed that 70% of patients receiving branded imatinib would shift to generic imatinib in year 1, and 95% would shift in year 2 after loss of patent exclusivity. Formulary management could be applied through PA requiring the use of generic imatinib before a branded TKI for patients newly prescribed TKI therapy. It was assumed that 74% of PA requests would be approved, and that the administrative cost of each would be $20. RESULTS: In a hypothetical 1 million member commercial plan, the loss of patent exclusivity for branded imatinib produced cost-savings of $6.8 million during 2 years, or 28.8% of the total pharmacy spending on the TKI class. The savings were even greater in a 1 million member Medicare plan, at $22.9 million (28.8%). Formulary management reduced incremental TKI spending by 1.1% and 2.2% for the commercial and Medicare plans, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of formulary management beyond generic substitution, the loss of patent exclusivity for branded imatinib is expected to reduce total pharmacy spending on TKIs by nearly 33% during 2 years. Given the small number of newly treated patients, formulary management of the TKI class through restricted access to branded imatinib, with or without a preferred branded TKI, has limited potential for incremental cost-savings.",,"['Bloudek, Lisa M', 'Makenbaeva, Dinara', 'Eaddy, Michael']","['Bloudek LM', 'Makenbaeva D', 'Eaddy M']","['Dr Bloudek is Assistant Director, Xcenda, LLC, Palm Harbor, FL.', 'Dr Makenbaeva is Hematology Lead, Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ.', 'Dr Eaddy is Vice President, Xcenda, LLC, Palm Harbor, FL.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am Health Drug Benefits,American health & drug benefits,101479877,,,,PMC4719136,,2016/02/03 06:00,2016/02/03 06:01,['2016/02/03 06:00'],"['2016/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/03 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am Health Drug Benefits. 2015 Dec;8(9):472-80.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'cost-savings', 'formulary management', 'generic imatinib', 'payers', 'pharmacy spending', 'prior authorization', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral envelope glycoprotein (Env) induces the membrane fusion, and also mediates cell-cell fusion. There are two types of cell-cell fusions induced by the Env protein. Fusion-from-within is induced by fusion between viral fusogenic Env protein-expressing cells and susceptible cells, and virions induce fusion-from-without by fusion between adjacent cells. Although entry of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MLV) requires host cell endocytosis, the involvement of endocytosis in cell fusion is unclear. By fluorescent microscopic analysis of the fusion-from-within, we found that fragments of target cells are internalized into Env-expressing cells. Treatment of the Env-expressing cells with an endocytosis inhibitor more significantly inhibited the cell fusion than that of the target cells, indicating that endocytosis in Env-expressing cells is required for the cell fusion. The endocytosis inhibitor also attenuated the fusion-from-without. Electron microscopic analysis suggested that the membrane fusion resulting in fusion-from-within initiates in endocytic membrane dents.

We are presenting our experience of the treatment of priapism and the status of sexual function even following successful detumescence achieved after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients, who presented with priapism from January 2012 to December 2014, were included in the study. After obtaining a detailed history; color Doppler ultrasonography of penis and blood gas analysis of the initial corporal aspirate were done to ascertain the type of priapism. Standard protocol in our institute for management of priaprism was to start with conservative treatment by corporal aspiration and intracorporeal injection (ICI) of phenylephrine. On the failure of conservative management, distal shunts were performed. Proximal shunts were performed on the failure of distal shunt procedures. Erectile function was evaluated with International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaire on admission and during follow-up. RESULTS: All the patients had ischemic type priapism. Age of the patients ranged from 22 to 55 years. Duration of priapism varied from 20 to 480 h (mean 96.7). Etiologies attributed were; over-the-counter sildenafil use, chlorpromazine, opium intake and intracorporeal papaverine injection, chronic myeloid leukemia, and idiopathic. Five patients had preserved erectile function during follow-up. Preservation of normal erectile function following aspiration and ICI, proximal and distal shunt procedures were 66.7%, 18.1% and 20%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with late presentation and those patients requiring higher treatment modalities (e.g., proximal shunts) for achieving detumescence will subsequently have a poor erectile function. These patients should be counseled about the early penile prosthesis placement during initial surgical management.",,"['Pal, Dilip Kumar', 'Biswal, Deepak Kumar', 'Ghosh, Bastab']","['Pal DK', 'Biswal DK', 'Ghosh B']","['Department of Urology, Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Urology, Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Urology, Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,Urol Ann,Urology annals,101510823,,,,PMC4719511,,2016/02/03 06:00,2016/02/03 06:01,['2016/02/03 06:00'],"['2016/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0974-7796.165717 [doi]', 'UA-8-46 [pii]']",ppublish,Urol Ann. 2016 Jan-Mar;8(1):46-50. doi: 10.4103/0974-7796.165717.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Erectile dysfunction', 'impotence', 'penile implant', 'penile prosthesis', 'priapism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of functionally distinct subpopulations in this disease is therefore crucial to dissecting the molecular machinery underlying LSC self-renewal. Here, we combined next-generation sequencing technology with in vivo assessment of LSC frequencies and identified the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) as a novel and stable marker for human LSCs for the majority of AML samples. High GPR56 expression was significantly associated with high-risk genetic subgroups and poor outcome. Analysis of GPR56 in combination with CD34 expression revealed engraftment potential of GPR56(+)cells in both the CD34(-)and CD34(+)fractions, thus defining a novel LSC compartment independent of the CD34(+)CD38(-)LSC phenotype.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Pabst, Caroline', 'Bergeron, Anne', 'Lavallee, Vincent-Philippe', 'Yeh, Jonathan', 'Gendron, Patrick', 'Norddahl, Gudmundur L', 'Krosl, Jana', 'Boivin, Isabel', 'Deneault, Eric', 'Simard, Jessica', 'Imren, Suzan', 'Boucher, Genevieve', 'Eppert, Kolja', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Humphries, Keith', 'Lemieux, Sebastien', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Barabe, Frederic']","['Pabst C', 'Bergeron A', 'Lavallee VP', 'Yeh J', 'Gendron P', 'Norddahl GL', 'Krosl J', 'Boivin I', 'Deneault E', 'Simard J', 'Imren S', 'Boucher G', 'Eppert K', 'Herold T', 'Bohlander SK', 'Humphries K', 'Lemieux S', 'Hebert J', 'Sauvageau G', 'Barabe F']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Stem Cells, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada;

Genetic deletion in mice has shown that Gata2 is pivotal to the embryonic generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). It functions in the embryo during endothelial cell to hematopoietic cell transition to affect hematopoietic cluster, HPC, and HSC formation. Gata2 conditional deletion and overexpression studies show the importance of Gata2 levels in hematopoiesis, during all developmental stages. Although previous studies of cell populations phenotypically enriched in HPCs and HSCs show expression of Gata2, there has been no direct study of Gata2 expressing cells during normal hematopoiesis. In this study, we generate a Gata2Venus reporter mouse model with unperturbed Gata2 expression to examine the hematopoietic function and transcriptome of Gata2 expressing and nonexpressing cells. We show that all the HSCs are Gata2 expressing. However, not all HPCs in the aorta, vitelline and umbilical arteries, and fetal liver require or express Gata2. These Gata2-independent HPCs exhibit a different functional output and genetic program, including Ras and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein pathways and other Gata factors, compared with Gata2-dependent HPCs.

In other malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia, presence of IDH mutation is associated with elevated 2-HG levels in serum or urine compartments. Circulating 2-HG in patients with glial malignancies has not been thoroughly investigated. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 2-HG levels in the serum and urine of a large set of patients with IDH-mutant and IDH-wild-type glioma, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a subset of this cohort. RESULTS: We found that 2-HG was elevated in the urine of patients with IDH-mutant versus IDH-wild-type glioma, although no significant differences in 2-HG levels were observed in the serum or the small set of CSF samples obtained. Among patients with IDH-mutant glioma, 2-HG levels did not differ based on the histopathologic grade, genetic subtype (TP53 mutant or 1p/19q codeleted), presence of a canonical (IDH1 R132H) or noncanonical (any other IDH variant) mutation, or treatment type. CONCLUSION: Our finding suggests that urinary 2-HG is increased among patients with IDH-mutant gliomas, and may represent a future surrogate, noninvasive biomarker to aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and management. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Patients with glioma who harbor mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase genes showed selective elevation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate in the urine. Similar elevations were not identified in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid. 2-Hydroxyglutarate may serve as a useful, noninvasive biomarker to stratify patients newly diagnosed with glioma with regard to prognosis and management.",['(c)AlphaMed Press.'],"['Fathi, Amir T', 'Nahed, Brian V', 'Wander, Seth A', 'Iafrate, A John', 'Borger, Darrell R', 'Hu, Ranliang', 'Thabet, Ashraf', 'Cahill, Daniel P', 'Perry, Ashley M', 'Joseph, Christelle P', 'Muzikansky, Alona', 'Chi, Andrew S']","['Fathi AT', 'Nahed BV', 'Wander SA', 'Iafrate AJ', 'Borger DR', 'Hu R', 'Thabet A', 'Cahill DP', 'Perry AM', 'Joseph CP', 'Muzikansky A', 'Chi AS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA afathi@partners.org.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Translational Research Laboratory, Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Translational Research Laboratory, Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Biostatistics Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Division of Neuro-Oncology, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],['P50 CA165962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glutarates)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Here, we find excess Hedgehog (HH) ligand secretion and loss of PTCH2 in myeloproliferative disease, which drives canonical and noncanonical HH-signaling. Interestingly, Ptch2(-/-) mice mimic dual pathway activation and develop a MPN-phenotype with leukocytosis (neutrophils and monocytes), strong progenitor and LKS mobilization, splenomegaly, anemia, and loss of lymphoid lineages. HSCs exhibit increased cell cycling with improved stress hematopoiesis after 5-FU treatment, and this results in HSC exhaustion over time. Cytopenias, LKS loss, and mobilization are all caused by loss of Ptch2 in the niche, whereas hematopoietic loss of Ptch2 drives leukocytosis and promotes LKS maintenance and replating capacity in vitro. Ptch2(-/-) niche cells show hyperactive noncanonical HH signaling, resulting in reduced production of essential HSC regulators (Scf, Cxcl12, and Jag1) and depletion of osteoblasts. Interestingly, Ptch2 loss in either the niche or in hematopoietic cells dramatically accelerated human JAK2V617F-driven pathogenesis, causing transformation of nonlethal chronic MPNs into aggressive lethal leukemias with >30% blasts in the peripheral blood.

However, the exact molecular mechanism and altered gene expression associated with apoptosis is unclear. In this study, we investigated SFN-induced cytotoxic effects and whether or not they went through cell-cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis and further examined molecular mechanism and altered gene expression in human leukemia HL-60 cells. Cell viability, cell-cycle distribution, sub-G1 (apoptosis), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+) production, levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim ), and caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities were assayed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis-associated proteins levels and gene expressions were examined by Western blotting and cDNA microarray assays, respectively. Results indicated that SFN decreased viable cells, induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis based on sub-G1 phase development. Furthermore, SFN increased ROS and Ca(2+) production and decreased the levels of DeltaPsim and activated caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities in HL-60 cells. SFN significantly upregulated the expression of BAX, Bid, Fas, Fas-L, caspase-8, Endo G, AIF, and cytochrome c, and inhibited the antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-x and XIAP, that is associated with apoptosis. We also used cDNA microarray to confirm several gene expressions such as caspase -8, -3, -4, -6, and -7 that are affected by SFN. Those results indicated that SFN induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells via Fas- and mitochondria-dependent pathways. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Linear 48-mer 1 is known to form monovalent cation channels on binding to lipid bilayers. We previously developed a fully synthetic route to 1, and then achieved the design and synthesis of a structurally simplified analogue of 1, namely, dansylated polytheonamide mimic 2. Although the synthetically more accessible 2 was found to emulate the channel function of 1, its cytotoxicity was decreased 120-fold. Herein, the chemical preparation and biological evaluation of seven analogues 3-9 of 2 are reported. Compounds 3-9 were modified at their N terminus and/or the side chain of residue 44 of 2 to alter their physicochemical properties. The total synthesis of 3-9 was accomplished in a unified fashion by a combination of solid-phase and solution-phase chemistry. Systematic evaluation of the hydrophobicities, single-channel currents, ion-exchange activities, and cytotoxicities of 3-9 revealed that their hydrophobicities are correlated with the total magnitude of ion exchange and determine their cytotoxic potency. Consequently, the most hydrophobic analogue 9 exhibited the lowest IC50 value, which is comparable to that of 1. Therefore, these results clarified that the bioactivity of the polytheonamide-based peptides can be rationally controlled by changing their hydrophobicity at the N and C termini of the 48-amino-acid sequence.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This inflammatory response prominently includes an array of cytokines known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Previous observations link the transcription-associated methyltransferase and oncoprotein MLL1 to the DDR, leading us to investigate the role of MLL1 in SASP expression. Our findings reveal direct MLL1 epigenetic control over proproliferative cell cycle genes: MLL1 inhibition represses expression of proproliferative cell cycle regulators required for DNA replication and DDR activation, thus disabling SASP expression. Strikingly, however, these effects of MLL1 inhibition on SASP gene expression do not impair OIS and, furthermore, abolish the ability of the SASP to enhance cancer cell proliferation. More broadly, MLL1 inhibition also reduces ""SASP-like"" inflammatory gene expression from cancer cells in vitro and in vivo independently of senescence. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MLL1 inhibition may be a powerful and effective strategy for inducing cancerous growth arrest through the direct epigenetic regulation of proliferation-promoting genes and the avoidance of deleterious OIS- or TIS-related tumor secretomes, which can promote both drug resistance and tumor progression.",['(c) 2016 Capell et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Capell, Brian C', 'Drake, Adam M', 'Zhu, Jiajun', 'Shah, Parisha P', 'Dou, Zhixun', 'Dorsey, Jean', 'Simola, Daniel F', 'Donahue, Greg', 'Sammons, Morgan', 'Rai, Taranjit Singh', 'Natale, Christopher', 'Ridky, Todd W', 'Adams, Peter D', 'Berger, Shelley L']","['Capell BC', 'Drake AM', 'Zhu J', 'Shah PP', 'Dou Z', 'Dorsey J', 'Simola DF', 'Donahue G', 'Sammons M', 'Rai TS', 'Natale C', 'Ridky TW', 'Adams PD', 'Berger SL']","['Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, Beatson Laboratories, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G611BD, United Kingdom; Institute of Biomedical and Environmental Health Research, University of the West of Scotland, Paisley PA12BE, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, Beatson Laboratories, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G611BD, United Kingdom;', 'Epigenetics Program, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA;']",['eng'],"['P01 AG031862/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AR007465/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01AG031862/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence/*genetics', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/physiopathology', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",PMC4743061,,2016/02/03 06:00,2016/06/14 06:00,['2016/02/03 06:00'],"['2016/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['30/3/321 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.271882.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2016 Feb 1;30(3):321-36. doi: 10.1101/gad.271882.115.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage response', 'MLL1', 'epigenetic', 'inflammation', 'oncogene-induced senescence', 'senescence-associated secretory phenotype']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

An improved survival, combined with a constant incidence, is expected to increase the prevalence of CML. However, data on the prevalence of CML remain scarce. We examined the overall and relative (age and gender matched) survival and assessed the past, present, and projected future prevalence of CML in Sweden. Data on all patients diagnosed with CML between 1970 and 2012 were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Register and the Swedish Cause of Death Register. The 5-year overall survival increased from 0.18 to 0.82, during the observed time period. Between 2006 and 2012, the 5-year relative survival was close to normal for 40-year-old, but considerably lower for 80-year-old CML patients. The observed prevalence tripled from 1985 to 2012, from 3.9 to 11.9 per 100 000 inhabitants. Assuming no further improvements in relative survival, the prevalence is projected to further increase by 2060 to 22.0 per 100 000 inhabitants (2587 persons in Sweden).

The aim of the present investigation was to study the interactive potentials of DAPG with the metastatic proteins such as MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-kappaB and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bcl-xL through in silico interaction and in vitro studies. The in silico modeling predicted high interactions of DAPG with the metastatic proteins, especially MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-kappaB with the glide score of -7.028, -6.304, and -5.231, respectively. Similarly, the DAPG had weak interactions with the antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bcl-xL with the glide score of -4.505, -3.839, and -4.003, respectively. The interaction studies further revealed the inhibition of MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-kappaB activities with the low IC50 concentration of 5.82 +/- 1.6, 6.74 +/- 1.2, and 10.7 +/- 1.5 muM respectively, in the presence of DAPG. Similarly, DAPG inhibited the Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w activities with the high IC50 concentration of 29.8 +/- 1.9, 85.9 +/- 2.7, and 97.4 +/- 1.5 muM, respectively. These results correlate with the relatively high IC50 concentration of 16.3 +/- 1.76, 7.67 +/- 0.78, and 10.7 +/- 0.96 muM in the Bcl-2-overexpressing HL-60, K562 and Raji leukemic cells than the metastatic A549 and MDA MB-231 cancer cells with the low IC50 concentration of 0.06 +/- 0.02 and 0.08 +/- 0.01 muM, respectively, compared to the healthy, human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells with the high IC50 concentration of 54.7 +/- 1.43 muM.

Thus, improved models that better predict survival outcomes and enable the development of biomarkers are needed to identify patients most likely to respond to and benefit from therapy. Here, we describe a comprehensive approach in which we incorporated biobanking, xenografting, and multiplexed phospho-flow (PF) cytometric profiling to study drug response and identify predictive biomarkers in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. To test the efficacy of our approach, we evaluated the investigational JAK2 inhibitor fedratinib (FED) in 64 patient samples. FED robustly reduced leukemia in mouse xenograft models in 59% of cases and was also effective in limiting the protumorigenic activity of leukemia stem cells as shown by serial transplantation assays. In parallel, PF profiling identified FED-mediated reduction in phospho-STAT5 (pSTAT5) levels as a predictive biomarker of in vivo drug response with high specificity (92%) and strong positive predictive value (93%). Unexpectedly, another JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib (RUX), was ineffective in 8 of 10 FED-responsive samples. Notably, this outcome could be predicted by the status of pSTAT5 signaling, which was unaffected by RUX treatment. Consistent with this observed discrepancy, PF analysis revealed that FED exerted its effects through multiple JAK2-independent mechanisms. Collectively, this work establishes an integrated approach for testing novel anticancer agents that captures the inherent variability of response caused by disease heterogeneity and in parallel, facilitates the identification of predictive biomarkers that can help stratify patients into appropriate clinical trials.",['(c)2016 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Chen, Weihsu C', 'Yuan, Julie S', 'Xing, Yan', 'Mitchell, Amanda', 'Mbong, Nathan', 'Popescu, Andreea C', 'McLeod, Jessica', 'Gerhard, Gitte', 'Kennedy, James A', 'Bogdanoski, Goce', 'Lauriault, Stevan', 'Perdu, Sofie', 'Merkulova, Yulia', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Guidos, Cynthia', 'Dick, John E', 'Wang, Jean C Y']","['Chen WC', 'Yuan JS', 'Xing Y', 'Mitchell A', 'Mbong N', 'Popescu AC', 'McLeod J', 'Gerhard G', 'Kennedy JA', 'Bogdanoski G', 'Lauriault S', 'Perdu S', 'Merkulova Y', 'Minden MD', 'Hogge DE', 'Guidos C', 'Dick JE', 'Wang JC']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

TICs are uniquely capable of recapitulating the tumor and are thought to be highly resistant to radio- and chemotherapy. Macroscopic patterns of tumor expansion before treatment and tumor regression during treatment are tied to the dynamics of TICs. Until now, the quantitative information about the fraction of TICs from macroscopic tumor burden trajectories could not be inferred. In this study, we generated a quantitative method based on a mathematical model that describes hierarchically organized tumor dynamics and patient-derived tumor burden information. The method identifies two characteristic equilibrium TIC regimes during expansion and regression. We show that tumor expansion and regression curves can be leveraged to infer estimates of the TIC fraction in individual patients at detection and after continued therapy. Furthermore, our method is parameter-free; it solely requires the knowledge of a patient's tumor burden over multiple time points to reveal microscopic properties of the malignancy. We demonstrate proof of concept in the case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), wherein our model recapitulated the clinical history of the disease in two independent patient cohorts. On the basis of patient-specific treatment responses in CML, we predict that after one year of targeted treatment, the fraction of TICs increases 100-fold and continues to increase up to 1,000-fold after 5 years of treatment. Our novel framework may significantly influence the implementation of personalized treatment strategies and has the potential for rapid translation into the clinic. Cancer Res; 76(7); 1705-13.

However, the role of EMT inducers in hematological malignancies is unknown. Twist1, an EMT inducer necessary for cell migration, has recently been found to have transcriptionally regulatory activity on the expression of Bmi1, and these two are capable of promoting tumorigenesis in a synergized manner. Knowing that Bmi1 expression is essential for maintenance of leukemic stem cells, we speculate that Twist1 might govern the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development as well. We found that upregulated Twist1 increased Bmi1 expression in AML and endued leukemic cells a higher proliferative potential and increased resistance to apoptosis. In primary AML samples, there was strong positive correlation between the expression levels of Twist1 and Bmi1. AML patients whose leukemic blasts harbored overexpressed Twist1 had a more aggressive clinical phenotype, but they were more likely to have a better clinical outcome after standard therapy. In vitro studies confirmed that Twist1-overexpressing leukemic cells were more susceptible to cytarabine, but not daunorubicin, cytotoxicity. Our findings suggest that, in a subset of AML patients, Twist1 has a prominent role in the pathogenesis of the disease that leads to unique clinical phenotypes.",,"['Chen, C-C', 'You, J-Y', 'Gau, J-P', 'Huang, C-E', 'Chen, Y-Y', 'Tsai, Y-H', 'Chou, H-J', 'Lung, J', 'Yang, M-H']","['Chen CC', 'You JY', 'Gau JP', 'Huang CE', 'Chen YY', 'Tsai YH', 'Chou HJ', 'Lung J', 'Yang MH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Lotung Poh-Ai Hospital, Yilan, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Immunology Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Genome Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TWIST1 protein, human)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4558591,,2016/02/03 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2016/02/03 06:00'],"['2015/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201567 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2015.67 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2015 Aug 14;5:e339. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2015.67.,,,,20150814,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we established quantitative fragment analysis of FLT3-ITD simultaneously measuring mutant allele burden and length, verified the analytical performance and evaluated the clinical significance in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. FLT3-ITD was detected in 73 of 363 adult AML patients (20.1%) and high mutant allelic burden (50%, n=13) and long ITD length (70 base pairs, n=15) were significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS; P=0.002 and 0.005, respectively) and event-free survival (EFS; P=0.004 and 0.007, respectively). FLT3-ITD poor prognostic group was identified as patients with high allele burden or long ITD length (n=24), which revealed significant adverse clinical outcome for both OS (P<0.001) and EFS (P<0.001). In cytogenetically normal AML, even FLT3-ITD low allele burden and short length was associated with poorer OS (P=0.037) and EFS (P=0.044) than wild type, whose influence was overcome when hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed. In minimal residual disease monitoring, FLT3-ITD negativity after consolidation therapy was a valuable predictor of better OS (P<0.001) and EFS (P<0.001).

For one signature miRNA, miR-126, high bioactivity aggregated all in vivo patient sample LSC activity into a single sorted population, tightly coupling miR-126 expression to LSC function. Through functional studies, miR-126 was found to restrain cell cycle progression, prevent differentiation, and increase self-renewal of primary LSC in vivo. Compared with prior results showing miR-126 regulation of normal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) cycling, these functional stem effects are opposite between LSC and HSC.

The histone variant macroH2A1 (mH2A1) is almost three times the size of its canonical H2A counterpart, due to the presence of an approximately 25 kDa evolutionarily conserved non-histone macro domain. Strikingly, mH2A1 can mediate both gene repression and activation. However, the molecular determinants conferring these alternative functions remain elusive. Here, we report that mH2A1.2 is required for the activation of the myogenic gene regulatory network and muscle cell differentiation. H3K27 acetylation at prospective enhancers is exquisitely sensitive to mH2A1.2, indicating a role of mH2A1.2 in imparting enhancer activation. Both H3K27 acetylation and recruitment of the transcription factor Pbx1 at prospective enhancers are regulated by mH2A1.2. Overall, our findings indicate a role of mH2A1.2 in marking regulatory regions for activation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) was more highly expressed in K562R than in the parental cell line K562S, and higher levels of IL-1beta contributed to the imatinib resistance of K562R. In addition, IL-1beta secreted from K562R cells affected stromal cell production of CXCL11, which in turn promoted migration of K562R cells into the stroma.

We postulated that RT usage after CALGB's publication should have decreased over time. STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated a cohort of 205,860 women aged 70 years or older, with stage I, ER+/progesterone receptor (PR)+ breast cancer with lumpectomy, diagnosed between 1998 and 2012, in the National Cancer Data Base. Clinicopathologic and sociodemographic variables were compared between pre-CALGB and post-CALGB publication (circa 2004). Univariate and multivariate analysis were used. RESULTS: Radiation therapy usage decreased by only 2.95% after CALGB publication (68.71% vs 65.76%; p < 0.0001). Almost one-third of women with short life expectancy (>/=85 years) received RT in the post-CALGB group. Significant predictors (p < 0.01) of lowest RT use include advanced age, increased great circle distance, academic research program, East South Central region, rural population < 2,500 not adjacent to a metropolitan area, low income level, high comorbidity index, small tumor, well-differentiated histology, residual tumor, and lack of receipt of anti-hormonal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The CALGB trial had a minimal impact on the rate of adjuvant RT use among elderly women with small, hormone positive breast cancers. Significant variation in RT usage exists across sociodemographic strata.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Population mixing can result in increased contacts between infected and susceptible individuals and may increase the risk of leukemia. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between residential mobility as an indicator of population mixing at individual level and the risk of leukemia in children (<15 years). METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study using Finnish register data. Cases (n = 1,093) were all children diagnosed with leukemia (M9800-M9948 in ICD-O-3) at <15 years of age in Finland in 1990-2011. We chose randomly three controls per case (n = 3,279), free of cancer and alive in the end of the index year (diagnosis of the case). Controls were matched by sex and age. A comprehensive history of residential mobility was constructed from the population registry including overall migration, moving to a larger municipality (more inhabitants), and moving to a municipality with low, intermediate, or high migration intensity. The association between residential mobility and the risk of childhood leukemia was evaluated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We did not observe consistently increased or decreased risks of childhood leukemia associated with different migration patterns. Overall, residential mobility showed odds ratios nonsignificantly below unity, and no elevated risks were found. CONCLUSION: Our results do not indicate that higher residential mobility or moving to municipalities with more inhabitants is associated with risk of childhood leukemia.",,"['Jarvela, Laura', 'Raitanen, Jani', 'Erme, Sini', 'Lohi, Olli', 'Auvinen, Anssi']","['Jarvela L', 'Raitanen J', 'Erme S', 'Lohi O', 'Auvinen A']","['School of Health Sciences, University of Tampere, 33014, Tampere, Finland.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of Tampere, 33014, Tampere, Finland.', 'UKK Institute for Health Promotion, Tampere, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere Medical School and Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere Medical School and Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of Tampere, 33014, Tampere, Finland. anssi.auvinen@uta.fi.', 'STUK - Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, Helsinki, Finland. anssi.auvinen@uta.fi.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, University of Tampere Medical School and Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland. anssi.auvinen@uta.fi.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', '*Population Dynamics', 'Registries']",,,2016/02/03 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2016/02/03 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10552-016-0720-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-016-0720-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2016 Mar;27(3):433-43. doi: 10.1007/s10552-016-0720-y.

These cases included two rats (Case 1 and 2) from a sesame oil-treated group and one rat (Case 3) from a chemical-treated group in the same single gavage study. Case 1 rapidly lost body weight at 13 weeks of age without any clinical signs and died. Round lymphoid tumor cells were found in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and pancreas. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for CD3 and PCNA, which is suggestive of malignant T-cell lymphoma. Cases 2 and 3 had rapid body weight loss at 14 and 16 weeks of age, respectively, exhibited severe anemia, hypolocomotion, and decreased body temperature, and were euthanized due to a poor prognosis based on severe clinical signs. Pleomorphic large tumor cells were found in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, heart, kidneys, lung, pancreas, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, ovaries, Harderian gland, and/or eyes.

CD10 expression is reported to be a favorable prognostic marker for some tumors such as B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, but unfavorable for others. Here, we report the case of a 33-year-old woman diagnosed with endometrial mixed carcinoma with the NEC component expressing CD10 who showed a favorable outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with lumbago and brownish discharge from the genitals. Imaging modalities revealed a large exophytic mass in the uterine corpus, and a small one in the uterine cervix. Radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Microscopic examination of the endometrial and cervical masses revealed that the NEC component accounted for the maximum area in both masses. However, small areas in both lesions showed well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (WDEA) components, and histological transition between the two components was also observed. In addition to CD56 and synaptophysin expression, the NEC component was positive for CD10 but negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). In contrast, the WDEA component expressed both ER and PgR, but neither CD10 nor neuroendocrine markers were demonstrated. The CD10 and neuroendocrine markers clearly distinguished between the NEC and WDEA components. Furthermore, retained expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and weak phosphorylated Akt expression were found, which were assumed to suppress the aggressive behavior of the tumor.

The innate immune system is the first line of defense in preventing bacterial and viral infections, and dendritic cells (DCs) play important roles in innate immunity. Because bone marrow is an organ that is susceptible to ALV-J, the virus may influence the generation of bone marrow-derived DCs. In this study, DCs cultured in vitro were used to investigate the effects of ALV infection. The results revealed that ALV-J could infect these cells during the early stages of differentiation, and infection of DCs with ALV-J resulted in apoptosis. miRNA sequencing data of uninfected and infected DCs revealed 122 differentially expressed miRNAs, with 115 demonstrating upregulation after ALV-J infection and the other 7 showing significant downregulation. The miRNAs that exhibited the highest levels of upregulation may suppress nutrient processing and metabolic function. These results indicated that ALV-J infection of chicken DCs could induce apoptosis via aberrant microRNA expression.

Mixed samples were detected using DCDF and ES probes. Results of DCDF probes, ES probe before calibration, ES probes after calibration and theoretical results were compared by binomial distribution in different proportions. RESULTS: The rate of false positive signals has risen with increase of negative rate. A significant difference was found between theoretical proportion and results without calibration in negative level, 5%, 10% and 25% positive level (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between theoretical proportion and results without calibration in 50% and 90% positive level (P>0.05).

Pigs were fed from 6.5 to 115 kg.

The function of Tax1 in ATL development however is still controversial, primarily because Tax1 induces cell cycle progression and apoptosis. To systemically understand cell growth phase-dependent induction of cell survival or cell death by Tax1, we established a single experimental system using an interleukin 2 (IL-2)-dependent human T-cell line Kit 225 that can be forced into resting phase by IL-2 deprivation. Introduction of Tax1 and HTLV-2 Tax (Tax2B) decreased mitochondrial activity alongside apoptosis in growing cells but not in resting cells. Cell cycle profile analysis indicated that Tax1 and Tax2B were likely to perturb the S phase in growing cells. Studies with Tax1 mutants and siRNA for NF-kappaB/RelA revealed that Tax1-mediated cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in growing Kit 225 cells depend on RelA. Interestingly, inactivation of the non-canonical NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK pathways relieved Tax1-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that the Tax1-NF-kappaB-p38 MAPK axis may be associated with apoptosis in growing cells. Inflammatory mediators such as CCL3 and CCL4, which are involved in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), were induced by Tax1 and Tax2B in growing cells. In contrast, RelA silencing in resting cells reduced mitochondrial activity, indicating that NF-kappaB/RelA is also critical for Tax1-mediated cell survival. These findings suggest that Tax1-mediated cell survival and death depend on the cell growth phase. Both effects of Tax1 may be implicated in the long latency of HTLV-1 infection.",,"['Mizuguchi, Mariko', 'Sasaki, Yuka', 'Hara, Toshifumi', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Funato, Noriko', 'Tanaka, Nobuyuki', 'Fujii, Masahiro', 'Nakamura, Masataka']","['Mizuguchi M', 'Sasaki Y', 'Hara T', 'Higuchi M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Funato N', 'Tanaka N', 'Fujii M', 'Nakamura M']","['Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, Miyagi Cancer Center Research Institute, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.', 'Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Products, tax', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology/*virology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism']",PMC4734616,,2016/02/02 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2016/02/02 06:00'],"['2015/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0148217 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-45263 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Feb 1;11(2):e0148217. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0148217. eCollection 2016.,,,,20160201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on HTLV-1 have been instrumental for our understanding of the molecular pathology of virus-induced cancers. HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of an adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and can lead to a variety of neurological pathologies, including HTLV-1-associated-myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The ability to treat the aggressive ATL subtypes remains inadequate. HTLV-1 replicates by (1) an infectious cycle involving virus budding and infection of new permissive target cells and (2) mitotic division of cells harboring an integrated provirus. Virus replication initiates host antiviral immunity and the checkpoint control of cell proliferation, but HTLV-1 has evolved elegant strategies to counteract these host defense mechanisms to allow for virus persistence. The study of the molecular biology of HTLV-1 replication has provided crucial information for understanding HTLV-1 replication as well as aspects of viral replication that are shared between HTLV-1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).

METHODS: The antioxidant activities of two compounds were assessed by ABTS and DPPH radical-scavenging assays. Two compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562) cells using the MIT assay. The expression of NF-kappaB P65 mRNA in K562 apoptotic cells was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time quantitative PCR. In addition, protein expression levels of the NF-ICB P65, p-Akt, Fas, P-catenina and E-cadherin were also measured by Western blot. RESULTS: (1) We found that compound I displayed significant inoxidizability, while compound II had no obvious antioxidizability. (2) In cytotoxicity experiments, compound I didn't display cytotoxicity while compound H displayed obvious cytotoxicity. (3) Compared with the blank group, the expression of NF-kappaB P65 mRNA in K562 cell after treatment with compound II was obviously up-regulated.

Moreover, its use, being in principle a non-invasive technique, appears an interesting clinical tool for the evaluation of the therapeutical effects and of the disease progression. In this work we analyzed molecular changes in aged cultures of leukemia model U937 cells with respect to fresh cultures of the same cell line. In fact, structural variations of individual neoplastic cells on aging may lead to a heterogeneous data set, therefore falsifying confidence intervals, increasing error levels of analysis and consequently limiting the use of Raman spectroscopy analysis. We found that the observed morphological changes of U937 cells corresponded to well defined modifications of the Raman contributions in selected spectral regions, where markers of specific functional groups, useful to characterize the cell state, are present. A detailed subcellular analysis showed a change in cellular organization as a function of time, and correlated to a significant increase of apoptosis levels.

At this age, the frequency of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (almost all of B-lineage) is quite similar to the one of myeloblastic forms (AML). Infant leukemia frequently presents with high hyperleucocytosis, major tumoral burden and numerous extra-hematological features, especially in central nervous system and skin. Whatever the lineage, the leukemic cell is often very immature cytologically and immunologically. Rearrangements of the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene, located on band 11q23, are the hallmark of these immature leukemias and confer a particular resistance to conventional approaches, corticosteroids and chemotherapy. The immaturity of infants less than 1-year-old is associated to a decrease of the tolerable dose-intensity of some drugs (anthracyclines, alkylating agents) or asks questions about some procedures like radiotherapy or high dose conditioning regimen, responsible of inacceptable acute and late toxicities. The high level of severe infectious diseases and other high-grade side effects limits also the capacity to cure these infants. The survival of infants less than 1-year-old with AML is only 50% but similar to older children. On the other hand, survival of those with ALL is the same, then quite limited comparing the 80% survival in children over one year. Allogeneic stem cell transplantations are indicated in high-risk subgroups of infant ALL (age below 6 months, high hyperleucocytosis >300.10(9)/L, MLL-rearrangement, initial poor prednisone response). However, morbidity and mortality remain very important and these approaches cannot be extended to all cases. During the neonatal period, the dismal prognosis linked to the high number of primary failures or very early relapses and uncertainties about the late toxicities question physicians about ethics. It is an emergency to propose different strategies (targeted therapies) to these infants with acute leukemia as conventional trials failed to improve outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

Majority of patients affected are of Slavic origin and share the same founder mutation of 657del5 within the NBN gene encoding protein involved in DNA double-strand breaks repair. Clinically, this is characterized by a microcephaly, immunodeficiency and a high incidence of pediatric malignancies, mostly lymphomas and leukemias. Anticancer treatment among patients with NBS is challenging because of a high risk of life threatening therapy-related toxicity including severe infections, bone marrow failure, cardio- and nephrotoxicity and occurrence of secondary cancer. Based on systemic review of available literature and the Polish acute lymphoblastic leukemia database we concluded that among patients with NBS, these who suffered from clinically proven severe immunodeficiency are at risk of the complications associated with oncological treatment. Thus, in this group it reasonable to reduce chemotherapy up to 50% especially concerning anthracyclines methotrexate, alkylating agents and epipodophyllotoxines, bleomycin and radiotherapy should be omitted.

A problem with the CBMN assay is that all DNA damaging agents also inhibit the ability of cells to progress through mitosis, leading to a low number of binucleated cells (BNCs). One method to resolve this issue is to ensure a sufficient proportion of BNCs in the samples. In the current study, the applicability of a cell sorting system capable of isolating cell fractions containing abundant BNCs was investigated. Furthermore, to investigate the relationship between the cell division delay due to radiation exposure and the generation of BNCs and micronuclei (MN), we assessed a series of lag times between radiation exposure and addition of cytochalasin-B (Cyt-B). Cells from the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 were exposed to X-rays (2 Gy and 4 Gy), and Cyt-B was subsequently added at 0, 6 and 12 h following irradiation. After treatment with Cyt-B for 24 h, the percentage of BNCs, the MN frequency and the cell cycle distribution were analyzed. In addition, cells displaying the DNA contents corresponding to BNCs were isolated and analyzed. The results indicate that applying the cell sorter to the CBMN assay increased the percentage of BNCs compared with the standard method. Thus, this technique is a promising way of enhancing the capacity of the CBMN assay.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Lost DAPK expression due to (epi)genetic silencing is found in a broad spectrum of cancers. Within B-cell lymphomas, deficiency of the prototypic family member DAPK1 represents a predisposing or early tumorigenic lesion and high-frequency promoter methylation marks more aggressive diseases. On the basis of protein studies and meta-analyzed gene expression profiling data, we show here that within the low-level context of B-lymphocytic DAPK, particularly CLL cells have lost DAPK1 expression. To target this potential vulnerability, we conceptualized B-cell-specific cytotoxic reconstitution of the DAPK1 tumor suppressor in the format of an immunokinase. After rounds of selections for its most potent cytolytic moiety and optimal ligand part, a DK1KD-SGIII fusion protein containing a constitutive DAPK1 mutant, DK1KD, linked to the scFv SGIII against the B-cell-exclusive endocytic glyco-receptor CD22 was created. Its high purity and large-scale recombinant production provided a stable, selectively binding, and efficiently internalizing construct with preserved robust catalytic activity. DK1KD-SGIII specifically and efficiently killed CD22-positive cells of lymphoma lines and primary CLL samples, sparing healthy donor- or CLL patient-derived non-B cells. The mode of cell death was predominantly PARP-mediated and caspase-dependent conventional apoptosis as well as triggering of an autophagic program. The notoriously high apoptotic threshold of CLL could be overcome by DK1KD-SGIII in vitro also in cases with poor prognostic features, such as therapy resistance. The manufacturing feasibility of the novel CD22-targeting DAPK immunokinase and its selective antileukemic efficiency encourage intensified studies towards specific clinical application.

Here, we report the subgroup analysis of China Assessment of Antifungal Therapy in Haematological Disease (CAESAR) study to evaluate the risk of IFI in patients with AML in 1st remission receiving high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) as consolidation. A total of 638 patients with AML in 1st complete remission were selected from the database. Among them, 130 patients received HiDAC alone with total dose of 2-3 g/m(2) x 6 while 508 patients received multiple-agent combination chemotherapy (multiagent chemo group). The patients' characteristics were generally not different but more patients in HiDAC group had peripherally inserted central catheter (61.5% vs 44.5%, P = 0.002). The median duration of neutropenia was 8.0 days in both HiDAC (2-20) and multiagent chemo group (2-28). Number of patients with prolonged neutropenia (>14 days) tended to be more in multiagent chemo group but not significant different (16.3% vs 8.8%, respectively). There was no significant difference between 2 groups in persistent neutropenic fever (40.8% vs 33.1%), antifungal treatment (11.5% vs 11.4%), and incidence of proven/probable IFI (4 probable in HiDAC vs 1 proven/4 probable in multiagent chemo, P = 0.35) or possible IFI. As to the clinical outcome in terms of duration of hospitalization and death in remission, there was a trend of shorter duration of hospitalization in HiDAC (19 days, 3-70) compare to multiagent chemo group (21 days, 1-367, P = 0.057) while no death documented in HiDAC group and only 2 patients died in the multiagent chemo group (0.4%). As to risk factors associated with IFI in all 638 patients, there was a trend of more IFI in patients with severe neutropenia (3.0%, P = 0.089) and previous history of IFI (3.85%, P = 0.086) while the antifungal prophylaxis was not associated significantly reduced IFI.

A genetic fingerprint pattern of a specimen by short tandem repeats (STR) is self-evident. Due to high amount of chromosomal rearrangements, known in epithelia ovary cancer cells and the instable STR pattern described in other tumour entities like leukaemia, this study explores the suitability of STR profiling for primary cultured epithelial ovary cancer cells. METHODS: STR profiles of epithelial ovary cancers of 16 patients were compared with corresponding blood and corresponding primary cell cultures. The primary cell cultures of epithelial ovary tumours were passaged up to 28 times. In between, cultures were cryo conserved and recultured again, two to five times per patient. RESULTS: In two cases, the STR pattern of tumour lost alleles (1/16 and 3/16) in comparison of corresponding STR-pattern from blood. In comparison to blood, cell culture of a third case, lost four alleles (4/16) accompanied with morphologic changes after 14th passage. It is equal after cryo conservation of the seventh passage from the same patient. The only changes in STR profiles we recognized are losses of alleles. Remaining STR markers allow authentication. CONCLUSIONS: Very likely, the allelic drop-outs beyond passage 14 assume complex genetic losses of heterozygosis resulting in changed growth behaviour of cells. All other STR-profiles of remaining 15 patients analysed in this study are stable over all passages and freeze-thaw processes. Thus, ovary cancer cell cultures in research should be authenticated by STR-profile in general.",,"['Huang, Xiufeng', 'Weimer, Jorg', 'von Wurmb-Schwark, Nicole', 'Fredrik, Regina', 'Arnold, Norbert', 'Schem, Christian']","['Huang X', 'Weimer J', 'von Wurmb-Schwark N', 'Fredrik R', 'Arnold N', 'Schem C']","[""School of Medicine, Women's Hospital, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, China."", 'Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3 (Haus 24), 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3 (Haus 24), 24105, Kiel, Germany. jweimer@email.uni-kiel.de.', 'Institute of Legal Medicine, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3 (Haus 28), 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3 (Haus 24), 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3 (Haus 24), 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3 (Haus 24), 24105, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Gynecol Obstet,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,8710213,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Papillary/genetics/pathology', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Carcinoma, Endometrioid/genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/genetics/pathology', '*Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Fingerprinting/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/genetics/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']",,,2016/01/31 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2016/01/31 06:00'],"['2015/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00404-016-4018-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00404-016-4018-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2016 Aug;294(2):369-76. doi: 10.1007/s00404-016-4018-9.

We found that in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), HIF-1alpha is a novel regulator of the interaction of CLL cells with protective leukemia microenvironments and, in turn, is regulated by this interaction in a positive feedback loop that promotes leukemia survival and propagation. Through unbiased microarray analysis, we found that in CLL cells, HIF-1alpha regulates the expression of important chemokine receptors and cell adhesion molecules that control the interaction of leukemic cells with bone marrow and spleen microenvironments. Inactivation of HIF-1alpha impairs chemotaxis and cell adhesion to stroma, reduces bone marrow and spleen colonization in xenograft and allograft CLL mouse models, and prolongs survival in mice. Of interest, we found that in CLL cells, HIF-1alpha is transcriptionally regulated after coculture with stromal cells. Furthermore, HIF-1alpha messenger RNA levels vary significantly within CLL patients and correlate with the expression of HIF-1alpha target genes, including CXCR4, thus further emphasizing the relevance of HIF-1alpha expression to CLL pathogenesis.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Valsecchi, Roberta', 'Coltella, Nadia', 'Belloni, Daniela', 'Ponente, Manfredi', 'Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa Sabrina', 'Brambilla, Paola', 'Lenti, Elisa', 'Martinelli Boneschi, Filippo', 'Brendolan, Andrea', 'Ferrero, Elisabetta', 'Ferrarini, Marina', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Tonon, Giovanni', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Bernardi, Rosa']","['Valsecchi R', 'Coltella N', 'Belloni D', 'Ponente M', 'Ten Hacken E', 'Scielzo C', 'Scarfo L', 'Bertilaccio MT', 'Brambilla P', 'Lenti E', 'Martinelli Boneschi F', 'Brendolan A', 'Ferrero E', 'Ferrarini M', 'Ghia P', 'Tonon G', 'Ponzoni M', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Bernardi R']","['Division of Experimental Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy;

Patients treated in chronic phase can enjoy an expected survival similar to the general population. In the last few years we have found that some patients with an excellent therapeutic response can have their TKI discontinued and still remain in molecular remission. RECENT FINDINGS: The fact that some patients can apparently have their therapy discontinued, and stay in remission for more than 2 years, is surprising, as in-vitro work suggests the CML cell is dependent on BCR-ABL signaling and mathematical models predict that extinction of the CML stem cell reservoir will take decades of therapy. However, given that unopposed BCR-ABL causes progression and CML cells can have a rather long latency (e.g., Hiroshima survivors), it may be some time until we can be completely assured that discontinuation is without risk. SUMMARY: If we can safely discontinue TKI in some patients, it will have a profound effect on both the strategy and medical economics of CML therapy. A key future finding will be factor(s) that predict which patients can be discontinued without relapse, thus targeting only the patients where discontinuation will be successful.",,"['Bansal, Aasthaa', 'Radich, Jerald']","['Bansal A', 'Radich J']","['aPharmaceutical Outcomes Research and Policy Program, University of Washington bPublic Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cClinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/01/31 06:00,2016/11/05 06:00,['2016/01/31 06:00'],"['2016/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000224 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Mar;23(2):115-20. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000224.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although current therapeutic strategies provide a reasonable likelihood of achieving a complete remission for the majority of patients, relapse rates and subsequent disease-related mortality remain unacceptably high. Improved methods of risk stratification are needed to better identify patients at considerable risk of relapse in hopes of allowing for early therapeutic intervention and/or intensification that may lead to a higher likelihood of cure. The current status of risk stratification of AML and emerging technologies with potential to improve prognostic classification and outcomes are summarized in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Refinement of our understanding of the impact of current pretreatment AML cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and molecular aberrations to predict outcomes and guide therapeutic decision-making is ongoing. Emerging data suggest that incorporation of the degree of posttreatment response and/or the detection of minimal residual disease can improve the accuracy of risk stratification for individual patients.

The purpose of this review is to outline current evidence for evaluation and management of high-risk APL and discuss areas of ongoing and future investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: With the changing treatment paradigm in APL and increasing use of arsenic trioxide (ATO), reports have questioned the relevance of classic prognostic factors. Despite advancements in therapy, early death remains a primary reason for treatment failure. A randomized, phase III trial demonstrated that all-trans retinoic acid + ATO is at least noninferior and may be superior to all-trans retinoic acid + chemotherapy in low/intermediate-risk APL. One phase III and multiple phase II trials have suggested a benefit of adding ATO to therapy of high-risk patients.

Major prognostic factors for disease outcome are the genetic alterations of AML, patient's age, and performance status. AML is more common in older adults, with a median age of 72 years. However, in this age group the unfavorable cytogenetics dominates at a time when biologically it may be most difficult to administer optimal intensive therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) enables the administration of high-dose therapy supported by stem cell infusion with a treatment-related toxicity not significantly higher than that associated with chemotherapy and significantly lower than in allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The dilemma of best postremission therapy has not been resolved because of the paucity of randomized controlled studies, especially in various cytogenetic risk and age groups. Instead, the use of genetic randomization by donor availability, analysis of outcome based on intention-to-treat, and mixed populations in the registry data produce variable results. SUMMARY: ASCT has been associated with prolonged disease-free survival as compared to chemotherapy, especially in the favorable and intermediate risk groups.

Here we examine the data for predicting which patients are candidates for 'curative therapy', available therapeutic options, and the utilization of reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission. RECENT FINDINGS: Incorporation of geriatric assessment tools to assess patient frailty, in addition to evaluation of comorbid conditions, improves patient selection for intense therapy. The majority of patients eligible for and treated with induction chemotherapy achieve complete remission, and overall survival in the older AML population is superior after allogeneic stem cell transplant. However, population-based studies continue to demonstrate the undertreatment or lack of treatment of older AML patients. SUMMARY: New patient assessment tools, ability to offer more successful outcomes after induction chemotherapy, and improved survival after allogeneic transplantation has not yet translated to increased 'curative' treatment on a population level of older AML patients. It is critical that the tools and therapies available be put into practice while older patient enrollment in well designed therapeutic clinical trials which include the option of allogeneic transplantation is increased.",,"['Finn, Laura E', 'Foran, James M']","['Finn LE', 'Foran JM']","['aDivision of Hematology and Medical Oncology bMayo Clinic Cancer Center, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/01/31 06:00,2016/11/05 06:00,['2016/01/31 06:00'],"['2016/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000220 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Mar;23(2):95-101. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000220.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proper and early diagnosis of thromboembolism is of paramount importance to reduce mortality and morbidity. We evaluated antithrombin III (ATIII), protein C, protein S, and D-dimer in 60 children with ALL compared with 30 healthy controls, and patients were followed up for 12 months for detection of thrombotic complications. The relation between these natural anticoagulants and the development of thrombotic complications, as well as therapy was assessed to identify patients at risk of thromboembolism. ATIII, protein C, and protein S were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) with elevated D-dimer (P < 0.001) in patients with ALL compared with those in the control group. The incidence of thrombotic complications was 16.7%. Patients with thrombotic complications had significantly lower ATIII, protein C, protein S, and platelet count, whereas age, total leukocyte count, and D-dimer were increased compared with those without thrombosis (P < 0.05). Patients under chemotherapy had lower ATIII, protein C, and protein S levels with higher D-dimer compared with the newly diagnosed untreated patients (P < 0.05). ATIII and protein C were positively correlated (r = 0.573, P = 0.002), whereas both were negatively correlated with D-dimer (P < 0.001). ALL is associated with a state of hypercoagulability, which may be attributed to hemostatic derangement because of increased thrombin generation indicated by elevated D-dimer in association with decreased natural anticoagulants ATIII, protein C, and protein S.

In this study, the authors describe a 44-year-old obese woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia in molecular remission on dasatinib therapy, who presented with a painful urticarial eruption limited to lipo-lymphedematous skin and accompanied by malaise, episodic fever, diarrhea, neutrophilia, and leukocytosis. Initially transient and migratory, the rash became fixed, papular, and vesicular and showed minimal response to corticosteroids. Biopsy demonstrated sparse perivascular and interstitial dermal neutrophilic infiltrates, without vasculitis or significant dermal edema. Aggregates of neutrophils were found within and surrounding lymphangiectases. Biopsy of a new onset papule 3 weeks later demonstrated papillary dermal edema, denser neutrophilic infiltrate, and vasculitis-like changes. These 2 histopathologic patterns of ND, early and late, resemble neutrophilic urticarial dermatitis (also known as neutrophilic dermatitis with systemic inflammation) and Sweet syndrome, respectively. Extensive workup did not reveal evidence of relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia, infection, or a coexisting systemic inflammatory disease. Dasatinib was discontinued and the eruption gradually resolved over 2.5 months. Still in molecular remission (no detectable BCR-ABL gene fusion), dasatinib therapy was recommenced at 3-month follow-up.

We also detected significantly higher BMI, waist, fat mass, p-insulin, Homa-Index, leptin/kg fat mass and s-ghrelin and significantly lower fat free mass specifically among female ALL survivors (all P<0.01). Interestingly, s-ghrelin levels increased with time since diagnosis and with low age at diagnosis for childhood ALL. Our results showed that leptin/kg fat mass and fat mass were associated with a reduced HT volume 34 years after ALL diagnosis and that women treated with CRT after ALL are at high risk of metabolic abnormalities. Taken together our data suggest that the hypothalamus is involved in the metabolic consequences after CRT in ALL survivors.",,"['Follin, Cecilia', 'Gabery, Sanaz', 'Petersen, Asa', 'Sundgren, Pia C', 'Bjorkman-Burtcher, Isabella', 'Latt, Jimmy', 'Mannfolk, Peter', 'Erfurth, Eva Marie']","['Follin C', 'Gabery S', 'Petersen A', 'Sundgren PC', 'Bjorkman-Burtcher I', 'Latt J', 'Mannfolk P', 'Erfurth EM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Skane University hospital and IKVL, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Translational Neuroendocrine Research Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Skane University Hospital and IKVL/Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Skane University Hospital and IKVL/Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund University Bioimaging Centre (LBIC), Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Skane University Hospital and IKVL/Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Skane University Hospital and IKVL/Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Skane University hospital and IKVL, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Ghrelin)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Leptin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Ghrelin/blood', 'Growth Hormone/therapeutic use', '*Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Insulin/blood', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Leptin/blood', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Risk', '*Survivors']",PMC4732818,,2016/01/30 06:00,2016/07/07 06:00,['2016/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0147575 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-44432 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jan 29;11(1):e0147575. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0147575. eCollection 2016.,,,,20160129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MITF expression was shown to be antagonized by the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB. Parthenolide, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, has not been yet reported to affect MITF-M expression. Our results obtained in patient-derived melanoma cell populations indicate that parthenolide efficiently decreases the MITF-M level. This is neither dependent on p65/NF-kappaB signaling nor RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activity as inhibition of MEK by GSK1120212 (trametinib) and induction of ERK1/2 activity by parthenolide itself do not interfere with parthenolide-triggered depletion of MITF-M in both wild-type BRAF and BRAF(V600E) melanoma populations. Parthenolide activity is not prevented by inhibitors of caspases, proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. As parthenolide reduces MITF-M transcript level and HDAC1 protein level, parthenolide-activated depletion of MITF-M protein may be considered as a result of transcriptional regulation, however, the influence of parthenolide on other elements of a dynamic control over MITF-M cannot be ruled out. Parthenolide induces diverse effects in melanoma cells, from death to senescence. The mode of the response to parthenolide is bound to the molecular characteristics of melanoma cells, particularly to the basal MITF-M expression level but other cell-autonomous differences such as NF-kappaB activity and MCL-1 level might also contribute. Our data suggest that parthenolide can be developed as a drug used in combination therapy against melanoma when simultaneous inhibition of MITF-M, NF-kappaB and HDAC1 is needed.",,"['Hartman, Mariusz L', 'Talar, Beata', 'Sztiller-Sikorska, Malgorzata', 'Nejc, Dariusz', 'Czyz, Malgorzata']","['Hartman ML', 'Talar B', 'Sztiller-Sikorska M', 'Nejc D', 'Czyz M']","['Department of Molecular Biology of Cancer, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biology of Cancer, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biology of Cancer, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biology of Cancer, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', '33E86K87QN (trametinib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'Pyridones/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4891023,,2016/01/30 06:00,2016/12/31 06:00,['2016/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['7030 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.7030 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Feb 23;7(8):9026-40. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.7030.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MITF', 'NF-kappaB', 'cellular senescence', 'melanoma', 'parthenolide']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signs and symptoms of childhood cancer are difficult to recognize, as it is not the first diagnosis to be considered for nonspecific complaints, leading to potential uncertainty in diagnosis. The aim of this study was to perform proteomic analysis of serum from pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) to identify candidate biomarker proteins, for use in early diagnosis and evaluation of treatment. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from ten patients at the time of diagnosis (B-ALL group) and after induction therapy (AIT group). Sera from healthy children were used as controls (Control group). The samples were subjected to immunodepletion, affinity chromatography with alpha-d-galactose-binding lectin (from Artocarpus incisa seeds) immobilized on a Sepharose(TM) 4B gel, concentration, and digestion for subsequent analysis with nano-UPLC tandem nano-ESI-MS(E). The program Expression (E) was used to quantify differences in protein expression between groups. RESULTS: A total of 96 proteins were identified. Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1), Clusterin (CLU), thrombin (F2), heparin cofactor II (SERPIND1), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), alpha-2-antiplasmin (SERPINF2), Alpha-1 antitrypsin (SERPINA1), Complement factor B (CFB) and Complement C3 (C3) were identified as candidate biomarkers for early diagnosis of B-ALL, as they were upregulated in the B-ALL group relative to the control and AIT groups. Expression levels of the candidate biomarkers did not differ significantly between the AIT and control groups, providing further evidence that the candidate biomarkers are present only in the disease state, as all patients achieved complete remission after treatment. CONCLUSION: A panel of protein biomarker candidates has been developed for pre-diagnosis of B-ALL and also provided information that would indicate a favorable response to treatment after induction therapy.",,"['Cavalcante, Marcio de Souza', 'Torres-Romero, Jose Camilo', 'Lobo, Marina Duarte Pinto', 'Moreno, Frederico Bruno Mendes Batista', 'Bezerra, Leonardo Primo', 'Lima, Diego Silva', 'Matos, Jesamar Correia', 'Moreira, Renato de Azevedo', 'Monteiro-Moreira, Ana Cristina de Oliveira']","['Cavalcante Mde S', 'Torres-Romero JC', 'Lobo MD', 'Moreno FB', 'Bezerra LP', 'Lima DS', 'Matos JC', 'Moreira Rde A', 'Monteiro-Moreira AC']","['Northeast Network of Biotechnology (RENORBIO), State University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil.', 'Center of Experimental Biology (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil ; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil.', 'Center of Experimental Biology (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil ; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil.', 'Center of Experimental Biology (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil.', 'Center of Experimental Biology (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil.', 'Development and Technological Innovation in Drug Program, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil.', ""Reference Center at Children's Cancer Diagnosis and Adolescents Dr. Murilo Martins, Albert Sabin Hospital, Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil."", 'Center of Experimental Biology (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil.', 'Center of Experimental Biology (NUBEX), University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), Fortaleza, Ceara Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC4730630,,2016/01/30 06:00,2016/01/30 06:01,['2016/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-016-0055-6 [doi]', '55 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2016 Jan 27;4:1. doi: 10.1186/s40364-016-0055-6. eCollection 2016.,,,,20160127,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Biomarker', 'Frutalin', 'Lectin', 'Mass spectrometry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the expression pattern of miR-370 and its clinical implications in pediatric AML patients. METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the expression of miR-370 in both bone marrow mononuclear cells and sera obtained from pediatric AML patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, the expression levels of miR-370 in the bone marrow and sera of pediatric AML patients were both decreased significantly (both P=0.001). Importantly, serum miR-370 level could efficiently screen pediatric AML patients from healthy controls (Area under receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC =0.993). Then, low serum miR-370 level was significantly associated with French-American-British (FAB) classification subtype M7 subtype (P=0.02) and unfavorable karyotype (P=0.01). Moreover, pediatric AML patients with low serum miR-370 level had shorter relapse-free and overall survivals than those with high serum miR-370 level (both P=0.001). Multivariate analysis further identified serum miR-370 level as an independent prognostic factor for both relapse-free and overall survivals. Interestingly, the prognostic relevance of serum miR-370 level was more obvious in the subgroup of patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-370 expression may be markedly and consistently decreased in pediatric AML patients and in turn contributes to aggressive progression of this malignancy. Serum miR-370 may serve as a potential non-invasive diagnostic/prognostic marker for pediatric AML patients.",,"['Lin, Xiaofei', 'Wang, Zhengyan', 'Wang, Yumei', 'Feng, Weijing']","['Lin X', 'Wang Z', 'Wang Y', 'Feng W']","[""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Units, Huai'an Maternity and Child Health Hospital of Yangzhou University Huai'an 223002, Jiangsu Province, P.R.

In the present study, we tested a hypothesis that the PRAME gene plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis and proliferation of leukemia cells. We observed that KG-1 cells transient overexpressing the PRAME gene (when transfected with pcDNA3.1-PRAME plasmid) significantly induces apoptosis and decreases proliferation in vitro, and repression of PRAME expression by a short interfering RNA exhibited a increased proliferation in K562 cells in vitro and increases tumorigenicity of K562 leukemic cells in nude mice.

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) were prepared from six patients with CML and three healthy individuals. The mRNA levels of MCM8 were determined and compared. The expression of MCM8 was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach in human CML cell line K562. After transfection with MCM8 siRNA, cell viability and apoptotic rate were analyzed, as well as the protein expression levels of Caspase-3 and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-xL. RESULTS: Relative mRNA levels of MCM8 were both significantly higher in PBMC and BMMC from CML patients than those in healthy individuals (P < 0.05). The cell viability was significantly reduced while the apoptotic rate was statistically increased by knockdown of MCM8 compared to control group or the scramble siRNA group (both P < 0.05). Moreover, the protein expression levels of Caspase-3 were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and while the levels of Bcl-xL were statistically reduced (P < 0.05) compared to the control group or the scramble siRNA group.

In addition, CCR2a and CCR2b receptors have been shown to couple to Gq family members, triggering the canonical activation of phospholipase Cbeta isoenzymes. Activation of pertussis toxin-insensitive Gq proteins by cell-surface receptors is not only coupled to activation of phospholipase isoenzymes but also to Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which in turn mediate activation of the Rho GTPases. Activated Rho GTPases regulate numerous cellular functions, including the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and gene transcription, such as the transcription factor serum response factor. These findings prompted us to investigate whether CCR2a and/or CCR2b stimulate serum response factor activity. The results presented herein demonstrate that stimulation of human CCR2a- or CCR2b-expressing COS-7 cells caused a vigorous induction of serum response factor activity. This effect was specifically mediated by Gq and/or G14, as well as Rho A and/or a closely related Rho GTPase. Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of CCR2a and CCR2b and Galphaq was sensitive to coexpression of the Galphaq-interacting leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The findings of the work indicate a role for Galphaq and/or Galpha14 and in CCR2a/CCR2b-stimulated Rho A GTPase-mediated serum response factor activation and introduce a noncanonical pathway activated by CCR2 receptors by coupling to Gq proteins.",['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Vatter, Petra', 'Schuhholz, Julia', 'Koenig, Carolin', 'Pfreimer, Mariana', 'Moepps, Barbara']","['Vatter P', 'Schuhholz J', 'Koenig C', 'Pfreimer M', 'Moepps B']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University, Medical Center, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University, Medical Center, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University, Medical Center, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University, Medical Center, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University, Medical Center, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, Ulm, Germany barbara.moepps@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, CCR2)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL2/pharmacology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR2/*metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins']",,,2016/01/30 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.2MA0815-386R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.2MA0815-386R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2016 Jun;99(6):979-91. doi: 10.1189/jlb.2MA0815-386R.

The crude incidence was 129.0 per million and the age standardized rate (ASR) was 129.6 per million. The ASR was higher in boys (142.1 per million) than in girls (116.4 per million). The boy to girl ratio was 1.2(95%CI: 1.0-1.5). The incidence was highest in age group <5 years (165.1 per million). The incidences in age groups 5-9 years and 10-14 years were 101.2 per million and 113.9 per million, respectively. Leukemia was the most common cancer in children (n=165, 35.9%, ASR: 47.0 per million), followed by central nervous system tumors (n=91, 19.8%, ASR: 25.6 per million) and lymphomas (n=45, 9.8%, ASR: 12.6 per million). The age and gender specific incidence of malignant tumors and the type specific incidence of malignant tumors in children in Shanghai had no significant changes during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of malignant tumors was higher in boys than in girls in Shanghai. Leukemia, central nervous system tumors and lymphomas were the three most common cancers in children. The overall incidence of malignant tumors in children in Shanghai had no significant changes during 2002-2011.",,"['Bao, Pingping', 'Wu, Chunxiao', 'Gu, Kai', 'Gong, Yangming', 'Peng, Peng', 'Huang, Zhezhou', 'Zhang, Minlu', 'Zheng, Ying', 'Zhong, Weijian']","['Bao P', 'Wu C', 'Gu K', 'Gong Y', 'Peng P', 'Huang Z', 'Zhang M', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhong W']","['Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai 200336, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,8208604,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology']",,,2016/01/30 06:00,2016/06/11 06:00,['2016/01/30 06:00'],"['2016/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2016.01.023 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Jan;37(1):106-10. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2016.01.023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we examined the effects of these agents on proliferation and adhesion of various cancer cells. Rol exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of the proliferation of human refractory and prostate cancer cells, while RA and RP showed little or no effect. In contrast, RA inhibited the growth of human breast cancer cells to a greater extent than Rol at low concentrations, but not at high concentrations. Rol suppressed adhesion of refractory and prostate cancer cells to a greater extent than RA, while it suppressed adhesion of breast cancer cells as well as RA and of JHP-1 cells less effectively than RA. These results indicate that Rol is a potent suppressor of cancer cell growth and adhesion, which are both linked to metastasis and tumor progression.

Due to their multimodal effect on perturbation of cellular oxidative state, these compounds hold great potential as therapeutic agents against highly proliferative neoplastic cells. In our previous work, we developed a series of novel dimeric naphthoquinones and showed that they were selectively cytotoxic to human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast and prostate cancer cell lines. We subsequently identified the oxidoreductase NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (NQO1) as the major target of dimeric naphthoquinones and proposed a mechanism of action that entailed induction of a futile redox cycling. RESULTS: Here, for the first time, we describe a direct physical interaction between the bromohydroxy dimeric naphthoquinone E6a and NQO1. Moreover, our studies reveal an extensive binding interface between E6a and the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor of NQO1 in addition to interactions with protein side chains in the active site. We also present biochemical evidence that dimeric naphthoquinones affect the redox state of the FAD cofactor of NQO1. Comparison of the mode of binding of E6a with those of other chemotherapeutics reveals unique characteristics of the interaction that can be leveraged in future drug optimization efforts. CONCLUSION: The first structure of a dimeric naphthoquinone-NQO1 complex was reported, which can be used for design and synthesis of more potent next generation dimeric naphthoquinones to target NQO1 with higher affinity and specificity.",,"['Pidugu, Lakshmi Swarna Mukhi', 'Mbimba, J C Emmanuel', 'Ahmad, Muqeet', 'Pozharski, Edwin', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Emadi, Ashkan', 'Toth, Eric A']","['Pidugu LS', 'Mbimba JC', 'Ahmad M', 'Pozharski E', 'Sausville EA', 'Emadi A', 'Toth EA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.

In chronic myeloid leukemia targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors demonstrates high efficacy in most of the patients. However about 15 % of patients demonstrate primary resistance to standard therapy. Whole exome sequencing is a good tool for unbiased search of genetic variations important for prognosis of survival and therapy efficacy in many cancers. We apply this approach to CML patients with optimal response and failure of tyrosine kinase therapy. RESULTS: We analyzed exome variations between optimal responders and failures and found 7 variants in cancer-related genes with different genotypes in two groups of patients. Five of them were found in optimal responders: rs11579366, rs1990236, rs176037, rs10653661, rs3803264 and two in failures: rs3099950, rs9471966. These variants were found in genes associated with cancers (ANKRD35, DNAH9, MAGEC1, TOX3) or participating in cancer-related signaling pathways (THSD1, MORN2, PTCRA).

Unfortunately, unless combined with a bone marrow transplant, disease relapse is frequent. In addition to the acquired point mutations in the FLT3 kinase domain that contribute to FLT3 inhibitor resistance, MEK/ERK signaling is persistently activated in AML cells even when FLT3 phosphorylation is continually suppressed. Thus, concomitant targeting of FLT3 and MAPK may potentially exert synergistic activity to counteract the resistance of AML cells to FLT3-targeted therapy. In this study, we investigated the antileukemia activity of a MEK1 and FLT3 dual inhibitor, E6201, in AML cells resistant to FLT3 inhibition. We found that E6201 exerted profound apoptogenic effects on AML cells harboring resistance-conferring FLT3 mutations.

Here we report a novel exonic mutation in the IL10RA gene that caused unique splicing aberrations in a Japanese patient with infantile-onset of inflammatory bowel disease in association with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and a transient clinical syndrome mimicking juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A Japanese boy, who was the first child of non-consanguineous healthy parents, developed bloody diarrhea, perianal fistula, and folliculitis in early infancy and was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. He also developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura and transient features mimicking juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The patient failed to respond to various treatments, including elemental diet, salazosulfapyridine, metronidazole, corticosteroid, infliximab, and adalimumab. We identified a novel mutation (c.537G > A, p.T179T) in exon 4 of the IL10RA gene causing unique splicing aberrations and resulting in lack of signaling through the interleukin-10 receptor. At 21 months of age, the patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and achieved clinical remission. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel exonic mutation in the IL10RA gene resulting in infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease. This mutation might also be involved in his early-onset hematologic disorders. Physicians should be familiar with the clinical phenotype of IL-10 signaling defects in order to enable prompt diagnosis at an early age and referral for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",,"['Yanagi, Tadahiro', 'Mizuochi, Tatsuki', 'Takaki, Yugo', 'Eda, Keisuke', 'Mitsuyama, Keiichi', 'Ishimura, Masataka', 'Takada, Hidetoshi', 'Shouval, Dror S', 'Griffith, Alexandra E', 'Snapper, Scott B', 'Yamashita, Yushiro', 'Yamamoto, Ken']","['Yanagi T', 'Mizuochi T', 'Takaki Y', 'Eda K', 'Mitsuyama K', 'Ishimura M', 'Takada H', 'Shouval DS', 'Griffith AE', 'Snapper SB', 'Yamashita Y', 'Yamamoto K']","['Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, 67 Asahi-machi, Kurume, 830-0011, Japan. yanagi_tadahiro@med.kurume-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, 67 Asahi-machi, Kurume, 830-0011, Japan. mizuochi_tatsuki@kurume-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, 67 Asahi-machi, Kurume, 830-0011, Japan. takaki_yuugo@med.kurume-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, 67 Asahi-machi, Kurume, 830-0011, Japan. eda_keisuke@med.kurume-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Gastroenterology Department of Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan. ibd@med.kurume-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. ischii@pediatr.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. takadah@pediatr.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp.', ""Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. dror.shouval@childrens.harvard.edu."", ""Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. dror.shouval@childrens.harvard.edu."", ""Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. alexandra.griffith@childrens.harvard.edu."", ""Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. scott.snapper@childrens.harvard.edu."", ""Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. scott.snapper@childrens.harvard.edu."", ""Division of Gastroenterology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. scott.snapper@childrens.harvard.edu."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, 67 Asahi-machi, Kurume, 830-0011, Japan. yushiro@med.kurume-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan. yamamoto_ken@med.kurume-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['P30 DK034854/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Gastroenterol,BMC gastroenterology,100968547,"['0 (IL10 protein, human)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['*Exons', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*genetics/surgery', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*RNA Splicing', 'Remission Induction/methods']",PMC4730728,,2016/01/30 06:00,2016/10/12 06:00,['2016/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12876-016-0424-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12876-016-0424-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Gastroenterol. 2016 Jan 28;16:10. doi: 10.1186/s12876-016-0424-5.,,,,20160128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are markers of cancer and induce chromosomal instability, leading to the formation of other chromosomal aberrations and the clonal evolution of pathological cells. Our knowledge of the roles and behavior of human DCs is often derived from studies of induced DCs and cell lines. It is difficult to identify all the DCs in the karyotypes of patients because of the limitations of metaphase cytogenetic methods. The aim of this study was to revise the karyotypes of 20 AML patients in whom DCs were found with conventional G-banding or multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) with (multi)centromeric probes and to characterize the DCs at the molecular cytogenetic level. FISH analyses confirmed 23 of the 29 expected DCs in 18 of 20 patients and identified 13 others that had not been detected cytogenetically. Fourteen DCs were altered by other chromosomal changes. In conclusion, karyotypes with DCs are usually very complex, and we have shown that they often contain more than one DC, which can be missed with conventional or mFISH methods. Our study indicates an association between number of DCs in karyotype and very short survival of patients.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

OS and EFS rates after allo-HSCT were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The main predictor of recurrence and survival in patients after allo-HSCT was a recurrence-risk group the patient belonged to before transplantation. The standard-risk group patients whose donors had telomeric gene-content motifs of KIR-B haplotypes had higher EFS rates than those whose donors lacked these genes. The standard-risk patients homozygous for HLA-1 alleles (i.e. without HLA-C2 ligand) tended to have higher EFS rates, so did the patients without HLA-Bw4 ligand.

In spite of its relatively indolent nature, no radical cure is as yet available. CLL is not associated with either a unique cytogenetic or a molecular defect, which might have been a potential therapeutic target. Instead, several factors are involved in disease development, such as environmental signals which interact with genetic abnormalities to promote survival, proliferation and an immune surveillance escape. Among these, PI3-Kinase signal pathway alterations are nowadays considered to be clearly important. The TCL1 gene, an AKT co-activator, is the cause of a mature T-cell leukemia, as well as being highly expressed in all B-CLL. A TCL1 transgenic mouse which reproduces leukemia with a distinct immunophenotype and similar to the course of the human B-CLL was developed several years ago and is widely used by many groups.

Over 50% of human T-ALLs possess activating mutations of Notch1. The clerodane diterpene casearin J (CJ) is a natural product that inhibits the sarcoendoplasmatic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump and induces cell death in leukemia cells, but the molecular mechanism of cytotoxicity remains poorly understood. Here we show that owing to SERCA pump inhibition, CJ induces depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pools, oxidative stress, and apoptosis via the intrinsic signaling pathway. Moreover, Notch1 signaling is reduced in T-ALL cells with auto-activating mutations in the HD-domain of Notch1, but not in cells that do not depend on Notch1 signaling. CJ also provoked a slight activation of NF-kappaB, and consistent with this notion a combined treatment of CJ and the NF-kappaB inhibitor parthenolide (Pt) led to a remarkable synergistic cell death in T-ALL cells. Altogether, our data support the concept that inhibition of the SERCA pump may be a novel strategy for the treatment of T-ALL with HD-domain-mutant Notch1 receptors and that additional treatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitor parthenolide may have further therapeutic benefits.",,"['De Ford, C', 'Heidersdorf, B', 'Haun, F', 'Murillo, R', 'Friedrich, T', 'Borner, C', 'Merfort, I']","['De Ford C', 'Heidersdorf B', 'Haun F', 'Murillo R', 'Friedrich T', 'Borner C', 'Merfort I']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Biotechnology, Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM), Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM), Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research, Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Escuela de Quimica and CIPRONA, Universidad de Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica.', 'Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM), Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institut fur Biochemie, Albert Ludwigs University, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM), Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research, Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Centre for Biological Signaling Studies (BIOSS), Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Biotechnology, Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM), Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Diterpenes, Clerodane)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes, Clerodane/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitochondria, Heart/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC4816186,,2016/01/29 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/01/29 06:00'],"['2015/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2015413 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.413 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Jan 28;7:e2070. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.413.,,,,20160128,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0813-7883'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that the eEF2 gene was overexpressed and plays an oncogenic role in various types of cancers and that eEF2 gene product elicited both humoral immune responses to produce eEF2-specific IgG autoantibody in cancer-bearing individuals and cellular immune responses to induce eEF2 peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vitro. The purpose of the present study was to induce eEF2-specific, antitumor CTL responses in vivo by vaccination with MHC class I-binding eEF2-derived peptide. First, two mouse MHC class I-restricted eEF2derived, 9-mer peptides, EF17 (17-25 aa, ANIRNMSVI) and EF180 (180-188 aa, RIVENVNVI) were identified as eEF2-specific CTL peptides, and mice were vaccinated intradermally eight times with either EF17 or EF180 peptide emulsified with Montanide ISA51 adjuvant. Cytotoxicity assay showed that eEF2-specific CTLs were induced in both EF17and EF180vaccinated mice, and histological study showed no detectable damage in the organs of these mice. Next, to examine in vivo antitumor effects of eEF2 peptide vaccination in a therapeutic model, mice were vaccinated four times with one each of the two eEF2 peptides at weekly intervals after implantation of eEF2-expressing leukemia cells. The vaccination with eEF2 peptides induced eEF2-specific CTLs and suppressed tumor growth, and disease-free survival was significantly longer in EF180-vaccinated mice compared to control mice. The survival was associated with the robustness of eEF2-specific CTL induction. These results indicate that vaccination with MHC class I-binding eEF2 peptide induced eEF2-targeting, antitumor CTL responses in vivo without damage to normal organs, which provided us a rationale for eEF2 peptide-based cancer immunotherapy.",,"['Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Murakami, Yui', 'Morii, Eiichi', 'Akao, Toshiki', 'Tatsumi, Naoya', 'Odajima, Satoko', 'Fukuda, Mari', 'Machitani, Takao', 'Iwai, Miki', 'Kawata, Sayo', 'Hojo, Nozomi', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruo', 'Oji, Yusuke']","['Nakajima H', 'Murakami Y', 'Morii E', 'Akao T', 'Tatsumi N', 'Odajima S', 'Fukuda M', 'Machitani T', 'Iwai M', 'Kawata S', 'Hojo N', 'Oka Y', 'Sugiyama H', 'Oji Y']","['Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Sciences, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Sciences, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Sciences, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Sciences, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Sciences, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Sciences, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Sciences, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Sciences, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 2)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunologic Factors/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 2/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/*administration & dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/01/29 06:00,2016/12/27 06:00,['2016/01/29 06:00'],"['2015/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2016.4589 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2016 Apr;35(4):1959-66. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.4589.

The involvement of the respiratory or central nervous system and the metabolic derangements accompanying tumor lysis are responsible for early mortality. Standard care for acute hyperleukocytosis must include cytoreduction, proper supportive care, and prevention of tumor lysis. Hydration, alkalization, allopurinol, or urate oxidase should be started immediately. In patients with low platelet count of less than 20,000/mm(3), platelet transfusions should be given to prevent cerebral hemorrhage, as platelets do not add substantially to blood viscosity. Packed red blood cells must be given with caution as they can significantly increase blood viscosity. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, packed red transfusions should be planned when the hemoglobin level is less than 7-8 g/dl, avoiding post-transfusional levels above 10 g/dl. Coagulation abnormalities should be corrected. Leukapheresis has been advocated to correct metabolic abnormalities and to decrease viscosity by reducing the peripheral white blood count. However, leukapheresis may fail to decrease the leukocyte count substantially or may achieve only a transient tumor bulk reduction. The procedure is generally well tolerated but can involve problems such as the need for anticoagulation or difficulty of access, and limited availability in many institutions.Specific antileukemic therapy must be initiated as soon as life-threatening complications have been corrected as it remains the first-line treatment of hyperleukocytosis.",,"['Ruggiero, Antonio', 'Rizzo, Daniela', 'Amato, Maria', 'Riccardi, Riccardo']","['Ruggiero A', 'Rizzo D', 'Amato M', 'Riccardi R']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, A.

This study was aimed to investigate SRSF2 mutations in Chinese AML patients. High-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was developed to screen SRSF2 mutations in 249 cases with AML, and then direct DNA sequencing was used to verify the results of HRMA. In this study, 3.6 % (9/249) of Chinese AML patients were found with heterozygous SRSF2 mutations. Patients with SRSF2 mutations were older than those with wild-type SRSF2 (P = 0.014). No differences in the sex, blood parameters, French-American-British classification (FAB) subtypes, and karyotypes were observed between AML patients with and without SRSF2 mutations. Although the overall survival (OS) of SRSF2-mutated patients was inferior to those without mutations in both whole AML patients (median 4 vs. 11 months, respectively; P = 0.006) and cytogenetically normal patients (median 2 vs. 12 months, respectively; P = 0.008), multiple analysis disclosed that SRSF2 mutation was not an independent prognostic factor in AML patients.

Clofarabine-induced defect in DNA replication, induces p53 and subsequently P53R2 genes as subunit of RR. clofarabine deregulated P53R2 gene expression leading to the elevated levels of P53R2 which impose resistance to DNA damaging drugs. In this study the apoptotic and cytotoxic effects of clofarabine has been investigated on breast cancer cell line. METHODS: Cofarabine cytotoxicity on T47D cells has been studied by MTT assay. T47D cells were exposed to the different concentrations of clofarabine for 24, 48 and 72 hours intervals. Relative expression of P53R2 gene has been studied using real-time PCR. Moreover, after treating with clofarabine the apoptotic and necrotic cells were detected using Annexin V and propodium iodide (PI) reagents by flowcytometry technique. RESULTS: MTT assay results showed that the clofarabine IC50 on T47D cell line were 3 and 2.5microM after 48 and 72 h exposure, respectively. Clofarabine did not show any significant cytotoxic effect after 24 h exposure. The analysis of qRT-PCR showed a significant increase in P53R2 gene expression in treated cells with both 2.5 and 3 muM doses and also, the results of flowcytometry revealed 26.91 and 74.46 percent apoptosis induction in 48 and 72h treatments respectively in comparison to the control groups. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that apoptotic and cytotoxic effects of clofarabine on T47D cell line were in time and dose dependent manner; therefore it could be considered a new candidate in breast cancer therapy.",,"['Rahmati-Yamchi, Mohammad', 'Zarghami, Nosratollah', 'Nozad Charoudeh, Hojjatollah', 'Ahmadi, Yasin', 'Baradaran, Behzad', 'Khalaj-Kondori, Mohammad', 'Milani, Morteza', 'Akbarzadeh, Abolfazl', 'Shaker, Maghsud', 'Pourhassan-Moghaddam, Mohammad']","['Rahmati-Yamchi M', 'Zarghami N', 'Nozad Charoudeh H', 'Ahmadi Y', 'Baradaran B', 'Khalaj-Kondori M', 'Milani M', 'Akbarzadeh A', 'Shaker M', 'Pourhassan-Moghaddam M']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Science, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Liver and Gastrointestinal disease research center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Liver and Gastrointestinal disease research center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical biotechnology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Adv Pharm Bull,Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,101578021,,,,PMC4729341,,2016/01/29 06:00,2016/01/29 06:01,['2016/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15171/apb.2015.064 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Pharm Bull. 2015 Nov;5(4):471-6. doi: 10.15171/apb.2015.064.

Genetic variations in the Reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) may alter the progress of folate metabolism, and thereby cause the initiation and progress of the cancer. Considerable studies have performed to investigate the association between RFC1 G80A (rs1051266) polymorphism and cancer susceptibility, but the conclusions were conflicting. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to reevaluate the association of RFC1 G80A polymorphism with cancer risk. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for eligible studies. The association of RFC1 G80A polymorphism and cancer risk was evaluated by the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The significant association was found between RFC1 G80A polymorphism and hematological malignance susceptibility (A vs. G: OR=1.11, 95%CI=1.003-1.23, P=0.045; GA vs. GG: OR=1.18, 95%CI=1.06-1.31, P=0.002; AA+GA vs. GG: OR=1.18, 95%CI=1.07-1.29, P=0.001). Stratified analysis by ethnicity indicated that the association became more prominent among Caucasians (GA vs. GG: OR=1.28, 95%CI=1.12-1.45, P<0.001; AA+GA vs. GG: OR=1.21, 95%CI=1.08-1.36, P=0.001).

Compound 1 showed the highest antibacterial effect, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 31 to 62 and 62 to 250 mug/mL, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. On further assays, the cytotoxic effect of compounds 1-5 was determined by MTT assay on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines including their multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotypes. Compound 1 induced a remarkable cytotoxic activity toward ALL cells (IC50 = 6.6-9.9 muM) and a lower effect against CML cells (IC50 = 27.5-30.0 muM). Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle distribution and cell death by PI-labeled cells and by Annexin V/PI staining, respectively. Upon treatment, 1 induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase accompanied by a strong induction of apoptosis.

Type I interferons (IFNs) are key effectors of the innate antiviral response, and IFN-alpha combined with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor zidovudine is considered the standard first-line therapy for ATL. HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax is known to suppress innate IFN production and response but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully established. In this study, we report on the suppression of type I IFN production by HTLV-1 Tax through interaction with and inhibition of TBK1 kinase that phosphorylates IRF3. Induced transcription of IFN-beta was severely impaired in HTLV-1-transformed ATL cells and freshly infected T lymphocytes. The ability to suppress IRF3 activation was ascribed to Tax. The expression of Tax alone sufficiently repressed the induction of IFN production by RIG-I plus PACT, cGAMP synthase plus STING, TBK1, IKKepsilon, IRF3, and IRF7, but not by IRF3-5D, a dominant-active phosphomimetic mutant. This suggests that Tax perturbs IFN production at the step of IRF3 phosphorylation. Tax mutants deficient for CREB or NF-kappaB activation were fully competent in the suppression of IFN production. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the association of Tax with TBK1, IKKepsilon, STING, and IRF3.In vitrokinase assay indicated an inhibitory effect of Tax on TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3. Taken together, our findings suggested a new mechanism by which HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax circumvents the production of type I IFNs in infected cells. Our findings have implications in therapeutic intervention of ATL. IMPORTANCE: Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the cause of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), an aggressive and fatal blood cancer, as well as another chronic disabling disease of the spinal cord. Treatments are unsatisfactory, and options are limited. A combination of antiviral cellular protein alpha interferon and zidovudine, which is an inhibitor of a viral enzyme called reverse transcriptase, has been recommended as the standard first-line therapy for ATL. Exactly how HTLV-1 interacts with the cellular machinery for interferon production and action is not well understood.

HTLV-1 encodes a protein from the antisense strand of its proviral genome, the HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), which inhibits Tax-1-mediated viral transcription and promotes cell proliferation, a high proviral load, and persistence in vivo. In adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cell lines and patient T cells, hbz is often the only viral gene expressed. The antisense strand of the HTLV-2 proviral genome also encodes a protein termed APH-2. Like HBZ, APH-2 is able to inhibit Tax-2-mediated viral transcription and is detectable in most primary lymphocytes from HTLV-2-infected patients. However, unlike HBZ, the loss of APH-2 in vivo results in increased viral replication and proviral loads, suggesting that HBZ and APH-2 modulate the virus and cellular pathways differently. Herein, we examined the effect of APH-2 on several known HBZ-modulated pathways: NF-kappaB (p65) transactivation, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling, and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) transactivation. Like HBZ, APH-2 has the ability to inhibit p65 transactivation. Conversely, HBZ and APH-2 have divergent effects on TGF-beta signaling and IRF-1 transactivation. Quantitative PCR and protein half-life experiments revealed a substantial disparity between HBZ and APH-2 transcript levels and protein stability, respectively. Taken together, our data further elucidate the functional differences between HBZ and APH-2 and how these differences can have profound effects on the survival of infected cells and, ultimately, pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE: Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and type 2 (HTLV-2) are highly related retroviruses that have distinct pathological outcomes in infected hosts. Functional comparisons of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 proteins provide a better understanding about how HTLV-1 infection is associated with disease and HTLV-2 infection is not. The HTLV genome antisense-strand genes hbz and aph-2 are often the only viral genes expressed in HTLV-infected T cells. Previously, our group found that HTLV-1 HBZ and HTLV-2 APH-2 had distinct effects in vivo and hypothesized that the differences in the interactions of HBZ and APH-2 with important cell signaling pathways dictate whether cells undergo proliferation, apoptosis, or senescence. Ultimately, these functional differences may affect how HTLV-1 causes disease but HTLV-2 generally does not. In the current study, we compared the effects of HBZ and APH-2 on several HTLV-relevant cellular pathways, including the TGF-beta signaling, NF-kappaB activation, and IRF-1 transactivation pathways.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

We sought to analyze the clinical utility of a novel assay for putative leukemia stem cells in a large prospective cohort. The leukemic clone's most primitive hematopoietic cellular phenotype was prospectively identified in 109 newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients, and analyzed against clinical risk groups and outcomes. Most (80/109) patients harbored CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia cells. The CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia cells in 47 of the 80 patients displayed intermediate aldehyde dehydrogenase expression, while normal CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells expressed high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase. In the other 33/80 patients, the CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia cells exhibited high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and most (28/33, 85%) harbored poor-risk cytogenetics or FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem translocations. No CD34(+) leukemia cells could be detected in 28/109 patients, including 14/21 patients with nucleophosmin-1 mutations and 6/7 acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. The patients with CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity manifested a significantly lower complete remission rate, as well as poorer event-free and overall survivals. The leukemic clone's most immature phenotype was heterogeneous with respect to CD34, CD38, and ALDH expression, but correlated with acute myeloid leukemia risk groups and outcomes.

Between January 1999 and November 2014, 172 (4%) of the 4174 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia followed at our center had a magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system and/or a lumbar puncture to evaluate neurological symptoms. After comprehensive evaluation, the etiology of neurological symptoms was: central nervous system chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 18 patients (10% evaluated by imaging and/or lumbar puncture, 0.4% overall cohort); central nervous system Richter Syndrome in 15 (9% evaluated, 0.3% overall); infection in 40 (23% evaluated, 1% overall); autoimmune/inflammatory conditions in 28 (16% evaluated, 0.7% overall); other cancer in 8 (5% evaluated, 0.2% overall); and another etiology in 63 (37% evaluated, 1.5% overall). Although the sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid analysis to detect central nervous system disease was 89%, the specificity was only 42% due to the frequent presence of leukemic cells in the cerebrospinal fluid in other conditions. No parameter on cerebrospinal fluid analysis (e.g. total nucleated cells, total lymphocyte count, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell percentage) were able to offer a reliable discrimination between patients whose neurological symptoms were due to clinically significant central nervous system involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia and another etiology. Median overall survival among patients with clinically significant central nervous system chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Richter syndrome was 12 and 11 months, respectively. In conclusion, clinically significant central nervous system involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a rare condition, and neurological symptoms in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are due to other etiologies in approximately 80% of cases.

In this study, we investigated the possible contribution of RELMbeta to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development. First, RELMbeta knock-out (KO) mice were shown to be resistant to methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH development. Since it was newly revealed that Kupffer cells in the liver express RELMbeta and that RELMbeta expression levels in the colon and the numbers of RELMbeta-positive Kupffer cells were both increased in this model, we carried out further experiments using radiation chimeras between wild-type and RELMbeta-KO mice to distinguish between the contributions of RELMbeta in these two organs. These experiments revealed the requirement of RELMbeta in both organs for full manifestation of NASH, while deletion of each one alone attenuated the development of NASH with reduced serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. The higher proportion of lactic acid bacteria in the gut microbiota of RELMbeta-KO than in that of wild-type mice may be one of the mechanisms underlying the lower serum LPS level the former. These data suggest the contribution of increases in RELMbeta in the gut and Kupffer cells to NASH development, raising the possibility of RELMbeta being a novel therapeutic target for NASH.",,"['Okubo, Hirofumi', 'Kushiyama, Akifumi', 'Sakoda, Hideyuki', 'Nakatsu, Yusuke', 'Iizuka, Masaki', 'Taki, Naoyuki', 'Fujishiro, Midori', 'Fukushima, Toshiaki', 'Kamata, Hideaki', 'Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Nishimura, Fusanori', 'Katagiri, Hideki', 'Asahara, Takashi', 'Yoshida, Yasuto', 'Chonan, Osamu', 'Encinas, Jeffery', 'Asano, Tomoichiro']","['Okubo H', 'Kushiyama A', 'Sakoda H', 'Nakatsu Y', 'Iizuka M', 'Taki N', 'Fujishiro M', 'Fukushima T', 'Kamata H', 'Nagamachi A', 'Inaba T', 'Nishimura F', 'Katagiri H', 'Asahara T', 'Yoshida Y', 'Chonan O', 'Encinas J', 'Asano T']","['Department of Medical Science, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Hiroshima, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima City, Hiroshima Japan.', 'Institute for Adult Disease, Asahi Life Foundation, 2-2-6, Bakuro-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 103-0002, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo.', 'Department of Medical Science, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Hiroshima, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima City, Hiroshima Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Kobe Pharma Research Institute, Nippon Boehringer-Ingelheim Co.

In the present study, NPC1 was shown by microarray analysis to be more highly expressed in the Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line SUP-B15/RI, an imatinib-resistant variant of SUP-B15/S cells without bcr-abl gene mutation established in our lab. Further investigation revealed a defect in the functional capacity of the NPC1 protein demonstrated by filipin staining accompanied by a lower intracellular imatinib mesylate(IM) concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography in SUP-B15/RI compared with SUP-B15/S cells. Furthermore, U18666A, an inhibitor of NPC1 function, was used to block cholesterol trafficking to imitate the NPC1 defect in SUP-B15/S cells, leading to higher NPC1 expression, stronger filipin fluorescence, lower intracellular IM concentrations and greater resistance against IM. Samples from non-mutated relapsed Ph+ ALL patients also showed higher NPC1 expression compared with IM-sensitive patients.

Identifying factors that predict response to therapy may help increase efficacy and avoid toxicity. The phase II SWOG S0703 study investigated the use of hydroxyurea and azacitidine with gemtuzumab ozogamicin in the elderly AML population and found survival rates similar to those expected with standard AML regimens, with less toxicity. As part of this study, global DNA methylation along with promoter DNA methylation and expression analysis of six candidate genes (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, HIC1, RARB, CDH1 and APAF1) were determined before and during therapy to investigate whether very early changes are prognostic for clinical response. Global DNA methylation was not associated with a clinical response. Samples after 3 or 4 days of treatment with azacitidine showed significantly decreased CDKN2A promoter DNA methylation in patients achieving complete remission (CR) compared to those who did not. Samples from day 7 of treatment showed significantly decreased RARB, CDKN2B and CDH1 promoter DNA methylation in responders compared to nonresponders. Gene-specific DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood samples may help early identification of those older AML patients most likely to benefit from demethylating agent therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past years, rituximab (anti-CD20) emerged as the standard of care in the induction treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), as well as in other subsets. Since the benefits of immuno-chemotherapy have been clearly demonstrated in a whole range of lymphomas, several innovative approaches are being explored to achieve significant responses, particularly in refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases. Studies of the comparative effectiveness and structure/function relationship of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, together with an increased understanding of the molecular features of NHLs, have led to the development of a range of novel therapies, many of which target the tumor in a tailored fashion. Although several molecules can help clinicians to dissect the pathological mechanisms acting in the natural history of the disease, the main purpose of this review emphasize the recent developments in targeting the B-cell NHLs surface. These novel approaches are illustrated, and the new intriguing opportunities offered by bispecific antibodies and antibody-associated immune modulation are addressed.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An important consideration affecting the choice of transgenic vector is their insertion site preferences. Previous large-scale analyses of Ds transposon integration sites in plants were done on the basis of reporter gene expression or germ-line transmission, making it difficult to discern vertebrate integration preferences. Here, we compare over 1300 Ds transposon integration sites in zebrafish with Tol2 transposon and retroviral integration sites. Genome-wide analysis shows that Ds integration sites in the presence or absence of marker selection are remarkably similar and distributed throughout the genome. No strict motif was found, but a preference for structural features in the target DNA associated with DNA flexibility (Twist, Tilt, Rise, Roll, Shift, and Slide) was observed. Remarkably, this feature is also found in transposon and retroviral integrations in maize and mouse cells. Our findings show that structural features influence the integration of heterologous DNA in genomes, and have implications for targeted genome engineering.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Vrljicak et al.'],"['Vrljicak, Pavle', 'Tao, Shijie', 'Varshney, Gaurav K', 'Quach, Helen Ngoc Bao', 'Joshi, Adita', 'LaFave, Matthew C', 'Burgess, Shawn M', 'Sampath, Karuna']","['Vrljicak P', 'Tao S', 'Varshney GK', 'Quach HN', 'Joshi A', 'LaFave MC', 'Burgess SM', 'Sampath K']","['Division of Biomedical Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AJ, United Kingdom.', 'Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, National University of Singapore, 117604, Singapore.', 'National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-8004.', 'Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, National University of Singapore, 117604, Singapore.', 'Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, National University of Singapore, 117604, Singapore.', 'National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-8004.', 'National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-8004 K.Sampath@warwick.ac.uk.', 'Division of Biomedical Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AJ, United Kingdom K.Sampath@warwick.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,G3 (Bethesda),"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Engineering', '*Genome', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Genomics/methods', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Virus Integration', 'Zebrafish/genetics']",PMC4825651,,2016/01/29 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/01/29 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['g3.115.026849 [pii]', '10.1534/g3.115.026849 [doi]']",epublish,G3 (Bethesda). 2016 Apr 7;6(4):805-17. doi: 10.1534/g3.115.026849.,,,,20160407,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0729-1977'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Ac/Ds', '*ES cells', '*MMLV', '*Tol2', '*functional genomics', '*gene targeting', '*genome engineering', '*genome-wide analysis', '*integrations', '*mouse', '*retrovirus', '*transposon', '*vertebrate genomes', '*zebrafish']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idelalisib is a potent, selective inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), a lipid kinase whose over-activity in B-NHL drives disease progression. Idelalisib has demonstrated activity in indolent B-NHL (iB-NHL) and is approved for use as monotherapy in patients with follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma and in combination with rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. AREAS COVERED: Herein we review the development and pharmacology of idelalisib, its safety and efficacy in clinical studies of iB-NHL, and its potential for inclusion in future applications in iB-NHL and in combination with other therapies. EXPERT OPINION: Idelalisib adds to the growing arsenal of iB-NHL pharmacotherapeutics and to the progression of the field toward precision agents with good efficacy and reduced toxicities. Nevertheless, idelalisib carries important risks that require careful patient counseling and monitoring. The appropriate sequencing of idelalisib with other proven treatment options in addition to its potential for combination with established or novel drugs will be borne out in ongoing and planned investigations.",,"['Graf, Solomon A', 'Gopal, Ajay K']","['Graf SA', 'Gopal AK']","['a Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle , WA , USA.', 'b Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'c Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'a Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle , WA , USA.', 'b Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 HL007093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24CA184039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA044991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 CA184039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA44991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32HL007093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Purines/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage']",PMC4955805,['NIHMS797927'],2016/01/29 06:00,2016/06/30 06:00,['2016/01/29 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2016.1135130 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2016;17(2):265-74. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2016.1135130.

BACKGROUND: TKIs have proven survival benefits in the treatment of several cancers, including chronic myeloid leukaemia, breast, liver, renal and lung cancer. However, current high prices are a barrier to treatment. Mass production of low-cost generic antiretrovirals has led to over 13 million people being on HIV/AIDS treatment worldwide. This analysis estimates target prices for generic TKIs, assuming similar methods of mass production. METHODS: Four TKIs with patent expiry dates in the next 5 years were selected for analysis: imatinib, erlotinib, lapatinib and sorafenib. Chemistry, dosing, published data on per-kilogram pricing for commercial transactions of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and quotes from manufacturers were used to estimate costs of production. Analysis included costs of excipients, formulation, packaging, shipping and a 50% profit margin. Target prices were compared with current prices. Global numbers of patients eligible for treatment with each TKI were estimated. RESULTS: API costs per kg were $347-$746 for imatinib, $2470 for erlotinib, $4671 for lapatinib, and $3000 for sorafenib. Basing on annual dose requirements, costs of formulation/packaging and a 50% profit margin, target generic prices per person-year were $128-$216 for imatinib, $240 for erlotinib, $1450 for sorafenib, and $4020 for lapatinib. Over 1 million people would be newly eligible to start treatment with these TKIs annually. CONCLUSIONS: Mass generic production of several TKIs could achieve treatment prices in the range of $128-$4020 per person-year, versus current US prices of $75161-$139,138. Generic TKIs could allow significant savings and scaling-up of treatment globally, for over 1 million eligible patients.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), plays a pivotal role in regulating uterine receptivity. LIF is expressed in the endometrial glands and has a robust action on the uterine luminal epithelium (LE). In mice, LIF is induced by nidatory E2 and functions to convert the LE from a non-receptive to an embryo-responsive state. LIF mediates its actions by activating the JAK-STAT pathway specifically in the LE. Activation of JAK-STAT pathway results in the induction of many additional pathways, including some 40 + transcription factors, many of which initiate a cascade of changes affecting epithelial polarity, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, angiogenesis, stromal cell decidualization, and inhibiting cell proliferation. This review discusses the role of LIF and the recent analysis of its action on the uterine LE in regulating endometrial receptivity and implantation.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

METHODS: We performed global specific gene expression profiling and functional pathway analysis in purified Sca1+ cells of two MDS transgenic mouse models that mimic human high-risk MDS (HR-MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) post MDS, with NRASD12 and BCL2 transgenes under the control of different promoters MRP8NRASD12/tethBCL-2 or MRP8[NRASD12/hBCL-2], respectively. RESULTS: Analysis of dysregulated genes that were unique to the diseased HR-MDS and AML post MDS mice and not their founder mice pointed first to pathways that had previously been reported in MDS patients, including DNA replication/damage/repair, cell cycle, apoptosis, immune responses, and canonical Wnt pathways, further validating these models at the gene expression level. Interestingly, pathways not previously reported in MDS were discovered. These included dysregulated genes of noncanonical Wnt pathways and energy and lipid metabolisms. These dysregulated genes were not only confirmed in a different independent set of BM and spleen Sca1+ cells from the MDS mice but also in MDS CD34+ BM patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: These two MDS models may thus provide useful preclinical models to target pathways previously identified in MDS patients and to unravel novel pathways highlighted by this study.",,"['Guerenne, Laura', 'Beurlet, Stephanie', 'Said, Mohamed', 'Gorombei, Petra', 'Le Pogam, Carole', 'Guidez, Fabien', 'de la Grange, Pierre', 'Omidvar, Nader', 'Vanneaux, Valerie', 'Mills, Ken', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Sarda-Mantel, Laure', 'Noguera, Maria Elena', 'Pla, Marika', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Padua, Rose Ann', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Krief, Patricia']","['Guerenne L', 'Beurlet S', 'Said M', 'Gorombei P', 'Le Pogam C', 'Guidez F', 'de la Grange P', 'Omidvar N', 'Vanneaux V', 'Mills K', 'Mufti GJ', 'Sarda-Mantel L', 'Noguera ME', 'Pla M', 'Fenaux P', 'Padua RA', 'Chomienne C', 'Krief P']","[""Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR-S) 1131, Paris, France. lguerenne@gmail.com."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite (U) 1131, Paris, France. lguerenne@gmail.com.', ""Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR-S) 1131, Paris, France. stephanie.beurlet@free.fr."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite (U) 1131, Paris, France. stephanie.beurlet@free.fr.', ""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London and Kings College Hospital, London, UK. malih100@gmail.com."", ""Universite Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR-S) 1131, Paris, France.

The Janus kinases (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) pathway is one such pathway that is frequently mutated in leukemia and lymphoma. In response to cytokines and growth factors, a cascade of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation events propagates the JAK-STAT pathway from the cell surface to the nucleus. Activated STAT family members then play a fundamental role in establishing the transcriptional landscape of the cell. In leukemia and lymphoma, somatic mutations have been identified in JAK and STAT family members, as well as, negative regulators of the pathway. Most recently, inactivating mutations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) genes PTPN1 (PTP1B) and PTPN2 (TC-PTP) were sequenced in B cell lymphoma and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) respectively. The loss of PTP1B and TC-PTP phosphatase activity is associated with an increase in cytokine sensitivity, elevated JAK-STAT signaling, and changes in gene expression. As inactivation mutations in PTPN1 and PTPN2 are restricted to distinct subsets of leukemia and lymphoma, a future challenge will be to identify in which cellular contexts do they contributing to the initiation or maintenance of leukemogenesis or lymphomagenesis. As well, the molecular mechanisms by which PTP1B and TC-PTP loss co-operates with other genetic aberrations will need to be elucidated to design more effective therapeutic strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our aim was to investigate the purchases of medications associated with MetS among 7551 early onset cancer patients compared to siblings. METHODS: Our nationwide Finnish population-based registry study analyzed the drug purchase of medication among early onset cancer patients diagnosed with cancer below the age of 35 years between 1994 and 2004 compared to siblings by linkage to the drug purchase registry, allowing for a maximal follow-up of 18 years. RESULTS: The hazard ratios (HRs) for purchasing antihypertensives and diabetes drugs were higher after both childhood (HR 4.6, 95%CI 3.1-7.0; HR 3.0, 95%1.5-6.1) and young adulthood (YA) cancer (HR 1.5, 95%CI 1.3-1.8; HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.2) compared to siblings. The HRs for purchasing lipid-lowering drugs were elevated both after childhood (HR 4.3,95%CI 0.9-19.5) and YA cancer (HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.04-2.5), but only reached significance in YA cancer patients. Among specific cancer diagnosis groups, highest HR values for antihypertensives were found in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (HR 6.1, 95%CI 3.7-10.3) and bone tumor (HR 4.3, 95%CI 1.9-9.4), and YA ALL (HR 4.8, 95%CI 3.1-7.0) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (HR 3.4, 95%CI 2.5-5.1) patients. Moreover, childhood ALL (HR 6.3, 95%CI 2.7-14.8), AML (HR 7.6, 95%CI 1.9-24.5) and central nervous system (CNS)-tumor (HR 3.5, 95%CI 1.3-9.2) and YA ALL (HR 3.7, 95%CI 1.2-9.5) patients showed the strongest likelihood of purchasing diabetes drugs compared to siblings. CONCLUSION: The purchase of medications associated with MetS was increased after early onset cancer and highly dependent on the age at cancer diagnosis and the cancer diagnosis. Prevention strategies are imperative for reducing potentially life-threatening cardiovascular complications after early onset cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

Clinical resistance to the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib is a critical problem in treating CML. This study investigated the antitumor effect and mechanism of MPT0B169, a new antitubulin agent, in K562 CML cells and their derived imatinib-resistant cells, IMR2 and IMR3. IMR2 and IMR3 cells showed complete resistance to imatinib-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Resistance involved ERK1/2 overactivation and MDR1 overexpression. MPT0B169 inhibited the growth of K562, IMR2, and IMR3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. MPT0B169 substantially inhibited the mRNA and protein levels of Bcr-Abl, followed by its downstream pathways including Akt, ERK1/2, and STAT3 in these cells. MPT0B169 treatment resulted in a decrease in the polymer form of tubulin according to Western blot analysis. It triggered cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase before apoptosis, which was related to the upregulation of the mitotic marker MPM2 and the cyclin B1 level, and a change in the phosphorylation of Cdk1. MPT0B169 induced apoptosis in nonresistant and imatinib-resistant cells via a mitochondrion-mediated caspase pathway. Further study showed that the agent led to a decrease in the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 and an increase in the apoptotic protein Bax. Taken together, our results suggest that MPT0B169 might be a promising agent for overcoming imatinib resistance in CML cells.",,"['Wong, Shuit-Mun', 'Liu, Fu-Hwa', 'Lee, Yueh-Lun', 'Huang, Huei-Mei']","['Wong SM', 'Liu FH', 'Lee YL', 'Huang HM']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0', '(2-dimethylamino-N-(1-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-7-yl)acetam', 'ide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'Z711V88R5F (Sarcosine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Sarcosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology']",PMC4729476,,2016/01/28 06:00,2016/07/21 06:00,['2016/01/28 06:00'],"['2015/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0148093 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-38955 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jan 27;11(1):e0148093. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0148093. eCollection 2016.,,['PLoS One. 2017 Oct 11;12 (10 ):e0186531.

Regulation of its gene transcription is one way for WT1-targeting drug design. Recently, in silico analysis of some oncogene promoters like WT1 showed some guanine-rich regions with the ability to form G-quadruplex structures. Ligands like 5,10,15,20-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphine (TMPyP4) have predominant effect on G-quadruplex stabilization. The aim of this study was to understand the effect of TMPyP4 on WT1 gene transcription via stabilization of promoter G-quadruplexes. We examined the formation of new G-quadruplex motifs in WT1 promoter in the presence of TMPyP4. In order to understand the nature of its interaction with WT1 promoter quadruplexes, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), circular dichroism (CD), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) stop assays, and quantitative RT-PCR were performed. According to the results, the WT1 promoter can form stable intramolecular parallel G-quadruplexes. In addition, after 48 and 96 h of incubation, 100 muM TMPyP4 reduced the WT1 transcription to 9 and 0.4 %, respectively, compare to control. We report that ligand-mediated stabilization of G-quadruplexes within the WT1 promoter can silence WT1 expression.

In summary, our data show that the A13 treatment could effectively be applied to acute leukemia via inhibiting STAT3 signaling pathway.",,"['Weng, Qiaoyou', 'Ren, Luqing', 'Guo, Lu', 'Hu, Yan', 'Zhou, Haixia', 'Bao, Yuyan', 'Chen, Lingfeng', 'Liang, Guang', 'Wang, Yi', 'Ruan, Jichen']","['Weng Q', 'Ren L', 'Guo L', 'Hu Y', 'Zhou H', 'Bao Y', 'Chen L', 'Liang G', 'Wang Y', 'Ruan J']","['Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', 'Department of Interventional Radiology, the 5th Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Lishui, Zhejiang, 323000, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, the 2nd Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325000, China."", 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China. yi.wang1122@gmail.com.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China. ruanjichen@163.com.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, the 2nd Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325000, China. ruanjichen@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mastocytoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2016/01/28 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/01/28 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-4861-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-4861-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Jul;37(7):9959-66. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-4861-0.

METHODS: A total of 36 B-NHL cases (including MCL 16 cases, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) 11 cases, splenic marginal zone cell lymphoma (SMZL) 9 cases) and 8 healthy donors were enrolled in this study from January 2008 to April 2011 in our Lymphoma Clinic Center. The mRNA level of Yap (effector of Hippo pathway) and LATS1, LATS2 mRNA were detected by using real-time quantitative PCR. Log expression values of real-time quantitative PCR data were used in this analysis. RESULTS: The YAP mRNA expression level in MCL, CLL and SMZL patient were significantly higher than that in health donor (lg: 1.97+/-0.79, 1.83+/-0.54, 2.12+/-0.42 vs 1.21+/-1.56, all P<0.05). The expression level of LATS1, LATS2 mRNA in MCL was significantly correlated with molecular cytogenetic aberrations, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The LATS1 expression level was statistically lower in the group of MCL with delection P53 than the group of MCL without delection P53 (lg: 0.75+/-0.27 vs 1.10+/-0.19, P=0.035). And the LATS1 expression level was statistically lower in the death group than the survival group (lg: 0.76+/-0.27 vs 1.15+/-0.17, P=0.026). The PFS and OS were significantly longer in the MCL patients with high level of LATS1 than that of other MCL patients ((70.4+/-32.7) vs (5.6+/-2.2) months, P=0.044; (123.8+/-22.0) vs (7.7+/-2.2) months, P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Hippo pathway is dysfunctional in B-NHL, especially in MCL.The reduced expression of LATS1, LATS2 in MCL patients is associated with progressive disease, and might be an important prognostic factor in MCL.",,"['Yu, Zhen', 'Yi, Shuhua', 'Zhang, Yanru', 'Li, Zengjun', 'Qiu, Lugui']","['Yu Z', 'Yi S', 'Zhang Y', 'Li Z', 'Qiu L']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China; Email: qiulg@ihcams.ac.cn.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (LATS1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (LATS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,,2016/01/28 06:00,2016/01/28 06:01,['2016/01/28 06:00'],"['2016/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/28 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2015 Oct;95(40):3285-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other 3q abnormalities have been reported and cryptic MECOM rearrangements have been identified in some cases. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, we investigated 97 acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients with various 3q abnormalities to determine the role and the frequency of the involvement of MECOM. We identified MECOM rearrangements in 51 patients, most of them showed 3q26 involvement by chromosome banding analysis (CBA): inv(3)/t(3;3) (n = 26) and other balanced 3q26 translocations (t(3q26)) (n = 15); the remaining cases (n = 10) showed various 3q abnormalities: five with balanced translocations involving 3q21 or 3q25; two with homogenously staining region (hsr) on 3q; and three with other various 3q abnormalities. Complex rearrangements with multiple breakpoints on 3q, masking 3q26 involvement, were identified in cases with 3q21/3q25 translocations. Furthermore, multiple breaks were observed in two cases with t(3q26), suggesting that complex rearrangement may also occur in apparently simple t(3q26). Intrachromosomal gene amplification was another mechanism leading to MECOM overexpression in two cases with hsr on 3q. In the last three cases, FISH analysis revealed 3q26 involvement that was missed by CBA because of metaphases' suboptimal quality. All cases with MECOM rearrangements showed overexpression by real-time quantitative PCR. Finally, MECOM rearrangements can occur in patients with 3q abnormalities even in the absence of specific 3q26 involvement, underlining that their frequency is underestimated. As MECOM rearrangement has been associated with very poor prognosis, its screening should be performed in patients with any 3q abnormalities.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Baldazzi, Carmen', 'Luatti, Simona', 'Zuffa, Elisa', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Marzocchi, Giulia', 'Ameli, Gaia', 'Bardi, Maria Antonella', 'Bonaldi, Laura', 'Paolini, Rossella', 'Gurrieri, Carmela', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Testoni, Nicoletta']","['Baldazzi C', 'Luatti S', 'Zuffa E', 'Papayannidis C', 'Ottaviani E', 'Marzocchi G', 'Ameli G', 'Bardi MA', 'Bonaldi L', 'Paolini R', 'Gurrieri C', 'Rigolin GM', 'Cuneo A', 'Martinelli G', 'Cavo M', 'Testoni N']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.', ""Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara-Arcispedale Sant'Anna, Ferrara, Italy."", 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of General Medicine, UOSD Hematology, Santa Maria Della Misericordia Hospital, Rovigo, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', ""Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara-Arcispedale Sant'Anna, Ferrara, Italy."", ""Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara-Arcispedale Sant'Anna, Ferrara, Italy."", 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli,"" Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital-University, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2016/01/28 06:00,2016/09/27 06:00,['2016/01/28 06:00'],"['2015/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22341 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2016 Apr;55(4):375-88. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22341.

We, therefore, characterized infectious complications in children with AML and Down syndrome treated according to AML-BFM 2004 study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00111345; amended 2006 for Down syndrome with reduced intensity). PROCEDURE: Data on infectious complications were gathered from the medical records in the hospital where the patient was treated. Infectious complications were categorized as fever without identifiable source (FUO), or as microbiologically or clinically documented infections. RESULTS: A total of 157 infections occurred in 61 patients (60.5% FUO, 9.6% and 29.9% clinically and microbiologically documented infections, respectively). Almost 90% of the pathogens isolated from the bloodstream were Gram-positive bacteria, and approximately half of them were viridans group streptococci. All seven microbiologically documented episodes of pneumonia were caused by viruses. Infection-related mortality was 4.9%, and all three patients died due to viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that a reduced-intensity chemotherapeutic regimen in children with AML and Down syndrome is still associated with high morbidity. Although no patient died due to bacteria or fungi, viruses were responsible for all lethal events. Future studies, therefore, have to focus on the impact of viruses on morbidity and mortality of patients with AML and Down syndrome.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hassler, Angela', 'Bochennek, Konrad', 'Gilfert, Julia', 'Perner, Corinna', 'Schoning, Stefan', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas']","['Hassler A', 'Bochennek K', 'Gilfert J', 'Perner C', 'Schoning S', 'Creutzig U', 'Reinhardt D', 'Lehrnbecher T']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."", 'Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center, University of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infections/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,2016/01/28 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2016/01/28 06:00'],"['2015/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25917 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Jun;63(6):1070-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25917.

Flow cytometry can discriminate CD34(+) CD38(-) LSC and normal haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) by using aberrant expression of markers and scatter properties. However, not all LSC can be identified using currently available markers, so new markers are needed. CD45RA is expressed on leukaemic cells in the majority of AML patients. We investigated the potency of CD45RA to specifically identify LSC and HSC and improve LSC quantification. Compared to our best other markers (CLL-1, also termed CLEC12A, CD33 and CD123), CD45RA was the most reliable marker. Patients with high percentages (>90%) of CD45RA on CD34(+) CD38(-) LSC have 1.69-fold higher scatter values compared to HSC (P < 0.001), indicating a more mature CD34(+) CD38(-) phenotype. Patients with low (<10%) or intermediate (10-90%) CD45RA expression on LSC showed no significant differences to HSC (1.12- and 1.15-fold higher, P = 0.31 and P = 0.44, respectively). CD45RA-positive LSC tended to represent more favourable cytogenetic/molecular markers. In conclusion, CD45RA contributes to more accurate LSC detection and is recommended for inclusion in stem cell tracking panels.

Among them, lymphoma cells of 18 cases located in other involved organs had similar CD103 expression patterns. Histologically, we found (a) increased reactive IELs in non-neoplastic mucosal layers in 28% (5/18) of surgical and mucosal resection cases, (b) preserved epithelial glands, and (c) numerous small intraepithelial ATLL nests in involved lesions in 36 (69%) and 21 (40%), respectively, of the 52 examined cases.

The classic clinical features of T-PLL are lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin lesions. Skin involvement varies clinically from diffuse infiltrated erythema. Infiltration is localized to the face and ears, nodules, and erythroderma. We present a case of small cell variant of T-PLL in a patient who presented with unusual cutaneous manifestations of acquired palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) followed by diffuse erythematous infiltrated papules and plaques involving the trunk. When the etiology of acquired PPK is not clear, the physician should consider the possibility of an underlying malignant disease. In this case, the diagnosis of T-PLL was subsequently confirmed by laboratory and cytological findings, as well as by the immunophenotyping of leukemic cells in skin biopsy. Since paraneoplastic acquired PPK may be the initial evident sign of malignancy, the physician's awareness of this manifestation may be crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.

In this study, we used a mouse model of ATL and restored expression of the microRNA, miR-124a, to identify in vivo downstream effectors responsible for its tumor-suppressive functions in ATL cells. Our results revealed that STAT3, a direct target of miR-124a, is constitutively activated in HTLV-I-transformed cells and ATL cells, and activating STAT3 mutations were detected in 25.5% of primary ATL patients. Interestingly, we found that the STAT3 downstream kinase effector, Pim1, is constitutively activated in ATL cells. The dependence of ATL cells to Pim1 activity was demonstrated using 2 Pim1 small inhibitors, SMI-4a and AZD1208. These studies indicated that HTLV-I-transformed and ATL cells, but not normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, are highly sensitive to AZD1208, and the inhibition of Pim1 signaling triggers an apoptotic signal in leukemic cells. Finally, preclinical testing of AZD1208 in a mouse model of ATL resulted in significant prevention of tumor growth in vivo.

A T-cell defect in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) due to disease and/or therapy impairs ex vivo expansion and response to CAR T cells. To evaluate the effect of ibrutinib treatment on the T-cell compartment in CLL as it relates to CAR T-cell generation, we examined the phenotype and function of T cells in a cohort of CLL patients during their course of treatment with ibrutinib. We found that >/=5 cycles of ibrutinib therapy improved the expansion of CD19-directed CAR T cells (CTL019), in association with decreased expression of the immunosuppressive molecule programmed cell death 1 on T cells and of CD200 on B-CLL cells. In support of these findings, we observed that 3 CLL patients who had been treated with ibrutinib for >/=1 year at the time of T-cell collection had improved ex vivo and in vivo CTL019 expansion, which correlated positively together and with clinical response. Lastly, we show that ibrutinib exposure does not impair CAR T-cell function in vitro but does improve CAR T-cell engraftment, tumor clearance, and survival in human xenograft models of resistant acute lymphocytic leukemia and CLL when administered concurrently.

The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of Ebp1 expression in AML cells and to determine the mechanisms by which Ebp1 promotes cell proliferation in these cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of Ebp1 was studied in mononuclear cells obtained from the peripheral blood of 54 patients with AML by Western blot analysis. The effects of Ebp1 expression on proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression and cell proliferation was measured using Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, in vitro ubiquitination, and colony-forming assays. The role of Ebp1 in promoting rRNA synthesis and cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring the level of pre-rRNA and the recruitment of Pol I to rDNA. RESULTS: Ebp1 is highly expressed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells and regulates the level of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis by binding to RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) and enhancing the formation of the Pol I initiation complex. Ebp1 also increases the stability of PCNA protein by preventing its interaction with Mdm2, for which it is a substrate. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate an important role of Ebp1 in promoting cell proliferation in AML cells through the regulation of both rRNA synthesis and PCNA expression.

Age-standardized rates and numbers of deaths are predicted for 2016 in the European Union (EU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Population and death certification data for stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, prostate, leukaemias and total cancers were obtained from the World Health Organization database and Eurostat. Figures were derived for the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. Projected numbers of deaths by age group were obtained for 2016 by linear regression on estimated numbers of deaths over the most recent time period identified by a joinpoint regression model. RESULTS: Projected total cancer mortality trends for 2016 in the EU are favourable in both sexes with rates of 133.5/100 000 men and 85.2/100 000 women (8% and 3% falls since 2011) corresponding to 753 600 and 605 900 deaths in men and women for a total number of 1 359 500 projected cancer deaths (+3% compared with 2011, due to population ageing). In men, lung, colorectal and prostate cancer have fallen 11%, 5% and 8%, respectively, since 2011. Breast and colorectal cancer trends in women are favourable (8% and 7% falls, respectively), but lung and pancreatic cancer rates have risen 5% and 4% since 2011 reaching rates of 14.4 and 5.6/100 000 women. Leukaemias show favourable projected mortality for both sexes and all age groups, with stronger falls in the younger age groups. All ages rates are 4.0/100 000 men and 2.5/100 000 women, with falls of 14% and 12% respectively. CONCLUSION: The 2016 predictions for EU cancer mortality confirm the favourable trends in rates particularly for men. Lung cancer is likely to be the leading site for female cancer rates. Continuing falls in mortality, larger in children and young adults, are predicted in leukaemias, essentially due to advancements in management and therapy, and their subsequent adoption across Europe.","['(c) The Author 2016.

In this study, we investigated mutations of three SF genes, SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2, by Sanger sequencing in 500 patients with de novo AML and analysed their clinical relevance. SF mutations were identified in 10.8% of total cohort and 13.2% of those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. SF mutations were closely associated with RUNX1, ASXL1, IDH2 and TET2 mutations. SF-mutated AML patients had a significantly lower complete remission rate and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than those without the mutation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that SFmutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for DFS and OS. A scoring system incorporating SF mutation and ten other prognostic factors was proved very useful to risk-stratify AML patients. Sequential study of paired samples showed that SF mutations were stable during AML evolution. In conclusion, SF mutations are associated with distinct clinic-biological features and poor prognosis in de novo AML patients and are rather stable during disease progression.

We have also shown that MYB expression in ER(+ve) breast cancer cells is regulated at the level of transcriptional elongation and as such, is suppressed by CDK9i. Here we examined the effects of CDK9i on breast cancer cells and the involvement of MYB in these effects. ER(+ve) breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7 were much more sensitive (> 10 times) to killing by CDK9i than ER(-ve)/MYB(-ve) cells. Moreover, surviving cells showed a block at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Importantly, ectopic MYB expression conferred resistance to apoptosis induction, cell killing and G2/M accumulation. Expression of relevant MYB target genes including BCL2 and CCNB1 was suppressed by CDK9 inhibition, and this too was reversed by ectopic MYB expression. Nevertheless, inhibition of BCL2 alone either by MYB knockdown or by ABT-199 treatment was insufficient for significant induction of apoptosis. Further studies implied that suppression of MCL-1, a well-documented target of CDK9 inhibition, was additionally required for apoptosis induction, while maximal levels of apoptosis induced by CDK9i are likely to also involve inhibition of BCL2L1 expression. Taken together these data suggest that MYB regulation of BCL2 underlies the heightened sensitivity of ER(+ve) compared to ER(-ve) breast cancer cells to CDK9 inhibition, and that these compounds represent a potential therapeutic for ER(+ve) breast cancers and possibly other MYB-dependent cancers.",,"['Mitra, Partha', 'Yang, Ren-Ming', 'Sutton, James', 'Ramsay, Robert G', 'Gonda, Thomas J']","['Mitra P', 'Yang RM', 'Sutton J', 'Ramsay RG', 'Gonda TJ']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research, Emeryville, CA, USA.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CCNE1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin B1/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin E/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",PMC4891027,,2016/01/27 06:00,2016/12/31 06:00,['2016/01/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['6997 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6997 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Feb 23;7(8):9069-83. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6997.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CDK9 inhibitors', 'MYB', 'apoptosis', 'breast cancer', 'transcription pausing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also studied links between EZH2 expression and prognosis in MDS patients. Patients with high-grade MDS exhibited lower levels of EZH2 expression than those with low-grade MDS. Low EZH2 expression was associated with high percentages of blasts, shorter survival, and increased transformation of MDS into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MDS patients frequently had reductions in EZH2 copy number. EZH2 knockdown increased tumor growth capacity and reduced H3K27me3 levels in both MDS-derived leukemia cells and in a xenograft model. H3K27me3 levels were reduced and HOX gene cluster expression was increased in MDS patients. EZH2 knockdown also increased HOX gene cluster expression by reducing H3K27me3, and H3K27 demethylating agents increased HOX gene cluster expression in MDS-derived cell lines.

The anti-leukemic effect of VPA and HU was assessed in multiple AML cell lines confirming the superior anti-leukemic effect of combination therapy. Mechanistic studies revealed that VPA amplified the ability of HU to slow S-phase progression and this correlated with significantly increased DNA damage. VPA was also shown to reduce expression of the DNA repair protein, Rad51. Interestingly, the tumour suppressor protein p53 was revealed to mitigate cell cycle recovery following combination induced arrest. The efficacy of combination therapy was validated in vivo. Combination treatment increased survival in OCI-AML3 and patient-derived xenograft mouse models of AML. Therapy response was confirmed by optical imaging with multiplexed near-infrared labelled antibodies. The combination of HU and VPA indicates significant potential in preclinical models of AML.

MDS are generally suspected in the presence of cytopenia on routine analysis and the evaluation of bone marrow cells morphology and cellularity leads to correct diagnosis of MDS. The incidence of MDS is approximately five cases per 100,000 people per year in the general population, but it increases up to 50 cases per 100,000 people per year after 60 years of age. Typically MDS affect the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 65-70 years. Here the current therapeutic approaches for MDS are evaluated by searching the PubMed database. Establishing the prognosis in MDS patients is a key element of therapy. In fact an accurate estimate of prognosis drives decisions about the choice and timing of the therapeutic options. Therapy is selected based on prognostic risk assessment, cytogenetic pattern, transfusion needs and biological characteristics of the disease, comorbidities and clinical condition of the patients. In lower-risk patients the goals of therapy are different from those in higher-risk patients. In lower-risk patients, the aim of therapy is to reduce transfusion needs and transformation to higher risk disease or AML, improving the quality of life and survival. In higher-risk patients, the main goal of therapy is to prolong survival and to reduce the risk of AML transformation. Current therapies include growth factor support, lenalidomide, immunomodulatory and hypomethylating agents, intensive chemotherapy, and allogenic stem cell transplantation.

Retrospective analyses indicate that AYAs display superior remission and survival rates when treated with a pediatric rather than an adult protocol.

The advent of arsenic trioxide has contributed to improve the anti-leukemic efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukemia. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate if dual induction by all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide could accelerate the recovery of abnormality of coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed in 103 newly-diagnosed patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Hemostatic variables and the consumption of component blood were comparably analyzed among patients treated by different induction regimen with or without arsenic trioxide. RESULTS: Compared to patients with other subtypes of de novo acute myeloid leukemia, patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia had lower platelet counts and fibrinogen levels, significantly prolonged prothrombin time and elevated D-dimers (P<0.001). Acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with high or intermediate risk prognostic stratification presented lower initial fibrinogen level than that of low-risk group (P<0.05). After induction treatment, abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia was significantly improved before day 10. The recovery of abnormal hemostatic variables (platelet, prothrombin time, fibrinogen and D-dimer) was not significantly accelerated after adding arsenic trioxide in induction regimens; and the consumption of transfused component blood (platelet and plasma) did not dramatically change either. Acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with high or intermediate risk prognostic stratification had higher platelet transfusion demands than that of low-risk group (P<0.05).

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effectively used to treat CML; however, CML patients in the advanced (CML-AP) and chronic (CML-CP) phases of the disease are usually resistant to TKI therapy. Thus, it is necessary to seek for novel agents to treat CML, such as the enzyme l-amino acid oxidase from Calloselasma rhodostoma (CR-LAAO) snake venom. We examined the antitumor effect of CR-LAAO in Bcr-Abl(+) cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy subjects and CML patients. CR-LAAO was more cytotoxic towards Bcr-Abl(+) cell lines than towards healthy subjects' PBMC. The H2O2 produced during the enzymatic action of CR-LAAO mediated its cytotoxic effect. The CR-LAAO induced apoptosis in Bcr-Abl(+) cells, as detected by caspases 3, 8, and 9 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA damage. CR-LAAO elicited apoptosis in PBMC from CML-CP patients without TKI treatment more strongly than in PBMC from healthy subjects and TKI-treated CML-CP and CML-AP patients.

Individual variability in this drug-related toxicity could be attributed in part to genetic polymorphism thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). AIM: To investigate the frequency of common TPMT polymorphisms in a cohort of Egyptian children with ALL and the possible relation between these polymorphisms and 6-MP with short-term complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 25 children. Data related to 6-MP toxicity during the maintenance phase were collected from the patients' files. DNA was isolated and genotyping for TPMT G460A, and A719G mutations were performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Twenty (80%) of the included 25 patients had a polymorphic TPMT allele. TPMT*3A was the most frequent (14/25, 56%), 8 patients were homozygous and 6 were heterozygous. TPMT*3C mutant allele was found in 4 patients (16%) in the heterozygous state while 2 patients (8%) were found to be heterozygous for TPMT*3B mutant allele. TPMT mutant patients, especially homozygous, were at greater risk of 6-MP hematological toxicity without significant difference regarding hepatic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: TPMT polymorphism was common among the studied group and was associated with increased risk of drug toxicity.

Patients were treated modified Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munster 95 protocol. Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and variables were compared using log-rank test. RESULTS: The EFS was 63.4% at a median follow-up was 32.7 months. On univariate analysis National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk stratification, sex, white blood cell count, day 8 blast clearance, and income were significantly associated with EFS. However, on multivariate analysis only female sex (P = 0.01) and day 8 blast clearance (P = 0.006) were significantly associated with EFS. Seventy-four of 238 (31%) patients had recurrent leukemia. The common sites of relapse were bone marrow in 55/74 (75%) patients and central nervous system in 11/74 (20%) patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this trial, patients at least 61 years old were centrally randomized (1:1) to receive either a single induction course of GO (6 mg/m(2) on day 1 and 3 mg/m(2) on day 8) or BSC. Patients who did not progress after GO induction could receive up to eight monthly infusions of the immunoconjugate at 2 mg/m(2). Randomization was stratified by age, WHO performance score, CD33 expression status, and center. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) by intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: A total of 237 patients were randomly assigned (118 to GO and 119 to BSC). The median OS was 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.8 months) in the GO group and 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.6 to 4.2 months) in the BSC group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.90; P = .005); the 1-year OS rate was 24.3% with GO and 9.7% with BSC. The OS benefit with GO was consistent across most subgroups, and was especially apparent in patients with high CD33 expression status, in those with favorable/intermediate cytogenetic risk profile, and in women. Overall, complete remission (CR [complete remission] + CRi [CR with incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts]) occurred in 30 of 111 (27%) GO recipients. The rates of serious adverse events (AEs) were similar in the two groups, and no excess mortality from AEs was observed with GO. CONCLUSION: First-line monotherapy with low-dose GO, as compared with BSC, significantly improved OS in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

After alloHSCT, B-cell malignancies often are treated with unmanipulated donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) from the transplant donor. DLIs frequently are not effective at eradicating malignancy and often cause graft-versus-host disease, a potentially lethal immune response against normal recipient tissues. METHODS: We conducted a clinical trial of allogeneic T cells genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting the B-cell antigen CD19. Patients with B-cell malignancies that had progressed after alloHSCT received a single infusion of CAR T cells. No chemotherapy or other therapies were administered. The T cells were obtained from each recipient's alloHSCT donor. RESULTS: Eight of 20 treated patients obtained remission, which included six complete remissions (CRs) and two partial remissions. The response rate was highest for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with four of five patients obtaining minimal residual disease-negative CR. Responses also occurred in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma. The longest ongoing CR was more than 30 months in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. New-onset acute graft-versus-host disease after CAR T-cell infusion developed in none of the patients. Toxicities included fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Peak blood CAR T-cell levels were higher in patients who obtained remissions than in those who did not. Programmed cell death protein-1 expression was significantly elevated on CAR T cells after infusion. Presence of blood B cells before CAR T-cell infusion was associated with higher postinfusion CAR T-cell levels. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR T cells can effectively treat B-cell malignancies that progress after alloHSCT. The findings point toward a future when antigen-specific T-cell therapies will play a central role in alloHSCT.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Brudno, Jennifer N', 'Somerville, Robert P T', 'Shi, Victoria', 'Rose, Jeremy J', 'Halverson, David C', 'Fowler, Daniel H', 'Gea-Banacloche, Juan C', 'Pavletic, Steven Z', 'Hickstein, Dennis D', 'Lu, Tangying L', 'Feldman, Steven A', 'Iwamoto, Alexander T', 'Kurlander, Roger', 'Maric, Irina', 'Goy, Andre', 'Hansen, Brenna G', 'Wilder, Jennifer S', 'Blacklock-Schuver, Bazetta', 'Hakim, Frances T', 'Rosenberg, Steven A', 'Gress, Ronald E', 'Kochenderfer, James N']","['Brudno JN', 'Somerville RP', 'Shi V', 'Rose JJ', 'Halverson DC', 'Fowler DH', 'Gea-Banacloche JC', 'Pavletic SZ', 'Hickstein DD', 'Lu TL', 'Feldman SA', 'Iwamoto AT', 'Kurlander R', 'Maric I', 'Goy A', 'Hansen BG', 'Wilder JS', 'Blacklock-Schuver B', 'Hakim FT', 'Rosenberg SA', 'Gress RE', 'Kochenderfer JN']","['Jennifer N.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of imatinib treatment on MF and the prognostic significance of MF at this new era of CML therapy. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 135 patients with CML who were exposed to imatinib. The grades of MF pre and post imatinib together with cytogenetic and molecular responses were evaluated. RESULTS: Severe MF (grade II-III) was observed in 44 (33%) patients prior to imatinib therapy, and in 8 (8%) after 12 months of imatinib treatment (p=0.001). The complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates at 12 months did not differ according to the pre-imatinib MF grades, and CCyR rates in patients with grades 0, I, II and III MF were 36/47 (76.5%), 26/33 (78.7%), 12/23 (52.1%) and 7/10 (70%), respectively (p=0.127). There was no significant difference between patients with or without CCyR at 12 months of imatinib regarding grades of MF (p=0.785). The distribution of the major molecular response rates at 18 months according to pre-treatment grades of MF were determined as grade 0 in 38/45 (84.4%), grade I in 21/28 (75%), grade II in 14/21 (66.6%) and grade III in 7/10 (70%) (p=0.112). There was no significant difference in overall survival rates between initial MF mild (grade 0-I) and severe (grade II-III) groups (p=0.278). CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, MF regresses with imatinib therapy over time, and the MF grades at diagnosis do not have a negative impact on the responses to imatinib treatment. Therefore, the adverse prognostic impact of the MF among patients with CML seems to disappear in the era of the TKIs.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Prior to 2009, chemotherapies were the only options for relapsed/refractory PTCL, other than hematopoietic transplants. However, chemotherapy only improves survival by about 1 month compared with palliation. Four drugs are now approved in the US to treat relapsed/refractory PTCL: pralatrexate, romidepsin, belinostat, and brentuximab vedotin (for systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma [sALCL]). Response rates with pralatrexate, romidepsin, and belinostat range from 25 to 54% in mixed relapsed/refractory PTCL populations, while 86% of sALCL patients respond to brentuximab vedotin. Here, we critically evaluate the evidence supporting the current drug treatment of relapsed/refractory PTCL, and look to the future to see how the treatment panorama may change with the advent of new targeted therapies, some of which (e.g., alisertib in PTCL and mogamulizumab in CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma) are already in phase 3 trials.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Pathological diagnosis is very difficult based on morphology if systemic signs of disease are absent. The subtype of myeloid sarcoma is also minimally identifiable in the histological picture. FINDINGS: We investigated 18 paraffin-embedded myeloid sarcoma samples, and our immunohistochemical data confirmed the relevance of some key markers for the diagnosis and subclassification of myeloid sarcoma. CD34 was found as a marker in 67% of the myeloid sarcoma cases, and CD34 was positive in all immature types of myeloid sarcoma. CD68 was found in 83% of the myeloid sarcoma cases, but CD68 was most identified in the differentiated type of myeloid sarcoma. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was positive in all myeloid sarcomas. Notably, the reactivity of MPO in the blastic subtype was much lower in myeloid sarcomas. CD117 reactivity was found in 67% of myeloid sarcomas. Ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) protein exhibited significant negative reactivity in 88% of the cases, and 5-methylcytosine (5-hmC) was significantly positive in the nucleus in 100% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that an immunohistochemical panel that included MPO, CD68 and CD34 could be used for the detection of blastic, differentiated and immature types of myeloid sarcoma. Changes in novel epigenetic regulators, including the loss of TET2 and gain of 5-hmC, as characteristics of myeloid malignancies may be useful novel markers of myeloid sarcoma.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we demonstrated a new single cell chemical proteomic (SCCP) strategy with a membrane-permeable activity-based probe (ABP) to characterize the functional proteins in lysosome located in the cytosol. The ABP targeted to the cysteine cathepsin family protein, CpFABP-G, was designed for cysteine cathepsins labeling. The labeled HeLa cell of a cancer cell line was injected into a capillary and was lysed by SDS solution with heating. The lysate was then online readout by capillary electrophoresis-laser-induced fluorescence method. Due to the employment of highly specified ABP kicking out the uncorrelated proteins, the expression of cysteine cathepsins in individual HeLa cells was easily detected, and heterogeneity among those HeLa cells was readily discriminated. Further work was concentrated on SCCP analysis of the mouse leukemia cell of monocyte macrophage (RAW264.7). It was for the first time identifying two expression modes of cysteine cathepsins in RAW264.7, which could be undermined by the analysis of cell populations.

We developed a high-throughput screening method based on a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTS-TR-FRET) assay, using the C-terminal domain (CTD) of HIV-1 capsid to identify inhibitors of capsid dimerization. This assay was used to screen a library of pharmacologically active compounds, composed of 1,280in vivo-active drugs, and identified ebselen [2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one], an organoselenium compound, as an inhibitor of HIV-1 capsid CTD dimerization. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis confirmed the direct interaction of ebselen with the HIV-1 capsid CTD and dimer dissociation when ebselen is in 2-fold molar excess. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed that ebselen covalently binds the HIV-1 capsid CTD, likely via a selenylsulfide linkage with Cys198 and Cys218. This compound presents anti-HIV activity in single and multiple rounds of infection in permissive cell lines as well as in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Ebselen inhibits early viral postentry events of the HIV-1 life cycle by impairing the incoming capsid uncoating process. This compound also blocks infection of other retroviruses, such as Moloney murine leukemia virus and simian immunodeficiency virus, but displays no inhibitory activity against hepatitis C and influenza viruses. This study reports the use of TR-FRET screening to successfully identify a novel capsid inhibitor, ebselen, validating HIV-1 capsid as a promising target for drug development.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

It can be divided into various subtypes with different phenotypes and prognoses. Here, we report on the clinical characteristics of 136 SM patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2009 to September 2014 in a large tertiary centre in The Netherlands. We included all patients who fulfilled WHO criteria for SM. Data were collected from electronic patient files. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients had indolent SM (ISM) (91.2%), 7 had aggressive SM (ASM) (5.1%) and 5 had SM with associated hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD) (3.7%). There was no progression from ISM to advanced SM subtypes, but 1 patient with ASM developed chronic myelocytic leukemia 2years after diagnosis. The average time to diagnosis for the whole population was 8.1years (range, 0-49years). The most frequent triggers for work-up-skin involvement, anaphylaxis and osteoporosis-were characterized by an interval to diagnosis of 10.9, 2.9 and 7.5years, respectively. A total of 32 patients (23.5%) had a serum tryptase levels below the cutoff value of 20ng/mL at the time of diagnosis, but these patients did not have significant differences in clinical phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: SM comprises a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms and its often atypical presentation can delay the establishment of the diagnosis substantially. Skin involvement, anaphylaxis and unexplained osteoporosis should trigger analysis for mastocytosis. A normal serum tryptase does not exclude the diagnosis of SM.","['Copyright (c) 2016 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by', 'Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of short-wave ultraviolet (UVB) radiation on the membrane electrical properties, phospholipid content, and lipid peroxidation levels of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Changes in cell function may affect the basal electrical surface properties of cell membranes. These changes can be detected using electrokinetic measurements. In this study, the surface charge densities of fibroblasts and keratinocytes were measured as a function of pH. A four-component equilibrium model was used to describe the interaction between the ions in solution and on cell membrane surfaces. Agreement was found between the experimental and theoretical charge variation curves of leukemia cells from pH 2.5 to pH 9. Phospholipid composition was determined qualitatively and quantitatively by HPLC, and lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring the level of malondialdehyde.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cellular response to LDIR was compared and contrasted using immortalized human Epstein-Barr virus-infected B-cells (EBV-B) in mono-culture, co-culture with human bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC), or under the LDIR-induced bystander effect. The resulting alterations in protein and gene expression (including microRNA, miRNA) were evaluated by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomics assay, western blot, cDNA array and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. RESULTS: The miRNAs let7a, miR-15b, miR-16, and miR-21, and a lipid metabolic miRNA hub miR-23b, were upregulated after LDIR exposure in the mono-cultured EBV-B cells, but were downregulated in EBV-B cells co-irradiated with MSC. A lipid biosynthesis enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, the common target of these miRNA, was downregulated at the level of protein and mRNA expression in the LDIR-exposed, mono-cultured EBV-B cells and upregulated MSC co-cultured EBV-B cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a putative miRNA regulatory mechanism controlling the LDIR-induced stress response, and illustrate that LDIR exposure, and the cell's microenvironment, can affect specific gene expression, both directly and indirectly, resulting in altered protein expression.",,"['Tabe, Yoko', 'Hatanaka, Yasuhito', 'Nakashiro, Mayumi', 'Sekihara, Kazumasa', 'Yamamoto, Shinichi', 'Matsushita, Hiromichi', 'Kazuno, Saiko', 'Fujimura, Tsutomu', 'Ikegami, Takako', 'Nakanaga, Keita', 'Matsumoto, Hirotaka', 'Ueno, Takashi', 'Aoki, Junken', 'Yokomizo, Takehiko', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Miida, Takashi', 'Iwabuchi, Kazuhisa', 'Sasai, Keisuke']","['Tabe Y', 'Hatanaka Y', 'Nakashiro M', 'Sekihara K', 'Yamamoto S', 'Matsushita H', 'Kazuno S', 'Fujimura T', 'Ikegami T', 'Nakanaga K', 'Matsumoto H', 'Ueno T', 'Aoki J', 'Yokomizo T', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'Miida T', 'Iwabuchi K', 'Sasai K']","['a Department of Laboratory Medicine , Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'i Department of Leukemia , the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , Texas , USA ;', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'b Department of Radiology , Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'k Leading Center for the Development and Research of Cancer Medicine , Juntendo University , Tokyo , Japan.', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'k Leading Center for the Development and Research of Cancer Medicine , Juntendo University , Tokyo , Japan.', 'c Department of Laboratory Medicine , Tokai University School of Medicine , Kanagawa ;', 'd BioMedical Research Center, Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'd BioMedical Research Center, Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'e Laboratory of Bioanalytical Chemistry , Tohoku Pharmaceutical University , Miyagi ;', 'f Laboratory of Molecular and Biochemical Research , Research Support Center, Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'g Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Tohoku University , Miyagi ;', 'g Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Tohoku University , Miyagi ;', 'd BioMedical Research Center, Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'g Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Tohoku University , Miyagi ;', 'h Department of Biochemistry (I) , Juntendo University , Tokyo , Japan ;', 'i Department of Leukemia , the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , Texas , USA ;', 'i Department of Leukemia , the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , Texas , USA ;', 'a Department of Laboratory Medicine , Juntendo University , Tokyo ;', 'j Research Institute for Environmental and Gender Specific Medicine, Juntendo University , Tokyo , Japan .', 'b Department of Radiology , Juntendo University , Tokyo ;']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,['EC 2.3.1.15 (Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*physiology/radiation effects/*virology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Systems Integration']",,,2016/01/27 06:00,2016/06/01 06:00,['2016/01/27 06:00'],"['2016/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553002.2015.1106021 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2016;92(1):24-34. doi: 10.3109/09553002.2015.1106021.

Emerging evidence suggests that constitutive activation of various signaling pathways like mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK-Erk) signaling plays a role in the heterogeneous clinical outcome of CLL patients. In this study, we have investigated the role of Sprouty (SPRY)2 as a negative regulator of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase signaling in the pathogenesis of CLL. We show that SPRY2 expression is significantly decreased in CLL cells, particularly from poor-prognosis patients compared with those from good-prognosis patients. Overexpression of SPRY2 in CLL cells from poor-prognosis patients increased their apoptosis. Conversely, downregulation of SPRY2 in CLL cells from good-prognosis patients resulted in increased proliferation. Furthermore, CLL cells with low SPRY2 expression grew more rapidly in a xenograft model of CLL. Strikingly, B-cell-specific transgenic overexpression of spry2 in mice led to a decrease in the frequency of B1 cells, the precursors of CLL cells in rodents. Mechanistically, we show that SPRY2 attenuates the B-cell receptor (BCR) and MAPK-Erk signaling by binding to and antagonizing the activities of RAF1, BRAF, and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) in normal B cells and CLL cells. We also show that SPRY2 is targeted by microRNA-21, which in turn leads to increased activity of Syk and Erk in CLL cells. Taken together, these results establish SPRY2 as a critical negative regulator of BCR-mediated MAPK-Erk signaling in CLL, thereby providing one of the molecular mechanisms to explain the clinical heterogeneity of CLL.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Shukla, Ashima', 'Rai, Karan', 'Shukla, Vipul', 'Chaturvedi, Nagendra K', 'Bociek, R Gregory', 'Pirruccello, Samuel J', 'Band, Hamid', 'Lu, Runqing', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Shukla A', 'Rai K', 'Shukla V', 'Chaturvedi NK', 'Bociek RG', 'Pirruccello SJ', 'Band H', 'Lu R', 'Joshi SS']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Oncology and Hematology.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, College of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, Department of Pathology and Microbiology, College of Medicine, and Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Disease, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA087986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (SPRY2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Braf protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Spry2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Syk Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4865588,,2016/01/27 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/01/27 06:00'],"['2015/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30182-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-09-669317 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 May 12;127(19):2310-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-09-669317.

Febrile neutropenia (FN) represents an oncologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. Resulting chemotherapy dose reductions or delays may compromise disease control and survival. While non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a potentially curable malignancy, there are limited data on the risk of neutropenic complications. This review represents a systematic search and evidence summary of neutropenic complications reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published over the past decade in adults with NHL receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. AREAS COVERED: Data captured include the chemotherapy regimen and dosing, the type of NHL, sample size, myeloid growth factor (MGF) use, and myelosuppression including FN and severe neutropenia and infection. EXPERT OPINION: Rates of neutropenic complications for commonly utilized chemotherapy regimens vary considerably across studies with FN reported in only one-fourth of study arms. Further challenges in interpreting reported rates are the variable and inconsistent use of MGF support and little or no information on delivered chemotherapy dose intensity. Considerable change in regimens, study populations and reporting of neutropenic events as well as the use of MGF was observed over the decade of RCTs reported. Complete and accurate reporting of treatment-related toxicities in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy is essential in both clinical trials and clinical practice.",,"['Lyman, Gary H', 'Poniewierski, Marek S', 'Culakova, Eva']","['Lyman GH', 'Poniewierski MS', 'Culakova E']","['a Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'b Department of Medicine , University of Washington School of Medicine , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'a Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'a Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/metabolism', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk']",,,2016/01/26 06:00,2016/12/28 06:00,['2016/01/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740338.2016.1146675 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2016;15(4):483-92. doi: 10.1517/14740338.2016.1146675.

Its anti-cancer activity is among the current topics for novel cancer treatment. Here, effects of RSV on cell proliferation and the sphingolipid metabolism of K562, a human leukemia cell line, were analyzed. Some experiments were also performed in HCT116, a human colon cancer cell line. RSV inhibited cell proliferation of both cell lines. Increased cellular ceramide and decreased sphingomyelin and S1P by RSV were observed in RSV-treated K562 cells. Further analysis revealed that acid sphingomyelinase mRNA and enzyme activity levels were increased by RSV. Desipramine, a functional ASMase inhibitor, prevented RSV-induced ceramide increase. RSV increased ATF3, EGR1, EGR3 proteins and phosphorylated c-Jun and FOXO3. However, co-transfection using these transcription factor expression vectors and ASMase promoter reporter vector revealed positive effects of EGR1 and EGR3 but not others. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated the direct binding of EGR1/3 transcription factors with ASMase 5'-promoter.

Suppressor of AP-1 regulated by interferon (SARI) has tumor-selective growth inhibitory effect. However, it's unclear whether SARI is involved in the Dex-mediated lymphoma growth suppression. In this study, we found that Dex-treated B lymphoma tissues had a higher level of SARI. Dex repressed the growth of B lymphoma cells and upregulated SARI expression by activating glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of SARI attenuated the Dex-mediated growth suppression of B lymphoma cells and inhibition of AP-1 activity. Reporter assays revealed that activation of GR enhanced the transcriptional activity of SARI promoter. EMSA and ChIP assays showed that GR directly bound to the ER9 element in SARI promoter region. These results for the first time demonstrated that SARI is a novel target gene of GR, and the upregulation of SARI plays an important role in Dex's killing effect on B lymphoma cells, suggesting that SARI may serve as a novel target and a potential indicator of Dex sensitivity in B lymphoma treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The graft contained a median of 9 x 10(6)/kg of CD34+ and 20 x 10(3)/kg of alphabeta-T cells. Post-transplant immune suppression included tacrolimus till day +30 and Mtx in 21 patients, tacrolimus in 5, Mtx in 2 and no prophylaxis in 5 patients. Sixteen patients received native or TCR-alpha/beta-depleted donor lymphocytes at a median of 47 (40-204) days. Median follow-up is 1.76 years. Primary engraftment was achieved in 33 patients (100%). Cumulative incidence of acute GvHD (aGvHD) grade 2-3 was 39 (26-60)%, half of them had skin-only aGvHD. Cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD was 30(18-50)%. Transplant-related mortality is 10(4-26)%. Event-free survival (EFS) is 60(43-76)% and overall survival (OS) is 67(50-84)% at 2 years. In a subgroup of patients, who received transplantation in CR, EFS is 66(48-84)% and OS-72(53-90)% at 2 years.

We report the outcome of high-risk leukemia children transplanted with a new way of managing cyclosporine (CsA)-based GvHD prophylaxis. A total of 110 HSCT in 109 ALL or AML children who received CsA without mycophenolate or methotrexate in matched related as well as in matched or mismatched unrelated stem cell transplantation were included. CsA dosage regimens were individualized to obtain specific trough blood concentrations values. The incidences of grade I-II and III-IV acute GvHD were 69.1% and 1.8%, respectively, and 8.4% for chronic GvHD. GvHD was neither more frequent nor severe in unrelated than in related HSCT. GvHD occurred in 87% of patients with a mean CsA trough concentration 120 ng/mL versus 43% with concentration >120 ng/mL (P<0.0001). Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival were 78% and 83.6%, respectively. DFS was 76.9% for ALL and 80.4% for AML patients. There was no difference in DFS between matched siblings and matched unrelated or mismatched unrelated HSCT. DFS in patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) 10(-3) and in those with MRD <10(-3) before SCT was comparable.

Patients were identified from the registry of the Hong Kong Pediatric Hematology and Oncology study group. RESULTS: This cohort included a total of 29 patients with DS. Ten were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 19 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mean follow-up duration was 8.3 years (range, 0.6 mo to 18.1 y). The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival for DS-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and DS-AML were 65.6%, 54.9%, 89.5%, and 89.5%, respectively.

The system is based on four different FLT3 inhibitors, namely midostaurin, sorafenib, lestaurtinib, and quizartinib, which were independently loaded onto gelatin-coated gold nanoparticles. Detailed investigation of the physicochemical properties of the formed complexes lead to the selection of quizartinib-loaded AuNPs for the in vitro evaluation of the biological effects of the formed complex against OCI-AML3 acute myeloid leukemia cells. Viability tests by MTT demonstrated that the proposed drug complex has improved efficacy when compared with the drug alone. The obtained results constitute a premise for further in vivo investigation of such drug vehicles based on AuNPs.

Ten years of development of histone deacetylase inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.,307-17,10.1517/13543784.2016.1146251 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: Epigenetic changes and mutations in epigenetic modifiers characterize and likely drive many cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Development of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors has been most successful in these diseases. While many epigenetic marks are potential targets of cancer therapies, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have undergone the most advanced development to date. AREA COVERED: In this review, the authors describe and discuss the biology and the clinical results of HDAC inhibitors in the settings of myeloid malignancies. EXPERT OPINION: While significant results have been achieved in lymphoma and myeloma, efficacy remains limited in myeloid malignancies for both single agent and HDACi based combination regimens. The redundancy and the pleiotropic activity of HDACi (on both histone and non-histone proteins) are key factors that have limited to date the selection of patients and the design of robust biomarkers. Recent advances in biology (mechanisms of resistance, immunology) and the design of a more specific third generation of HDACi are two important features that will drive the future clinical development of HDACi in myeloid malignancies.",,"['Stahl, Maximilian', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Prebet, Thomas']","['Stahl M', 'Gore SD', 'Vey N', 'Prebet T']","['a Department of Internal Medicine , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'b Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'c Hematology Department , Institut Paoli-Calmettes and Aix-Marseille Universite , Marseille , France.', 'b Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Design', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Patient Selection']",,,2016/01/26 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2016/01/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2016.1146251 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2016;25(3):307-17. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2016.1146251.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Epigenetics', 'HDACi', 'HDACi based combination therapy', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors', 'Hypomethylating agents', 'Immunotherapy', 'MDS', 'Vorinostat', 'myeloid malignancies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression levels of LIF are regulated by many different factors under different conditions in different tissue/cell types. For example, estrogen and p53 are important regulators for the high LIF production in uterine tissues at the implantation stage. Hypoxia plays a critical role in LIF overexpression in solid tumors.

The objective of this study was to assess whether the 6936A/G SNP of the EPCR gene is involved in the procoagulant activity displayed by hematological malignancies. EPCR 6936A/G polymorphism analysis was performed in 205 patients with hematological malignancies and in 63 healthy controls. All the subjects were genotyped for the EPCR 6936A/G SNP (AA, AG and GG genotypes). The 6936A/G polymorphism distribution was similar between healthy donors and patients. The association between EPCR 6936A/G SNP and thrombosis was investigated in 110 patients. The disease-wise break-up revealed that 55 of the patients suffered from acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In AML patients, the incidence of thrombosis was 28.3% and significantly higher in the 6936AG compared with that in the 6936AA genotype (50 vs. 22%, respectively). In conclusion, this study revealed a significant association of the 6936AG genotype of EPCR with thrombotic events in AML.

This study aimed to examine the proteomic responses to ALS treatment and unveil the molecular interactome and possible mechanisms for its anticancer effect in K562 cells using stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) approach. The proteomic data identified that ALS treatment modulated the expression of 1541 protein molecules (570 up; 971 down). The pathway analysis showed that 299 signaling pathways and 459 cellular functional proteins directly responded to ALS treatment in K562 cells. These targeted molecules and signaling pathways were mainly involved in cell growth and proliferation, cell metabolism, and cell survival and death. Subsequently, the effects of ALS on cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and autophagy were verified. The flow cytometric analysis showed that ALS significantly induced G2/M phase arrest and the Western blotting assays showed that ALS induced apoptosis via mitochondria-dependent pathway and promoted autophagy with the involvement of PI3K/Akt/mTOR, p38 MAPK, and AMPK signaling pathways in K562 cells.

We evaluated the relationship between bone marrow radiation doses and clinical characteristics and survival of 79 CLL cases diagnosed during 1986-2006 in a cohort of 110 645 male workers who participated in the cleanup work of the Chornobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine in 1986. All diagnoses were confirmed by an independent International Hematology Panel. Patients were followed up to the date of death or end of follow-up on 31 October 2010. The median age at diagnosis was 57 years. Median bone marrow dose was 22.6 milligray (mGy) and was not associated with time between exposure and clinical diagnosis of CLL (latent period), age, peripheral blood lymphocyte count or clinical stage of disease in univariate and multivariate analyses. Latent period was significantly shorter among those older at first exposure, smokers and those with higher frequency of visits to the doctor prior to diagnosis. A significant increase in the risk of death with increasing radiation dose was observed (p = 0.03, hazard ratio = 2.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.11,5.08 comparing those with doses >/=22 mGy to doses <22 mGy). After adjustment for radiation dose, survival of CLL cases was significantly shorter among those with younger age at first exposure, higher peripheral blood lymphocyte count, more advanced clinical stage of disease and older age at diagnosis (all p < 0.05). This is the first study to examine association between bone marrow radiation doses from the Chornobyl accident and clinical manifestations of the CLL in Chornobyl cleanup workers.

METHODS: We established stable Jurkat-siTal1 and Jurkat-T1 cell lines by trasnfecting T-ALL Jurkat cells with lentiviral vectors to knock-down or overexpress Tal1. Jurkat cells transfected with negative control siRNAs for Tal1 knock-down (Jurkat-mock1) and over-expression(Jurkat-mock2) served as the control cells. The proliferation of the cells lines was assessed using CCK-8 assay, and the cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expressions of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 (CDKN2A) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN2B) were measured by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: Jurkat-T1 cells showed more active proliferation in vitro than Jurkat-mock2 cells, while Jurkat-siTal1 cells showed slower growth than Jurkat-mock1 cells. In Jurkat-T1 cells, G0/G1 phase cells were decreased and S phase cells increased compared with Jurkat-mock2 cells, and Jurkat-siTal1 cells showed increased G0/G1 phase cells and decreased S phase cells compared with Jurkat-mock1 cells. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that Tal1 inhibited the cellular expression of CDKN2A and CDKN2B at both mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: Tal1 promotes the growth and the transition from G0/G1 phase to S phase in T-ALL cells Jurkat by inhibiting the expressions of G0/G1 and S phase negative regulatory proteins CDKN2A and CDKN2B.",,"['Wang, Yi', 'Shu, Yi', 'Yuan, Juntao', 'Chen, Hui', 'Zou, Lin']","['Wang Y', 'Shu Y', 'Yuan J', 'Chen H', 'Zou L']","[""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University/Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders/Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing/Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China.E-mail: 641807153@qq.com.""]",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lentivirus', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",,,2016/01/26 06:00,2016/04/27 06:00,['2016/01/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2016 Jan;36(1):78-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular signalling pathways involved in cell migration are important to understand cancer cell metastasis. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of CXCL12 induced cell migration and the importance of different signalling cascades that become activated by CXCR4 in leukemic cells versus breast cancer cells. We identified Src kinase as being essential for cell migration in both cancer types, with strong involvement of the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway. We did not detect any involvement of Ras or JAK2/STAT3 in CXCL12 induced migration in Jurkat cells. Preventing PKC activation with inhibitors does not affect migration in Jurkat cells at all, unlike in the adherent breast cancer cell line MCF-7 cells. However, in both cell lines, knock down of PKCalpha prevents migration towards CXCL12, whereas the expression of PKCzeta is less crucial for migration. PI3K activation is essential in both cell types, however LY294002 usage in MCF-7 cells does not block migration significantly.

The presence of differences in chromosomal content of cells within the same individual is known as chromosomal mosaicism. The impact of mosaic pattern on the prognosis of MDS has been unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of mosaic pattern on the survival of patients with MDS. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 119 patients diagnosed with MDS at the Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology. Giemsa-Trypsin-Giemsa banding was used to evaluate chromosomal abnormality. The effect of chromosomal abnormality mosaicism on overall survival and transformation to acute leukemia was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 66.3years, and the mean disease duration was 24.2months. Chromosomal abnormality was observed in 32.5% of patients. Patients with chromosomal abnormalities comprising at least 50% metaphases had significantly lower overall survival than patients with abnormality comprising up to 50% of all abnormal metaphases (p=.003). There were no differences in transformation to acute leukemia among patients with higher and lower chromosomal mosaicism (p=.056). CONCLUSION: The most important outcome of this study was to demonstrate worse overall survival rates in MDS patients with higher abnormal chromosomal mosaicism than patients with lesser abnormal chromosomal mosaicism. Higher levels of abnormal chromosomal mosaicism did not predict transformation to acute leukemia. The cause of worse outcomes of patients with higher abnormal chromosomal mosaicism may be related to clonal mass.","['Copyright (c) 2016 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

M3v blasts often have folded nuclei, but unlike traditional APL blasts, they often possess faint granules without Auer rods. In addition, microgranular APL often presents with an elevated or normal white blood cell count in contrast with the leukopenia seen in traditional APL. In APL, delayed diagnosis can lead to early death from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is the main cause of mortality in an otherwise treatable, and often curable, leukemia. We describe a 19-year-old male with microgranular APL who presented with leukopenia and many blasts resembling non-APL AML blasts with an unexpected immunophenotypic pattern. He was treated for DIC and initiated on all-trans-retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide; he achieved complete molecular remission after induction therapy. Suspicion for APL should always remain high in the presence of clinical manifestations of the disease in order that appropriate treatment can be initiated rapidly to prevent early death.","['Copyright (c) 2016 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

Its antitumor activity was evaluated in cell culture and in mouse models of pancreatic cancer. DHA-dFdC is a poorly soluble, pale yellow waxy solid, with a molecular mass of 573.3Da and a melting point of about 96 degrees C. The activation energy for the degradation of DHA-dFdC in an aqueous Tween 80-based solution is 12.86kcal/mol, whereas its stability is significantly higher in the presence of vitamin E. NCI-60 DTP Human Tumor Cell Line Screening revealed that DHA-dFdC has potent and broad-spectrum antitumor activity, especially in leukemia, renal, and central nervous system cancer cell lines. In human and murine pancreatic cancer cell lines, the IC50 value of DHA-dFdC was up to 10(5)-fold lower than that of dFdC. The elimination of DHA-dFdC in mouse plasma appeared to follow a biexponential model, with a terminal phase t1/2 of about 58minutes. DHA-dFdC significantly extended the survival of genetically engineered mice that spontaneously develop pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In nude mice with subcutaneously implanted human Panc-1 pancreatic tumors, the antitumor activity of DHA-dFdC was significantly stronger than the molar equivalent of dFdC alone, DHA alone, or the physical mixture of them (1:1, molar ratio). DHA-dFdC also significantly inhibited the growth of Panc-1 tumors orthotopically implanted in the pancreas of nude mice, whereas the molar equivalent dose of dFdC alone did not show any significant activity. DHA-dFdC is a promising compound for the potential treatment of cancers in organs such as the pancreas.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Institut National de la Sante Et de la Recherche Medicale.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the study was to present the experience of a single centre in the surgical treatment of pulmonary IFI. Between 1992 and 2014, 50 haematological patients with IFI underwent pulmonary resection. In 27 cases it was an emergency procedure to avoid haemoptysis (if the lesion threatened pulmonary vessels). The remaining 23 patients underwent elective surgery before new chemotherapy or stem-cell transplantation. Among these patients (median age: 54 years; range: 5-70 years), 92% had acute leukaemia and 68% were on haematological first-line therapy (receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapies). Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and pulmonary mucormycosis were diagnosed in 37 and 12 patients, respectively. One patient had IFI due to Trichoderma longibrachiatum. All of the patients received antifungal agents. In the month preceding IFI diagnosis, 94% of patients had been neutropenic. At the time of surgery, 30% of patients were still neutropenic and 54% required platelet transfusions. Lobectomy or segmentectomy were performed in 80% and 20% of cases, respectively. Mortality at 30 and 90 days post-surgery was 6% and 10%, respectively. After surgery, median overall survival was 21 months; median overall survival was similar between patients with emergency or elective surgery and between the types of IFI (invasive pulmonary aspergillosis or pulmonary mucormycosis). However, overall survival was far better in haematological first-line patients or in those achieving a haematological complete response than in other patients (p <0.001). In pulmonary IFI, lung resection could be an effective complement to medical treatment in selected haematological patients.","['Copyright (c) 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious', 'Diseases.

Although consequences of transfusional iron overload are best described in thalassemia major and related inherited anemias, they are increasingly recognized in acquired conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Iron overload in MDS not only impacts on certain tissues, but may affect the clonal evolution of MDS through generation of reactive oxygen species. Iron overload may also influence hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation outcomes. Novel MRI methods for assessing body iron have impacted significantly on outcome in inherited anemias by allowing monitoring of iron burden and iron chelation therapy. This approach is increasingly being used in MDS and stem-cell-transplant procedures.

The aim of this study was to clone and express of GRA7 protein of T. gondii and evaluate its potential for immunodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis in cancer patients. As well as validate the results using a new molecular assay, LAMP technique. The GRA7 gene was successfully cloned, expressed and purified by affinity chromatography and the production was evaluated by SDS PAGE, dot blot and western blot analyses. The rGRA7 was used for developing an ELISA based on the rGRA7 using sera from patients with toxoplasmosis and healthy controls. Furthermore, 50 serum samples from leukemic children infected with toxoplasmosis and 50 seronegative controls were included to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of rGRA7 based ELISA. Finally, the LAMP technique was used to assess the accuracy and validity of the results obtained by rGRA7 based ELISA. The consistency of the results of two tests was determined by using the Kappa coefficient of agreement. The rGRA7 showed higher and optimum immunoreactivity with 1:100 dilution of serum from Toxoplasma infected patients. The sensitivity and specificity of test were calculated as 92 and 94%, respectively. According to the Kappa coefficient of agreement, there was a significant conformance between the results obtained by ELISA based on the rGRA7 and the results of LAMP technique ( approximately 96%, P<0.001).

METHODS: In this study, 48 fathers who visited a university hospital in Seoul, Korea and who gave written consent completed the questionnaire between September 23 and November 19, 2013. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple regression. RESULTS: The level of distress in fathers of chronically ill children was relatively high and the majority of them were experiencing posttraumatic growth. Models including the variable (deliberate rumination, religiousness, optimism) explained 64.3% (F=26.38, p<.001) of the variance for posttraumatic growth. Deliberate rumination (beta=.59, p<.001) was the most influential factor. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that it is essential for nurses to intervene and facilitate continuously so as to promote posttraumatic growth and relieve distress in fathers of chronically ill children.

Radiation exposure is linked to risk. Thyroid nodules in children have a high risk for malignancy, whether spontaneous or after radiation. Due to the extremely limited available paediatric data, we sought to review a series of patients with thyroid carcinoma, seen over 25 years. Forty-six patients were identified. Thirty-nine (84.8 %) had papillary thyroid carcinoma, five (10.9 %) follicular carcinoma and 2 (4.3 %) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MEN2B). Thirty-three (71.7 %) had childhood radiation exposure (17 females) with thyroid malignancy occurring 6-37 years later. The smallest nodule size found on surveillance to have thyroid malignancy was 4 mm. Thyroid cancer in patients 16 years and under was seen in 22 patients (47.8 %). All had total thyroidectomy, with initial central node clearance from 2005. Diagnostic rTSH stimulated I(123) scan was followed by ablative I(131) if any uptake was seen. Sixteen (32.6 %) had metastases. Twenty-four (52.2 %) had I(131), four requiring multiple courses. Forty-two remain alive and well. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound screening is required for early diagnosis as small nodule size is not predictive of benign histology or absence of metastases. Central node clearance provides better outcome. Despite metastatic disease at presentation for some, prognosis is favourable. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing and radiation exposure in childhood cancer survivors is clearly linked to risk. * Published guidelines in many places can only provide very low level evidence due to extremely limited available paediatric data. What is New: * Paper provides good evidence to confirm existing views with the largest cohort of thyroid cancer reported to date in the paediatric age group in Australia, and the largest cohort in Australia where there have been specific high risks of radiation exposure. The only other reported larger studies have come from the Children's Oncology Group and Childhood Cancer Survivor Study [24]. * Using diagnostic rTSH stimulated I(123) scan 6 weeks after surgery helps to determine if radioactive iodine ablation is necessary and limits unnecessary bone marrow exposure for young patients in whom future leukaemia is of greater concern.",,"['Ho, Wei Li Cindy', 'Zacharin, Margaret R']","['Ho WL', 'Zacharin MR']","[""Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, 3052, Victoria, Australia. cindy_ho@nuhs.edu.sg."", ""Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, Singapore, 119074, Singapore. cindy_ho@nuhs.edu.sg."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Rd, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia. cindy_ho@nuhs.edu.sg."", ""Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, 3052, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thyroid Gland/diagnostic imaging/*radiation effects', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/01/26 06:00,2017/01/14 06:00,['2016/01/26 06:00'],"['2015/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00431-016-2692-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00431-016-2692-z [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2016 May;175(5):677-83. doi: 10.1007/s00431-016-2692-z.

Many haematologic malignancies exhibit elevated or aberrant mTOR activation, supporting the launch of numerous clinical trials aimed at evaluating the potential of single agent mTOR-targeted therapies. While promising early clinical data using allosteric mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and its derivatives, rapalogs) have suggested activity in a subset of haematologic malignancies, these agents have shown limited efficacy in most contexts. Whether the efficacy of these partial mTOR inhibitors might be enhanced by more complete target inhibition is being actively addressed with second generation ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors (TOR-KIs), which have only recently entered clinical trials. However, emerging preclinical data suggest that despite their biochemical advantage over rapalogs, TOR-KIs may retain a primarily cytostatic response. Rather, combinations of mTOR inhibition with other targeted therapies have demonstrated promising efficacy in several preclinical models. This review investigates the current status of rapalogs and TOR-KIs in B cell malignancies, with an emphasis on emerging preclinical evidence of synergistic combinations involving mTOR inhibition.",['(c) 2016 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Lee, Jong-Hoon Scott', 'Vo, Thanh-Trang', 'Fruman, David A']","['Lee JS', 'Vo TT', 'Fruman DA']","['Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, USA. dfruman@uci.edu.']",['eng'],"['R21 HD081319/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR001415/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001414/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA189629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA158383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC5061788,,2016/01/26 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2016/01/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.12888 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2016 Nov;82(5):1213-1228. doi: 10.1111/bcp.12888.

Among several regulatory/accessory genes in HTLV-1, HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is the only viral gene constitutively expressed in infected cells. Our previous study showed that HBZ functions in two different molecular forms, HBZ protein and HBZ RNA. In this study, we show that HBZ protein targets retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which is a critical tumor suppressor in many types of cancers. HBZ protein interacts with the Rb/E2F-1 complex and activates the transcription of E2F-target genes associated with cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Mouse primary CD4(+) T cells transduced with HBZ show accelerated G1/S transition and apoptosis, and importantly, T cells from HBZ transgenic (HBZ-Tg) mice also demonstrate enhanced cell proliferation and apoptosis. To evaluate the functions of HBZ protein alone in vivo, we generated a new transgenic mouse strain that expresses HBZ mRNA altered by silent mutations but encoding intact protein. In these mice, the numbers of effector/memory and Foxp3(+) T cells were increased, and genes associated with proliferation and apoptosis were upregulated. This study shows that HBZ protein promotes cell proliferation and apoptosis in primary CD4(+) T cells through activation of the Rb/E2F pathway, and that HBZ protein also confers onto CD4(+) T-cell immunophenotype similar to those of ATL cells, suggesting that HBZ protein has important roles in dysregulation of CD4(+) T cells infected with HTLV-1.",,"['Kawatsuki, A', 'Yasunaga, J-I', 'Mitobe, Y', 'Green, P L', 'Matsuoka, M']","['Kawatsuki A', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Mitobe Y', 'Green PL', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research and Departments of Veterinary Biosciences and Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/virology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",PMC4959989,['NIHMS795079'],2016/01/26 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/01/26 06:00'],"['2015/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2015510 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.510 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Aug 25;35(34):4509-17. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.510.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is highly expressed in leukaemia cells from the majority of paediatric patients with B-lineage ALL (pre-B ALL). CTGF is a matricellular protein and plays a role in aggressive cancers. Here we have genetically engineered leukaemia cells to modulate CTGF expression levels. Elevated CTGF levels accelerated disease dissemination and reduced survival in NOD/SCID mice. In vitro studies showed that CTGF protein induces stromal cell proliferation, promotes adhesion of leukaemia cells to stromal cells and leads to overexpression of genes associated with cell cycle and synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM). Corresponding data from our leukaemia xenograft models demonstrated that CTGF leads to increased proliferation of non-leukaemia cells and deposition of ECM in the bone marrow. We document for the first time a functional role of CTGF in altering disease progression in a lymphoid malignancy.

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study including 1157 cases with HMs. Firstly, we screened and verified the independent risk factors associated with post-chemotherapy adverse events by both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis using 70 % of randomly selected cases (training set). Secondly, we proposed a mathematical model based on those selected factors. The calibration and discrimination of the model were assessed by Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, respectively. Lastly, the predicative power of this model was further tested in the remaining 30 % of cases (validation set). RESULTS: Our statistical analysis indicated that liver dysfunction (OR = 2.164), active infection (OR = 3.619), coagulation abnormalities (OR = 4.614), intensity of chemotherapy (OR = 10.001), acute leukemia (OR = 2.185), and obesity (OR = 1.604) were independent risk factors for post-chemotherapy adverse events in HM patients (all P < 0.05). Based on the verified risk factors, a predictive model was proposed. This model had good discrimination and calibration. When 0.648 was selected as the cutoff point, the sensitivity and specificity of this predictive model in validation sets was 72.7 and 87.4 %, respectively. Furthermore, this proposed model's positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and consistency rate were 87.3, 73.0 and 80.0 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that this six risk factor-based mathematical model is accurate and sufficient enough to predict definite post-chemotherapy adverse events in a HM patient and it may aid clinicians to optimize treatment for a HM patient.",,"['Fei, Xiaoming', 'Lei, Fang', 'Zhang, Haifeng', 'Lu, Hua', 'Zhu, Yan', 'Tang, Yu']","['Fei X', 'Lei F', 'Zhang H', 'Lu H', 'Zhu Y', 'Tang Y']","[""Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Jiangsu University, 438# Jiefang Road, 212001, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Hematology Research Institute, Jiangsu University, 438# Jiefang Road, Zhenjiang, 212001, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Jiangsu University, 438# Jiefang Road, 212001, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 140# Hanzhong Road, Nanjing, 210029, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 140# Hanzhong Road, Nanjing, 210029, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Jiangsu University, 438# Jiefang Road, 212001, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Jiangsu University, 438# Jiefang Road, 212001, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China. feixiaomingujs@aliyun.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/01/25 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/01/25 06:00'],"['2015/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00520-016-3085-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-016-3085-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Jun;24(6):2727-33. doi: 10.1007/s00520-016-3085-6.

We found that iron chelators displayed significant antiproliferative activity in human gastric cancer cell lines, which may be attributed to their induction of G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. We also found that iron chelators induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in the activation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress apoptotic pathways in gastric cancer cells.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a crucial lipid mediator in the skin and potentially interferes with LC homeostasis but also functional properties, such as cytokine release, migration and antigen-uptake which are considered to be key events in the initiation and maintenance of pathological disorders. OBJECTIVE: Here, we used human Langerhans-like cells to study the influence of S1P-mediated signalling on LC maturation, cytokine release, migration and endocytosis. METHODS: Immature Langerhans-like cells were generated from the human acute myeloid leukaemia cell line MUTZ-3 (MUTZ-LCs) and human primary monocytes (MoLCs). S1P receptor expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Expression of maturation markers were investigated by flow cytometry. The influence of S1P signalling on cytokine release was quantified by ELISA. Migration assays and FITC-dextran uptake in the presence of S1P, specific S1 P receptor agonists and antagonists as well as fingolimod (FTY720) were analysed through fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. RESULTS: S1P receptor protein expression was confirmed for S1P1, S1P2 and S1P4 in MUTZ-LCs and S1P1 and S1P2 in MoLCs. In mature cells S1P receptors were downregulated. S1P did not induce maturation in MUTZ-LCs, whereas in MoLCs CD83 and CD86 were slightly upregulated. IL-8 release of MUTZ-LCs matured in the presence of S1P was not altered, however, reduced IL-6 and IL-12p70 levels were observed in mature MoLCs. Interestingly, immature MUTZ-LCs revealed a significantly increased S1P-dependent migratory capacity, whereas CCL20 induced migration was significantly decreased in the presence of S1P. Furthermore, migratory capacity towards CCL21 in mature MUTZ-LCs but not MoLCs was significantly lower when cells were stimulated with S1P. S1P, FTY720 and specific S1P receptor agonists did not modulate the endocytotic capacity of immature MUTZ-LCs and MoLCs. These findings were further supported by testing specific antagonists of S1P1-4 in the absence or presence of S1P. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that S1P regulates key events of human LC maturation including cytokine release and migration. These findings are of particular importance when considering the potential use of S1P in inflammatory skin disorders.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We report two CP-CML patients achieving and maintaining major molecular responses while on very low doses of dasatinib, ultimately achieving undetectable levels of BCR-ABL fusion transcript in their peripheral blood.

There was no laboratory evidence of acute disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, on presentation or later on. Initially the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was considered, so all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) was added to induction chemo therapy. As the diagnosis of APL was ruled out, based on the flow cytometry, fluorescent in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction findings, the ATRA was discontinued and the patient continued on the standard AML chemo therapy induction regimen. Later on chromosomal analysis was also normal. Sever dehydration on presentation, would have contributed to brain infarction. AML particularly monocytic, can mimic APL, especially its microgranular variant.

However, therapeutic selectivity and drug resistance are two major issues in imatinib based leukemia therapy prompting development of strategies to surmount imatinib resistance for effective CML therapy. Growing evidences advocate that, cancer cells exhibit augmented intrinsic reactive oxygen species (ROS), due to oncogenic stimulation, amplified metabolic activity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Since ROS activates multidrug resistant proteins in CML cells, we hypothesized that an herbal molecule having ROS scavenging property may therefore enhance imatinib induced cell death in drug resistant cells by counteracting ROS mediated drug resistance. In the present study, we document to explore an approach to simultaneously deliver two drugs (imatinib, an anticancer drug for CML therapy and curcumin a ROS scavenger) using poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles for drug resistant CML cells.

However, little is known about the expression pattern of microRNA-215 in acute myeloid leukemia. This study was to investigate the status of microRNA-215 expression and further analyze its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to evaluate the expression level of microRNA-215 in 113 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Besides, the relationship between microRNA-215 levels and clinical and pathological factors was explored. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy individuals, microRNA-215 expression in acute myeloid leukemia patients was significantly down-regulated (P= 0.001). MicroRNA-215 low-expressed patients had higher white blood cells than microRNA-215 high-expressed patients (P= 0.014). The incidence of FLT3/ITD mutation in the patients with low microRNA-215 expression was significantly higher than those with high microRNA-215 expression (P= 0.025). MicroRNA-215 low-expressed patients had significantly shorter overall survival than microRNA-215 high-expressed patients in both non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia patients and cytogenetically normal patients (P= 0.017 and P= 0.044, respectively). Meanwhile, multivariate analysis confirmed the adverse prognostic value of microRNA-215 expression in acute myeloid leukemia patients with non-M3 subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that reduced microRNA-215 expression is a common event and is associated with poor clinical outcome in acute myeloid leukemia.","['(c) The Author 2016.

We investigated whether a multi-state model would give insight into the events after transplantation in a cohort of patients who were transplanted using a strategy including scheduled donor lymphocyte infusions. Seventy-eight consecutive patients who underwent myeloablative T-cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were studied. We constructed a multi-state model to analyze the impact of donor lymphocyte infusion and graft-versus-host disease on the probabilities of relapse and non-relapse mortality over time. Based on this model we introduced a new measure for outcome after transplantation which we called 'treatment success': being alive without relapse and immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease. All relevant clinical events were implemented into the multi-state model and were denoted treatment success or failure (either transient or permanent). Both relapse and non-relapse mortality were causes of failure of comparable magnitude. Whereas relapse was the dominant cause of failure from the transplantation state, its rate was reduced after graft-versus-host disease, and especially after donor lymphocyte infusion. The long-term probability of treatment success was approximately 40%. This probability was increased after donor lymphocyte infusion. Our multi-state model helps to interpret the impact of post-transplantation interventions and clinical events on failure and treatment success, thus extracting more information from observational data.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Eefting, Matthias', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth C', 'Halkes, Constantijn J M', 'von dem Borne, Peter A', 'Kersting, Sabina', 'Marijt, Erik W A', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Putter, Hein', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Eefting M', 'de Wreede LC', 'Halkes CJ', 'von dem Borne PA', 'Kersting S', 'Marijt EW', 'Veelken H', 'Putter H', 'Schetelig J', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands l.c.de_wreede@lumc.nl.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Medical Department I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden & DKMS, German Bone Marrow Donor Center, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/mortality/pathology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Statistical', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Siblings', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors']",PMC5004390,,2016/01/24 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2016/01/24 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.136846 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.136846 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Apr;101(4):506-14. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.136846.

However, the precise mechanisms governing the replacement of normal hematopoietic stem cells in their niche by myeloid neoplasm stem cells have not yet been clarified. Primary acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome cells induced aberrant expression of multiple hematopoietic factors including Jagged-1, stem cell factor and angiopoietin-1 in mesenchymal stem cells even in non-contact conditions, and this abnormality was reverted by extracellular vesicle inhibition. Importantly, the transfer of myeloid neoplasm-derived extracellular vesicles reduced the hematopoietic supportive capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. Analysis of extracellular vesicle microRNA indicated that several species, including miR-7977 from acute myeloid leukemia cells, were higher than those from normal CD34(+)cells. Remarkably, the copy number of miR-7977 in bone marrow interstitial fluid was elevated not only in acute myeloid leukemia, but also in myelodysplastic syndrome, as compared with lymphoma without bone marrow localization. The transfection of the miR-7977 mimic reduced the expression of the posttranscriptional regulator, poly(rC) binding protein 1, in mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, the miR-7977 mimic induced aberrant reduction of hematopoietic growth factors in mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in decreased hematopoietic-supporting capacity of bone marrow CD34(+)cells. Furthermore, the reduction of hematopoietic growth factors including Jagged-1, stem cell factor and angiopoietin-1 were reverted by target protection of poly(rC) binding protein 1, suggesting that poly(rC) binding protein 1 could be involved in the stabilization of several growth factors. Thus, miR-7977 in extracellular vesicles may be a critical factor that induces failure of normal hematopoiesis via poly(rC) binding protein 1 suppression.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Horiguchi, Hiroto', 'Kobune, Masayoshi', 'Kikuchi, Shohei', 'Yoshida, Masahiro', 'Murata, Masaki', 'Murase, Kazuyuki', 'Iyama, Satoshi', 'Takada, Kohichi', 'Sato, Tsutomu', 'Ono, Kaoru', 'Hashimoto, Akari', 'Tatekoshi, Ayumi', 'Kamihara, Yusuke', 'Kawano, Yutaka', 'Miyanishi, Koji', 'Sawada, Norimasa', 'Kato, Junji']","['Horiguchi H', 'Kobune M', 'Kikuchi S', 'Yoshida M', 'Murata M', 'Murase K', 'Iyama S', 'Takada K', 'Sato T', 'Ono K', 'Hashimoto A', 'Tatekoshi A', 'Kamihara Y', 'Kawano Y', 'Miyanishi K', 'Sawada N', 'Kato J']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan mkobune@sapmed.ac.jp.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ANGPT1 protein, human)', '0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (MIRN7977 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (PCBP1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",IM,"['Angiopoietin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Extracellular Vesicles/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jagged-1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligoribonucleotides/genetics/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",PMC5004399,,2016/01/24 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2016/01/24 06:00'],"['2015/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.134932 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.134932 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Apr;101(4):437-47. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.134932.

However, little is known about its role in hematopoiesis. In this study, we measured helicase-like transcription factor mRNA expression in the bone marrow of 204 adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. Patients were dichotomized into low and high expression groups at the median level for clinicopathological correlations. Helicase-like transcription factor levels were dramatically reduced in the low expression patient group compared to those in the normal controls (n=40) (P<0.0001). Low helicase-like transcription factor expression correlated positively with French-American-British M4/M5 subtypes (P<0.0001) and complex cytogenetic abnormalities (P=0.02 for >/=3 abnormalities;P=0.004 for >/=5 abnormalities) but negatively with CEBPA double mutations (P=0.012). Also, low expression correlated with poorer overall (P=0.005) and event-free (P=0.006) survival in the intermediate-risk cytogenetic subgroup. Consistent with the more aggressive disease associated with low expression, helicase-like transcription factor knockdown in leukemic cells promoted proliferation and chromosomal instability that was accompanied by downregulation of mitotic regulators and impaired DNA damage response. The significance of helicase-like transcription factor in genome maintenance was further indicated by its markedly elevated expression in normal human CD34(+)hematopoietic stem cells. We further demonstrated that helicase-like transcription factor was a RUNX1 target and transcriptionally repressed by RUNX1-ETO and site-specific DNA methylation through a duplicated RUNX1 binding site in its promoter. Taken together, our findings provide new mechanistic insights on genomic instability linked to helicase-like transcription factor deregulation, and strongly suggest a tumor suppressor function of the SWI/SNF protein in acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Cheng, Chi Keung', 'Chan, Natalie P H', 'Wan, Thomas S K', 'Lam, Lai Ying', 'Cheung, Coty H Y', 'Wong, Terry H Y', 'Ip, Rosalina K L', 'Wong, Raymond S M', 'Ng, Margaret H L']","['Cheng CK', 'Chan NP', 'Wan TS', 'Lam LY', 'Cheung CH', 'Wong TH', 'Ip RK', 'Wong RS', 'Ng MH']","['Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cina.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cina.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cina.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cina.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cina.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cina.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cina.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cina Sir Y.

This study identified factors associated with self-management skills (SMSs), an important correlate of successful transition. METHODS: Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey conducted at three Canadian hospitals between July 2011 and January 2012. The sample included 184 childhood cancer survivors aged between 15 and 19 years. Independent factors included demographic- and illness-related factors. The outcome of interest was SMSs, measured using the SMSs scale, with higher scores indicating more SMSs. RESULTS: More SMSs were associated positively with older age (beta = 1.2, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.1 to 2.4), being female (beta = 4.6, 95 % CI = 1.9 to 7.4), and having a non-married parent (beta = 5.2, 95 % CI = 0.04 to 10.4). There was a negative association between SMSs and having had a central nervous system tumor (CNS) compared to having leukemia (beta = -7.9, 95 % CI = -13.5 to -2.2). CONCLUSIONS: Younger, male, and CNS tumor survivors lack SMSs. Future research is needed to explore the extent and nature of associations between SMSs and parents' marital status. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Younger, male, and CNS tumor survivors should be targeted for interventions in order to ensure that adequate SMSs are attained before completion of transition.",,"['Syed, Iqra A', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Barr, Ronald', 'Rosenberg-Yunger, Zahava R S', ""D'Agostino, Norma M"", 'Klassen, Anne F']","['Syed IA', 'Nathan PC', 'Barr R', 'Rosenberg-Yunger ZR', ""D'Agostino NM"", 'Klassen AF']","['Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, The Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Pathology and Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', 'School of Health Services Management, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.', 'Ontario Pharmacists Association, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 3A, 1280 Main Street W., Hamilton, ON, Canada, L8S 4K1. aklass@mcmaster.ca.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Self Care', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/01/24 06:00,2017/04/22 06:00,['2016/01/24 06:00'],"['2015/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11764-016-0514-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11764-016-0514-y [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2016 Aug;10(4):686-91. doi: 10.1007/s11764-016-0514-y.

Diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow commonly occurs in T-ALL and relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, and is associated with worse prognosis. However, the mechanism of leukemia outgrowth in the marrow and the resulting biologic impact on hematopoiesis are poorly understood. Here, we investigated targetable cellular and molecular abnormalities in leukemia marrow stroma responsible for the suppression of normal hematopoiesis using a T-ALL mouse model and human T-ALL xenografts. We found that actively proliferating leukemia cells inhibited normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation and homing to the perivascular region. In addition, leukemia development was accompanied by the suppression of the endosteum-lining osteoblast population. We further demonstrated that aberrant Notch activation in the stroma plays an important role in negatively regulating the expression of CXLC12 on osteoblasts and their differentiation. Notch blockade reversed attenuated HSPC cycling, leukemia-associated abnormal blood lineage distribution, and thrombocytopenia as well as recovered osteoblast and HSPC abundance and improved the hematopoietic-supportive functions of osteoblasts. Finally, we confirmed that reduced osteoblast frequency and enhanced Notch signaling were also features of the marrow stroma of human ALL tissues. Collectively, our findings suggest that therapeutically targeting the leukemia-infiltrated hematopoietic niche may restore HSPC homeostasis and improve the outcome of ALL patients.",['(c)2016 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Wang, Weihuan', 'Zimmerman, Grant', 'Huang, Xiaoran', 'Yu, Shuiliang', 'Myers, Jay', 'Wang, Yiwei', 'Moreton, Stephen', 'Nthale, Joseph', 'Awadallah, Amad', 'Beck, Rose', 'Xin, Wei', 'Wald, David', 'Huang, Alex Y', 'Zhou, Lan']","['Wang W', 'Zimmerman G', 'Huang X', 'Yu S', 'Myers J', 'Wang Y', 'Moreton S', 'Nthale J', 'Awadallah A', 'Beck R', 'Xin W', 'Wald D', 'Huang AY', 'Zhou L']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.

We previously found that the initially high apoptosis-resistance of AML cells decreased after therapy, while regaining high levels at relapse. Herein, we further explored this aspect of dynamic apoptosis regulation in AML. First, we showed that the intraindividualex vivoapoptosis-related profiles of normal lymphocytes and AML blasts within the bone marrow of AML patients were highly correlated. The expression values of apoptosis-regulating proteins were far beyond healthy control lymphocytes, which implicates the influence of microenvironmental factors. Second, we demonstrated that apoptosis-resistant primary AML blasts, as opposed to apoptosis-sensitive cells, were able to up-regulate BCL-2 expression in sensitive AML blasts in contact cultures (p= 0.0067 andp= 1.0, respectively). Using secretome proteomics, we identified novel proteins possibly engaged in apoptosis regulation. Intriguingly, this analysis revealed that major functional protein clusters engaged in global gene regulation, including mRNA splicing, protein translation, and chromatin remodeling, were more abundant (p= 4.01E-06) in secretomes of apoptosis-resistant AML. These findings were confirmed by subsequent extracellular vesicle proteomics. Finally, confocal-microscopy-based colocalization studies show that splicing factors-containing vesicles secreted by high AAI cells are taken up by low AAI cells. The current results constitute the first comprehensive analysis of proteins released by apoptosis-resistant and sensitive primary AML cells. Together, the data point to vesicle-mediated release of global gene regulatory protein clusters as a plausible novel mechanism of induction of apoptosis resistance. Deciphering the modes of communication between apoptosis-resistant blasts may in perspective lead to the discovery of prognostic tools and development of novel therapeutic interventions, aimed at limiting or overcoming therapy resistance.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Wojtuszkiewicz, Anna', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J', 'Kessler, Floortje L', 'Piersma, Sander R', 'Knol, Jaco C', 'Pham, Thang V', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Musters, Rene J P', 'van Meerloo, Johan', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Jimenez, Connie R']","['Wojtuszkiewicz A', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Kessler FL', 'Piersma SR', 'Knol JC', 'Pham TV', 'Jansen G', 'Musters RJ', 'van Meerloo J', 'Assaraf YG', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Zweegman S', 'Cloos J', 'Jimenez CR']","['From the double daggerDept. of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, section signDept. of Hematology.', 'section signDept. of Hematology.', 'section signDept. of Hematology.', 'paragraph signOncoProteomics Laboratory, Dept. of Medical Oncology.', 'paragraph signOncoProteomics Laboratory, Dept. of Medical Oncology.', 'paragraph signOncoProteomics Laboratory, Dept. of Medical Oncology.', '||Dept. of Rheumatology, VUmc-Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands;', '**Dept. of Physiology, ICaR-VU, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands;', 'section signDept. of Hematology.', 'double daggerdouble daggerDept. of Biology, Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research Laboratory, Faculty of Biology, Technion-Israel, Institute of Technology, Haifa 3200003, Israel.', 'From the double daggerDept. of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology.', 'section signDept. of Hematology.', 'From the double daggerDept. of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, section signDept. of Hematology.', 'paragraph signOncoProteomics Laboratory, Dept. of Medical Oncology, c.jimenez@vumc.nl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,['0 (Proteome)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Exosomes/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4824855,,2016/01/24 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/01/24 06:00'],"['2015/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)33621-5 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M115.052944 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2016 Apr;15(4):1281-98. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M115.052944.

The pathogenesis of HAM/TSP involves a chronic inflammatory response in central nervous system (CNS), with the presence of HTLV-1 infected cells and HTLV-1-specific CD8+ lymphocytes. Chemokines may have a role in the infiltration of these cells into the CNS. In this context, the present study analyzed the level of plasmatic chemokines CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL5 (RANTES), IL8 (CXCL8), CXCL9 (MIG), and CXCL10 (IP-10) and HTLV-1 proviral load from peripheral blood in 162 asymptomatic carriers and 136 HAM/TSP patients to determine the differences that be associated with the clinical status of the HTLV-1 infection. The results showed that patients with HAM/TSP have significantly higher levels of IL8 and CXCL9, and that the level of IL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10 was significantly greater in HTLV-1 infected individuals with high (>1%) than those with low proviral load (<1%). However, the levels of the chemokines tested have not showed high sensitivity to discriminate HAM/TSP patients from asymptomatic carriers. In addition, chemokine profiles in asymptomatic carriers and HAM/TSP groups were similar, with no significant increased frequency of higher producers of chemokines in HAM/TSP individuals. Results indicate that the heterogeneity of the individuals in the groups regarding time of infection, duration of disease, proviral load level and other possible confound factors may impair the use of chemokines levels to monitor HTLV-1 carriers in clinical practice.

We performed a real-time evaluation of the automatic differential count according to WBC number with Sysmex XN series and demonstrated a significant differential impact on blast distinction depending on the number of WBC. DESIGN AND METHODS: We categorized the 49,699 specimen according to WBC number and compared the results of blast flagging in the white cell differential (WDF) channel and WPC channel on the basis of the results of manual differential count. Additionally, clinical impact of missed blasts after running WPC reflex test was analyzed. RESULTS: For patients with WBC under 1.5x10(9)/L, blast flagging for WPC channel showed markedly decreased sensitivity (56%) compared to that of WDF mode (100%). Most of the patients with missed blasts in WPC mode were under chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The specificity and efficiency for WPC channel were much higher than that of WDF mode in all range of WBC. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the additional reagent cost required for the WPC channel, WPC reflex test is not suitable for patients with leukopenia if it is operated alone. Instead, manual blood film review or double-check with other supplemental equipment should be accompanied.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

We describe a case of disseminated acanthamoebiasis with cutaneous manifestations and summarize additional diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic highlights. METHODS: A 58-year-old man with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia had several weeks of progressive, painful ulcerations on the forehead, arms, abdomen, and thighs. A biopsy was performed for histopathologic evaluation. RESULTS: The biopsy specimen showed inflammatory infiltrate with abscess formation involving the epidermis, dermis, and subcutis. Scattered cells showed nuclei with a prominent central karyosome, dispersed chromatin, and either abundant foamy basophilic cytoplasm or two well-demarcated cytoplasmic walls. Acanthamoeba species was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous lesions from acanthamoebiasis are exceptionally rare but should be included in the differential diagnosis of necrotic cutaneous lesions in immunocompromised patients. Although infrequently encountered, pathologists need to be aware of the morphologic features of free-living amoebas. Immunohistochemical and molecular studies can confirm the diagnosis. Multiagent treatment regimens, when initiated empirically, have been more successful than single-agent regimens, but infections involving the central nervous system are almost universally fatal.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016.

Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) biomagnetic liver susceptometry, a noninvasive measurement of iron overload, allows measurement of the interference of an exteriorly applied small but highly constant magnetic field by the paramagnetic liver storage iron. By measuring the true iron load of patients through SQUID, we wanted to assess the effect of iron overload on patients undergoing SCT. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis (1994-2010), comparing the effect of SF and liver iron content measured by SQUID shortly before transplantation on overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and transplant-related mortality (TRM) in 142 patients (median age 54.5 yr, range 5.6-75 yr) undergoing SCT (80% reduced intensity regimen). Patients were subdivided into five groups: myelodysplastic syndrome, de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), secondary AML, primary myelofibrosis, and others. RESULTS: Correlation between SF and SQUID was significant (r = 0.6; P < 0.001; log function). The chance of infection was increased 2.4-fold (95% CI 1.22-4.71) when SQUID values ranged >/=1000 mug Fe/g liver (P = 0.012). We found similar results for SF >1000 ng/mL (P = 0.003). A significant association between SQUID and fungal infection was also seen (P = 0.004). For patients with SQUID >/=1000, the risk of proven fungal infection was increased 3.08-fold (95% CI 1.43-6.63). A similar association between SF >1000 and fungal infection was shown (P = 0.01). In univariate analysis, age was a prognostic factor for TRM (P = 0.034, HR 1.04, CI 1.00-1.08). SF >/=1000 was associated with OS (P = 0.033, HR 2.09, CI 1.06-4.11) and EFS (P = 0.016, HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.15-4.10). In multivariate analysis on EFS, only age and SF >1000 remained as independent factors (HR 1.027, P = 0.040, 95% CI 1.001-1.054 and HR 2.058, P = 0.034, 95% CI 1.056-4.008, respectively). The multivariate analysis on TRM left age and SQUID values >/=1000 in the final model (HR 1.045, P = 0.041, 95% CI 1.002-1.090 and HR 2.110, P = 0.103, 95% CI 0.859-5.183, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our data confirmed that SF >/=1000 increases the risk of infection, moreover fungal infection in transplant recipients. As SQUID values correlate well with SF, we could show that SF is indeed a good surrogate parameter for iron overload when measured shortly before SCT. Prospective trials are needed to investigate the effect of iron chelation before or during SCT on transplant outcome.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A variety of neoplasms can involve the periportal region, whether primary or secondary, owing to contiguous spread from surrounding hepatic parenchyma or from adjacent organs. CT plays an important role in not only diagnosing these lesions but also determining the extent of the disease. Most of the malignancies leading to the periportal spread manifest as periportal hypodensity either distinctly or in contiguity with the primary tumour. Even in known malignancies, periportal hypodensity commonly results from non-neoplastic causes like periportal oedema; hence, a knowledge of the imaging findings to ascertain its presence as well as to conclude the definite neoplastic spread is prudent.

Recent studies have shown variable outcomes when small abnormal B cell populations are seen by flow cytometry (El Rassi et al., Cancer 2015; 121:872-875; Vrotsos et al., Cytometry B Clin Cytom 2015). METHODS: The hematopathology database was searched (7.4-year period), and patients identified through routine clinical study, who were BCR-ABL1 positive CML and had an ABLB of less than 20%. Flow cytometric (FC) and histologic data was evaluated to determine immunophenotypic abnormalities, immunohistochemical patterns, and percentage of ABLB, hematogones, and mature B cells. RESULTS: Seven patients with CML and ABLB identified by FC studies were found, five of which also had available histologic material to review. ABLB by FC ranged from 0.006% to 3.4%, typically demonstrated an immunophenotype with increased CD10, increased CD19, and decreased CD38, without myeloid antigens, abnormalities similar to that reported previously (Vrotsos et al., Cytometry B Clin Cytom 2015). The ABLB population was found only in diagnostic samples and always with more numerous hematogones. By immunohistochemistry, three of five patients showed >/=10% TdT positive cells. All patients showed a response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and no patients progressed to clinical lymphoid blast phase. CONCLUSIONS: Immature B cells, occasionally including a small subset with an abnormal phenotype can be observed in chronic phase CML at diagnosis. We believe an approach incorporating clinical data, cytogenetic/molecular findings, and morphologic evaluation may be helpful when determining the best management of CML patients at diagnosis if small ABLB populations are identified by FC.

However, our knowledge of Cytl1 is still limited. Here, we determined the Cytl1 expression pattern regulated by ovarian hormones at both the mRNA and protein levels. We found that the endometrial expression of Cytl1 in mice was low before or on the first day of gestation, significantly increased during embryo implantation, and then decreased at the end of implantation. We investigated the effects of Cytl1 on endometrial cell proliferation, and the effects on the secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF). We also explored the effect of Cytl1 on endometrial adhesion properties in cell-cell adhesion assays. Our findings demonstrated that Cytl1 is an ovarian hormone-dependent protein expressed in the endometrium that enhances the proliferation of HEC-1-A and RL95-2 cells, stimulates endometrial secretion of LIF and HB-EGF, and enhances the adhesion of HEC-1-A and RL95-2 cells to JAR spheroids.

An effective immune response requires T cells recognizing CMV epitopes via their T cell receptors (TCRs). Little is known about the TCR repertoire, in particular the TCR-alpha repertoire and its clinical relevance in patients following stem cell transplantation. Using next-generation sequencing we examined the TCR-alpha repertoire of CD8(+) T cells and CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells in four patients. Additionally, we performed single-cell TCR-alphabeta sequencing of CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells. The TCR-alpha composition of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 CMVpp65- and CMVIE -specific T cells was oligoclonal and defined by few dominant clonotypes. Frequencies of single clonotypes reached up to 11% of all CD8(+) T cells and half of the total CD8(+) T cell repertoire was dominated by few CMV-reactive clonotypes. Some TCR-alpha clonotypes were shared between patients. Gene expression of the circulating CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells was consistent with chronically activated effector memory T cells. The CD8(+) T cell response to CMV reactivation resulted in an expansion of a few TCR-alpha clonotypes to dominate the CD8(+) repertoires. These results warrant further larger studies to define the ability of oligoclonally expanded T cell clones to achieve an effective anti-viral T cell response in this setting.",['(c) 2016 British Society for Immunology.'],"['Link, C S', 'Eugster, A', 'Heidenreich, F', 'Rucker-Braun, E', 'Schmiedgen, M', 'Oelschlagel, U', 'Kuhn, D', 'Dietz, S', 'Fuchs, Y', 'Dahl, A', 'Domingues, A M J', 'Klesse, C', 'Schmitz, M', 'Ehninger, G', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Schetelig, J', 'Bonifacio, E']","['Link CS', 'Eugster A', 'Heidenreich F', 'Rucker-Braun E', 'Schmiedgen M', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Kuhn D', 'Dietz S', 'Fuchs Y', 'Dahl A', 'Domingues AM', 'Klesse C', 'Schmitz M', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schetelig J', 'Bonifacio E']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'BIOTEChnology Center, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS Clinical Trials Unit, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institut Fur Immunologie, Medizinische Fakultat, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus.', 'DKMS Clinical Trials Unit, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytomegalovirus/growth & development/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Epitopes/genetics/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/*immunology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC4872374,,2016/01/23 06:00,2017/03/23 06:00,['2016/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cei.12770 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2016 Jun;184(3):389-402. doi: 10.1111/cei.12770.

However, the prognostic significance of ACCR in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unknown. We evaluated 272 adult patients with ALL and abnormal cytogenetics at baseline who were treated with frontline induction chemotherapy, achieved complete remission (CR) and had cytogenetic analysis performed at the time of CR. ACCR was observed in 26 patients (9.6%). Median relapse-free survival was 22 months (95% CI, 12 months to not reached) for patients with ACCR vs. 48 months (range, 30-125 months) in patients with normal cytogenetics at CR (NCCR; P = 0.31). Median overall survival also did not differ significantly between the ACCR (99 months [range, 17 months to not reached]) and NCCR groups (67 months [range, 47 months to not reached], P = 0.86). The specificity of ACCR for minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity by multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC) was 43%, and there was overall poor correlation between these two methods for the detection of residual disease. When patients were stratified by MRD status, the presence or absence of persistent cytogenetic abnormalities at CR did not add additional prognostic information. This study suggests that there is poor association between MRD assessment by MFC and the presence or absence of cytogenetic abnormalities at CR in adult patients with ALL. ACCR was not associated with adverse outcomes in ALL and did not add additional prognostic information when MRD status by MFC was known.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Short, Nicholas J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Jabbour, Elias J', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Garris, Rebecca', 'Qiao, Wei', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Daver, Naval', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Short NJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Jabbour EJ', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Faderl S', 'Burger JA', 'Garris R', 'Qiao W', 'Huang X', 'Jain N', 'Konopleva M', 'Kadia TM', 'Daver N', 'Borthakur G', 'Cortes JE', 'Ravandi F']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California Irvine, Orange, California.', 'Division of Leukemia, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC5834229,['NIHMS870531'],2016/01/23 06:00,2016/08/04 06:00,['2016/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24296 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2016 Jun;91(4):385-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24296.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of malonaldehyde on the allergenicity of shrimp tropomyosin. RESULTS: RBL-2H3 cells, a model of type I allergic reactions, were sensitised with sera from patients allergic to shrimp, and were stimulated with native and cross-linked tropomyosin. Release of inflammatory mediators such as beta-hexosaminidase, histamine, tryptase, cysteinyl leukotriene, and prostaglandin D2 was clearly suppressed in a manner that depended on the extent of tropomyosin cross-linking. Release of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 was similarly decreased. Notably, cells sensitised with one patient's serum released IL-4 at comparable levels in response to native and cross-linked tropomyosin. CONCLUSION: Cross-linking strongly modulates the ability of shrimp tropomyosin to induce release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from activated RBL-2H3 cells.

It accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. DIAGNOSIS: CML is characterized by a balanced genetic translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson gene (ABL1) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Frontline therapy: Three tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Clinical trials with 2nd generation TKIs reported significantly deeper and faster responses; their impact on long-term survival remains to be determined. Salvage therapy: For patients who fail frontline therapy, second-line options include second and third generation TKIs. Although second and third generation TKIs are potent and selective TKIs, they exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient and disease characteristics, such as patients' comorbidities, disease stage, and BCR-ABL1 mutational status. Patients who develop the T315I ""gatekeeper"" mutation display resistance to all currently available TKIs except ponatinib. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains an important therapeutic option for patients with CML-CP who have failed at least two TKIs, and for all patients in advanced phase disease.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas M.

Whether the diagnostic bone marrow blast percentage has current value with regards to patient prognostication or identification of optimal treatment strategies is unclear. We retrospectively studied 1652 treatment-naive adults with MDS or AML and >/=10% blasts from January 2000 to April 2014. Patients with 20-29% blasts were more similar to MDS patients in terms of advanced age, increased frequency of poor-risk cytogenetics, lower WBC count, and less frequent NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations. Median overall survival of MDS and RAEB-T were similar, 16.0 and 16.0 months, compared to 13.5 months for AML with >/=30% blasts (P = 0.045). Multivariate analysis showed inferior survival with increased age (HR 1.81 age 60-69, HR 2.68 age >/=70, P < 0.0005); poor-risk cytogenetics (HR 2.25, P < 0.0005); therapy-related disease (HR 1.44, P < 0.0005); and markers of proliferative disease including WBC >/=25 x 10(9) /L (HR 1.35, P = 0.0003), elevated LDH count (HR 1.24, P = 0.0015), and peripheral blasts (HR 1.25, P = 0.004). Among younger patients (</=60 years), intensive AML-type therapy resulted in similar outcomes regardless of blast percentage, suggesting this to be optimal therapy in this context. Among older patients (>/=70 years), patients with 20-29% blasts had similar outcomes to patients with <20% blasts, and better than those with >/=30% blasts. In addition, among older patients, epigenetic therapy provided at least equivalent outcome to intensive chemotherapy.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Nazha, Aziz', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['DiNardo CD', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Pierce S', 'Nazha A', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Jabbour E', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA01667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/blood/mortality/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC5486407,['NIHMS870530'],2016/01/23 06:00,2016/06/03 06:00,['2016/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24252 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2016 Feb;91(2):227-32. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24252.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) on the negative prognostic impact of U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations. In total, 122 patients with MDS (30%), acute myeloid leukemia (51%), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (11%), and MDS/MPN (8%) receiving a HCT from 2003 to 2012 were evaluated for mutations in U2AF1 and SRSF2 by direct sequencing. Median time of follow up was 24 months (range 0.46-110). SRSF2 mutations were detected in 11 (10%) patients and U2AF1 in 3 (3%) patients. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between mutated and wild-type (WT) patients. Patients carrying SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations had similar overall survival (P = 0.84), relapse mortality (P = 0.50), and non-relapse mortality (P = 0.72) compared to WT patients.

While the 2008 update of the World Health Organisation (WHO) is the current standard, the publication of the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) has illustrated the need for supplemental prognostic information. The aim of this study was to investigate whether morphological classification models for MDS - of both the French-American-British (FAB) group and WHO - provide reliable criteria for their classification into homogeneous and clinically relevant categories with prognostic relevance beyond the IPSS-R. We reclassified 238 MDS patients using each of the FAB, WHO 2001 and WHO 2008 criteria and studied classification categories in terms of clinical, haematological and cytogenetic features. Subsequently, we calculated prognostic scores using the IPSS-R and investigated whether the morphological classification models had significantly prognostic value in patients stratified by the IPSS-R and vice versa. By adopting the FAB, WHO 2001 and WHO 2008 classifications, MDS patients were organised into homogeneous categories with intrinsic prognostic information. However, whereas the morphological classification models showed no prognostic value beyond the IPSS-R, the IPSS-R had significant prognostic value beyond the FAB, WHO 2001 and WHO 2008 classifications. Even though morphological classification models for MDS might be clinically relevant from a prognostic point of view, their relevance in terms of risk stratification is evidently limited in light of the IPSS-R. Therefore, we suggest to stop the use of morphological classification models for MDS for risk stratification in routine clinical practice.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The goals of this study were to determine changes in select gene expressions in monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rat models after human umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) transfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rats were separated into 3 groups i.e., control group (C group), M group (MCT 60 mg/kg), and U group (hUCB-MSCs transfusion) a week after MCT injection. RESULTS: TUNEL assay showed that the U group had significantly lowered positive apoptotic cells in the lung tissues, as compared with the M group. mRNA of caspase-3, B cell leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl)-2, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the lung tissues were greatly reduced at week 4 in the U group. Immunohistochemical staining of the lung tissues also demonstrated a similar pattern, with the exception of IL-6. The protein expression of caspase-3, Bcl-2 VEGF, IL-6, TNF-alpha and brain natriuretic peptide in the heart tissues were significantly lower in the U group, as compared with the M group at week 2. Furthermore, the protein expression of VEGF, IL-6 and BNP in the heart tissues were significantly lower in the U group at week 4. Collagen content in the heart tissues was significantly lower in the U group, as compared with M group at weeks 2 and 4, respectively.

We sought to estimate the yield of recommended yearly urinalysis screening for genitourinary complications as per Version 3.0 of the COG Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines and identify possible risk factors for abnormal screening in a survivor population. PROCEDURE: A database of pediatric cancer survivors evaluated between January 2008 and March 2012 at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta was queried for survivors at risk for genitourinary late effects. The frequency of abnormal urinalyses (protein >/=1+ and/or presence of glucose and/or >/=5 red blood cells per high power field) was estimated. Risk factors associated with abnormal screening were identified. RESULTS: Chart review identified 773 survivors (57% male; 67% Caucasian; 60% leukemia/lymphoma survivors; mean age at diagnosis, 5.7 years [range: birth to 17.7 years]; time from diagnosis to initial screening, 7.6 years [range: 2.3 to 21.5 years]) who underwent urinalysis. Abnormal results were found in 78 (5.3%) of 1,484 total urinalyses. Multivariable analysis revealed higher dose ifosfamide (odds ratio [OR] = 6.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9-16.0) and total body irradiation (TBI, OR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.0-8.4) as significant risk factors for abnormal initial urinalysis screening. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric cancer survivors exposed to higher dose ifosfamide or TBI may be at higher risk of abnormal findings on urinalysis screening. Targeted screening of these higher risk patients should be considered.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ramirez, Matthew D', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Esiashvili, Natia', 'Meacham, Lillian R', 'Wasilewski-Masker, Karen']","['Ramirez MD', 'Mertens AC', 'Esiashvili N', 'Meacham LR', 'Wasilewski-Masker K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""The Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""The Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""The Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""The Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia.""]",['eng'],"['TL1 TR000456/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000454/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR000454/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glycosuria/chemically induced/*urine', 'Hematuria/chemically induced/*urine', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/mortality/urine', '*Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/urine', 'Male', 'Proteinuria/chemically induced/*urine', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors', '*Urinalysis']",PMC4801680,['NIHMS746234'],2016/01/23 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2016/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25897 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 May;63(5):893-900. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25897.

METHODS: The records of all patients treated at our department between 1989 and 2012 for relapsing/refractory Ewing sarcoma who received oral VP-16 were analyzed. The dose was 40 mg/m2 daily for 21 consecutive days in every 28. Response was assessed after 2/3 cycles according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0. RESULTS: A total of 46 of 58 patients completed at least 2 cycles; 12 suspended the treatment earlier due to rapid disease progression. The patients' median age at diagnosis was 14 years and 25/58 had metastatic disease. All patients received intensive polychemotherapy including VP-16 IV as first- (n = 53) or second-line (n = 5) treatment; 21/58 had myeloablative regimens with peripheral blood stem cell rescue, and 1 underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Oral VP-16 was prescribed as 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th-line treatment for 19, 27, and 12 patients, respectively. The cycles administered totaled 241 (median 3, mean 4 per patient; range 1-14). A total of 46 of 58 patients were evaluable: 11 responded (9 partial remission, 1 very good partial remission, 1 complete remission) and 10 were stable, the response lasting a mean of 8 months.

It has shown significant activity against adult cancer preclinical models. PROCEDURE: NSC 750854 was tested against the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) in vitro cell line panel at concentrations from 1.0 nM to 10 muM and against the PPTP in vivo xenograft panels administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily for 5 days repeated at day 15. RESULTS: The median relative IC50 (rIC50 ) value for the PPTP cell lines was 32 nM (range from 11 to 124 nM), with consistent cytotoxicity across all cell lines. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines were more sensitive to NSC 750854 than non-ALL cell lines. NSC 750854 induced significant differences in EFS distribution compared to control in 31 of 35 (89%) solid tumor xenografts. It induced tumor growth inhibition meeting criteria for intermediate or high event free survival (EFS) T/C activity in 17 of 32 (53%) evaluable solid tumor xenografts (most consistently in the rhabdomyosarcoma panel). Objective responses were observed in 15 of 37 (41%) solid tumor xenografts and in all eight leukemia models with complete response (CR) or maintained complete response (MCR) in seven of eight leukemia models. CONCLUSIONS: NSC 750854 has a unique spectrum of antitumor activity compared with other agents tested by the PPTP as it induces regression in tumor models with limited sensitivity to most agents tested to date. Given the promising level of activity observed for NSC 750854 against PPTP preclinical models, further exploration of its mechanism of action is warranted.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gorlick, Richard', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Maris, John M', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kang, Min H', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Collins, Jerry', 'Kurmashev, Dias', 'Kurmasheva, Raushan T', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Gorlick R', 'Kolb EA', 'Keir ST', 'Maris JM', 'Lock RB', 'Carol H', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kang MH', 'Billups CA', 'Collins J', 'Kurmashev D', 'Kurmasheva RT', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA']","[""The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York."", 'A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware.', 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Children's Cancer Institute of Australia for Medical Research, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute of Australia for Medical Research, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas.', 'Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), NCI, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'NCI, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA199221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CM042216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA199297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Purine Nucleosides)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/prevention & control', 'Purine Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",PMC4724638,['NIHMS731143'],2016/01/23 06:00,2016/06/14 06:00,['2016/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25826 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Mar;63(3):443-50. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25826.

In many cases (but not always), the viruses have evolved to bind the PDZ domains using the same short linear peptide motifs found in host protein-PDZ interactions, and in some cases regulate the interactions in a similar fashion by phosphorylation. What is striking is that the diverse viruses target a common subset of PDZ proteins that are intimately involved in controlling cell polarity and the structure and function of intercellular junctions, including tight junctions. Cell polarity is fundamental to the control of cell proliferation and cell survival and disruption of polarity and the signal transduction pathways involved is a key event in tumourigenesis. This review focuses on the oncogenic viruses and the role of targeting PDZ proteins in the virus life cycle and the contribution of virus-PDZ protein interactions to virus-mediated oncogenesis.

Dimeric naphthoquinones (BiQs) with the ability to undergo redox cycling and to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells are a novel class of compounds with unique characteristics that make them excellent candidates to be tested against AML cells. We evaluated the effect of two BiQ analogues and one monomeric naphthoquinone in AML cell lines and primary cells from patients. All compounds possess one halogen and one hydroxyl group on the quinone cores. Dimeric, but not monomeric, naphthoquinones demonstrated significant anti-AML activity in the cell lines and primary cells from patients with favorable therapeutic index compared to normal hematopoietic cells. BiQ-1 effectively inhibited clonogenicity and induced apoptosis as measured by Western blotting and Annexin V staining and mitochondrial membrane depolarization by flow cytometry. BiQ-1 significantly enhances intracellular ROS levels in AML cells and upregulates expression of key anti-oxidant protein, Nrf2. Notably, systemic exposure to BiQ-1 was well tolerated in mice. In conclusion, we propose that BiQ-induced therapeutic augmentation of ROS in AML cells with dysregulation of antioxidants kill leukemic cells while normal cells remain relatively intact.

Tamoxifen alone inhibited the proliferation of myeloid leukemia cell lines while only slightly increasing morphologic differentiation. Tamoxifen effectively enhanced the growth-inhibiting actions of various differentiation-inducing agents. ATRA in the presence of tamoxifen increased NBT reduction and the expression of CD11b in HL-60 cells more effectively than ATRA alone. Tamoxifen also enhanced the differentiation induced by the other inducers tested. ATRA induced the differentiation of APL cell lines NB4 and HT93 and APL cells in primary culture, and this differentiation was also enhanced by tamoxifen.

We therefore retrospectively analysed the initial reports of BM core biopsies from 116 patients who were subsequently identified as FP positive (FP+, n = 56) or FP negative/corticosteroid-responsive HER or HES (n = 60). Compared to HER or HES, detection of FP was more frequently associated with increased numbers of blasts (11/56 vs. 2/60, p = 0.007) and mast cells (23/33 vs. 7/23, p = 0.006; with expression of CD25 [11/18 vs. 2/13, p = 0.025]), and/or fibrosis (25/35 vs. 1/23, p < 0.0001).

METHODS: Between August and November 2013, US-residing members of the PatientsLikeMe online CLL patient community completed open-ended web-based surveys designed to elicit descriptions of CLL symptoms, impacts, and treatment-related perceptions. Qualitative telephone follow-up interviews were conducted with a subsample of respondents. Survey responses and interview transcripts were coded for qualitative analysis using Atlas.ti. RESULTS: Fifty survey responses were included in the analyses. Participants were age 60.5 +/- 6.9 years, 54% female, and 96% white. When surveyed, 20% were receiving current treatment, 16% were in remission, and 64% were treatment-naive. Among respondents, 369 descriptions of CLL symptoms were coded. Fatigue-related symptoms were expressed most frequently, with 54% reporting ""fatigue,"" ""tiredness,"" or both in their responses. These concepts were followed by night sweats (38%), swollen lymph nodes (32%), and frequent infections (28%). Among impacts of CLL, worry and fear (66% of respondents), depressed feelings (52%), and work limitations (50%) were noted most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Survey results identified constitutional symptoms of CLL included in existing PRO instruments and the literature. Although the findings suggest that qualitative data obtained through social media applications can be potentially useful in supporting concept identification for newly developed PRO instruments, they also indicate that online approaches alone may not be sufficient to achieve efficient and exhaustive concept elicitation.

This study aimed to provide a detailed physico-chemical characterization of recombinant Der p 23 (rDer p 23) as well as to investigate its IgE reactivity in a cohort of HDM-allergic patients from Thailand. METHODS: Purified rDer p 23, secreted from recombinant Pichia pastoris, was characterized by mass spectrometry and circular dichroism analyses as well as for its chitin-binding activity. The IgE-binding frequency and allergenicity of Der p 23 were determined by ELISA and RBL-SX38 degranulation assays, respectively. RESULTS: Purified intact rDer p 23 carried O-mannosylation and mainly adopted a random coil structure. Polyclonal antibodies to rDer p 23 can detect the corresponding natural allergen (nDer p 23) in aqueous fecal pellet extracts, suggesting that both forms of Der p 23 share common B-cell epitopes. Despite its homologies with chitin-binding proteins, both natural Der p 23 and rDer p 23 were unable to interact in vitro with chitin matrices. Of 222 Thai HDM-allergic patients tested, 54% displayed Der p 23-specific IgE responses. Finally, the allergenicity of rDer p 23 was confirmed by the degranulation of rat basophil leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlighted important levels of Der p 23 sensitizations in Thailand. Our study clearly suggested that rDer p 23 is likely more appropriate for HDM allergy component-resolved diagnosis than HDM extracts.","['(c) 2016 S.

However, experimental approaches have only determined the methylation state of a small portion of the human genome. We developed deep learning based (stacked denoising autoencoders, or SdAs) software named ""DeepMethyl"" to predict the methylation state of DNA CpG dinucleotides using features inferred from three-dimensional genome topology (based on Hi-C) and DNA sequence patterns. We used the experimental data from immortalised myelogenous leukemia (K562) and healthy lymphoblastoid (GM12878) cell lines to train the learning models and assess prediction performance. We have tested various SdA architectures with different configurations of hidden layer(s) and amount of pre-training data and compared the performance of deep networks relative to support vector machines (SVMs). Using the methylation states of sequentially neighboring regions as one of the learning features, an SdA achieved a blind test accuracy of 89.7% for GM12878 and 88.6% for K562. When the methylation states of sequentially neighboring regions are unknown, the accuracies are 84.82% for GM12878 and 72.01% for K562.

RESULTS: The overall median follow-up period was 49 months. At baseline, 6 dasatinib-treated patients (6%) had mild renal dysfunction and 13 (12%) had mild liver dysfunction. Also, 8 nilotinib-treated patients (7%) had mild renal dysfunction, 1 (1%) moderate renal dysfunction, and 9 (8%) mild liver dysfunction. No significant differences were found in the rate of complete cytogenetic response, major molecular response, or molecular response by a 4.5 log reduction on the international scale between the organ function cohorts. Dasatinib- or nilotinib-treated patients with baseline renal dysfunction had a greater incidence of transient reversible acute kidney injury (P = .011 and P < .001), and nilotinib-treated patients with renal dysfunction had a greater incidence of bleeding (P < .001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with PTCL were identified through prospectively maintained T-cell lymphoma databases from the National Cancer Centre Singapore/Singapore General Hospital and Weill-Cornell Medical College after institutional review board approval. Patients with leukemia or indolent, composite, and cutaneous lymphomas were excluded. The patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed to determine the frequency and type of SI used. Of those with relapse, the method of relapse detection and data on symptoms, signs, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase LDH were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 338 patients were included in the present study. In the first year after achieving CR1, patients had an average of 1.2 and a median of 1 SI performed (range, 0-4). In the second year after achieving CR1, they had an average of 0.78 and a median of 1 SI performed (range, 0-4). Of the 135 patients who achieved CR1, 61 (45%) developed a relapse. Relapses were detected before SI in 48 (84%), and 9 patients had relapses detected during routine SI. Of the 9 patients whose relapses were detected during planned SI, only 3 did not have any symptoms or signs suggestive of relapsed disease. Of these 3 patients, 2 had angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and 1 had natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Most PTCL relapses were detected before planned SI, and most patients had symptoms with relapse. Only 3 patients (5.2%) were completely asymptomatic at relapse, suggesting a limited utility of routine imaging for detecting PTCL relapses.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

SUMMARY: Imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are first-line therapies for chronic-phase CML. Nilotinib or dasatinib can be used as first- or second-line treatment, with nilotinib preferred in patients with BCR-ABL F317 and V229 mutations and dasatinib in patients with Y253H, E255, and F359 mutations. All three medications are associated with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia; the reported rates varied but ranged from 38% to 90% in Phase III studies. Although less data are available for bosutinib, the drug can be used as second-line therapy and is effective against F317L, Y253H, and F359 mutations. Mutations at position T315I are generally resistant to all of these tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but may respond to ponatinib or omacetaxine. The choice of third-line therapy can be driven by mutational analysis or patient-specific characteristics. While ponatinib and omacetaxine have activity in patients with T351I mutations, they have not been directly compared. Differences in patient characteristics and adverse-effect profiles may also aid in the selection of appropriate therapy. CONCLUSION: Several TKIs are effective in the treatment of chronic-phase CML. Imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib may be used as first-line therapy, while second- and third-line treatments are determined based on previous failed therapy as well as BCR-ABL mutation status.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

In most cases these proliferations initially manifest in the blood and marrow; however, extramedullary involvement may precede blood or marrow involvement in a subset of cases, making a definitive diagnosis challenging by morphologic and immunohistochemical assessment alone. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare, aggressive entity that frequently presents in extramedullary sites and can show morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap with myeloid neoplasms. Given that BPDCN and myeloid neoplasms may both initially present in extramedullary sites and that novel targeted therapies may be developed that exploit the unique molecular signature of BPDCN, new immunophenotypic markers that can reliably separate myeloid neoplasms from BPDCN are desirable. We evaluated the utility of myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) expression in a series of extramedullary myeloid leukemias (EMLs) and BPDCN.

LIM Domain Only 2 (LMO2) gene translocations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a small subset of T-ALLs, and LMO2 protein has recently been reported to be expressed in a large proportion of T-ALLs. METHODS: In this study, we tested specificity of LMO2 for distinction between neoplastic and nonneoplastic T-precursor cells in thymus and bone marrow. RESULTS: Our findings show that LMO2 is expressed in neoplastic lymphoblasts of T-ALL and is absent in thymocytes of normal thymuses or thymomas. CONCLUSIONS: LMO2 is therefore a useful marker for immunophenotypic assessment of thymic neoplasms.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016. All rights reserved.

Decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (dODNs), which comprise STAT3-specific DNA sequences are competitive inhibition of STAT3 transcriptional activity. To deliver STAT3dODN specifically to myeloid cells, we linked STAT3dODN to the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand, cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG). The CpG-STAT3dODN conjugates are quickly internalized by human and mouse TLR9(+)immune cells (dendritic cells, B cells) and the majority of patients' derived AML blasts, including leukemia stem/progenitor cells. Following uptake, CpG-STAT3dODNs are released from endosomes, and bind and sequester cytoplasmic STAT3, thereby inhibiting downstream gene expression in target cells. STAT3 inhibition in patients' AML cells limits their immunosuppressive potential by reduced arginase expression, thereby partly restoring T-cell proliferation. Partly chemically modified CpG-STAT3dODNs have >60 hours serum half-life which allows for IV administration to leukemia-bearing mice (50% effective dose approximately 2.5 mg/kg). Repeated administration of CpG-STAT3dODN resulted in regression of human MV4-11 AML in mice. The antitumor efficacy of this strategy is further enhanced in immunocompetent mice by combining direct leukemia-specific cytotoxicity with immunogenic effects of STAT3 blocking/TLR9 triggering. CpG-STAT3dODN effectively reducedCbfb/MYH11/MplAML burden in various organs and eliminated leukemia stem/progenitor cells, mainly through CD8/CD4 T-cell-mediated immune responses. In contrast, small-molecule Janus kinase 2/STAT3 inhibitor failed to reproduce therapeutic effects of cell-selective CpG-STAT3dODN strategy. These results demonstrate therapeutic potential of CpG-STAT3dODN inhibitors with broad implications for treatment of AML and potentially other hematologic malignancies.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Zhang, Qifang', 'Hossain, Dewan Md Sakib', 'Duttagupta, Priyanka', 'Moreira, Dayson', 'Zhao, Xingli', 'Won, Haejung', 'Buettner, Ralf', 'Nechaev, Sergey', 'Majka, Marcin', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Cai, Qi', 'Swiderski, Piotr', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Kortylewski, Marcin']","['Zhang Q', 'Hossain DM', 'Duttagupta P', 'Moreira D', 'Zhao X', 'Won H', 'Buettner R', 'Nechaev S', 'Majka M', 'Zhang B', 'Cai Q', 'Swiderski P', 'Kuo YH', 'Forman S', 'Marcucci G', 'Kortylewski M']","[""Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA; Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, People's Republic of China;"", 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;', 'Department of Transplantation, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Cracow, Poland;', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA; Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;', 'DNA/RNA Synthesis Core Facility, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA.', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA; Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA; Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA;']",['eng'],"['P30CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA178387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA155367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', '*CpG Islands', 'Drug Stability', 'Genes, cdc/*drug effects/immunology', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Serum/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Escape/*drug effects']",PMC4817311,,2016/01/23 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2016/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30301-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-08-665604 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Mar 31;127(13):1687-700. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-08-665604.

Furthermore, knockdown of HPIP obviously inhibits the protein expression of Shh as well as Smo, Ptc and Gli-1 in A549 cells.

Together with cytogenetic aberrations, these gene mutations are powerful prognostic markers in AML and can be used to guide patient management, for example selection of optimal post-remission therapy. The mutated genes also hold promise as therapeutic targets themselves. We evaluated the applicability of a gene panel for the detection of AML mutations in a diagnostic molecular pathology laboratory. METHODS: Fifty patient samples comprising 46 AML and 4 other myeloid neoplasms were accrued for the study. They consisted of 19 males and 31 females at a median age of 60 years (range: 18-88 years). A total of 54 genes (full coding exons of 15 genes and exonic hotspots of 39 genes) were targeted by 568 amplicons that ranged from 225 to 275 bp. The combined coverage was 141 kb in sequence length. Amplicon libraries were prepared by TruSight myeloid sequencing panel (Illumina, CA) and paired-end sequencing runs were performed on a MiSeq (Illumina) genome sequencer. Sequences obtained were analyzed by in-house bioinformatics pipeline, namely BWA-MEM, Samtools, GATK, Pindel, Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor and a novel algorithm ITDseek. RESULTS: The mean count of sequencing reads obtained per sample was 3.81 million and the mean sequencing depth was over 3000X. Seventy-seven mutations in 24 genes were detected in 37 of 50 samples (74 %). On average, 2 mutations (range 1-5) were detected per positive sample. TP53 gene mutations were found in 3 out of 4 patients with complex and unfavorable cytogenetics. Comparing NGS results with that of conventional molecular testing showed a concordance rate of 95.5 %. After further resolution and application of a novel bioinformatics algorithm ITDseek to aid the detection of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), the concordance rate was revised to 98.2 %. CONCLUSIONS: Gene panel testing by NGS approach was applicable for sensitive and accurate detection of actionable AML gene mutations in the clinical laboratory to individualize patient management. A novel algorithm ITDseek was presented that improved the detection of FLT3-ITD of varying length, position and at low allelic burden.",,"['Au, Chun Hang', 'Wa, Anna', 'Ho, Dona N', 'Chan, Tsun Leung', 'Ma, Edmond S K']","['Au CH', 'Wa A', 'Ho DN', 'Chan TL', 'Ma ES']","['Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, 1/F Li Shu Fan Block, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital 2 Village Road, Happy Valley, Hong Kong, China. chau@hksh.com.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, 1/F Li Shu Fan Block, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital 2 Village Road, Happy Valley, Hong Kong, China. anna.wy.wa@hksh.com.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, 1/F Li Shu Fan Block, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital 2 Village Road, Happy Valley, Hong Kong, China. dona.ny.ho@hksh.com.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, 1/F Li Shu Fan Block, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital 2 Village Road, Happy Valley, Hong Kong, China. tlchan@hksh.com.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, 1/F Li Shu Fan Block, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital 2 Village Road, Happy Valley, Hong Kong, China. eskma@hksh.com.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Diagn Pathol,Diagnostic pathology,101251558,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC4722624,,2016/01/23 06:00,2016/10/12 06:00,['2016/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13000-016-0456-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13000-016-0456-8 [pii]']",epublish,Diagn Pathol. 2016 Jan 22;11:11. doi: 10.1186/s13000-016-0456-8.,,,,20160122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that AS and cyclosporine A (CsA) exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell growth and c-Myc expression in HCT116 cells. AS inhibited the expression of PML, c-Myc, NFATc1, NFATc3, and NFATc4, while stimulating the expression of p53 and NFATc2. Knockdown of PML reduced NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3 and NFATc4 expression while overexpression of p53 stimulated NFATc2-luciferase activity that was further augmented by AS by binding to a set of p53 responsive elements (PREs) on the NFATc2 promoter. Additionally, overexpression of p53 suppressed NFATc3 and NFATc4. Reciprocally, NFATc3 knockdown enhanced p53 while reducing MDM2 expression indicating that NFATc3 is a negative regulator of p53 while a positive regulator of MDM2, consistent with its tumor-promoting property as knockdown of NFATc3 retarded cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in xenograft. In patients with colon cancer, tumor expression of NFATc2 correlated with superior survival, while nuclear NFATc1 with inferior survival. These results indicate that AS differentially regulates NFAT pathway through PML and p53 and reveal an intricate reciprocal regulatory relationship between NFAT proteins and p53 pathway.",,"['Ding, Wenping', 'Tong, Yingying', 'Zhang, Xiuli', 'Pan, Minggui', 'Chen, Siyu']","['Ding W', 'Tong Y', 'Zhang X', 'Pan M', 'Chen S']","['Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Santa Clara, CA.', 'Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Oakland, CA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '44SIJ800OX (arsenic trisulfide)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4726130,,2016/01/23 06:00,2017/01/11 06:00,['2016/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['srep19793 [pii]', '10.1038/srep19793 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Jan 22;6:19793. doi: 10.1038/srep19793.,,,,20160122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major complications of HSCT are graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that targets specific tissues and tumor relapses. However, the mechanisms dictating the anatomical features of GVHD and GVL remain unclear. Here, we show that after HSCT, CTLs exhibited different killing activity in distinct tissues, being highest in the liver and lowest in lymph nodes. Differences were imposed by the microenvironment, partly through differential PD-1 ligand expression, which was strongly elevated in lymph nodes. Two-photon imaging revealed that PD-1 blockade restored CTL sensitivity to antigen and killing in lymph nodes. Weak CTL activity in lymph nodes promoted local tumor escape but could be reversed by anti-PD-1 treatment.

The mechanism of this increase and its reversibility on treatment cessation have never been investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from imatinib-treated patients explored in our renal physiology unit with measurement of glomerular filtration rate (urinary clearance of (51)CrEDTA) and of urinary clearance and tubular secretion of creatinine. Results were compared with those of controls matched for measured glomerular filtration rate, age, gender, and ethnicity. We also analyzed variations of serum creatinine before and during imatinib cessation and after imatinib resumption in patients enrolled in imatinib discontinuation studies. RESULTS: In 4 imatinib-treated patients who underwent thorough renal exploration, the part of creatinine clearance due to tubular secretion was negligible (2.4, 3.1, -1.3, and 2.8 mL/min) and significantly lower than that measured in their respective controls (17.7 +/- 5.6, 43.0 +/- 18.0, 23.1 +/- 6.7, and 18.6 +/- 5.6 mL/min, P < .001). In 1 patient, exploration was repeated after imatinib discontinuation and evidenced a recovery of creatinine tubular secretion (20.3 vs. 17.9 +/- 5.2 mL/min in the control population, P = .2). In 15 patients of imatinib discontinuation studies, a median decrease in serum creatinine of 17.9% was observed after imatinib cessation. Resumption of treatment in 6 patients led to a median increase in serum creatinine of 18.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib completely blunts tubular secretion of creatinine, a previously unreported pharmacologic property. This inhibition increases serum creatinine independently of any glomerular dysfunction and is fully reversible on imatinib cessation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we investigated in vitro generated Langerhans-like cells obtained from the human acute myeloid leukaemia cell line MUTZ-3 (MUTZ-LCs) to study TLR- and cytokine-dependent activation of epidermal DCs. MUTZ-LCs revealed high TLR2 expression and responded robustly to TLR2 engagement, confirmed by increased CD83, CD86, PD-L1 and IDO expression, upregulated IL-6, IL-12p40 and IL-23p19 mRNA levels IL-8 release. TLR2 activation reduced CCR6 and elevated CCR7 mRNA expression and induced migration of MUTZ-LCs towards CCL21. Similar results were obtained by stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta whereas ligands of TLR3 and TLR4 failed to induce a fully mature phenotype. Despite limited cytokine gene expression and production for TLR2-activated MUTZ-LCs, co-culture with naive CD4(+) T cells led to significantly increased IFN-gamma and IL-22 levels indicating Th1 differentiation independent of IL-12. TLR2-mediated effects were blocked by the putative TLR2/1 antagonist CU-CPT22, however, no selectivity for either TLR2/1 or TLR2/6 was observed. Computer-aided docking studies confirmed non-selective binding of the TLR2 antagonist.

METHODS: Hazard ratios (HRs) and relative risks (RRs) of reproductive and marital outcomes were studied for male survivors of cancer in young age (<25 years) and cancer-free male comparisons, born during 1965-1985, by linking compulsory national registries in Norway. RESULTS: Male cancer survivors (n=2687) had reduced paternity (HR: 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.76). This was most apparent in survivors of testicular cancer, brain tumours, lymphoma, leukemia and bone tumours, and when diagnosed with cancer before 15 years of age.

These enzymes regulate metabolism, cell survival, differentiation and DNA repair. SIRT proteins play an important role in the survival and drug resistance of cancer cells. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression and role of SIRT in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We analyzed the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in CLL and normal B cells using the Oncomine database as well as by Western blotting of fresh CLL cells from patients and pro-lymphocytic leukemia (PLL) cell lines, JVM-3 and MEC-2. We showed that both primary CLL cells and JVM-3 and MEC-2 cell lines overexpress high levels of functional SIRT1 and SIRT2. SIRT inhibitors EX-527 and sirtinol impair cell growth, induce ROS production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis in primary CLL cells and cell lines. Using shRNA knock down of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in JVM-3 and MEC-2 cell lines, we showed that expression of both proteins is crucial for the survival of these cells. Furthermore, studies in nutrient deprived conditions suggest a role of SIRT in metabolism in CLL. These results demonstrate that the inhibition of SIRT1 and SIRT2 activity may be a new therapeutic approach for CLL.",,"['Bhalla, Savita', 'Gordon, Leo I']","['Bhalla S', 'Gordon LI']","['a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Lymphoma Program, Department of Medicine and the Robert H.

Previous studies have shown that root extracts are rich in polyphenolic compounds with antibacterial, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. Little is known regarding the anticancer properties of Pelargonium sidoides extracts. Objective This study evaluates the anti-proliferative effects of a Pelargonium sidoides radix mother tincture (PST). Materials and methods The PST was characterized by LC-MS/MS. Anti-proliferative activity was evaluated in the pre-screen panel of the National Cancer Institute (NCI-H460, MCF-7 and SF-268) and the Jurkat leukaemia cell line at concentrations of 0-150 mug/mL. The effect on cell growth was determined with sulphorhodamine B and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays after 72 h. The effect on cell cycle and apoptosis induction in Jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry with propidium iodide and Annexin V: fluorescein isothiocyanate staining. Results Dihydroxycoumarin sulphates, gallic acid as well as gallocatechin dimers and trimers were characterized in PST by mass spectrometry. Moderate anti-proliferative effects with GI50 values between 40 and 80 mug/mL were observed in the NCI-pre-screen panel. Strong activity observed with Jurkat cells with a GI50 value of 6.2 mug/mL, significantly better than positive control 5-fluorouracil (GI50 value of 9.7 mug/mL). The PST arrested Jurkat cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and increased the apoptotic cells from 9% to 21%, while the dead cells increased from 4% to 17%.

This finding has not been reported previously. In 1962, Gibbs and Gibbs described the ES EEG pattern due to its high amplitude (200 to 400 muV). ES are a rare spindle variant that is found in EEGs of 0.05% of normal children (average age, 3 years, with a range of 1 to 12 years), and are even rarer after 11 years. Moreover due to changes in the white matter of the frontal lobe, ES have been associated with such conditions as cerebral palsy and mental retardation, residual brain damage, undefined infections, infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, Menkes' kinky-hair syndrome, congenital muscular dystrophy, hydrocephalus, porencephaly, epilepsy, progressive cerebellar degeneration, and mycoplasma encephalitis. Methotrexate has a notably toxic effect on the central nervous system, with leukoencephalopathy being the most common form. In our case, frontocentral ES were associated with hyperintense lesions in the white matter of the frontal lobe. Lesional deafferentation can be the substrate for an almost continuous ES, since both initiation and termination of spindle oscillations are thought to originate in thalamocortical neurons.

In Iran, cancer is the third cause of death. The present study aimed at providing the incidence rates (crude and agestandardized) of different types of cancers in Sistan and Baluchestan province (Southeastern of Iran). METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively reviewing all new cancer patients registered in Cancer Registry Center of Health Heputy for Sistan and Baluchestan province. Common cancers were defined based on the number of cases and standardized incidence rates. To compute the annual percentage change (APC), joinpoint 4.1.1.1 software was applied. RESULTS: A total of 3535 cases of cancers registered during 2004-2009 were identified. Of these, 46.82% occurred in females and 53.18% in males. The most frequent cancer in women was breast cancer followed by esophagus, skin, colorectal and leukemia. The 5 most frequent cancers in men were stomach, skin, leukemia, esophagus and bladder. Joinpoint analyze showed a significant increasing trend for adjusted standard incidence rate (ASIR) for both sexes (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: According to The results of the present study and comparison to previous studies for other provinces in Iran, cancer incidence in Sistan and Baluchistan is less common but trends of cancers are increasing in Sistan and Baluchestan Province.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of these components on Jurkat leukemia cells as an in vitro T cell model and their molecular mechanisms of activity. METHODS: Cells were cultured in the presence of components and subsequently stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)/calcium ionophore for evaluating interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production. The activation of T cell transcription factors that included nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFATs), activator protein-1 (AP-1; c-Jun/c-Fos), and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB were examined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Thymol and carvacrol at 25 microg/ml significantly reduced IL-2 levels from 119.4 +/- 8pg/ml in control cells treated only with PMA/Calcium ionophore and the solvent to 66.9 +/- 6.4pg/ml (thymol) and 32.3 +/- 3.6pg/ml (carvacrol) and IFN-gamma from 423.7 +/- 19.7pg/ml in control cells to 311.9 +/- 11.6pg/ml (thymol) and 293.5 +/- 16.7pg/ml (carvacrol). Western blot analyses of nuclear extracts showed that the same concentrations of components significantly reduced NFAT-2 to 44.2 +/- 2.7% (thymol) and 91.4 +/- 2.3% (carvacrol) of the control (p<0.05), and c-Fos to 31.2 +/- 6.2% (thymol) and 27.6 +/- 3.1% (carvacrol) of the control (p<0.01). No effects on NFAT-1, c-Jun and phospho-NF-kappaBp65 levels were observed.

CD34+ is a pan marker for human hematopoietic stem cells, including umbilical cord blood stem cell. In comparison to other sources, cord blood CD34+ cells proliferate more rapidly and produce large number of progeny cells. For ex vivo expansion of Umbilical Cord Blood- HSCs/HPCs, different combinations of cytokines have been used in many laboratories. IL2rg cytokines, including IL2, IL7 and IL15, are key cytokines in the regulation of differentiation, proliferation and survival of immune cells. IL2 is important cytokine for T cell survival and proliferation, IL7 involve in B cell development and IL15 is a key cytokine for NK cell development. In this study we evaluated the generation of T cells derived from CD34+ and CD34- cord blood mononuclear cells by using combination of cytokines including IL2, IL7 and IL15. METHODS: Cultured cord blood mononuclear cells were evaluated at distinct time points during 21 days by using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Present study showed that differentiation of T cells derived from CD34+ cord blood mononuclear cells increased by using IL2 and IL7 at different time points. In the other hand IL15 did not show any significant role in generation of T cells from CD34+ cord blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data illustrated that either IL2 or IL7 versus other cytokine combinations, generate more T cell from cord blood CD34 cells, probably this cytokines can be the best condition for ex vivo expansion of UCB HSCs.",,"['Aliyari, Zeynab', 'Soleimanirad, Sara', 'Sayyah Melli, Manizheh', 'Tayefi Nasrabadi, Hamid', 'Nozad Charoudeh, Hojjatollah']","['Aliyari Z', 'Soleimanirad S', 'Sayyah Melli M', 'Tayefi Nasrabadi H', 'Nozad Charoudeh H']","[""Umbilical Cord Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. ; Students' Research Committee, Faculty of medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."", 'Al-Zahra Hospital, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Al-Zahra Hospital, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Tissue Engineering Research Group, Advanced Research School, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Umbilical Cord Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. ; Tissue Engineering Research Group, Advanced Research School, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Adv Pharm Bull,Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,101578021,,,,PMC4708031,,2016/01/23 06:00,2016/01/23 06:01,['2016/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15171/apb.2015.083 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Pharm Bull. 2015 Dec;5(Suppl 1):615-9. doi: 10.15171/apb.2015.083.

Often, relapse occurs in peripheral organs, such as the CNS, which acts as a sanctuary site for leukemia cells to escape anti-cancer treatments. Similar to normal leukocyte migration, leukemia dissemination entails migration of cells from the blood circulation into tissues by extravasation. To extravasate, leukemia cells cross through vascular endothelial walls via a process called transendothelial migration, which requires cytoskeletal remodeling. However, the specific molecular players in leukemia extravasation are not fully known. We examined the role of myosin-IIA a cytoskeletal class II myosin motor protein, in leukemia progression and dissemination into the CNS by use of a mouse model of Bcr-Abl-driven B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Small hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of myosin-IIA did not affect apoptosis or the growth rate of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. However, in an in vivo leukemia transfer model, myosin-IIA depletion slowed leukemia progression and prolonged survival, in part, by reducing the ability of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to engraft efficiently. Finally, myosin-IIA inhibition, either by small hairpin RNA depletion or chemical inhibition by blebbistatin, drastically reduced CNS infiltration of leukemia cells. The effects on leukemia cell entry into tissues were mostly a result of the requirement for myosin-IIA to enable leukemia cells to complete the transendothelial migration process during extravasation. Overall, our data implicate myosin-IIA as a key mediator of leukemia cell migration, making it a promising target to inhibit leukemia dissemination in vivo and potentially reduce leukemia relapses.",['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Wigton, Eric J', 'Thompson, Scott B', 'Long, Robert A', 'Jacobelli, Jordan']","['Wigton EJ', 'Thompson SB', 'Long RA', 'Jacobelli J']","['Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA; and.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA; and Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA; and.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA; and Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, Colorado, USA jacobellij@njhealth.org.']",['eng'],['P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Brain/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",PMC5627497,,2016/01/23 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2016/01/22 06:00'],"['2015/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.1A0815-342R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1A0815-342R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2016 Jul;100(1):143-53. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1A0815-342R.

Among them, the NF-kappaB pathway is constitutively activated by Tax-1, which binds to NF-kappaB proteins and activates the IkappaB kinase (IKK). Upon phosphorylation-dependent IkappaB degradation, NF-kappaB migrates into the nucleus, mediating Tax-1-stimulated gene expression. We show that the transcriptional regulator of major histocompatibility complex class II genes CIITA (class II transactivator), endogenously or ectopically expressed in different cells, inhibits the activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway by Tax-1 and map the region that mediates this effect. CIITA affects the subcellular localization of Tax-1, which is mostly retained in the cytoplasm, and this correlates with impaired migration of RelA into the nucleus. Cytoplasmic and nuclear mutant forms of CIITA reveal that CIITA exploits different strategies to suppress Tax-1-mediated NF-kappaB activation in both subcellular compartments. CIITA interacts with Tax-1 without preventing Tax-1 binding to both IKKgamma and RelA. Nevertheless, CIITA affects Tax-1-induced IKK activity, causing retention of the inactive p50/RelA/IkappaB complex in the cytoplasm. Nuclear CIITA associates with Tax-1/RelA in nuclear bodies, blocking Tax-1-dependent activation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes. Thus, CIITA inhibits cytoplasmic and nuclear steps of Tax-1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. These results, together with our previous finding that CIITA acts as a restriction factor inhibiting Tax-1-promoted HTLV-1 gene expression and replication, indicate that CIITA is a versatile molecule that might also counteract Tax-1 transforming activity. Unveiling the molecular basis of CIITA-mediated inhibition of Tax-1 functions may be important in defining new strategies to control HTLV-1 spreading and oncogenic potential. IMPORTANCE: HTLV-1 is the causative agent of human adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). The viral transactivator Tax-1 plays a central role in the onset of ATLL, mostly by deregulating the NF-kappaB pathway. We demonstrate that CIITA, a key regulator of adaptive immunity, suppresses Tax-1-dependent activation of NF-kappaB by acting at several levels: it retains most of Tax-1 and RelA in the cytoplasm and inhibits their residual functional activity in the nucleus. Importantly, this inhibition occurs in cells that are targets of HTLV-1 infection. These findings are of interest in the field of virology because they expand the current knowledge of the functional relationship between viral products and cellular interactors and provide the basis for a better understanding of the molecular countermeasures adopted by the host cell to antagonize HTLV-1 spreading and transforming properties. Within this framework, our results may contribute to the establishment of novel strategies against HTLV-1 infection and virus-dependent oncogenic transformation.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

The resulting provirus contains identical 5' and 3' peripheral long terminal repeats (LTRs) containing bidirectional promoters. Antisense transcription from the 3' LTR regulates expression of a single gene, hbz, while sense transcription from the 5' LTR controls expression of all other viral genes, including tax. Both the HBZ and Tax proteins are implicated in the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), a T-cell malignancy caused by HTLV-1 infection. However, these proteins appear to harbor opposing molecular functions, indicating that they may act independently and at different time points prior to leukemogenesis. Here, we used bidirectional reporter constructs to test whether transcriptional interference serves as a mechanism that inhibits simultaneous expression of Tax and HBZ. We found that sense transcription did not interfere with antisense transcription from the 3' LTR and vice versa, even with strong transcription emanating from the opposing direction. Therefore, bidirectional transcription across the provirus might not restrict hbz or tax expression. Single-cell analyses revealed that antisense transcription predominates in the absence of Tax, which transactivates viral sense transcription. Interestingly, a population of Tax-expressing cells exhibited antisense but not activated sense transcription. Consistent with the ability of Tax to induce cell cycle arrest, this population was arrested in G(0)/G(1) phase. These results imply that cell cycle arrest inhibits Tax-mediated activation of sense transcription without affecting antisense transcription, which may be important for long-term viral latency. IMPORTANCE: The chromosomally integrated form of the retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) contains identical DNA sequences, known as long terminal repeats (LTRs), at its 5' and 3' ends. The LTRs modulate transcription in both forward (sense) and reverse (antisense) directions. We found that sense transcription from the 5' LTR does not interfere with antisense transcription from the 3' LTR, allowing viral genes encoded on opposite DNA strands to be simultaneously transcribed. Two such genes are tax and hbz, and while they are thought to function at different times during the course of infection to promote leukemogenesis of infected T cells, our results indicate that they can be simultaneously transcribed. We also found that the ability of Tax to induce cell cycle arrest inhibits its fundamental function of activating viral sense transcription but does not affect antisense transcription. This regulatory mechanism may be important for long-term HTLV-1 infection.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Specifically, the drug was identified as a potent inhibitor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is associated with osteoclast differentiation and function. In this study, we assessed the effect of niclosamide on osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Our in vitro study showed that receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation was inhibited by niclosamide, due to inhibition of serine-threonine protein kinase (Akt) phosphorylation, inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (IkappaB), and STAT3 serine(727). Niclosamide decreased the expression of the major transcription factors c-Fos and NFATc1, and thereafter abrogated the mRNA expression of osteoclast-specific genes, including TRAP, OSCAR, alphav/beta3 integrin (integrin alphav, integrin beta3), and cathepsin K (CtsK). In an in vivo model, niclosamide prevented lipopolysaccharide-induced bone loss by diminishing osteoclast activity.

Here, we investigated the potential anti-leukemic activity by WYE-687, a potent mTOR kinase inhibitor. We demonstrated that WYE-687 potently inhibited survival and proliferation of established (HL-60, U937, AML-193 and THP-1 lines) and human AML progenitor cells. Yet, same WYE-687 treatment was non-cytotoxic to the primary peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMCs) isolated from healthy donors. WYE-687 induced caspase-dependent apoptotic death in above AML cells/progenitor cells. On the other hand, the pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), the caspase-3 specific inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) or the caspase-9 specific inhibitor (z-LEHD-fmk) attenuated WYE-687-induced cytotoxicity. At the molecular level, WYE-687 concurrently inhibited activation of mTORC1 (p70S6K1 and S6 phosphorylations) and mTORC2 (AKT Ser-473 and FoxO1/3a phosphorylations), whiling downregulating mTORC1/2-regulated genes (Bcl-xL and hypoxia-inducible factor 1/2alpha) in both HL-60/U937 cells and human AML progenitor cells. In vivo, oral administration of WYE-687 potently inhibited U937 leukemic xenograft tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, without causing significant toxicities.

A total of the 269 loci were identified, including 145 protein coding genes mostly important for immunity and 50 noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Biological function of these ncRNAs remains unknown, becoming hot spot in the studies of HLA-associated diseases. The genomic diversity analysis in the HLA region facilitated by next-generation sequencing will pave the way to molecular understanding of linkage disequilibrium structure, population diversity, histocompatibility in transplantation, and associations with autoimmune diseases. The 4-digit DNA genotyping of HLA for six HLA loci, HLA-A through DP, in the patients with Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) identified six susceptible and three resistant HLA alleles. Their epistatic interactions in controlling the development of these diseases are shown. Four susceptible and one resistant HLA alleles are shared by GD and HT. Two HLA alleles associated with GD or HT control the titers of autoantibodies to thyroid antigens. All these observations led us to propose a new model for the development of GD and HT. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from unrelated donor (UR-HSCT) provides a natural experiment to elucidate the role of allogenic HLA molecules in immune response. Large cohort studies using HLA allele and clinical outcome data have elucidated that (1) HLA locus, allele, and haplotype mismatches between donor and patient, (2) specific amino acid substitution at specific positions of HLA molecules, and (3) ethnic background are all responsible for the immunological events related to UR-HSCT including acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect, and graft failure.",['(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We reported previously that TET1, the founding member of the TET methylcytosine dioxygenase family, plays an essential oncogenic role in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is overexpressed owing to MLL-fusion-mediated direct up-regulation at the transcriptional level. Here we show that the overexpression of TET1 in MLL-rearranged AML also relies on the down-regulation of miR-26a, which directly negatively regulates TET1 expression at the post-transcriptional level. Through inhibiting expression of TET1 and its downstream targets, forced expression of miR-26a significantly suppresses the growth/viability of human MLL-rearranged AML cells, and substantially inhibits MLL-fusion-mediated mouse hematopoietic cell transformation and leukemogenesis. Moreover, c-Myc, an oncogenic transcription factor up-regulated in MLL-rearranged AML, mediates the suppression of miR-26a expression at the transcriptional level. Collectively, our data reveal a previously unappreciated signaling pathway involving the MLL-fusion/MYC dash, verticalmiR-26a dash, verticalTET1 signaling circuit, in which miR-26a functions as an essential tumor-suppressor mediator and its transcriptional repression is required for the overexpression and oncogenic function of TET1 in MLL-rearranged AML.

This fact is linked to the resistance of melanocytes to UVB-induced apoptosis. In this study, we characterized the involvement of Mcl-1L in the regulation of UVB-induced apoptosis in melanocytes and in melanoma cells. In melanocytes, apoptosis was not evident at 24 h after UVB irradiation. The Mcl-1L expression increased after UVB irradiation, and the high Mcl-1L expression continued for at least 24 h. This UVB-dependent increase in Mcl-1L was mediated by the MEK-ERK-pS-STAT3 (STAT3 phosphorylated at Ser727) pathway. The Ser727 phosphorylation facilitated nuclear localization of STAT3. In melanoma cells, the expression levels of Mcl-1L varied depending on the cell line. WM39 melanoma cells expressed high levels of Mcl-1L via the MEK-ERK-pS-STAT3 pathway and were resistant to UVB-induced apoptosis without up-regulation of Mcl-1L. In melanocytes and in WM39 cells, transfection with Mcl-1 siRNA promoted UVB-induced apoptosis. Immunohistochemical studies showed that melanoma cells in in situ lesions expressed high amounts of Mcl-1L. These results indicate that the high expression of Mcl-1L mediated by the MEK-ERK-pS-STAT3 pathway protects melanocytes and melanoma cells from UVB-induced apoptosis.","['(c) 2016 The Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia,', 'Ltd.']","['Fukumoto, Takeshi', 'Iwasaki, Tetsushi', 'Okada, Taro', 'Hashimoto, Takanori', 'Moon, Youbin', 'Sakaguchi, Masanobu', 'Fukami, Yasuo', 'Nishigori, Chikako', 'Oka, Masahiro']","['Fukumoto T', 'Iwasaki T', 'Okada T', 'Hashimoto T', 'Moon Y', 'Sakaguchi M', 'Fukami Y', 'Nishigori C', 'Oka M']","['Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Related, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Research Center for Environmental Genomics, Organization of Advanced Science and Technology, Kobe University, 1-1 Rokkodai, Nada, Kobe, 657-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Science, 1-1 Rokkodai, Nada, Kobe, 657-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Department of Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Science, 1-1 Rokkodai, Nada, Kobe, 657-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Science, 1-1 Rokkodai, Nada, Kobe, 657-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Related, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Research Center for Environmental Genomics, Organization of Advanced Science and Technology, Kobe University, 1-1 Rokkodai, Nada, Kobe, 657-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Science, 1-1 Rokkodai, Nada, Kobe, 657-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Related, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Related, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Melanocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Melanoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2016/01/23 06:00,2016/10/22 06:00,['2016/01/22 06:00'],"['2015/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/gtc.12330 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Cells. 2016 Feb;21(2):185-99. doi: 10.1111/gtc.12330.

ATRA-related side effects partly contribute to this morbidity, which commonly presents as differentiation syndrome, pseudo tumour cerebri, dermatitis, gastrointestinal disorders, liver dysfunction (raised transaminases) and dryness of skin/eyes. Rarely, ATRA can lead to hypercalcaemia, genital vasculitis, erythaema nodosum and Sweet's syndrome.

Patients aged 60 years or older who were newly diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were analyzed. Sixty-four and 48 patients were treated with DNR-AraC and CAG, respectively. The complete remission rates, 3-year overall survival and event-free survival in the DNR-AraC group were significantly superior to those in the CAG group (65.6% vs. 29.2%, p<0.001, 38.4% vs. 12.3%, p=0.0033, and 20.3% vs. 7.8%, p=0.0030, respectively), although these differences were not statistically significant in multivariate analyses. Next, we calculated a propensity score for selecting the CAG regimen from six factors. The DNR-AraC regimen was associated with better survival than the CAG regimen in a low propensity score group, but there was no difference in survival between regimens in a high propensity score group.

However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors may at best chronicize rather than cure the disease thus current recommendation is to pursue treatment indefinitely. As a consequence, high quality treatment and care must integrate optimal disease control and treatment tolerability. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have an overall favorable safety profile in clinical practice since most adverse events are mild to moderate in intensity. However, recent evidence has emerged that new generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors may sometimes damage vital organs and if not adequately managed, morbidity and mortality may increase. The 2nd generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib is licensed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to imatinib and newly diagnosed chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia. Nilotinib represents an important therapeutic option but it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

In the present study, we aimed to inspect the impact of IKZF1 gene polymorphisms and childhood ALL in a sample of Iranian population who live in south east of Iran. This case-control study was done on 110 children diagnosed with ALL and 120 healthy children. The IKZF1 (rs4132601 T > G, rs11978267 A > G, rs11980379 T > C, and rs10272724 T > C) polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results showed that rs4132601 T > G polymorphism increased the risk of ALL in the codominant (OR = 2.96, 95 % CI = 1.58-5.54, p = 0.0008, TG vs TT; and OR = 2.75, 95 % CI = 1.31-5.76, p = 0.0094, GG vs TT) and dominant (OR = 2.89, 95 % CI = 1.61-5.19, p = 0.0004, TG + GG vs TT) inheritance models. On the other hand, the rs4132601 G allele increased the risk of ALL (OR = 1.86, 95 % CI = 1.28-2.96; p = 0.0011) in comparison with the T allele. We have also showed that rs11980379 T > C variant increased the risk of ALL in codominant (OR = 2.43, 95 % CI = 1.28-4.60, p = 0.0076, TC vs TT; and OR = 2.35, 95 % CI = 1.14-4.85, p = 0.0291, CC vs TT) and dominant (OR = 2.40, 95 % CI = 1.32-4.36, p = 0.0038, TC + CC vs TT) inheritance models. The rs11980379 C allele increased the risk of ALL (OR = 1.59, 95 % CI = 1.10-2.31, p = 0.0151) compared with T allele. Our study also revealed that the rs10272724 T > C polymorphism increased the risk of ALL in codominant (OR = 2.18, 95 % CI = 1.19-3.99, p = 0.0115, TC vs TT; and OR = 2.67, 95 % CI = 1.24-5.77, p = 0.0131, CC vs TT) and dominant (OR = 2.31, 95 % CI = 1.30-4.08, p = 0.0049, TC + CC vs TT) inheritance models. On the one hand, the rs11980379 C allele increased the risk of ALL (OR = 1.70, 95 % CI = 1.17-2.46, p = 0.0062) compared with T allele, while the rs11978267 A/G polymorphism was not associated with ALL risk. In conclusion, our findings confirm the impact of IKZF1 polymorphisms on childhood ALL risk in a sample of Iranian population.

It has been demonstrated that their altered expression is associated with the progression of several solid tumors. Nevertheless, whether these methyltransferases exert any impact in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains unknown. Here, we investigated the gene expression profile of SMYD2 and SMYD3 in 59 samples of CLL and 10 normal B cells. The obtained results were associated with white blood cells (WBC) and platelet counts, ZAP-70 protein expression, and cytogenetic analysis. We found that SMYD2 and SMYD3 are overexpressed in CLL patients and, interestingly, patients with residual expression of both genes presented a high WBC count and complex karyotype. Furthermore, a strong correlation between SMYD2 and SMYD3 gene expression was unveiled. Our data demonstrate the association of a residual expression of SMYD2 and SMYD3 with CLL progression indicators and suggests both genes are regulated by a common transcriptional control in this type of cancer. These results may provide the basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent CLL progression.",,"['Oliveira-Santos, Wilson', 'Rabello, Doralina Amaral', 'Lucena-Araujo, Antonio Roberto', 'de Oliveira, Fabio Morato', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes', 'Pittella Silva, Fabio', 'Saldanha-Araujo, Felipe']","['Oliveira-Santos W', 'Rabello DA', 'Lucena-Araujo AR', 'de Oliveira FM', 'Rego EM', 'Pittella Silva F', 'Saldanha-Araujo F']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia, Av.

The seminal SCID-X1 clinical studies, based on first-generation gammaretroviral vectors, demonstrated good long-term immune reconstitution in most treated patients despite the occurrence of vector-related leukemia in a few of them. This gene therapy has successfully enabled correction of the T cell defect. Natural killer and B cell defects were only partially restored, most likely due to the absence of a conditioning regimen.

Sensitive detection of a leukemia-specific marker (e.g., a mutation in the gene encoding nucleophosmin [NPM1]) could improve prognostication by identifying submicroscopic disease during remission. METHODS: We used a reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay to detect minimal residual disease in 2569 samples obtained from 346 patients with NPM1-mutated AML who had undergone intensive treatment in the National Cancer Research Institute AML17 trial. We used a custom 51-gene panel to perform targeted sequencing of 223 samples obtained at the time of diagnosis and 49 samples obtained at the time of relapse. Mutations associated with preleukemic clones were tracked by means of digital polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Molecular profiling highlighted the complexity of NPM1-mutated AML, with segregation of patients into more than 150 subgroups, thus precluding reliable outcome prediction. The determination of minimal-residual-disease status was more informative. Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients after the second chemotherapy cycle and was associated with a greater risk of relapse after 3 years of follow-up than was an absence of such transcripts (82% vs. 30%; hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and a lower rate of survival (24% vs. 75%; hazard ratio for death, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.47; P<0.001). The presence of minimal residual disease was the only independent prognostic factor for death in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 to 9.15; P<0.001). These results were validated in an independent cohort. On sequential monitoring of minimal residual disease, relapse was reliably predicted by a rising level of NPM1-mutated transcripts. Although mutations associated with preleukemic clones remained detectable during ongoing remission after chemotherapy, NPM1 mutations were detected in 69 of 70 patients at the time of relapse and provided a better marker of disease status. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of minimal residual disease, as determined by quantitation of NPM1-mutated transcripts, provided powerful prognostic information independent of other risk factors.

EBF1, a central component of this network, is essential for B-lymphoid specification and commitment as well as for the maintenance of the B-cell identity. Genetic alterations causing loss of function of these B-lymphopoiesis regulators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of B-lymphoid malignancies, with particular regard to B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (B-ALLs), where their presence is frequently detected. The activity of the B-cell regulatory network may also be disrupted by the aberrant expression of inhibitory molecules. In particular, two multi-zinc finger transcription cofactors named ZNF423 and ZNF521 have been characterised as potent inhibitors of EBF1 and are emerging as potentially relevant contributors to the development of B-cell leukaemias.

However, a significant limitation of NF-kappaB inhibition in the treatment of leukemia is the low efficiency of this technique. NF-kappaB inhibitor treatment induces apoptosis in leukemia cells; however, it additionally causes inflammatory molecules to induce increased sensitivity of healthy hematopoietic cells to cell death signals, therefore limiting its clinical applications. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a key regulator of inflammation, and induces a variety of actions in leukemic and healthy hematopoietic cells. TNF-alpha induces NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent survival signals, promoting the proliferation of leukemia cells. However, in healthy hematopoietic cells, TNF-alpha induces death signaling, an effect which is enhanced by the inhibition of NF-kappaB. Based on these observations, the present study hypothesized that inhibition of TNF-alpha signaling may be able to protect healthy hematopoietic cells and other tissue cells, while increasing the anti-leukemia effects of NF-kappaB inhibition on leukemia cells. The role and underlying molecular mechanisms of TNF-alpha inhibition in the regulation of NF-kappaB inhibition-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells was therefore investigated in the present study. The results indicated that inhibition of TNF-alpha enhanced NF-kappaB inhibition-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. It was also revealed that protein kinase B was significant in the regulation of TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB inhibition-induced apoptosis. During this process, intrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated. A combination of NF-kappaB and TNF-alpha inhibition may be a potential specific and effective novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Dong, Qiao-Mei', 'Ling, Chun', 'Chen, Xuan', 'Zhao, L I']","['Dong QM', 'Ling C', 'Chen X', 'Zhao LI']","['Central Laboratory, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

Whole-exome sequencing revealed the presence of a spontaneous activating mutation in Notch1, one of the most common mutations in human T-ALL, suggesting Idh1 mutations may have the capacity to cooperate with Notch1 to drive T-ALL. To further investigate the Idh1 mutation as an oncogenic driver in the T-cell lineage, we crossed Idh1-KI mice with conditional Trp53 null mice, a well-characterized model of T-cell malignancy, and found that T-cell lymphomagenesis was accelerated in mice bearing both mutations. Because both IDH1 and p53 are known to affect cellular metabolism, we compared the requirements for glucose and glutamine in cells derived from these tumors and found that cells bearing the Idh1 mutation have an increased dependence on both glucose and glutamine. These data suggest that mutant IDH1 contributes to malignancy in the T-cell lineage and may alter the metabolic profile of malignant T cells.",,"['Hao, Zhenyue', 'Cairns, Rob A', 'Inoue, Satoshi', 'Li, Wanda Y', 'Sheng, Yi', 'Lemonnier, Francois', 'Wakeham, Andrew', 'Snow, Bryan E', 'Dominguez-Brauer, Carmen', 'Ye, Jing', 'Larsen, Dana M', 'Straley, Kimberly S', 'Tobin, Erica R', 'Narayanaswamy, Rohini', 'Gaulard, Philippe', 'Mak, Tak W']","['Hao Z', 'Cairns RA', 'Inoue S', 'Li WY', 'Sheng Y', 'Lemonnier F', 'Wakeham A', 'Snow BE', 'Dominguez-Brauer C', 'Ye J', 'Larsen DM', 'Straley KS', 'Tobin ER', 'Narayanaswamy R', 'Gaulard P', 'Mak TW']","['The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada;', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada;', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada;', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada;', 'Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, ON, M3J 1P3, Canada;', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada; Inserm U955, Universite Paris Est and Departement de Pathologie, Groupe Henri-Mondor Albert-Chenevier, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Creteil, 94000 France;', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada;', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada;', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada;', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada;', 'Mbed Pathology, Toronto, Ontario, M5N 2G4, Canada;', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, 02139;', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, 02139;', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, 02139;', 'Inserm U955, Universite Paris Est and Departement de Pathologie, Groupe Henri-Mondor Albert-Chenevier, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Creteil, 94000 France;', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C1, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada tmak@uhnresearch.ca.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Exome', 'Genes, p53', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",PMC4747700,,2016/01/21 06:00,2016/08/09 06:00,['2016/01/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1525354113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1525354113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Feb 2;113(5):1387-92. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1525354113.

Allogeneic NK cell infusions have been adoptively transferred with promising clinical results. We aimed at determining whether the composition of NK graft in terms of frequency of alloreactive NK cells influence the clinical response in a group of elderly AML patients undergoing NK immunotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seventeen AML patients, in first complete remission (CR; median age 64 years, range 53-73) received NK cells from haploidentical KIR-ligand-mismatched donors after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, followed by IL2. To correlate donor NK cell activity with clinical response, donor NK cells were assessed before and after infusion. RESULTS: Toxicity was moderate, although 1 patient died due to bacterial pneumonia and was censored for clinical follow-up. With a median follow-up of 22.5 months (range, 6-68 months), 9 of 16 evaluable patients (0.56) are alive disease-free, whereas 7 of 16 (0.44) relapsed with a median time to relapse of 9 months (range, 3-51 months). All patients treated with molecular disease achieved molecular CR. A significantly higher number of donor alloreactive NK cell clones was observed in responders over nonresponders. The infusion of higher number of alloreactive NK cells was associated with prolonged disease-free survival (0.81 vs. 0.14, respectively;P= 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Infusion of purified NK cells is feasible in elderly AML patients as post-CR consolidation strategy. The clinical efficacy of adoptively transferred haploidentical NK cells may be improved by infusing high numbers of alloreactive NK cells.",['(c)2016 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Curti, Antonio', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Parisi, Sarah', 'Bontadini, Andrea', 'Dan, Elisa', 'Motta, Maria Rosa', 'Rizzi, Simonetta', 'Trabanelli, Sara', 'Ocadlikova, Darina', 'Lecciso, Mariangela', 'Giudice, Valeria', 'Fruet, Fiorenza', 'Urbani, Elena', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Bandini, Giuseppe', 'Bonifazi, Francesca', 'Lewis, Russell E', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Velardi, Andrea', 'Lemoli, Roberto M']","['Curti A', 'Ruggeri L', 'Parisi S', 'Bontadini A', 'Dan E', 'Motta MR', 'Rizzi S', 'Trabanelli S', 'Ocadlikova D', 'Lecciso M', 'Giudice V', 'Fruet F', 'Urbani E', 'Papayannidis C', 'Martinelli G', 'Bandini G', 'Bonifazi F', 'Lewis RE', 'Cavo M', 'Velardi A', 'Lemoli RM']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

At the apex of the hierarchy, hematopoietic stem cells undergo a number of lineage commitment decisions that ultimately lead to the production of polyploid megakaryocytes. On average, megakaryocytes release 10(11) platelets per day into the blood that repair vascular injuries and prevent excessive bleeding. This differentiation process is tightly controlled by exogenous and endogenous factors, which have been the topics of intense research in the hematopoietic field. Indeed, a skewing of megakaryocyte commitment and differentiation may entail the onset of myeloproliferative neoplasms and other preleukemic disorders together with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, whereas quantitative or qualitative defects in platelet production can lead to inherited platelet disorders. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing has prompted mapping of the genomic landscape of these conditions to provide an accurate view of the underlying lesions. The aims of this review are to introduce the physiological pathways of megakaryopoiesis and to present landmark studies on acquired and inherited disorders that target them. These studies have not only introduced a new era in the fields of molecular medicine and targeted therapies but may also provide us with a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying normal megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis that can inform efforts to create alternative sources of megakaryocytes and platelets.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Bianchi, Elisa', 'Norfo, Ruggiero', 'Pennucci, Valentina', 'Zini, Roberta', 'Manfredini, Rossella']","['Bianchi E', 'Norfo R', 'Pennucci V', 'Zini R', 'Manfredini R']","['Centre for Regenerative Medicine Stefano Ferrari, Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; and.', 'Centre for Regenerative Medicine Stefano Ferrari, Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; and Haematopoietic Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Regenerative Medicine Stefano Ferrari, Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; and.', 'Centre for Regenerative Medicine Stefano Ferrari, Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; and.', 'Centre for Regenerative Medicine Stefano Ferrari, Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', '*Blood Platelet Disorders/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Blood Platelets/metabolism/pathology', '*Genetic Diseases, Inborn/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Genome, Human', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', '*Megakaryocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Thrombopoiesis/*genetics']",PMC4841296,,2016/01/21 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2016/01/21 06:00'],"['2015/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30369-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-07-607952 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Mar 10;127(10):1249-59. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-07-607952.

We conducted a retrospective review of 41 pediatric patients with leukemia that underwent a second allo-HCT at our institution. Overall, 53.7 and 43.9 % of patients were alive and disease-free at 1 and 5 years, respectively, after the second allo-HCT. The factors affecting outcome by both univariate and multivariate analysis were interval between transplants and the use of a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen prior to second transplant. Outcomes were inferior in patients who received their second transplant <6 months from their first HCT when compared to patients in whom the interval between HCTs was 6-12 or more than 12 months. Interval between HCTs was also significant when each type of leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) n = 21, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) n = 11, and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) n = 7) was analyzed separately. In univariate analysis, use of the same donor and use of a matched sibling donor resulted in significant improved outcome. There was not a significant association between disease-free survival (DFS) and age, remission status, use of total body irradiation (TBI) before second HCT, or type of leukemia. Second allogeneic HCT can be a curative therapeutic option for leukemia patients relapsing after their first transplant. As more targeted therapies have become available, patients that relapse after first HCT are more likely to achieve remission. Therefore, it is anticipated that there will be more candidates for second HCT with improved performance and remission status, ultimately leading to a better outcome with the second HCT.",,"['Menon, Neethu N', 'Jenkins, Lydia M', 'Cui, Haiyan', 'Jenkins, Craig', 'Anwer, Faiz', 'Yeager, Andrew M', 'Katsanis, Emmanuel']","['Menon NN', 'Jenkins LM', 'Cui H', 'Jenkins C', 'Anwer F', 'Yeager AM', 'Katsanis E']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, PO Box 245073, 1501 N.

GO has shown benefit in both adult and pediatric AML trials, yet limited data exist about whether GO response correlates with CD33 expression level. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CD33 expression levels were prospectively quantified by multidimensional flow cytometry in 825 patients enrolled in Children's Oncology Group AAML0531 and correlated with response to GO. RESULTS: Patients with low CD33 expression (lowest quartile of expression [Q1]) had no benefit with the addition of GO to conventional chemotherapy (relapse risk [RR]: GO 36% v No-GO 34%, P = .731; event-free survival [EFS]: GO 53% v No-GO 58%, P = .456). However, patients with higher CD33 expression (Q2 to Q4) had significantly reduced RR (GO 32% v No-GO 49%, P < .001) and improved EFS (GO 53% v No-GO 41%, P = .005). This differential effect was observed in all risk groups. Specifically, low-risk (LR), intermediate-risk (IR), and high-risk (HR) patients with low CD33 expression had similar outcomes regardless of GO exposure, whereas the addition of GO to conventional chemotherapy resulted in a significant decrease in RR and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with higher CD33 expression (LR RR, GO 13% v No-GO 35%, P = .001; LR DFS, GO 79% v No-GO 59%, P = .007; IR RR, GO 44% v No-GO 57%, P = .044; IR DFS, GO 51% v No-GO 40%, P = .078; HR RR, GO 40% v No-GO 73%, P = .016; HR DFS, GO 47% v No-GO 28%, P = .135). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that GO lacks clinical benefit in patients with low CD33 expression but significantly reduces RR and improves EFS in patients with high CD33 expression, which suggests a role for CD33-targeted therapeutics in subsets of pediatric AML.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Pollard, Jessica A', 'Loken, Michael', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Bernstein, Irwin D', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Pollard JA', 'Loken M', 'Gerbing RB', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hirsch BA', 'Aplenc R', 'Bernstein ID', 'Gamis AS', 'Alonzo TA', 'Meshinchi S']","[""Jessica A.

The activity of RIPK3 is controlled by phosphorylation. Once activated, RIPK3 phosphorylates and activates the downstream effector mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) to induce necroptosis. In certain situations, RIPK3 has also been shown to promote apoptosis or cytokine expression in a necroptosis and kinase-independent manner. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for selective degradation of cellular proteins and thus has a critical role in many cellular processes such as cell survival and cell death. Clinically, proteasome inhibition has shown promise as an anti-cancer agent. Here we show that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib activate the RIPK3-MLKL necroptotic pathway in mouse fibroblasts as well as human leukemia cells. Unlike necroptosis induced by classical TNF-like cytokines, necroptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors does not require caspase inhibition. However, an intact RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) is essential. Surprisingly, when recruitment of MLKL to RIPK3 is restricted, proteasome inhibitors induced RIPK3-dependent apoptosis. Proteasome inhibition led to accumulation of K48-linked ubiquitinated RIPK3, which was partially reduced when Lys-264 was mutated. Taken together, these results reveal the ubiquitin-proteasome system as a novel regulatory mechanism for RIPK3-dependent necroptosis.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Moriwaki, Kenta', 'Chan, Francis Ka-Ming']","['Moriwaki K', 'Chan FK']","['From the Department of Pathology, Immunology and Microbiology Program, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Immunology and Microbiology Program, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.

Molecular genetic technologies are currently widely used in clinical research. In contrast, sensitive and high-throughput proteomic techniques for performing protein analyses in patient samples are still lacking. Here, we used a technology based on size exclusion chromatography followed by immunoprecipitation of target proteins with an antibody bead array (Size Exclusion Chromatography-Microsphere-based Affinity Proteomics, SEC-MAP) to detect hundreds of proteins from a single sample. In addition, we developed semi-automatic bioinformatics tools to adapt this technology for high-content proteomic screening of pediatric acute leukemia patients.To confirm the utility of SEC-MAP in leukemia immunophenotyping, we tested 31 leukemia diagnostic markers in parallel by SEC-MAP and flow cytometry. We identified 28 antibodies suitable for both techniques. Eighteen of them provided excellent quantitative correlation between SEC-MAP and flow cytometry (p< 0.05). Next, SEC-MAP was applied to examine 57 diagnostic samples from patients with acute leukemia. In this assay, we used 632 different antibodies and detected 501 targets. Of those, 47 targets were differentially expressed between at least two of the three acute leukemia subgroups. The CD markers correlated with immunophenotypic categories as expected. From non-CD markers, we found DBN1, PAX5, or PTK2 overexpressed in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias, LAT, SH2D1A, or STAT5A overexpressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and HCK, GLUD1, or SYK overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemias. In addition, OPAL1 overexpression corresponded to ETV6-RUNX1 chromosomal translocation.In summary, we demonstrated that SEC-MAP technology is a powerful tool for detecting hundreds of proteins in clinical samples obtained from pediatric acute leukemia patients. It provides information about protein size and reveals differences in protein expression between particular leukemia subgroups. Forty-seven of SEC-MAP identified targets were validated by other conventional method in this study.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Kanderova, Veronika', 'Kuzilkova, Daniela', 'Stuchly, Jan', 'Vaskova, Martina', 'Brdicka, Tomas', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Lund-Johansen, Fridtjof', 'Kalina, Tomas']","['Kanderova V', 'Kuzilkova D', 'Stuchly J', 'Vaskova M', 'Brdicka T', 'Fiser K', 'Hrusak O', 'Lund-Johansen F', 'Kalina T']","['From the double daggerCLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2 Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, V Uvalu 84, 15006 Prague 5, Czech Republic;', 'From the double daggerCLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2 Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, V Uvalu 84, 15006 Prague 5, Czech Republic;', 'From the double daggerCLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2 Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, V Uvalu 84, 15006 Prague 5, Czech Republic;', 'From the double daggerCLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2 Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, V Uvalu 84, 15006 Prague 5, Czech Republic;', 'section signInstitute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic; Videnska 1083, 14220 Prague, Czech Republic;', 'From the double daggerCLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2 Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, V Uvalu 84, 15006 Prague 5, Czech Republic;', 'From the double daggerCLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2 Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, V Uvalu 84, 15006 Prague 5, Czech Republic;', 'paragraph signDepartment of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet; Sognsvannsveien 20, 0372 Oslo, Norway.', 'From the double daggerCLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2 Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, V Uvalu 84, 15006 Prague 5, Czech Republic; tomas.kalina@lfmotol.cuni.cz.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,['0 (Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies/*pharmacology', 'Automation, Laboratory', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Gel/*methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods']",PMC4824853,,2016/01/21 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/01/21 06:00'],"['2015/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)33619-7 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M115.054593 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2016 Apr;15(4):1246-61. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M115.054593.

Deletion of the BCR, or its signal transducing chaperone Igbeta, leads to rapid loss of mature B cells, indicating that signals initiated at the BCR are crucial for B cell survival. BAFF or BAFF-R deficiency also significantly reduces the numbers of mature B cells despite normal BCR expression. Together, these observations indicate that continued BCR and BAFF-R signaling are essential for the survival of mature resting B cells in the periphery. Here we demonstrate that tonic BCR signals up-regulate p100 (Nfkb2) as well as Mcl-1 protein expression at a post-transcriptional level via a PI3K-dependent pathway. p100 expression is mTOR-independent, whereas Mcl-1 expression is mTOR-dependent. BAFF treatment further elevated Mcl-1 levels by an mTOR-independent pathway, while consuming p100. Accordingly, Mcl-1 induction by BAFF is abrogated in Nfkb2-/- B cells. We propose that the cumulative effects of the BCR and BAFF-R signaling pathways increase Mcl-1 levels beyond the threshold required for B cell survival.",,"['Kaileh, Mary', 'Vazquez, Estefania', 'MacFarlane, Alexander W 4th', 'Campbell, Kerry', 'Kurosaki, Tomohiro', 'Siebenlist, Ulrich', 'Sen, Ranjan']","['Kaileh M', 'Vazquez E', 'MacFarlane AW 4th', 'Campbell K', 'Kurosaki T', 'Siebenlist U', 'Sen R']","['Gene Regulation Section, Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Division of Basic Science, Institute for Cancer Research, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Division of Basic Science, Institute for Cancer Research, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Differentiation, WPI Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Gene Regulation Section, Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Nfkb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfrsf13c protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/pharmacology', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC4718598,,2016/01/20 06:00,2016/07/29 06:00,['2016/01/20 06:00'],"['2015/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0146955 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-37559 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jan 19;11(1):e0146955. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0146955. eCollection 2016.,,,,20160119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite the potential clinical gains with allo-HSCT, the post-transplantation outcomes for many patients, especially those with high-risk disease, remain dismal. Patients with AML who have internal tandem duplication mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) face particularly poor outcomes, even after allo-HSCT, which appears to only partially mitigate the poor prognosis associated with this mutation. Experimental treatments to reduce the likelihood of relapse and improve survival following allo-HSCT include maintenance with FLT3-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), several of which are currently being evaluated in clinical studies. Preliminary data and case reports suggest that FLT3 TKIs can be effective in the post-transplantation setting, particularly for patients with FLT3-ITD mutations. Improvements in donor matching, transplantation procedures, and supportive care have allowed a greater number of patients to undergo allo-HSCT than ever before. For these patients, it is essential to identify effective post-transplantation therapies to reduce the risk of relapse and improve disease-free survival.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and alloHSCT in children is safe, feasible, and may be associated with less adverse effects. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) induces a response in 30% of patients with CD33+ relapsed/refractory AML. The dose of GO is significantly lower when combined with chemotherapy. We examined the feasibility and toxicity of RIC alloHSCT followed by GO targeted immunotherapy in children with CD33+ AML in CR1/CR2. Conditioning consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m2 x 6 days, busulfan 3.2 to 4 mg/kg x 2 days +/- rabbit antithymocyte globulin 2 mg/kg x 4 days followed by alloHSCT from matched related/unrelated donors. GO was administered >/=60 days after alloHSCT in 2 doses (8 weeks apart), following a dose-escalation design (4.5, 6, 7.5, and 9 mg/m2). Fourteen patients with average risk AML received RIC alloHSCT and post-GO consolidation: median age 13.5 years at transplant (range, 1 to 21), male-to-female 8:6, and disease status at alloHSCT 11 CR1 and 3 CR2. Eleven patients received alloHSCT from 5-6/6 HLA-matched family donors: 8 received peripheral blood stem cells, 2 received bone marrow, and 1 received related cord blood transplantation. Three patients received an unrelated allograft (two 4-5/6 and one 9/10) from unrelated cord blood unit and bone marrow, respectively. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was observed in all assessable patients (100%), achieved at median 15.5 days (range, 7 to 31) and 21 days (range, 10 to 52), respectively. Three patients received GO at dose level 1 (4.5 mg/m2 per dose), 5 at dose level 2 (6 mg/m2 per dose), 3 at dose level 3 (7.5 mg/m2 per dose), and 3 at dose level 4 (9 mg/m2 per dose). Three of 14 patients received only 1 dose of GO after alloHSCT. One patient experienced grade III transaminitis, which resolved; no grade IV transaminitis, no grade III/IV hyperbilirubinemia, or sinusoidal obstructive syndrome were observed. The second dose of GO was given at median of 143 days (range, 120 to 209) after alloHSCT. Probability of grades II to IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were 21% and 33.5%, respectively. Probability of overall survival after RIC alloHSCT and GO consolidation at 1 and 5 years was 78% and 61%, respectively. Probability of 5-year event-free survival after RIC alloHSCT and GO consolidation in patients in CR1 was 78%. No dose-limiting toxicities probably or directly related to GO were observed in this cohort. This preliminary data demonstrate that RIC followed by alloHSCT and consolidation with GO appears to be safe in children and adolescents with CD33+ AML in CR1/CR2. A phase II trial is currently underway investigating this approach with a GO dose of 9 mg/m2 per dose.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

They are at high risk of bacteremia secondary to being immunocompromised. Recent reports indicate that procalcitonin (PCT) is a useful marker of bacteremia in children. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the clinical utility of PCT as a rapid marker of bacteremia in children with ALL presenting to the ED with a fever. In addition, we compared the results of PCT with white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were conducted of 492 patients with a total of 735 visits presenting to the ED from January 2009 to June 2012 with fever and a history of ALL where a PCT and a blood culture (BC) were obtained,. Positive BCs determined to be contaminants were excluded. The predictive powers of PCT, WBC, ESR, and CRP for bacteremia were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with 95% confidence intervals (CI). In addition, each of the 4 markers were also examined in a logistic regression model as a potential predictor of the BC result. RESULTS: A total of 735 PCT values were correlated with BC results. There were 76 (10.3%) true-positive BCs. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.729 (95% CI, 0.661-0.792) for PCT, 0.685 (95% CI, 0.531-0.823) for ESR, 0.622 (95% CI, 0.460-0.796) for CRP, and 0.567 (95% CI, 0.483-0.649) for WBC. When logistic regression was used, the transformation log PCT was significantly associated with BC result whereas each of the other 3 markers, after appropriate transformation to remove heavy skewness, was not significant (all P > 0.1). A doubling of PCT was associated with an odds ratio of 1.32 for positive BCs (95% CI, 1.15-1.53). CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin value was significantly associated with positive BC (P < 0.0001). The diagnostic performance of PCT was better than the other markers of inflammation. Its use in the ED in a select population of patients may be of significant value in identifying bacteremia.

However, the peptide epitope of PEPP2 that is recognized by cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is unknown. In this study, we revealed that PEPP2 gene was highly expressed in myeloid leukemia cells and some other hematological malignancies. This gene was also expressed in leukemic stem-like cells. We next identified the first reported epitope peptide (PEPP2(271-279)). The CTLs induced by PEPP2(271-279) recognized PEPP2-positive target cells in an HLA-A*24:02-restricted manner. We also found that a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, could enhance PEPP2 expression in leukemia cells but not in blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. The cytotoxic activity of anti-PEPP2 CTL against leukemic cells treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was higher than that directed against untreated cells.

Despite this, data on the course of hematological cancers among the oldest patients are sparse with many intervention studies focusing on younger age groups. The aim of this study is to present Danish incidence and mortality rates among older patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nationwide population-based study presenting the incidence, prevalence and mortality rates of NHL, MM, and AML with a focus on the elderly population in Denmark during the last few decades. Data were drawn from the NORDCAN database. RESULTS: Incidence rates of NHL, MM, CLL and AML were 10-50 times higher among the population aged 70 years or more than among the younger population. An increasing incidence with stable or decreased mortality rates was seen mainly among elderly patients with NHL during the last few decades, leading to increased survival and a greater prevalence of patients with NHL. Increased relative survival and prevalence could also be seen among elderly patients with MM and CLL, while the trends of the incidence rates were inconclusive for these diseases. Survival among patients with AML improved most notably in those aged below 70 years leading to an increased prevalence of AML patients predominantly in this age group.

Our goal was to identify the optimal sequential treatment strategy in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness for CML patients within the US health care context. We evaluated 18 treatment strategies regarding survival, quality-adjusted survival, and costs. For model parameters, the literature data, expert surveys, registry data, and economic databases were used. Evaluated strategies included imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib, stem-cell transplantation (SCT), and chemotherapy. We developed a Markov state-transition model, which was analyzed as a cohort simulation over a lifelong time horizon with a third-party payer perspective and discount rate of 3%. Remaining life expectancies ranged from 5.4 years (3.9 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) for chemotherapy treatment without TKI to 14.4 years (11.1 QALYs) for nilotinib-->dasatinib-->chemotherapy/SCT. In the economic evaluation, imatinib-->chemotherapy/SCT resulted in an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $171,700/QALY compared to chemotherapy without TKI. Imatinib-->nilotinib-->chemotherapy/SCT yielded an ICUR of $253,500/QALY compared to imatinib-->chemotherapy/SCT. Nilotinib-->dasatinib-->chemotherapy/SCT yielded an ICUR of $445,100/QALY compared to imatinib-->nilotinib-->chemotherapy/SCT. All remaining strategies were excluded due to dominance of the clinically superior strategies.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether combining VD3 with adenanthin, a peroxiresoxin I (Prx I)targeting natural compound, improves the efficacy of VD3. Cell viability was assessed using a trypan blue exclusion assay and flow cytometry was used to evaluate the expression of cell surface markers, CD11b/CD14, and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Wright's staining was used to examine morphological changes and RNAinterference was used to knockdown Prx I and p65 gene expression. Protein expression was determined by western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that adenanthin markedly enhanced VD3induced cell differentiation of leukemia NB4 cells, as evidenced by the increased percentage of CD11b and CD14positive cells, the mature morphology of the monocytes and the increased phagocytic ability. Consistent with these results, knockdown of Prx I, but not nuclear factorkappaB (p65), enhanced VD3induced cell differentiation. The combinatorial effects of adenanthin and VD3 were shown to be associated with the ROSCCAATenhancerbinding protein (C/EBP)beta axis, since Nacetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger, was able to abrogate the differentiationenhancing effects of adenanthin, and the knockdown of C/EBPbeta also inhibited the combinatorial effects of adenanthin and VD3. In addition, cotreatment with adenanthin and VD3 was able to induce differentiation in other nonacute promyelocytic leukemia cells and primary leukemia cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed a novel role for Prx I in VD3induced cell differentiation, and suggested that targeting Prx I may represent a novel strategy to enhance VD3induced leukemia cell differentiation.",,"['Wei, Wei', 'Liu, Chuanxu', 'Qin, Dongjun', 'Song, Lili', 'Xia, Li', 'Lei, Hu', 'Yu, Yun', 'Wang, Weiwei', 'Pu, Jianxin', 'Sun, Handong', 'Wu, Yingli', 'Xu, Hanzhang', 'Hao, Siguo']","['Wei W', 'Liu C', 'Qin D', 'Song L', 'Xia L', 'Lei H', 'Yu Y', 'Wang W', 'Pu J', 'Sun H', 'Wu Y', 'Xu H', 'Hao S']","['Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, P.R.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-three patients (37 males, mean age 12.4 years old) with ALL after treatment underwent a lower-limb MR examination between November 2006 and March 2012. In 47 there was clinical suspicion of ON, 26 were asymptomatic. Studies were performed with a 1 T and a 1.5 T scanner, acquiring short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T1-weighted sequences in coronal plane from the hips to the ankles. The average acquisition time was 18 min. Considering baseline and follow-up examinations, the overall number of MRI studies was 195. RESULTS: Fifty-four of 73 patients showed ON at MRI study, with an overall number of 323 ON (89 involving articular surface, 24 with joint deformity, JD). Twenty-five of 47 symptomatic patients showed subchondral ON lesions, 11 developed JD. Three of 26 asymptomatic patients showed subchondral bone ON at baseline examination but no JD at follow-up. Twenty-two of 28 BMT, 32/45 CHT patients developed ON. CONCLUSION: Our MRI protocol proved to be feasible in evaluating ON in paediatric patients.

BRAF mutation analysis is employed as an ancillary tool in indeterminate cases, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association management guidelines. Hereby, we report the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented an 8-mm-size, ill-defined, left thyroid nodule. FNA resulted ""suspicious for papillary thyroid carcinoma"". BRAF mutation status was analyzed, and somatic BRAF (V600E) mutation identified. The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy. At histological examination, the nodule was composed of Langerhans cells, admixed with many eosinophils. A final diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the thyroid was made. Our case emphasizes the critical diagnostic pitfalls due to the use of BRAF (V600E) mutation analysis in thyroid FNA. Notably, BRAF (V600E) mutation is common in melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, brain tumors, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, and histiocytoses. Therefore, in cases of indeterminate FNA with unclassifiable atypical cells BRAF (V600E) mutated, the possibility of a localization of hystiocytosis or a secondary thyroid malignancy should be taken into account.",,"['Kuhn, Elisabetta', 'Ragazzi, Moira', 'Zini, Michele', 'Giordano, Davide', 'Nicoli, Davide', 'Piana, Simonetta']","['Kuhn E', 'Ragazzi M', 'Zini M', 'Giordano D', 'Nicoli D', 'Piana S']","['Pathology Unit, Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova-IRCCS, Viale Risorgimento 80, 42123, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova-IRCCS, Viale Risorgimento 80, 42123, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Endocrinology Unit and Thyroid Diseases Center, Arcispedale S.

In cattle, the most important example of the relationship between the MHC and infectious diseases has been established by the resistance to Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection. The association of the bovine MHC class II BoLA-DRB3.2 alleles with BLV infection profiles was examined. BoLA-DRB3.2 allelic diversity was determined in 190 Iranian Holstein cattle using direct sequencing method. Association of the DRB3.2 alleles with BLV infection profiles was found as the odds ratio. Effects of the alleles on lymphocyte subsets were also evaluated by multivariate regression analysis and GLM procedures. The studied cattle were categorized into three groups: BLV seronegative, BLV seropositive with persistent lymphocytosis (PL), and BLV seropositive with lymphosarcoma (LS). The PL profile was significantly associated with the BoLA-DRB3.2*0101, *1101 and *4201 alleles, although the *3202 allele mediating resistance to PL was observed. Significant association was found between the BoLA-DRB3.2*1802, *3202, and *0901 alleles and susceptibility to LS, while the *0101 and *1101 alleles were associated with resistance to LS. BoLA-DRB3.2 alleles also showed a significant correlation with CD4, CD8, CD21 cells and CD4/CD8 ratio. Allelic differences influence the immune response to BLV infection and developing the disease profile.

The aim of this work was to explore the utility of CD99 paranuclear staining in the differential diagnosis of MCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We explore paranuclear dot-like CD99 expression in several small, round blue cell neoplasms, including neuroendocrine neoplasms, Ewing sarcomas/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (EWS/PNET), melanomas, small cell lung carcinomas (SCC), lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, and rhabdomyosarcomas, in comparison with 33 cases of MCC, to determine the specificity of the paranuclear dot-like CD99 expression in MCC. RESULTS: Twenty MCC (60%) demonstrated focal expression of CD99 and of those, 14 (42.4%) showed the characteristic paranuclear dot-like expression. CD99 was also paranuclear positive in 4 of 11 (36%) SCC, in 3 of 7 (43%) EWS/PNET, in 1 of 6 (16%) lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia cases, in 3 of 3 (100%) rhabdomyosarcomas and all melanomas were negative for the CD99 reaction. CONCLUSION: CD99 paranuclear dot-like expression was not exclusive of the MCC compared with several neoplasms included in its differential diagnosis.

These CT examinations are associated with absorbed doses that are much higher than those associated with conventional radiology. In comparison to adults, children have a greater sensitivity to radiation and a longer life span with more years at cancer risks. Five epidemiological studies on cancer risks after CT scan exposure during childhood were published between 2012 and 2015. The results of these studies are consistent and show an increase of cancer risks in children who have been exposed to several CT scans. However, methodological limits due to indication bias, retrospective assessment of radiation exposure from CT scans and lack of statistical power are to be taken into consideration. International projects such as EPI-CT (Epidemiological study to quantify risks for pediatric computerized tomography and to optimize dose), with a focus on dosimetric reconstruction and minimization of bias will provide more precise results. In the meantime, available results reinforce the necessity of justification and optimization of doses.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

Although many inducible and genetic animal models mimicking the selected aspects of SSc have been well documented, the lack of models encompassing the full clinical manifestations hindered the development and preclinical testing of therapies against this disease. Under this situation, three new genetic animal models have recently been established, such as Fra2 transgenic mice, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor deficient mice and Klf5(+/-) ;Fli1(+/-) mice, all of which recapitulate the pathological cascade of SSc. The former two murine models demonstrate endothelial cell apoptosis and capillary loss followed by tissue fibrosis, whereas the immune systems show no remarkable abnormality. Klf5(+/-) ;Fli1(+/-) mice develop immune activation, vasculopathy and tissue fibrosis in this sequence, eventually resulting in the development of dermal fibrosis, interstitial lung disease and pulmonary vascular involvement resembling those of SSc. Because Krueppel-like factor (KLF)5 and Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (Fli1) are the transcription factors epigenetically suppressed in SSc dermal fibroblasts, the reproduction of SSc manifestations in Klf5(+/-) ;Fli1(+/-) mice supports the canonical idea that environmental influences play a central role in the development of SSc in genetically predisposed individuals.

Because AML in older adults is a heterogeneous disease, it is important to identify those who are unlikely to benefit from induction therapy based on information available at the initial assessment. We used next-generation sequencing to analyze TP53 mutation status in AML patients aged 60 years or older, and evaluated its effects on outcomes. TP53 mutations were detected in 12 of 77 patients (16 %), and there was a significant association between TP53 mutations and monosomal karyotype. Patients with TP53 mutations had significantly worse survival than those without (P = 0.009), and multivariate analysis identified TP53 mutation status as the most significant prognostic factor for survival. Neverthelsess, TP53-mutated patients had a 42 % chance of complete remission and a median survival of 8.0 months, which compares favorably with those who did not undergo induction therapy, even in the short term.

Three leukemia cell lines (HL60, Jurkat and U937) were used in this study. A Cell Counting kit8 assay was performed to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of REG on leukemia cell lines, and flow cytometric analysis was used to detect REGinduced apoptosis. In addition, western blot analysis was conducted to detect the levels of apoptosisrelated proteins including, cytochrome c, cleaved (c)caspases3 and 9, Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and Bcl2associated protein x (Bax). Finally, a HL60 cell xenograft model in nude mice was used to evaluate the antitumor effect of REG on leukemia in vivo. The present results indicated that REG can significantly inhibit the proliferation of HL60, Jurkat and U937 cell lines in a concentration and timedependent manner. The half maximal inhibitory concentration values were 38.4, 49.1 and 48.2 microg/ml for HL60, Jurkat and U937 cells, respectively. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that REG can induce the apoptosis of HL60 cells, as well as increase the levels of cytochrome c, ccaspases3 and 9, and Bax, as well as downregulate the expression of Bcl2. In vivo, REG was found to possess a marked anticancer effect on leukemia.

The experimental size dependence of the extinction and emission spectra for silver nanoparticles were also studied. The nanoparticles were functionalized with fluorescent glycine dimers. Spectral position of the resonance extinction and photoluminescence emission for particles with average diameters ranging from 9 to 32 nm were examined. As the particle size increased, the spectral peaks for both extinction and the intrinsic emission of silver nanoparticles shifted to the red end of the spectrum. The intrinsic photoluminescence of the particles was orders of magnitude weaker and was spectrally separated from the photoluminescence of the glycine dimer ligands. The spectral position of the ligand emission was independent of the particle size; however, the quantum yield of the nanoparticle-ligand system was size-dependent. This was attributed to the enhancement of the ligand's emission caused by the local electric field strength's dependence on the particle size. The maximum quantum yield determined for the nanoparticle-ligand complex was (5.2 +/- 0.1) %. The nanoparticles were able to penetrate cell membranes of rat basophilic leukemia and neural stem cells fixed with paraformaldehyde. Additionally, toxicity studies were performed.

We analyzed the association between canine miRNA genes and cancer-associated regions (deleted and amplified regions) using previously published array of comparative genomic hybridization data on 268 canine cancer samples-comprising osteosarcoma, breast cancer, leukemia, and colorectal cancer. We also assessed this relationship apropos the incidence of miRNA genes in the CpG islands of the canine genome assembly. The association was evaluated using the mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis. Our analyses revealed that 135 miRNA genes were exactly located in the aberrated regions: 77 (57 %) in the loss and 58 (43 %) in amplified regions. Our findings indicated that the miRNA genes were located more frequently in the deleted regions as well as in the CpG islands than in all other regions.

However, clonal tumor expansion from complex normal tissue architectures potentially obscures cancer-specific events, including divergent epigenetic patterns. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of normal B cell subsets, we observed broad epigenetic programming of selective transcription factor binding sites coincident with the degree of B cell maturation. By comparing normal B cells to malignant B cells from 268 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we showed that tumors derive largely from a continuum of maturation states reflected in normal developmental stages. Epigenetic maturation in CLL was associated with an indolent gene expression pattern and increasingly favorable clinical outcomes. We further uncovered that most previously reported tumor-specific methylation events are normally present in non-malignant B cells. Instead, we identified a potential pathogenic role for transcription factor dysregulation in CLL, where excess programming by EGR and NFAT with reduced EBF and AP-1 programming imbalances the normal B

The reason for this is unknown. We hypothesized that ATG at concentrations achieved with our standard ATG dose of 4.5 mg/kg exerts antileukemic activity. We measured ATG-induced killing of leukemic blasts via complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and via complement-independent cytotoxicity (CIC) in marrow or blood from 36 patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. The median percentage of blasts killed by CDC was 0.3% at 1 mg/L ATG, 2.8% at 10 mg/L ATG, 12.6% at 25 mg/L ATG, and 42.2% at 50 mg/L ATG. The median percentage of blasts killed by CIC after a 4-hour incubation with ATG was 1.9% at 1 mg/L ATG, 7.15% at 10 mg/L ATG, 12.1% at 25 mg/L ATG, and 13.9% at 50 mg/L ATG. CIC appeared to represent a direct induction of apoptosis by ATG. There was a high variability in the sensitivity of the blasts to ATG; at 50 mg/L, the percentage of blasts killed ranged from 2.6% to 97.2% via CDC and from 1.4% to 69.9% via CIC. In conclusion, ATG at clinically relevant concentrations kills leukemic blasts in vitro. Some acute leukemias are highly sensitive to ATG, whereas others are relatively resistant.

Currently, the genetic identity of laboratory mice is primarily confirmed by surveying polymorphisms in selected sets of ""conventional"" genes and/or microsatellites in the absence of a single completely sequenced mouse genome. First, we examined variations in the genomic landscapes of transposable repetitive elements, named the TREome, in conventional and genetically engineered mouse strains using murine leukemia virus-type endogenous retroviruses (MLV-ERVs) as a probe. A survey of the genomes from 56 conventional strains revealed strain-specific TREome landscapes, and certain families (e.g., C57BL) of strains were discernible with defined patterns. Interestingly, the TREome landscapes of C3H/HeJ (toll-like receptor-4 [TLR4] mutant) inbred mice were different from its control C3H/HeOuJ (TLR4 wild-type) strain. In addition, a CD14 knock-out strain had a distinct TREome landscape compared to its control/backcross C57BL/6J strain. Second, an examination of superantigen (SAg, a ""TREome gene"") coding sequences of mouse mammary tumor virus-type ERVs in the genomes of the 46 conventional strains revealed a high diversity, suggesting a potential role of SAgs in strain-specific immune phenotypes. The findings from this study indicate that unexplored and intricate genomic variations exist in laboratory mouse strains, both conventional and genetically engineered. The TREome-based high-resolution genetics surveillance system for laboratory mice would contribute to efficient study design with quality control and accurate data interpretation. This genetics system can be easily adapted to other species ranging from plants to humans.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Gene polymorphisms in NER repair system may influence the individual's capacity to recognize and repair DNA lesions, thus increasing the cancer risk. We hypothesized that these gene polymorphisms might influence the probability of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We investigated the XPC, XPD, XPF, and XPG gene polymorphisms in 108 AML cases and 163 healthy controls. Also cytogenetic analyses besides FLT3 and DNMT3A mutations status were investigated. We found that variant genotypes (heterozygous and homozygous) of XPD 2251A > C and 22541A > C and the heterozygous genotype of XPG 3507G > C were associated with the risk of developing AML (OR = 2.55; 95% CI = 1.53-4.25; p value <0.001; OR = 1.66, 95 % CI = 1.02-2.72; p value = 0.047, and OR = 2.36; 95 % CI = 1.32-4.21; p value = 0.004, respectively).

With advances in methods used to study the genetics of aging and myeloid disease biology, novel insights are emerging which are expected to improve our understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of tMN. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical outcomes in tMN and de novo MDS/AML appear to be largely determined by genetics, and data are emerging to show how DNA mutations may enhance tMN risk stratification. The discovery of skewed hematopoieses and mutations in healthy older adults suggests an alternate predisposition mechanism for the genesis of tMN. Patients with tMN do respond to standard therapy and can benefit from allogeneic transplant in a manner similar to their genetically matched de novo counterpart. SUMMARY: De novo MDS/AML and tMN have shared genetic features, and tMN clinical outcomes may depend more on the genetics at presentation than the clinical history of an antecedent malignancy. Acquired somatic mutations in genes such as TP53 and myeloid skewing with associated mutations in cancer-free older adults may predispose such individuals to tMN under the influence of myelosuppressive therapy, and this may be a route to the development of a subset of tMN.",,"['Klimek, Virginia M', 'Tray, Nancy J']","['Klimek VM', 'Tray NJ']","['aDepartment of Medicine, Leukemia Service bHospital Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Disease Susceptibility', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,,2016/01/19 06:00,2016/11/05 06:00,['2016/01/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000222 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Mar;23(2):161-6. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000222.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic abnormalities, including karyotype aberrations, gene mutations and gene expression abnormalities are the most important diagnostic tools in diagnosis, classification and prognosis in acute myeloid leukemias. Based on World Health Organization (WHO) classification, acute myeloid leukemias can be divided to four groups. Due to the heterogeneous nature of AML and since most therapeutic protocols in AML are based on genetic alterations, gathering further information in the field of rare disorders as well as common cytogenetic abnormalities would be helpful in determining the prognosis and treatment in this group of diseases. Recently, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in both normal hematopoiesis and myeloid leukemic cell differentiation in myeloid lineage has been specified. miRNAs can be used instead of genes for AML diagnosis and classification in the future, and can also play a decisive role in the evaluation of relapse as well as response to treatment in the patients. Therefore, their use in clinical trials can affect treatment protocols and play a role in therapeutic strategies for these patients.

We assessed daratumumab, a novel CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody, in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial done in Canada, Spain, and the USA, patients (age >/=18 years) with multiple myeloma who were previously treated with at least three lines of therapy (including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs), or were refractory to both proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous daratumumab 8 mg/kg or 16 mg/kg in part 1 stage 1 of the study, to decide the dose for further assessment in part 2. Patients received 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, or 16 mg/kg per week for 8 weeks (cycles 1 and 2), then every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (cycles 3-6), and then every 4 weeks thereafter (cycle 7 and higher). The allocation schedule was computer-generated and randomisation, with permuted blocks, was done centrally with an interactive web response system. In part 1 stage 2 and part 2, patients received 16 mg/kg dosed as in part 1 stage 1. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (partial response [PR] + very good PR + complete response [CR] + stringent CR). All patients who received at least one dose of daratumumab were included in the analysis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01985126. FINDINGS: The study is ongoing. In part 1 stage 1 of the study, 18 patients were randomly allocated to the 8 mg/kg group and 16 to the 16 mg/kg group. Findings are reported for the 106 patients who received daratumumab 16 mg/kg in parts 1 and 2. Patients received a median of five previous lines of therapy (range 2-14). 85 (80%) patients had previously received autologous stem cell transplantation, 101 (95%) were refractory to the most recent proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs used, and 103 (97%) were refractory to the last line of therapy. Overall responses were noted in 31 patients (29.2%, 95% CI 20.8-38.9)-three (2.8%, 0.6-8.0) had a stringent CR, ten (9.4%, 4.6-16.7) had a very good PR, and 18 (17.0%, 10.4-25.5) had a PR. The median time to first response was 1.0 month (range 0.9-5.6). Median duration of response was 7.4 months (95% CI 5.5-not estimable) and progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI 2.8-4.6). The 12-month overall survival was 64.8% (95% CI 51.2-75.5) and, at a subsequent cutoff, median overall survival was 17.5 months (95% CI 13.7-not estimable). Daratumumab was well tolerated; fatigue (42 [40%] patients) and anaemia (35 [33%]) of any grade were the most common adverse events. No drug-related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation. INTERPRETATION: Daratumumab monotherapy showed encouraging efficacy in heavily pretreated and refractory patients with multiple myeloma, with a favourable safety profile in this population of patients.

Dairy cows positive for BL produce less milk and have more days open than cows negative for BL. In addition, the virus also affects the immune system and causes weaker response to vaccines. Heritability estimates of BL incidence have been reported for Jersey and Holstein populations at about 0.08, indicating an important genetic component that can potentially be exploited to reduce the prevalence of the disease. However, before BL is used in selection programs, it is important to study its genetic associations with other economically important traits such that correlated responses to selection can be predicted. Hence, this study aimed to estimate the genetic correlations of BL with milk yield (MY) and with somatic cell score (SCS). Data of a commercial assay (ELISA) used to detect BLV antibodies in milk samples were obtained from Antel BioSystems (Lansing, MI). The data included continuous milk ELISA scores and binary milk ELISA results for 11,554 cows from 112 dairy herds across 16 US states. Continuous and binary milk ELISA were analyzed with linear and threshold models, respectively, together with MY and SCS using multitrait animal models. Genetic correlations (posterior means +/- standard deviations) between BL incidence and MY were 0.17 +/- 0.077 and 0.14 +/- 0.076 using ELISA scores and results, respectively; with SCS, such estimates were 0.20 +/- 0.081 and 0.17 +/- 0.079, respectively. In summary, the results indicate that selection for higher MY may lead to increased BLV prevalence in dairy herds, but that the inclusion of BL (or SCS as an indicator trait) in selection indexes may help attenuate this problem.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

To explore the appropriate conditions for in vitro culture of bovine spermatogonia (containing putative SSCs), Sertoli cell monolayer and serum concentration were set as two main control factors. Morphological examination showed that the intactness and structure of adult bovine testicular tissue were well maintained after cryopreservation. The enriched bovine spermatogonia were large round CD9 and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) positive cells, with high nucleocytoplasmic ratios and multiple types including single, paired-, aligned-cells or grape cluster-like colonies in vitro. In Sertoli cell co-culture system, bovine spermatogonia attached quickly and proliferated obviously faster than those in the system without Sertoli cells. Serum-free media was no good for the attachment and proliferation of bovine spermatogonia. When 2.5%, 5% and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was employed in the media, spermatogonia attached easily and divided quickly to form paired-, chained-cells or grape cluster-like colonies with comparable percentages in all groups. However, the contaminated somatic cells proliferated robustly in groups containing 5% and 10% FBS. Together, bovine spermatognia isolated from cryopreserved adult testis tissue express CD9 and PLZF, can survive and proliferate conspicuously in Sertoli cell co-culture system, and low serum provides an optimal condition for the survival and proliferation of bovine spermatogonia because of avoiding the rapid growth of testis somatic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we briefly review where we currently are with antigen-specific AML immunotherapy and where we might go from here. Besides the exploration of novel target antigens, ongoing preclinical and clinical efforts aim to improve existing immunotherapy modalities and focus on developing novel therapeutics such as bispecific antibodies and gene-modified immune effector cells. Ultimately, clinical studies need to address the question of ideal target(s) in AML, a disease of great antigenic diversity, and clarify how the upcoming immunotherapeutics should be best used and what level of supportive care is required for their safe administration.",,"['Rashidi, Armin', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Rashidi A', 'Walter RB']","['a Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia Program, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , MO , USA.', 'b Clinical Research Division , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'c Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology , University of Washington , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'd Department of Epidemiology , University of Washington , Seattle , WA , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy', 'Immunotoxins/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Peptides/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/immunology']",,,2016/01/19 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/01/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2016.1142868 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2016;9(4):335-50. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2016.1142868.

Until a recent study, the signaling pathway of oxytocin was thought to be critical for the social behavior of prairie voles, but neuron-specific functional research may be necessary to identify the molecular mechanisms of social behavior. Prairie vole pluripotent stem cells of high quality are essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of social behaviors. Generation of high-quality induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) would help to establish a genetically modified prairie vole, including knockout and knock-in models, based on the pluripotency of iPSCs. Thus, we attempted to establish high-quality prairie vole-derived iPSCs (pv-iPSCs) in this study. We constructed a polycistronic reprogramming vector, which included six reprograming factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, c-myc, Lin28, and Nanog). Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of six reprogramming factors, which included Oct3/4 with the transactivation domain (TAD) of MyoD. Implantation of the pv-iPSCs into immunodeficient mice caused a teratoma with three germ layers. Furthermore, the established pv-iPSCs tested positive for stem cell markers, including alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-1, and dependence on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Our data indicate that our newly established pv-iPSCs may be a useful tool for genetic analysis of social behavior.",,"['Katayama, Masafumi', 'Hirayama, Takashi', 'Horie, Kengo', 'Kiyono, Tohru', 'Donai, Kenichiro', 'Takeda, Satoru', 'Nishimori, Katsuhiko', 'Fukuda, Tomokazu']","['Katayama M', 'Hirayama T', 'Horie K', 'Kiyono T', 'Donai K', 'Takeda S', 'Nishimori K', 'Fukuda T']","['Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arvicolinae', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Animal', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Social Behavior']",,,2016/01/19 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/01/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['content-CT-2561_Katayama_et_al [pii]', '10.3727/096368916X690502 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2016;25(5):783-96. doi: 10.3727/096368916X690502.

Expression of endometrial receptivity markers and LIF-STAT3 signaling in in vitro decidualized human endometrial stromal cells (hESC) treated with 65 kDa mycobacterial heat shock protein (HSP65) is also explored. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital and reproductive health research unit. PATIENT(S): Endometrial tissue samples were collected from 38 women who tested positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 30 normal women with proven fertility undergoing sterilization. In vitro decidualization of hESC was performed. INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial biopsies collected from all women during implantation window and treatment of hESC with HSP65. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Measurement of various endometrial receptivity markers including alphavbeta3 integrin, E-cadherin, MECA-79, mucin-1, and pinopodes and LIF/LIFR-STAT3 signaling molecules expressed in the endometrium of women with dormant genital tuberculosis (GTB) during implantation window and measured also in HSP65-treated hESC. RESULT(S): Significantly reduced levels of endometrial receptivity markers LIF, LIFR, and pSTAT3 were observed in endometrium of women with dormant GTB as compared with controls. A similar trend was observed under in vitro conditions with decreased level of phosphorylated STAT3 in HSP65-treated hESC. However, no change in the expression of endometrial receptivity markers under in vitro conditions was observed. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings suggest that endometrium of women with dormant GTB is associated with poor receptivity, as evidenced by reduced receptivity markers and aberrant LIF-STAT3 signaling. In vitro treatment of hESC with HSP65 also confirms compromised endometrial decidualization.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Published by', 'Elsevier Inc.

It is especially important in many cases of highly heterogeneous cancers. Precision diagnostics and therapeutics of such diseases demands interrogation of vast amounts of biological knowledge coupled with novel analytic methodologies. For instance, pathway-based approaches can shed light on the way tumorigenesis takes place in individual patient cases and pinpoint to novel drug targets. However, comprehensive analysis of hundreds of pathways and thousands of genes creates a combinatorial explosion, that is challenging for medical practitioners to handle at the point of care. Here we extend our previous work on mapping clinical omics data to curated Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge bases to derive influence diagrams of interrelationships of biomarker proteins, diseases and signal transduction pathways for personalized theranostics. We present RDF Sketch Maps - a computational method to reduce knowledge complexity for precision medicine analytics. The method of RDF Sketch Maps is inspired by the way a sketch artist conveys only important visual information and discards other unnecessary details. In our case, we compute and retain only so-called RDF Edges - places with highly important diagnostic and therapeutic information. To do this we utilize 35 maps of human signal transduction pathways by transforming 300 KEGG maps into highly processable RDF knowledge base. We have demonstrated potential clinical utility of RDF Sketch Maps in hematopoietic cancers, including analysis of pathways associated with Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) where we achieved up to 20-fold reduction in the number of biological entities to be analyzed, while retaining most likely important entities. In experiments with pathways associated with HCL a generated RDF Sketch Map of the top 30% paths retained important information about signaling cascades leading to activation of proto-oncogene BRAF, which is usually associated with a different cancer, melanoma. Recent reports of successful treatments of HCL patients by the BRAF-targeted drug vemurafenib support the validity of the RDF Sketch Maps findings. We therefore believe that RDF Sketch Maps will be invaluable for hypothesis generation for precision diagnostics and therapeutics as well as drug repurposing studies.",,"['Thanintorn, Nattapon', 'Wang, Juexin', 'Ersoy, Ilker', 'Al-Taie, Zainab', 'Jiang, Yuexu', 'Wang, Duolin', 'Verma, Megha', 'Joshi, Trupti', 'Hammer, Richard', 'Xu, Dong', 'Shin, Dmitriy']","['Thanintorn N', 'Wang J', 'Ersoy I', 'Al-Taie Z', 'Jiang Y', 'Wang D', 'Verma M', 'Joshi T', 'Hammer R', 'Xu D', 'Shin D']","['Department of Pathology and Anatomical Sciences, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Pac Symp Biocomput,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

Survival is currently around 60%, with no improvement in last decades, suggesting that new therapeutic approaches are needed. The anti-leukaemia effect mediated by the lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system has been established in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and also as adoptive immunotherapy after consolidation chemotherapy schemes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed and treated for AML in our centre during 1996-2014. The mean fluorescence intensities of HLA-I, MICA/B and ULBP1-4, ligands for NK cell receptors, were also analysed in ten new diagnosed leukaemia cases, five myeloid and five lymphoid. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients were used in this analysis. With a median follow up of 25 months, the event-free survival was 62% (95% CI: 55-67). Secondary AML, non-M3 phenotype, and the absence of favourable cytogenetic markers had a lower survival. The probability of relapse was 38% (95% CI: 31-45). The expression of HLA-I and ULBP-4 was significantly lower in myeloid than in lymphoid blast cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical results are similar to those described in the literature. Survival did not significantly change in recent decades, and the likelihood of relapse remains high. Myeloid blasts might be more susceptible to the cytotoxicity of NK cells through their lower expression of HLA-I. NK therapy strategies in minimal disease situation could be effective, as reported by other groups.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier', 'Espana, S.L.U.

We conducted a dose-escalation/expansion phase II, multicenter, single-arm study to determine the optimal dose of coltuximab ravtansine (SAR3419), an anti-CD19 antibody-drug conjugate, in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The dose-escalation part of the study determined the selected dose of coltuximab ravtansine for the evaluation of efficacy and safety in the dose-expansion phase. Patients received coltuximab ravtansine induction therapy (</= 8 weekly doses). The responding patients were eligible for maintenance therapy (biweekly administration for </= 24 weeks). Three dose levels of coltuximab ravtansine were examined: 55, 70, and 90 mg/m(2). The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included the duration of response (DOR) and safety. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were treated: 19 during dose escalation and 17 during dose expansion. One dose-limiting toxicity was observed at 90 mg/m(2) (grade 3 peripheral motor neuropathy); therefore, 70 mg/m(2) was selected for the dose-expansion phase. Five patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs were pyrexia, diarrhea, and nausea. Of the 17 evaluable patients treated at the selected dose, 4 had a disease response (estimated ORR using the Bayesian method: 25.5% (80% confidence interval, 14.2%-39.6%). The DOR was 1.9 months (range, 1-5.6 months). Because of these results, the study was prematurely discontinued. CONCLUSION: Coltuximab ravtansine was well tolerated but was associated with a low clinical response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we investigated the efficacy of the SMAC-mimetic BV6 in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). In ALL cell lines, intrinsic apoptosis sensitivity was associated with rapid cIAP degradation, NF-kappaB activation, TNF-alpha secretion and induction of an autocrine TNF-alpha-dependent cell death loop. This pattern of responsiveness was also observed upon ex vivo analysis of 40 primograft BCP-ALL samples. Treatment with BV6 induced cell death in the majority of ALL primografts including leukemias with high-risk and poor-prognosis features. Inhibition of cell death by the TNF receptor fusion protein etanercept demonstrated that BV6 activity is dependent on TNF-alpha. In a preclinical NOD/SCID/huALL model of high-risk ALL, marked anti-leukemia effectivity and significantly prolonged survival were observed upon BV6 treatment. Interestingly, also in vivo, intrinsic SMAC-mimetic activity was mediated by TNF-alpha. Importantly, BV6 increased the effectivity of conventional induction therapy including vincristine, dexamethasone and asparaginase leading to prolonged remission induction. These data suggest SMAC-mimetics as an important addendum to efficient therapy of pediatric BCP-ALL.",,"['Schirmer, M', 'Trentin, L', 'Queudeville, M', 'Seyfried, F', 'Demir, S', 'Tausch, E', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Eckhoff, S M', 'Meyer, L H', 'Debatin, K-M']","['Schirmer M', 'Trentin L', 'Queudeville M', 'Seyfried F', 'Demir S', 'Tausch E', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Eckhoff SM', 'Meyer LH', 'Debatin KM']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC4816168,,2016/01/19 06:00,2016/11/10 06:00,['2016/01/19 06:00'],"['2015/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2015382 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.382 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Jan 14;7:e2052. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.382.,,,,20160114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we first showed that the LIF/STAT3-regulated signaling pathway contributes to the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse ESCs by suppressing mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which is necessary for early differentiation. When LIF is withdrawn from culture medium, the mTOR activity rapidly increases as detected by phosphorylation of its targets - ribosomal protein S6 and translation factor 4EBP1. In turn, suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation on Tyr-705 by a specific small molecule WP1066 also activates phosphorylation of the mTOR target S6 ribosomal protein. LIF removal strongly activates ERK activity indicating that ERK can be involved in either direct phosphorylation of mTOR or phosphorylation of an upstream negative regulator of mTOR - TSC1/TSC2 proteins. According to western blotting data, LIF withdrawal leads to phosphorylation of TSC2 protein thereby relieving its negative effect on mTOR activity. mTOR activation is accompanied by a decrease of pluripotent gene expression Oct-4, Nanog, Sox2 and by an augmentation of fgf5 gene expression - a marker of post-implantation epiblast. Together, these data indicate that LIF-depleted mouse ESCs undergo a transition from the LIF/STAT3-supported pluripotent state to the FGFR/ERK-committed primed-like state with expression of early differentiation markers mediated through activation of mTOR signaling.",,"['Cherepkova, M Y', 'Sineva, G S', 'Pospelov, V A']","['Cherepkova MY', 'Sineva GS', 'Pospelov VA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms Cell Differentiation, Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms Cell Differentiation, Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms Cell Differentiation, Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (TSC2 protein, human)', '0 (Tsc2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4816172,,2016/01/19 06:00,2016/11/10 06:00,['2016/01/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2015387 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.387 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Jan 14;7:e2050. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.387.,,,,20160114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Usually, glioblastoma is treated with ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapy after surgical removal. However, radiotherapy is frequently unsuccessful, among others owing to resistance mechanisms the tumor cells have developed. Antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia (Bcl)-2 family members can contribute to radioresistance by interfering with apoptosis induction in response to IR. Bcl-2 and the closely related Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 are often overexpressed in glioblastoma cells. In contrast to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 is a short-lived protein whose stability is closely regulated by ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Although ubiquitin ligases facilitate degradation, the deubiquitylating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 9x (USP9x) interferes with degradation by removing polyubiquitin chains from Mcl-1, thereby stabilizing this protein. Thus, an inability to downregulate Mcl-1 by enhanced USP9x activity might contribute to radioresistance. Here we analyzed the impact of USP9x on Mcl-1 levels and radiosensitivity in glioblastoma cells. Correlating Mcl-1 and USP9x expressions were significantly higher in human glioblastoma than in astrocytoma. Downregulation of Mcl-1 correlated with apoptosis induction in established glioblastoma cell lines. Although Mcl-1 knockdown by siRNA increased apoptosis induction after irradiation in all glioblastoma cell lines, USP9x knockdown significantly improved radiation-induced apoptosis in one of four cell lines and slightly increased apoptosis in another cell line. In the latter two cell lines, USP9x knockdown also increased radiation-induced clonogenic death. The massive downregulation of Mcl-1 and apoptosis induction in A172 cells transfected with USP9x siRNA shows that the deubiquitinase regulates cell survival by regulating Mcl-1 levels.

Ginkgolide B has shown to increase the activity of PXR. Here we examined whether ginkgolide B activated PXR and attenuated xenobiotic-induced injuries in endothelial cells. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with ginkgolide B. The expression of PXR, CYP3A4, MDR1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and caspase-3 were quantified with qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis was analyzed with flow cytometry. Fluorescently labeled human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cells) were used to examine cell adhesion. RESULTS: Ginkgolide B (30-300 mumol/L) did not change the mRNA and protein levels of PXR in the cells, but dose-dependently increased nuclear translocation of PXR protein. Ginkgolide B increased the expression of CYP3A4 and MDR1 in the cells, which was partially reversed by pretreatment with the selective PXR signaling antagonist sulforaphane, or transfection with PXR siRNA. Functionally, ginkgolide B dose-dependently attenuated doxorubicin- or staurosporine-induced apoptosis, which was reversed by transfection with PXR siRNA. Moreover, ginkgolide B suppressed TNF-alpha-induced THP-1 cell adhesion and TNF-alpha-induced expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin in the cells, which was also reversed by transfection with PXR siRNA. CONCLUSION: Ginkgolide B exerts anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells via PXR activation, suggesting that a PXR-mediated endothelial detoxification program may be important for protecting endothelial cells from xeno- and endobiotic-induced injuries.",,"['Zhou, Tao', 'You, Wen-ting', 'Ma, Zeng-chun', 'Liang, Qian-de', 'Tan, Hong-ling', 'Xiao, Cheng-rong', 'Tang, Xiang-lin', 'Zhang, Bo-li', 'Wang, Yu-guang', 'Gao, Yue']","['Zhou T', 'You WT', 'Ma ZC', 'Liang QD', 'Tan HL', 'Xiao CR', 'Tang XL', 'Zhang BL', 'Wang YG', 'Gao Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Department of Department of Pharmacology, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 300193, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Ginkgolides)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Pregnane X Receptor)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Xenobiotics)', 'DF149B9460 (ginkgolide B)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics', 'Cytoprotection/*drug effects', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Ginkgolides/*pharmacology', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Pregnane X Receptor', 'Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Steroid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenobiotics/toxicity']",PMC4753368,,2016/01/19 06:00,2017/01/04 06:00,['2016/01/19 06:00'],"['2015/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2015124 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2015.124 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2016 Feb;37(2):177-86. doi: 10.1038/aps.2015.124.

METHODS: NB4 (an APL cell line sensitive to ATRA) and NB4-R1 (a resistant strain of ATRA) were observed as subjects in this study. Effects of combined treatment of 0.1 mmol/L MAT and 1 [mol/L ATRA on the differentiation of two cell lines were detected using nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test and flow cytometry (CD11b). Expressions of PML/RARot and PLSCR1 protein/gene were detected using Western blot and Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay. Meanwhile, H89, PKA antagonist, was used to observe cell differentiation antigen and changes of aforesaid proteins and genes. RESULTS: MAT combined ATRA could significantly elevate positive rates of NBT and CD11 b in NB4-R1 cells, and significantly down-regulate the expression of PML/RARapha-fusion protein/gene (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). ATRA used alone could obviously enhance the expression of PLSCRI in NB4 cells at protein and mRNA levels (P < 0.01). But the expression of PLSCR1 was up-regulated in NB4-R1 cells, but with statistical.difference only at the protein level (P <0. 01). In combination of MAT, PLSCR1 protein expression was further elevated in the two cell lines (P < 0.01). Besides, there was statistical difference in mRNA expressions in NB4-R1 cells (P < 0.05). All these actions could be reversed by treatment of 10 micromol/L H89 (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: MAT combined ATRA could significantly induce the differentiation of NB4-R1 cells, and inhibit the expression of PML/RARalpha fusion gene/protein, which might be associated with up-regulating PLSCR1 expression.",,"['Wu, Di-jiong', 'Liu, Ting-ting', 'Zhou, Qi-hao', 'Sun, Jie', 'Shao, Ke-ding', 'Ye, Bao-dong', 'Zhou, Yu-hong']","['Wu DJ', 'Liu TT', 'Zhou QH', 'Sun J', 'Shao KD', 'Ye BD', 'Zhou YH']",,['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (PLSCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '0 (Quinolizines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'N390W430AC (matrine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids', 'Antineoplastic Agents', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/*metabolism', 'Quinolizines', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2016/01/19 06:00,2016/09/16 06:00,['2016/01/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2015 Nov;35(11):1345-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considerable research attention has focused on the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) as a potential therapeutic target in B-cell malignancies. Treatment paradigms including ibrutinib, a potent inhibitor of the BTK recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have significantly improved disease outcome among high-risk and relapsed/refractory cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This has provided additional treatment options, especially among the elderly, where improved disease response has been accompanied by more manageable treatment-associated toxicity than commonly found with chemoimmunotherapy.

We have anecdotal evidence that THC may have contributed to disease control in a patient with acute undifferentiated leukemia. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the antileukemic efficacy of THC in several leukemia cell lines and native leukemia blasts cultured ex vivo. Expression analysis for the CB1/2 receptors was performed by Western immunoblotting and flow cytometry. CB-receptor antagonists as well as a CRISPR double nickase knockdown approach were used to evaluate for receptor specificity of the observed proapoptotic effects. RESULTS: Meaningful antiproliferative as well as proapoptotic effects were demonstrated in a subset of cases--with a preference of leukemia cells from the lymphatic lineage or acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing lymphatic markers. Induction of apoptosis was mediated via CB1 as well as CB2, and expression of CB receptors was a prerequisite for therapy response in our models. Importantly, we demonstrate that antileukemic concentrations are achievable in vivo.

The aim of our study was to determine whether inhibition of MPO activity has influence on the formation of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) that may contribute to the characteristic of leukemia translocations. Studies were carried out on HL-60 cell line, which were preincubated with the MPO inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH), or antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), followed by incubation at different concentrations of etoposide (1-10 mM) for 4 hours. Cytotoxicity was investigated using propidium iodide staining. Marker of DSBs, a phosphorylated form of histone 2AX (gH2AX) was detected using immunocytochemical methods. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. ABAH significantly reduced the cytotoxicity and the gH2AX level induced by lower concentrations of etoposide (1 and 1.5 mM) and did not modify the action of higher concentration (10 mM) of this cytostatic drug. NAC exerted similar impact as ABAH on the level of gH2AX induced by etoposide.

All isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antileukemic activity; especially, hinokinin and cubebin exhibited strong inhibition toward U937 cell proliferation.

We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of pathways responsible for ROS detoxification renders ALL cells more susceptible for cell death. Here, we report that pharmacological inhibitors of key pathways for the elimination of ROS, i.e. Erastin, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and Auranofin, sensitize ALL cells for cell death upon treatment with the Smac mimetic LCL161 that antagonizes Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) proteins. Erastin, BSO or Auranofin significantly increase LCL161-induced cell death and also act in concert with LCL161 to profoundly suppress long-term clonogenic survival in several ALL cell lines. Erastin or BSO cooperates with LCL161 to stimulate ROS production and lipid peroxidation prior to cell death. ROS production and lipid peroxidation are required for this cotreatment-induced cell death, since ROS scavengers or pharmacological inhibition of lipid peroxidation provides significant protection against cell death. These results emphasize that inhibition of antioxidant defense mechanisms can serve as a potent approach to prime ALL cells for LCL161-induced cell death.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We previously identified endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) as a novel functional marker of hematopoietic stem cells in mice. Here, we found that ESAM can also be used to purify human hematopoietic stem cells from all the currently available sources (adult bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, and cord blood). Multipotent colony-forming units and long-term hematopoietic-reconstituting cells in immunodeficient mice were found exclusively in the ESAM(High) fraction of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. The CD34(+)CD38(-) fraction of cord blood and collagenase-treated bone marrow contained cells exhibiting extremely high expression of ESAM; these cells are likely to be related to the endothelial lineage. Leukemia cell lines of erythroid and megakaryocyte origin, but not those of myeloid or lymphoid descent, were ESAM positive. However, high ESAM expression was observed in some primary acute myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, KG-1a myeloid leukemia cells switched from ESAM negative to ESAM positive with repeated leukemia reconstitution in vivo. Thus, ESAM is a useful marker for studying both human hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia cells.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Because constitutional DNA is not readily available as a control at the time of diagnosis, it is important to be able to distinguish between acquired and constitutional aberrations in a diagnostic setting. In the present study we focused on uniparental isodisomies (UPIDs). SNP array analyses of 143 pediatric and 38 adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias and matched remission samples revealed acquired whole chromosome or segmental UPIDs (wUPIDs, sUPIDs) in 32 cases (18%), without any age- or gender-related frequency differences. Acquired sUPIDs were larger than the constitutional ones (mean 35.3 Mb vs. 10.7 Mb; P < 0.0001) and were more often terminally located in the chromosomes (69% vs. 4.5%; P < 0.0001). Chromosomes 3, 5, and 9 were most often involved in acquired wUPIDs, whilst recurrent acquired sUPIDs targeted 6p, 9p, 9q, and 14q. The majority (56%) of sUPID9p was associated with homozygous CDKN2A deletions. In pediatric ALL, all wUPIDs were found in high hyperdiploid (51-67 chromosomes) cases and an extended analysis, also including unmatched diagnostic samples, revealed a higher frequency of wUPID-positivity in higher modal number (56-67 chromosomes) than in lower modal number (51-55 chromosomes) high hyperdiploid cases (34% vs. 11%; P = 0.04), suggesting different underlying mechanisms of formation of these subtypes of high hyperdiploidy.

METHODS: This study was undertaken at 31 Children's Oncology Group (COG) sites. Eligible children who were 2 to 9.99 years old were enrolled in a COG trial for patients with newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL from 2005 to 2009. Parents completed a demographic survey at the baseline and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.0 Cancer Module (proxy version) and the General Functioning Scale of the Family Assessment Device 1, 6, and 12 months after the diagnosis. The association between patient-related (age, sex, ethnicity, and treatment), parent-related (marital status and education), and family-related factors (functioning, income, and size) and symptom scores was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean scores for procedure-related anxiety, treatment-related anxiety, and pain improved during the first year of treatment (P < .0389). The mean nausea score was poorer 6 months after the diagnosis in comparison with the other assessments (P = .0085). A younger age at diagnosis was associated with significantly worse procedure-related anxiety (P = .004). An older age (P = .0002) and assignment to the intensified consolidation study arm (P = .02) were associated with significantly worse nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL experienced decreasing treatment-related anxiety, procedure-related anxiety, and pain during the first year of treatment. In comparison with scores at 1 and 12 months, nausea was worse 6 months after the diagnosis. Minimization of procedure-related anxiety in younger children and improved nausea control in older children and those receiving more intensified treatment should be prioritized.",['(c) 2016 American Cancer Society.'],"['Dupuis, L Lee', 'Lu, Xiaomin', 'Mitchell, Hannah-Rose', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Mattano, Leonard A Jr', 'Carroll, William L', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S']","['Dupuis LL', 'Lu X', 'Mitchell HR', 'Sung L', 'Devidas M', 'Mattano LA Jr', 'Carroll WL', 'Winick N', 'Hunger SP', 'Maloney KW', 'Kadan-Lottick NS']","['Department of Pharmacy, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Public Health and Health Professions, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'School of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Public Health and Health Professions, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'HARP Pharma Consulting, Mystic, Connecticut.', 'Perlmutter Cancer Center, Langone Medical Center, New York University, New York, New York.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", 'Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],"['CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA095861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001427/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Anxiety/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/methods', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Nausea/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Pain/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Parents', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",PMC5138861,['NIHMS832104'],2016/01/17 06:00,2016/08/10 06:00,['2016/01/17 06:00'],"['2015/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29876 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2016 Apr 1;122(7):1116-25. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29876.

On T and NK cells, CD137 is expressed following activation and, if ligated by its natural ligand (CD137L), conveys polyubiquitination-mediated signals via TNF receptor associated factor 2 that inhibit apoptosis, while enhancing proliferation and effector functions. CD137 thus behaves as a bona fide inducible costimulatory molecule. These functional properties of CD137 can be exploited in cancer immunotherapy by systemic administration of agonist monoclonal antibodies, which increase anticancer CTLs and enhance NK-cell-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Reportedly, anti-CD137 mAb and adoptive T-cell therapy strongly synergize, since (i) CD137 expression can be used to select the T cells endowed with the best activities against the tumor, (ii) costimulation of the lymphocyte cultures to be used in adoptive T-cell therapy can be done with CD137 agonist antibodies or CD137L, and (iii) synergistic effects upon coadministration of T cells and antibodies are readily observed in mouse models. Furthermore, the signaling cytoplasmic tail of CD137 is a key component of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptors that are used to redirect T cells against leukemia and lymphoma in the clinic. Ongoing phase II clinical trials with agonist antibodies and the presence of CD137 sequence in these successful chimeric antigen receptors highlight the importance of CD137 in oncoimmunology.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) has thus far been overlooked by researchers and no data exists on the subject. We studied the impact of adjunctive CHM on the disease course of CML, using mortality as the major outcome measurement. We used the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database to perform a nationwide population-based cohort study. Our study included CML patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010. We matched groups according to age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score and use of imatinib, and compared the Hazard Ratios (HR) of CHM group and non-CHM users, as well as characterized trends of prescriptions used for treating CML. 1371 patients were diagnosed with CML in the years examined, of which 466 were included in to this study. We found that the HR of CHM group was significantly lower compared to non-CHM groups (0.32, 95% CI 0.22-0.48, P < 0.0001). We also established that this association between reduced HR was dose-dependent, and the longer CHM users received prescriptions, the lower the HR (P < 0.01). We also analyzed the most commonly used herbal products as well as the HR associated to their use, thus providing future research candidates.

This pathway plays a significant role in the erythropoiesis process, contributing to the clearance of some organelles (such as mitochondria) that are not necessary in the mature red blood cells. Nevertheless, the role of autophagy in erythrocyte maturation has not been fully established. RESULTS: Here, we have demonstrated that hemin (a physiological erythroid maturation stimulator) is able to induce the expression of critical autophagic genes (i.e., Map1a1b (LC3), Beclin-1 gen, Atg5) in an erythroleukemia cell type. We have also shown that hemin increased the size of autophagic vacuoles which were labelled with LC3 and the degradative lysosomal marker dye quenched-bovine serum albumin. In addition, we have determined by Western blot a rise in the lipidated form of the autophagic protein LC3 (i.e., LC3-II) upon hemin treatment. Moreover, we provide evidence that hemin induces mitochondrial membrane depolarisation and that mitochondria sequestration by autophagy requires the active form of the NIX protein. CONCLUSIONS: We have found that the physiological erythroid maturation stimulator hemin is able to induce mitophagy in K562 cells, and that the autophagy adaptor NIX is necessary for mitophagy progression. K562 cells have been used as a relevant model to determine the possible therapeutic role of new differentiating compounds. SIGNIFICANCE: It has been proposed that autophagy induction is a feasible new therapeutic key in fighting cancer. Our results suggest that hemin is favoring erythroid maturation by inducing an autophagic response in K562 cells, being a possible therapeutic candidate that may help in the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment.","['(c) 2016 Societe Francaise des Microscopies and Societe de Biologie Cellulaire de', 'France.

We estimated incidence rates of pathology-confirmed adult cases of leukemia, myeloma and related diseases (myeloma), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) reported to the National Cancer Registry of South Africa (NCR) between 2000 and 2006, by age, gender, and population group (Black, White, Coloured, Asian/Indian). Gender-specific age-standardized rates were calculated overall and by population group and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regression models. Between 2000 and 2006, there were 14662 cases of leukemia, myeloma, HL, and NHL reported to the registry. Incidence rates of reported hematologic malignancies were generally 20-50% higher among males than females. Our analyses suggested marked differences in the rates of reported hematologic malignancies by population group which were most pronounced when comparing the White versus Black population groups (IRRs ranging from 1.6 for myeloma to 3.8 for HL for males and females combined). Challenges related to diagnosis and reporting of cancers may play a role in the patterns observed by population group while the set-up of the NCR (pathology-based) could lead to some degree of under-ascertainment in all groups.

Despite intensive research, mechanisms of resistance have not yet been fully elucidated. Six1 signaling has an important role in the expansion of progenitor cell populations during early embryogenesis. Six1 gene overexpression has been strongly associated with aggressiveness, invasiveness, and poor prognosis of different cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of Six1 signaling in resistance of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to taxanes. We first established in vitro paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Morphological modifications in paclitaxel-resistant cells were examined via light microscopic images and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Applying quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we measured Six1, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia(BCL-2), BAX, and P53 mRNA expression levels in both non-resistant and resistant cells. Resistant cells were developed from the parent MCF-7 cells by applying increasing concentrations of paclitaxel up to 64 nM. The inhibitory concentration 50% value in resistant cells increased from 3.5 +/- 0.03 to 511 +/- 10.22 nM (p = 0.015). In paclitaxel-resistant cells, there was a significant increase in Six1 and BCL-2 mRNA levels (p = 0.0007) with a marked decrease in pro-apoptotic Bax mRNA expression level (p = 0.03); however, there was no significant change in P53 expression (p = 0.025).

The measurement of intracellular calcium was determined using Furo-2 with a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The iron delivery process to the cytoplasmic iron pool was examined by monitoring the fluorescence of cells loaded with calcein-acetoxymethyl. Our data showed that iron increased intracellular calcium, and this response was 8 times higher when cells were incubated with DFO.

However, acquired resistance to TKIs is a significant clinical problem in CML, and TKI therapy is much less effective against Ph(+)B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). BCR-ABL1, via phosphorylated Tyr177, recruits the adapter GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) as part of a GRB2/GAB2 complex. We showed previously that GAB2 is essential for BCR-ABL1-evoked myeloid transformation in vitro. Using a genetic strategy and mouse models of CML and B-ALL, we show here that GAB2 is essential for myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL1. In the mouse model, recipients of BCR-ABL1-transducedGab2(-/-)bone marrow failed to develop CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia. Leukemogenesis was restored by expression of GAB2 but not by GAB2 mutants lacking binding sites for its effectors phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or SRC homology 2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). GAB2 deficiency also attenuated BCR-ABL1-induced B-ALL, but only the SHP2 binding site was required. The SHP2 and PI3K binding sites were differentially required for signaling downstream of GAB2. Hence, GAB2 transmits critical transforming signals from Tyr177 to PI3K and SHP2 for CML pathogenesis, whereas only the GAB2-SHP2 pathway is essential for lymphoid leukemogenesis. Given that GAB2 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, GAB2 and its effectors PI3K and SHP2 represent promising targets for therapy in Ph(+)hematologic neoplasms.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Gu, Shengqing', 'Chan, Wayne W', 'Mohi, Golam', 'Rosenbaum, Joel', 'Sayad, Azin', 'Lu, Zhibin', 'Virtanen, Carl', 'Li, Shaoguang', 'Neel, Benjamin G', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Gu S', 'Chan WW', 'Mohi G', 'Rosenbaum J', 'Sayad A', 'Lu Z', 'Virtanen C', 'Li S', 'Neel BG', 'Van Etten RA']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA; Program in Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA;', 'Cancer Biology Program, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA; and.', 'Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA;', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA; Program in Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA;']",['eng'],"['R01 CA11494/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA049152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA049152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA062203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Gab2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transduction, Genetic']",PMC4825414,,2016/01/17 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2016/01/17 06:00'],"['2015/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30281-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-06-653006 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Apr 7;127(14):1803-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-06-653006.

However, molecular mechanisms of the sustained expression changes are largely unknown, because there is no study addressing the relationship between landscapes of the gene expression and epigenetic modifications. Here, we analyzed ATL epigenome and integrated it with transcriptome from primary ATL cells and those from corresponding normal CD4(+)T cells to decipher ATL-specific ""epigenetic code"" that was critical for cell identity. We found that polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated trimethylation at histone H3Lys27 (H3K27me3) was significantly and frequently reprogrammed at half of genes in ATL cells. A large proportion of the abnormal gene downregulation was detected at the early stage of disease progression and was explained by H3K27me3 accumulation. The global H3K27me3 alterations involved ATL-specific gene expression changes that included several tumor suppressors, transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, miRNAs, and developmental genes, suggesting diverse outcomes by the PRC2-dependent hierarchical regulation. Interestingly, a key enzyme, EZH2, was sensitive to promiscuous signaling network including the NF-kappaB pathway and was functionally affected by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) Tax. The Tax-dependent immortalized cells showed H3K27me3 reprogramming that was significantly similar to that of ATL cells. Of note, a majority of the epigenetic silencing has occurred in leukemic cells from indolent ATL and also in HTLV-1-infected T cells from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. Because pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 reversed epigenetic disruption and selectively eliminated leukemic and HTLV-1-infected cells, targeting the epigenetic elements will hold great promise in treatment and prevention of the onset of ATL and HTLV-1-related diseases.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Fujikawa, Dai', 'Nakagawa, Shota', 'Hori, Makoto', 'Kurokawa, Naoya', 'Soejima, Ai', 'Nakano, Kazumi', 'Yamochi, Tadanori', 'Nakashima, Makoto', 'Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Yamagishi, Makoto', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Fujikawa D', 'Nakagawa S', 'Hori M', 'Kurokawa N', 'Soejima A', 'Nakano K', 'Yamochi T', 'Nakashima M', 'Kobayashi S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Iwanaga M', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Uchimaru K', 'Yamagishi M', 'Watanabe T']","['Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.', 'Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan;', 'Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2016/01/17 06:00,2016/08/20 06:00,['2016/01/17 06:00'],"['2015/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30280-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-08-662593 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Apr 7;127(14):1790-802. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-08-662593.

However, responses are variable, and causal baseline factors have not been well-studied. The type and number of low-level BCR-ABL1 mutations present after imatinib resistance has prognostic significance for subsequent treatment with nilotinib or dasatinib as second-line therapy. We therefore investigated the impact of low-level mutations detected by sensitive mass-spectrometry before ponatinib initiation (baseline) on treatment response in 363 TKI-resistant patients enrolled in the PONATINIB for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Evaluation and Ph(+)Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia trial, including 231 patients in chronic phase (CP-CML). Low-level mutations were detected in 53 patients (15%, including low-level T315I in 14 patients); most, however, did not undergo clonal expansion during ponatinib treatment and, moreover, no specific individual mutations were associated with inferior outcome. We demonstrate however, that the number of mutations detectable by mass spectrometry after TKI resistance is associated with response to ponatinib treatment and could be used to refine the therapeutic approach. Although CP-CML patients with T315I (63/231, 27%) had superior responses overall, those with multiple mutations detectable by mass spectrometry (20, 32%) had substantially inferior responses compared with those with T315I as the sole mutation detected (43, 68%). In contrast, for CP-CML patients without T315I, the inferior responses previously observed with nilotinib/dasatinib therapy for imatinib-resistant patients with multiple mutations were not seen with ponatinib treatment, suggesting that ponatinib may prove to be particularly advantageous for patients with multiple mutations detectable by mass spectrometry after TKI resistance.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Parker, Wendy T', 'Yeung, David T O', 'Yeoman, Alexandra L', 'Altamura, Haley K', 'Jamison, Bronte A', 'Field, Chani R', 'Hodgson, J Graeme', 'Lustgarten, Stephanie', 'Rivera, Victor M', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Branford, Susan']","['Parker WT', 'Yeung DT', 'Yeoman AL', 'Altamura HK', 'Jamison BA', 'Field CR', 'Hodgson JG', 'Lustgarten S', 'Rivera VM', 'Hughes TP', 'Branford S']","['Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology and Australian Cancer Research Foundation Cancer Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia; School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia;', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology and School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; Department of Hematology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia; Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia;', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology and.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology and.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology and.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology and.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA; and.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA; and.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA; and.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; Department of Hematology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia; Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia;', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology and School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia; School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; School of Molecular and Biomedical Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4832506,,2016/01/17 06:00,2016/09/08 06:00,['2016/01/17 06:00'],"['2015/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30256-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-09-666214 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Apr 14;127(15):1870-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-09-666214.

Pten loss results in increased activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, which is associated with increased proliferation, survival, and neoplastic growth. Here, we have addressed the effects of conditional deletion of Pten in hematopoietic cells by crossing Pten conditional knockout mice with a knock-in mouse expressing the Cre recombinase in the CD45 locus.

Cellular senescence contributes to age-related tissue dysfunction, but the epigenetic basis underlying drug-induced senescence remains unclear. macroH2A1, a variant of histone H2A, is a marker of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci that synergizes with DNA methylation to silence tumor-suppressor genes in human fibroblasts. In this study, we investigated the relationship between macroH2A1 splice variants, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, and liver carcinogenesis. We found that protein levels of both macroH2A1 isoforms were increased in the livers of very elderly rodents and humans, and were robust immunohistochemical markers of human cirrhosis and HCC. In response to the chemotherapeutic and DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), transgenic expression of macroH2A1 isoforms in HCC cell lines prevented the emergence of a senescent-like phenotype and induced synergistic global DNA hypomethylation. Conversely, macroH2A1 depletion amplified the antiproliferative effects of 5-aza-dC in HCC cells, but failed to enhance senescence. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype and whole-transcriptome analyses implicated the p38 MAPK/IL8 pathway in mediating macroH2A1-dependent escape of HCC cells from chemotherapy-induced senescence. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that this hepatic antisenescence state also required active transcription that could not be attributed to genomic occupancy of these histones. Collectively, our findings reveal a new mechanism by which drug-induced senescence is epigenetically regulated by macroH2A1 and DNA methylation and suggest macroH2A1 as a novel biomarker of hepatic senescence that could potentially predict prognosis and disease progression.",['(c)2016 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Borghesan, Michela', 'Fusilli, Caterina', 'Rappa, Francesca', 'Panebianco, Concetta', 'Rizzo, Giovanni', 'Oben, Jude A', 'Mazzoccoli, Gianluigi', 'Faulkes, Chris', 'Pata, Illar', 'Agodi, Antonella', 'Rezaee, Farhad', 'Minogue, Shane', 'Warren, Alessandra', 'Peterson, Abigail', 'Sedivy, John M', 'Douet, Julien', 'Buschbeck, Marcus', 'Cappello, Francesco', 'Mazza, Tommaso', 'Pazienza, Valerio', 'Vinciguerra, Manlio']","['Borghesan M', 'Fusilli C', 'Rappa F', 'Panebianco C', 'Rizzo G', 'Oben JA', 'Mazzoccoli G', 'Faulkes C', 'Pata I', 'Agodi A', 'Rezaee F', 'Minogue S', 'Warren A', 'Peterson A', 'Sedivy JM', 'Douet J', 'Buschbeck M', 'Cappello F', 'Mazza T', 'Pazienza V', 'Vinciguerra M']","['Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital, University College London, London, United Kingdom.

Eight patients (2 with MDS and 6 with AML) were treated with cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on day -3 and day -2 before infusion of NK cells isolated from a haploidentical related donor. One patient also received fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day for 4 days. Six doses of 1 million units of interleukin-2 (IL-2) were administered on alternating days beginning on day -1. The median number of NK cells infused was 10.6 x 10(6)/kg (range, 4.3 to 22.4 x 10(6)/kg), and the median number of CD3 cells infused was 2.1 x 10(3)/kg (range, 1.9 to 40 x 10(3)/kg). NK infusions were well tolerated, with a median time to neutrophil recovery of 19 days (range, 7 days to not achieved) and no incidence of graft-versus-host disease after NK infusion. One patient with AML and 1 patient with MDS achieved a complete response, but relapsed at 1.7 and 1.8 months, respectively. One patient with MDS experienced resolution of dysplastic features but persistence of clonal karyotype abnormalities; this patient was stable at 65 months after NK cell therapy. The median duration of survival was 12.9 months (range, 0.8 to 65.3 months). Chimerism analysis of CD3(-)/CD56(+) peripheral blood cells did not detect any circulating haploidentical NK cells after infusion. NK phenotyping was performed in 7 patients during and after IL-2 infusion. We found a slight trend toward greater expression of KIR2DL2/2DL3/2DS2 (5% versus 28%; P = .03) at 14 days in patients who survived longer than 6 months from NK cell infusion (n = 4) compared with those who died within 6 months of NK cell therapy (n = 3). In summary, our data support the safety of haploidentical NK cell infusion after allogeneic HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the mutation detection method used for risk assessment is not assigned. It is necessary to verify the analytical and clinical performance before applying new methods. Herein, we firstly applied a highly sensitive allele-specific, real-time quantitative PCR (AS-qPCR) assay to analyze KIT mutations, which demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity. Much higher incidence of KIT mutations (62.2%, 69/111) and prevalence of multiple mutations (43.5%, 30/69) were observed using AS-qPCR, which meant the existence of multiple KIT mutant subclones. The relative KIT mutant level was variable (median, 0.3 per control allele 100 copies, 0.002-532.7) and was divided into two groups: high (10, n=26) and low (<10) mutant level. Interestingly, rather than mutation positivity, mutant level was found to be associated with clinical outcome. High mutant level showed significantly inferior overall survival (P=0.005) and event-free survival (P=0.03), whereas low level did not influence the prognosis. The follow-up data showed that the mutant level were along with fusion transcripts in the majority (n=29), but moved separately in some cases, including the loss of mutations (n=5) and selective proliferation of minor clones (n=2) at relapse.

Our study demonstrated that (1) patients with a pure hyperdiploid karyotype have an adverse risk irrespective of the number of chromosomal gains, (2) patients with translocation t(9;11)(p21 approximately 22;q23) have an intermediate risk independent of the number of additional aberrations, (3) patients with 4 abnormalities have an adverse risk per se and (4) patients with three aberrations in the absence of abnormalities of strong influence (hyperdiploid karyotype, t(9;11)(p21 approximately 22;q23), CBF-AML, unique adverse-risk aberrations) have borderline intermediate/adverse risk with a reduced overall survival compared with patients with a normal karyotype.",,"['Stolzel, F', 'Mohr, B', 'Kramer, M', 'Oelschlagel, U', 'Bochtler, T', 'Berdel, W E', 'Kaufmann, M', 'Baldus, C D', 'Schafer-Eckart, K', 'Stuhlmann, R', 'Einsele, H', 'Krause, S W', 'Serve, H', 'Hanel, M', 'Herbst, R', 'Neubauer, A', 'Sohlbach, K', 'Mayer, J', 'Middeke, J M', 'Platzbecker, U', 'Schaich, M', 'Kramer, A', 'Rollig, C', 'Schetelig, J', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Ehninger, G']","['Stolzel F', 'Mohr B', 'Kramer M', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Bochtler T', 'Berdel WE', 'Kaufmann M', 'Baldus CD', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Stuhlmann R', 'Einsele H', 'Krause SW', 'Serve H', 'Hanel M', 'Herbst R', 'Neubauer A', 'Sohlbach K', 'Mayer J', 'Middeke JM', 'Platzbecker U', 'Schaich M', 'Kramer A', 'Rollig C', 'Schetelig J', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Abteilung Innere Medizin V, Universitat Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik A, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Robert Bosch Hospital, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Asklepios Klinik St Georg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Asklepios Klinik St Georg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik 5, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik II, Klinikum der J.W.

Data were gathered from the medical records in the hospital where the patients were treated. A total of 405 patients (203 girls; median age 8.4 years) experienced 1326 infections. Fever without identifiable source occurred in 56.1% of the patients and clinically and microbiologically documented infections in 17.5% and 32.4% of the patients, respectively. In all, 240 Gram-positive (112 viridans group streptococci) and 90 Gram-negative isolates were recovered from the bloodstream. Invasive fungal infection was diagnosed in 3% of the patients. Three children each died of Gram-negative bacteremia and invasive aspergillosis, respectively. As compared with the results of AML-BFM 93 with lower dose intensity, infection-related morbidity was slightly higher in AML-BFM 2004 (3.3. versus 2.8 infections per patient), whereas infection-related mortality significantly decreased (1.5% versus 5.4%; P=0.003).

Some of these compounds had shown a significant cell growth inhibitory activity towards leukemia cell lines, without affecting the growth of non-tumor human fibroblasts. However, their effect in cell lines derived from solid tumors has not been previously studied. The present work aimed at: (i) screening this small series of compounds from an in-house library, for their in vitro cell growth inhibitory activity in human tumor cell lines derived from solid tumors; and (ii) initiate a study of the effect of the most potent compound on apoptosis. The tumor cell growth inhibitory effect of 27 compounds was first analysed in different human tumor cell lines, allowing the identification of a hit compound, TXA1. Its hydrochloride salt TXA1.HCl was then synthesized, to improve solubility and bioavailability. Both TXA1 and TXA1.HCl inhibited the growth of MCF-7, NCI-H460, A375-C5, HeLa, 786-O, Caki-2 and AGS cell lines.

Hematologic findings indicated that the bird had a severe lymphocytic leukocytosis, consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Radiographs showed the presence of multiple soft tissue masses within the caudal coelomic cavity; ultrasound showed one mass to be an enlarged spleen, a cystic mass near the gonads, and a mass suspected to be associated with the ventriculus. Results of further antemortem diagnostics, including bone marrow aspiration, fine-needle aspirate cytology of the coelomic masses, and immunohistochemical staining confirmed T-cell leukemia with infiltration of the bone marrow and the spleen. The bird showed partial response to treatment with chlorambucil, lomustine, prednisone, l-asparaginase, and whole-body radiation, with neither evidence of adverse effects nor clinical signs of disease. Although the leukemia showed response, there was no evidence of remission at any point. The swan died 433 days after initial evaluation and initiation of therapy.

The established antimalarial, artesunate (AS), and the novel artemisinin-derived trioxane diphenylphosphate dimer 838 (ART-838) inhibited growth of all 23 tested acute leukemia cell lines, reduced cell proliferation and clonogenicity, induced apoptosis, and increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ART-838 was 88-fold more potent that AS in vitro, inhibiting all leukemia cell lines at submicromolar concentrations. Both ART-838 and AS cooperated with several established antileukemic drugs and newer kinase inhibitors to inhibit leukemia cell growth. ART-838 had a longer plasma half-life than AS in immunodeficient NOD-SCID-IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice, remaining at effective antileukemic concentrations for >8h. Intermittent cycles of ART-838 inhibited growth of acute leukemia xenografts and primagrafts in NSG mice, at higher potency than AS.

Cytogenetic and molecular alterations are strong prognostic factors, which have been used to individualize treatment. Here, we studied the impact of TP53 mutations on the outcome of AML patients with adverse cytogenetic risk treated with allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Samples of 97 patients with AML and adverse-risk cytogenetics who had received a HSCT within three randomized trials were analysed. Complete sequencing of the TP53 coding region was performed using next generation sequencing. The median age was 51 years. Overall, TP53 mutations were found in 40 patients (41%).

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the distribution of prominent glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene polymorphic variants among adult ALL patients. We also investigated the association between GR messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) isoform expressions and the response to chemotherapy. METHODS: Fifty-two newly diagnosed Philadelphia-negative adult ALL patients and 30 healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. Genotyping was carried out using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. GR mRNA isoform expressions were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: ALL patients in this study had a median age of 34 years (range, 18-75). GRalpha expression was associated with complete remission (P=0.03), while GRgamma mRNA expression was significantly higher in GC resistant patients (P=0.032) and in non-responders (P=0.019). However, there were no significant associations with GC resistance. The BclI polymorphic variant of the GR gene was the most frequent in adult ALL patients and was not associated with the GC response. Both higher GRalpha expression and lower GRgamma expression were associated with achievement of complete remission, while higher GRgamma expression was associated with GC-resistance. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the level of GR isoform expression may be useful in predicting GC response, achievement of complete remission, and better event-free survival in ALL patients. However, further evaluation with a larger cohort of patients is warranted.",,"['Bedewy, Ahmed M L', 'El-Maghraby, Shereen M', 'Kandil, Noha S', 'El-Bendary, Waleed R']","['Bedewy AM', 'El-Maghraby SM', 'Kandil NS', 'El-Bendary WR']","['Hematology Department, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Hematology Department, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Chemical Pathology Department, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Medical Military Academy, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC4705049,,2016/01/16 06:00,2016/01/16 06:01,['2016/01/16 06:00'],"['2015/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2015.50.4.235 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2015 Dec;50(4):235-41. doi: 10.5045/br.2015.50.4.235.

The percentage of blasts expressing IPMs at diagnosis was measured by multicolor flow cytometry analysis. Samples in which >/=20% of blasts expressed an IPM were considered positive. RESULTS: Among the total patient population (N=230), almost all (92%) were in first or second hematological complete remission (HCR) and 54% received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT). Five-year hematologic relapse-free survival (HRFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 36% and 39%, respectively, and 45.6% and 80.5% of patients were positive for the IPMs CD20 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), respectively.

We investigated the expression status and functional roles of CXCR7 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vitro. METHODS: CXCR7 mRNA was knocked down in AML cells by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, and subsequent biological alterations in the cells were evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: All AML cell lines examined in this study (U937, K562, KG1a, HL-60, and MO7e) and primary CD34(+) cells obtained from patients with AML expressed CXCR7 mRNA at various levels. Western blotting showed that all AML cells produced CXCR7. Furthermore, all AML cells expressed CXCR7 in both the cytoplasm and on the cell surface at various levels. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1; C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12)) induced internalization of cell surface CXCR7. However, neither hypoxia nor the examined hematopoietic growth factors (interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-3, IL-6, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte, macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and stem cell factor) and proinflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were found to alter cell surface CXCR7 expression. The transfection of AML cells with CXCR4 siRNA, but not CXCR7 siRNA, significantly impaired the CXCL12-induced transmigration of the cells. The transfection of AML cells with CXCR7 siRNA did not affect the survival or proliferation of these cells. Knockdown of CXCR7, but not CXCR4, induced the upregulation of CXCL12 mRNA expression and CXCL12 production in AML cells.

METHODS: The Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) updated the nationwide analysis on the incidence and survival of myeloid malignancies, from the Korean National Cancer Incidence Database between 1999 and 2012. Myeloid malignancies were classified based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology 3(rd) edition (ICD-O-3). RESULTS: Overall 3,771 cases of myeloid diseases, which was 1.7% of all cancers, were identified in 2012. The highest incidence of myeloid malignancies was observed in age 70s and male predominance was noted (1.3:1). Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the most frequent subtype, followed by myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and MDS/MPN: age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) in 2012 for each disease were 2.02, 1.95, 1.13, and 0.12 per 100,000 persons, respectively. The ASR for all myeloid malignancies was increased from 3.31 in 1999 to 5.70 in 2012 with the annual percentage change (APC) of 5.4 %. Five-year relative survival rate (RS) for myeloid malignancies has gradually improved for decades. RS changed from 26.3% to 34.8% in AML, specifically from 51.6% to 69.6% in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and from 23.8% to 29.9% in non-APL AML, between 1996-2000 and 2008-2012. RS also increased from 81.8% to 87.1% in MPN, with a significant improvement in CML (from 74.5% to 85.5%), and from 27.3% to 31.7% in MDS/MPN between 2001-2005 and 2008-2012. However, there was no survival improvement in MDS during the study period (45.6% in 2001-2005 to 44.4% in 2008-2012).

Peyronie's Disease (PD) is an acquired, localized fibrotic disorder of the tunica albuginea, which leads to penile deformity, pain, and eventually to erectile dysfunction. We report the case of a 52 year old African American male with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who underwent human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling allogeneic peripheral blood SCT. His post transplant course was complicated by development of acute and multi-organ chronic GvHD requiring prolonged immunosuppression. He developed progressive dorsal curvature of the penis with erections within 1 year of ultra low dose interleukin -2 (IL2) treatment for his chronic GvHD but concealed symptoms for several months. Color Doppler Duplex ultrasound evaluation of the erect penis revealed a 75-degree curvature and appropriate hemodynamic response to prostaglandin injection. He underwent successful incision and grafting of the penile plaque. There is no significant residual curvature and is now able to engage in intercourse. A strong temporal association between GVHD (or its treatment) and Peyronie's is documented here.

BCR-ABL is a functional oncoprotein p210 that exhibits constitutively activated tyrosine kinase causing genomic alteration of hematopoietic stem cells. BCR-ABL specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) successfully block CML progression. However, drug resistance owing to BCR-ABL mutations and overexpression is still an issue. Heat-shock proteins (Hsps) function as molecular chaperones facilitating proper folding of nascent polypeptides. Their increased expression under stressful conditions protects cells by stabilizing unfolded or misfolded peptides. Hsp90 is the major mammalian protein and is required by BCR-ABL for stabilization and maturation.

METHOD: Mononuclear cell-induced DC-CIK cells derived from umbilical cord blood were collected and co-cultured in the proportion of 1:5. Cord blood CIK cells or peripheral blood DC-CIK cells were used as control. Phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry; vial cell counting was performed using trypan blue, and the killing activity of effector cells against leukemia cells was measured by MTT assay. The levels of interferon-r (IFN-r), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: The proliferative capacity of DC-CIK cells was obviously improved compared with cord blood CIK cells and peripheral blood DC-CIK cells (P<0.05, P<0.05). During the co-culture of cord blood DC-CIK cells, the ratios of CD 3 (+) CD 8 (+) and CD 3 (+) CD 56 (+) cells were obviously higher than that of CIK cells under the same conditions (P<0.05). On day 3 of co-culture, the levels of IL-12, IFN-r and TNF-a in cultured supernatant of cord blood DC-CIK cells were all higher than those secreted by CIK cells cultured alone (P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.05). When the effector to target ratio was 2.5-20:1, the killing effect of cord blood DC-CIK cells against each subtype of acute leukemia cells was obviously higher than that of CIK cells (P<0.05). No significant differences in killing effect were observed for different subtypes. This finding was consistent with the killing effect of peripheral blood DC-CIK cells against leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: Cord blood DCs can enhance the proliferative capacity of homologous CIK cells and its anti-leukemia effect. Though cord blood DC-CIK cells showed a higher proliferative capacity than peripheral blood DC-CIK cells, the two types of DC-CIK cells did not differ significantly in terms of cytoxicity.

HCBA caused accumulation of H69S, MM.1S, U266 and 8226/S cells in G2/M-phase after 24 h. There was a significant increase in the positive histone H3 cells from a baseline value of 4.38 to 53.45% in 8226/S cells and from 4.32 to 43.83% in MM.1S cells on treatment with HCBA. The results from pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated relatively high oral bioavailability of 83% with distribution in both plasma and bone marrow. In non-tumor bearing SCID mice injected with a single acute lethal dose of HCBA no myelosuppression was observed. Flow cytometry analysis showed cell cycle arrest in metaphase. It also caused inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Thus, HCBA appears to be a potent agent to arrest cell cyclin the metaphase and inhibit tubulin polymerization.

In this study, the viability and phenotypic maturation of EoL-1 cells stimulated by either dbcAMP or butyric acid were comparatively analyzed. After treatment with 100 microM dbcAMP or 0.5 microM butyric acid, EoL-1 cells showed morphological signs of differentiation, although the number of nonviable EoL-1 cells was significantly increased following butyric acid treatment. Stimulation of EoL-1 cells with 0.5 microM butyric acid more effectively induced the expression of mature eosinophil markers than stimulation with dbcAMP. These results suggest that treatment of EoL-1 cells with 0.5 microM butyric acid for limited duration could be an effective strategy for inducing their differentiation.

In cell culture, inhibiting microtubule dynamics prevents spindle assembly, leading to mitotic arrest followed by either apoptosis in mitosis or slippage, whereby a cell returns to interphase without dividing. Myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1), a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family central to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, is degraded during a prolonged mitotic arrest and may therefore act as a mitotic death timer. Consistently, we show that blocking proteasome-mediated degradation inhibits taxol-induced mitotic apoptosis in a Mcl-1-dependent manner. However, this degradation does not require the activity of either APC/C-Cdc20, FBW7 or MULE, three separate E3 ubiquitin ligases implicated in targeting Mcl-1 for degradation. This therefore challenges the notion that Mcl-1 undergoes regulated degradation during mitosis. We also show that Mcl-1 is continuously synthesized during mitosis and that blocking protein synthesis accelerates taxol induced death-in-mitosis. Modulating Mcl-1 levels also influences slippage; overexpressing Mcl-1 extends the time from mitotic entry to mitotic exit in the presence of taxol, while inhibiting Mcl-1 accelerates it. We suggest that Mcl-1 competes with Cyclin B1 for binding to components of the proteolysis machinery, thereby slowing down the slow degradation of Cyclin B1 responsible for slippage. Thus, modulating Mcl-1 dynamics influences both death-in-mitosis and slippage. However, because mitotic degradation of Mcl-1 appears not to be under the control of an E3 ligase, we suggest that the notion of network crosstalk is used with caution.",,"['Sloss, Olivia', 'Topham, Caroline', 'Diez, Maria', 'Taylor, Stephen']","['Sloss O', 'Topham C', 'Diez M', 'Taylor S']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom.', 'Present Address: School of Environment & Life Sciences, Cockcroft Building, University of Salford, Salford M5 4WT, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom.', 'Present Address: School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, City Hospital, Nottingham NG5 1PB, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/L006839/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'A11913/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MR/L011840/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '11913/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Humans', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*genetics', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Paclitaxel']",PMC4868679,,2016/01/16 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/01/16 06:00'],"['2015/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['6894 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6894 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Feb 2;7(5):5176-92. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6894.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['APC/C-Cdc20', 'Bcl-xL', 'Chromosome Section', 'FBW7', 'Taxol', 'spindle assembly checkpoint']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, to test its potential anti-cancer activity, the aqueous extract was prepared from FBRA powder, and the effect of this extract on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells was directly examined. The exposure to FBRA extract reduced the cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The reduction of the cell viability was accompanied by the DNA fragmentation, and partially restored by treatment with pan-caspase inhibitor. Further studies showed that FBRA extract induced the cleavage of caspase-8, -9, and -3, and decreased Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, the expression of tBid, DR5, and Fas proteins was enhanced by FBRA extract, and the pretreatment with caspase-8 inhibitor, but not caspase-9 inhibitor, restored the reduction of the cell viability induced by FBRA extract. These findings suggested that FBRA extract could induce the apoptotic death of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells probably through mainly the death receptor-mediated pathway and supplementarily through the tBid-mediated mitochondrial pathway, proposing the possibility that FBRA was a potential functional food beneficial to patients with hematological cancer.",,"['Horie, Yukiko', 'Nemoto, Hideyuki', 'Itoh, Mari', 'Kosaka, Hiroaki', 'Morita, Kyoji']","['Horie Y', 'Nemoto H', 'Itoh M', 'Kosaka H', 'Morita K']","['Research and Development Division, Koken Co., Ltd., 329, Nakagoya, Tobetsu, Ishikari-gun, Hokkaido, 061-0211, Japan. horie@genmaikoso.co.jp.', 'Research and Development Division, Koken Co., Ltd., 329, Nakagoya, Tobetsu, Ishikari-gun, Hokkaido, 061-0211, Japan.', 'Research and Development Division, Koken Co., Ltd., 329, Nakagoya, Tobetsu, Ishikari-gun, Hokkaido, 061-0211, Japan.', 'Research and Development Division, Koken Co., Ltd., 329, Nakagoya, Tobetsu, Ishikari-gun, Hokkaido, 061-0211, Japan.', 'Life Science Research Group, Shikoku University School of Health Sciences, Ohjin, Tokushima, 771-1192, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Biochem Biotechnol,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,8208561,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8/biosynthesis', 'Caspase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Oryza/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Death Domain/genetics']",,,2016/01/16 06:00,2017/01/14 06:00,['2016/01/16 06:00'],"['2015/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12010-015-1970-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12010-015-1970-y [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Biochem Biotechnol. 2016 Apr;178(8):1599-611. doi: 10.1007/s12010-015-1970-y.

Imatinib was the first TKI approved, and has been considered the standard of care for more than a decade. Second generation compounds, namely dasatinib and nilotinib, are highly effective in newly diagnosed patients as well as those who fail imatinib. Second generation TKIs have been demonstrated to induce deeper and faster responses compared to imatinib, however no survival advantage has been observed so far. Today, the expected survival of CML patients, if properly managed, is likely to be similar to the general population. Clinicians are faced the challenge of making decision for which TKI to choose upfront. Comorbidities of the patient, the side effect profile, and the cost of the TKI of interest should be an important consideration in decision making. Whatever TKI is chosen as frontline, noncompliance or treatment failure should be recognized early as a prompt intervention increases the chance of achieving best possible response. Herein, we review the frontline options for the management of patients with CML and how to best choose these agents.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Jabbour, Elias']",['Jabbour E'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Extracellular miRNAs circulate in the bloodstream inside exosomes or in complexes with proteins and lipoproteins. The miRNA sequences and their quantitative levels are used as unique signatures associated with cancer diagnosis and prognosis after anticancer treatment. MicroRNAs are modified through a series of processing events after transcription like 5'-end phosphorylation, 3'- end adenylation or uridylation, terminal nucleotide deletion. The problem is that existing bioanalytical methods such as microarrays and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction are sensitive, but not capable of identifying the post-transcriptional modifications of miRNA. Here we report a capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) method, which performs a multiplex, direct analysis of miRNAs from biological samples. Using the CE-MS method, we detected two endogenous human circulating miRNAs, a 23-nucleotide long 5'-phosporylated miRNA with 3'-uridylation (iso-miR-16-5p), and a 22-nucleotide long 5'-phosporylated miRNA (miR-21-5p) isolated from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia serum. The CE separation and following MS analysis provides label-free quantitation and reveals modifications of miRNAs.

BACKGROUND: PG is an uncommon idiopathic, ulcerative, chronic inflammatory cutaneous disorder of unknown etiology, which is associated with systemic diseases found in more than 50% of patients. Oral lesions of PG are extremely rare and have not been previously reported on chronic leukemia patient. CLINICAL REPORT: This report presents the first case of a 73 year-old man who had PG-like oral ulcerations which offered the possibility of an initial finding of chronic myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should always take into consideration that PG in the oral mucosa is a recalcitrant ulcer and can precede the development of underlying clonal malignancy.","['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S and The Gerodontology Association.

To elucidate the effect of specific HLA alleles on acute graft-versus-host disease, we conducted a retrospective analysis using 6967 Japanese patients transplanted with T-cell-replete marrow from an unrelated donor. Using unbiased searches of patient and donor HLA alleles, patient and/or donor HLA-B*51:01 (patient: HR, 1.37,P<0.001; donor: HR, 1.35,P<0.001) and patient HLA-C*14:02 (HR, 1.35,P<0.001) were significantly associated with an increased risk of severe acute graft-versus-host disease. The finding that donor HLA-C*14:02 was not associated with severe acute graft-versus-host disease prompted us to elucidate the relation of these high-risk HLA alleles with patient and donor HLA-C allele mismatches. In comparison to HLA-C allele match, patient mismatched HLA-C*14:02 showed the highest risk of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (HR, 3.61,P<0.001) and transplant-related mortality (HR, 2.53,P<0.001) among all patient mismatched HLA-C alleles. Although patient HLA-C*14:02 and donor HLA-C*15:02 mismatch was usually KIR2DL-ligand mismatch in the graft-versus-host direction, the risk of patient mismatched HLA-C*14:02 for severe acute graft-versus-host disease was obvious regardless of KIR2DL-ligand matching. The effect of patient and/or donor HLA-B*51:01 on acute graft-versus-host disease was attributed not only to strong linkage disequilibrium of HLA-C*14:02 and -B*51:01, but also to the effect of HLA-B*51:01 itself. With regard to clinical implications, patient mismatched HLA-C*14:02 proved to be a potent risk factor for severe acute graft-versus-host disease and mortality, and should be considered a non-permissive HLA-C mismatch in donor selection for unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Morishima, Satoko', 'Kashiwase, Koichi', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Azuma, Fumihiro', 'Yabe, Toshio', 'Sato-Otsubo, Aiko', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Shiina, Takashi', 'Satake, Masahiro', 'Saji, Hiroh', 'Kato, Shunichi', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa', 'Sasazuki, Takehiko', 'Morishima, Yasuo']","['Morishima S', 'Kashiwase K', 'Matsuo K', 'Azuma F', 'Yabe T', 'Sato-Otsubo A', 'Ogawa S', 'Shiina T', 'Satake M', 'Saji H', 'Kato S', 'Kodera Y', 'Sasazuki T', 'Morishima Y']","['Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Tokyo, Japan smorishi@fujita-hu.ac.jp.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kanto-Koshinetsu Block Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Divsion of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kanto-Koshinetsu Block Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kanto-Koshinetsu Block Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.', 'Division of Basic Medical Science and Molecular Medicine, Department of Molecular Life Science, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kanto-Koshinetsu Block Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Promotion for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Institute for Advanced Study, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Anemia, Aplastic/genetics/immunology/mortality/*therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contraindications', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-C Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Receptors, KIR2DL1/genetics/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Unrelated Donors']",PMC5004392,,2016/01/16 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2016/01/16 06:00'],"['2015/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.136903 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.136903 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Apr;101(4):491-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.136903.

These mutations-in particular the most common substitution, V600E-are oncogenic drivers and important therapeutic targets. The development of small-molecule Raf inhibitors allowed rapid translation of basic advances to the clinic. In BRAF-mutant melanomas, orally bioavailable B-Raf inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, achieve dramatic responses initially, but this is followed by rapid emergence of resistance driven by numerous mechanisms and requiring second-generation treatment approaches. In tumors with wild-type B-Raf, vemurafenib paradoxically activates downstream signaling and cell proliferation and is thus contraindicated, highlighting again the importance of genotype-based clinical decision making. These advances were greatly facilitated by the study of biopsied tumor tissue, especially at the time of drug resistance.

Our previous study has shown that the lpqS gene deletion mutant of M. tuberculosis (MtbDeltalpqS) poorly replicates in THP1-(human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) derived macrophagic cell line. In addition, guinea pigs, when infected with the mutant strain exhibited significantly reduced bacterial burden and pathological damage in the infected tissues in comparison with the parental strain infected group. Subsequently, we evaluated the protective efficacy of the mutant by immunization of guinea pigs through aerosol and subcutaneous routes. We observed that immunization of guinea pigs with MtbDeltalpqS offered superior protection in lungs as compared to BCG. In addition, MtbDeltalpqS also prevented the haematogenous spread of the disease which was evident from the significantly reduced splenic bacillary load compared to saline vaccinated animals. The gross pathological observations and the histopathological observations well corroborated the bacterial findings. We also observed that aerogenic route of immunization imparts superior protection compared to subcutaneous route of immunization.

Transcriptome and functional studies reveal that each GSK-3beta and GSK-3alpha uniquely contributes to AML by affecting Wnt/Akt/mTOR signaling and metabolism, respectively. The molecular signature of HSCs deleted for GSK-3beta provided a prognostic tool for disease progression and survival of MDS patients.

RECENT FINDINGS: Maintenance treatment approaches utilizing conventional chemotherapy, immunomodulation, hypomethylating agents, targeted small molecules, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been explored in this setting. The published data have not yet demonstrated convincing efficacy to merit establishment of this approach as standard of care. The role of hypomethylating agents and novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors is being actively studied in phase II/III trials and may improve patient outcome.

It may be advantageous to identify patients with suboptimal treatment responses early as they may benefit from timely care strategy changes. Here, responses portending failure of standard induction therapy are reviewed and therapeutic options examined, including use of investigational, targeted agents for suitable patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients entering complete remission without minimal residual disease early, that is, with one cycle of standard induction chemotherapy, have a lower relapse risk and live longer than other similarly-treated patients, supporting the proposition of early complete remission without minimal residual disease as a criterion for induction therapy success. Investigational small molecule drugs are appealing for patients who fail standard therapies, but complete remission rates as a single agent are typically modest. SUMMARY: The relative value of different treatment strategies if a first standard induction therapy cycle fails to produce complete remission is unknown. However, retreatment with the same therapy often leads to complete remission and provides a benchmark against which other approaches should be compared. Addition of investigational small molecule drugs to standard reinduction therapy in patients with actionable targets could offer an attractive therapeutic strategy in this situation that might improve outcomes and facilitate clinical drug testing.",,"['Walter, Roland B']",['Walter RB'],"['aClinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center bDivision of Hematology, Department of Medicine cDepartment of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*therapy', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment', '*Therapies, Investigational', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/01/15 06:00,2016/11/05 06:00,['2016/01/15 06:00'],"['2016/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000213 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Mar;23(2):102-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000213.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the search for functional foods as complementary therapies against lung cancer, the immuno-stimulatory properties of the vegetable Morinda citrifolia leaves were investigated and compared with the anti-cancer drug erlotinib. Lung tumour-induced BALB/c mice were fed with 150 mg kg(-1) or 300 mg kg(-1) body weight of the leaf extract, or erlotinib (50 mg kg(-1) body-weight) for 21 days. The 300 mg kg(-1) body weight extract significantly (and dose-dependently) suppressed lung tumour growth; the extract worked more effectively than the 50 mg kg(-1) body weight erlotinib treatment. The extract significantly increased blood lymphocyte counts, and spleen tissue B cells, T cells and natural killer cells, and reduced the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is a lung adenocarcinoma biomarker. The extract also suppressed the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inflammatory markers, and enhanced the tumour suppressor gene (phosphatase and tensin homolog, PTEN). It inhibited tumour growth cellular gene (transformed mouse 3T3 cell double minute 2 (MDM2), V-raf-leukemia viral oncogene 1 (RAF1), and mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR)) mRNA expression in the tumours.

Use of methotrexate, ciclosporin, or cyclophosphamide as first therapy improves cytopenias in 50% of patients, but long-term use of these can lead to toxicity. We aimed to explore the activity and safety of alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, in patients with T-LGL. METHODS: We did this single-arm, phase 2 trial in consecutively enrolled adults with T-LGL referred to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, USA. Alemtuzumab was given intravenously at 10 mg per day for 10 days. The primary endpoint was haematological response at 3 months after infusion. A complete response was defined as normalisation of all affected lineages, and a partial response was defined in neutropenic patients as 100% increase in the absolute neutrophil count to more than 5 x 10(8) cells per L, and in those with anaemia, as any increase in haemoglobin of 20 g/L or higher observed in at least two serial measurements 1 week apart and sustained for 1 month or longer without exogenous growth factors support or transfusions. Analysis was by intention to treat. We report results from the first stage of this Simon two-stage design trial; enrolment into the second stage is continuing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00345345. FINDINGS: From Oct 1, 2006, to March 1, 2015, we enrolled 25 patients with T-LGL. 14 patients (56%; 95% CI 35-76) had a haematological response at 3 months. Four patients with associated myelodysplastic syndrome and two who had received haemopoietic stem cell transplantation had either no response or were not evaluable, meaning 14 (74% [49-91]) of the 19 patients with classic T-LGL responded. All patients had an infusion reaction (24 [96%] patients grade 1-2, one [4%] patient grade 3), which improved with symptomatic therapy. All patients developed lymphopenia, with 22 (88%) patients having grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. The other most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were leukopenia (eight [32%]) and neutropenic infections (five [20%]). Seven patients died; all were non-responders. INTERPRETATION: This is the largest and only prospective study of alemtuzumab in patients with T-LGL. The activity reported with a single course of a lymphocytotoxic drug in patients with mainly relapsed and refractory disease suggests that haematological response can be achieved without continued use of oral immunosuppression.

Among the cutoff values with a similar Youden index, 150 x 10E9/L (abbreviated WBC > 150) was selected to identify the greatest amount of patients with the potential to achieve a sustained molecular response of 4.5 (MR4.5). Regardless of whether the Sokal risk score was included, the BCR-ABL value at 3 months, WBC counts at presentation, hemoglobin levels, and sex were the common independent predictors for an MR4.5, with the former 2 presenting the highest hazard risk. Low Sokal risk scores did not independently predict the achievement of an MR4.5. Patients with concurrent WBC > 150 and BCR-ABL(IS) </= 10% had a similar incidence of 4-year MR4.5 compared with patients with concurrent WBC </= 150 and BCR-ABL(IS) > 10% and concurrent WBC > 150 and BCR-ABL(IS) > 10% (13.5% vs 13.2% vs 8.8%, P = 0.47), and all of these values were significantly lower than the values for patients with concurrent WBC </= 150 and BCR-ABL(IS) </= 10% (55.0%, all P < 0.0001). Patients with concurrent WBC </= 150 and BCR-ABL(IS) </= 10% had better 4-year event-free survival rates, progression-free survival rates, and overall survival rates compared with patients with WBC > 150 or BCR-ABL(IS) > 10%. The combination of WBC count at presentation and BCR-ABL(IS) at 3 months provides improved predictions of deep molecular response in imatinib-treated CML-CP patients. Therefore, the WBC count at presentation might be used to differentiate patients at the beginning of imatinib treatment.",,"['Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Lai, Yue-Yun', 'Zhu, Hong-Hu', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Qin YZ', 'Jiang Q', 'Jiang H', 'Lai YY', 'Zhu HH', 'Liu YR', 'Jiang B', 'Huang XJ']","[""From the Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/*mortality/physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4718283,,2016/01/15 06:00,2016/06/01 06:00,['2016/01/15 06:00'],"['2016/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000002486 [doi]', '00005792-201601120-00065 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Jan;95(2):e2486. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000002486.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this promising notion, to date, there is no comprehensive study addressing autophagy-related genes expression status in AML. As a critical mediator, BECN1 influences the onset and advance of autophagy and several studies have pointed to the BECN1 recurrent allelic deletion and expression variation in a broad range of tumors. To explore this caveat, we chose this alteration-prone gene to investigate in our study. METHODS: We have analyzed the expression status of BECN1 in a series of 128 de novo AML patients using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: In our favorable subgroup, BECN1 expression did not alter (P = 0.301), but in intermediate and unfavorable patients, we have had BECN1 low expression compared to the normal controls (P = 0.008 and P < 0.001, respectively). We found evidence for the association of reduced expression of BECN1 with FLT3-ITD mutation (19 of 27 patients), monosomal karyotype (all of 11 patients), higher age, and WBC count. CONCLUSION: Overall, remarkable association of reduced expression of BECN1 with FLT3-ITD mutation and monosomal karyotype and their functional relationship is interesting which should be addressed and verified in future studies.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Zare-Abdollahi, D', 'Safari, S', 'Movafagh, A', 'Ghadiani, M', 'Tabarraee, M', 'Riazi-Isfahani, S', 'Gorji, S', 'Keyvan, L', 'Gachkar, L']","['Zare-Abdollahi D', 'Safari S', 'Movafagh A', 'Ghadiani M', 'Tabarraee M', 'Riazi-Isfahani S', 'Gorji S', 'Keyvan L', 'Gachkar L']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Social Determinants of Health, National Institute of Health Research, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, South PNU Centre, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Center, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Beclin-1/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2016/01/15 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12454 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2016 Apr;38(2):125-32. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12454.

With the aim to improve the understanding of how HDACis work in vivo, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the clinically approved HDACi Givinostat in a collection of nine pediatric human T-ALL engrafted systemically in NOD/SCID mice. We observed highly heterogeneous antileukemia responses to Givinostat, associated with reduction of the percentage of infiltrating blasts in target organs, induction of apoptosis and differentiation. These effects were not associated with the T-ALL cytogenetic subgroup. Transcriptome analysis disclosed an immediate transcriptional signature enriched in genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and DNA repair, which was validated by quantitative RT-PCR and was associated with in vivo response to this HDACi. Increased phospho-H2AX levels, a marker of DNA damage, were measured in T-ALL cells from Givinostat responders. These results indicate that the induction of the DNA damage response could be an early biomarker of the therapeutic effects of Givinostat in T-ALL models.

Whether or not these oncoproteins interfere with other DNA-dependent processes is largely unexplored. Here, we show that LMO2 is recruited to DNA replication origins by interaction with three essential replication enzymes: DNA polymerase delta (POLD1), DNA primase (PRIM1), and minichromosome 6 (MCM6). Furthermore, tethering LMO2 to synthetic DNA sequences is sufficient to transform these sequences into origins of replication. We next addressed the importance of LMO2 in erythroid and thymocyte development, two lineages in which cell cycle and differentiation are tightly coordinated. Lowering LMO2 levels in erythroid progenitors delays G1-S progression and arrests erythropoietin-dependent cell growth while favoring terminal differentiation. Conversely, ectopic expression in thymocytes induces DNA replication and drives these cells into cell cycle, causing differentiation blockade. Our results define a novel role for LMO2 in directly promoting DNA synthesis and G1-S progression.",,"['Sincennes, Marie-Claude', 'Humbert, Magali', 'Grondin, Benoit', 'Lisi, Veronique', 'Veiga, Diogo F T', 'Haman, Andre', 'Cazaux, Christophe', 'Mashtalir, Nazar', 'Affar, El Bachir', 'Verreault, Alain', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Sincennes MC', 'Humbert M', 'Grondin B', 'Lisi V', 'Veiga DF', 'Haman A', 'Cazaux C', 'Mashtalir N', 'Affar el B', 'Verreault A', 'Hoang T']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3C 3J7; Molecular Biology Program, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H1T 2M4;', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3C 3J7;', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3C 3J7;', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3C 3J7; Molecular Biology Program, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H1T 2M4;', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3C 3J7;', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3C 3J7;', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Toulouse 31024, France;', 'Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H1T 2M4;', 'Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H1T 2M4;', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3C 3J7; Molecular Biology Program, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H1T 2M4; Departments of Pharmacology and Biochemistry, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3T 1J2.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3C 3J7; Molecular Biology Program, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H1T 2M4; Departments of Pharmacology and Biochemistry, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3T 1J2 trang.hoang@umontreal.ca.']",['eng'],['MOP111050/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Animals', 'DNA Replication/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Replication Origin', 'S Phase']",PMC4747768,,2016/01/15 06:00,2016/08/09 06:00,['2016/01/15 06:00'],"['2016/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1515071113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1515071113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Feb 2;113(5):1393-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1515071113.

JMML leukemogenesis is linked to a hyperactivated RAS pathway, with driver mutations in the KRAS, NRAS, NF1, PTPN11, or CBL genes. Previous murine models demonstrated how those genes contributed to the selective hypersensitivity of JMML cells to granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a unifying characteristic in the disease. However, it is unclear what causes the early death in children with JMML, because transformation to acute leukemia is rare. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog) protein at postnatal day 8 in mice harboring Nf1 haploinsufficiency results in an aggressive MPN with death at a murine prepubertal age of 20 to 35 days (equivalent to an early juvenile age in JMML patients). The death in the mice was due to organ infiltration with monocytes/macrophages. There were elevated activities of protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in cells at physiological concentrations of GM-CSF. These were more pronounced in mice with Nf1 haploinsufficiency than in littermates with wild-type Nf1,but this model is insufficient to cause cells to be GM-CSF hypersensitive. This new model represents a murine MPN model with features of a pediatric unclassifiable mixed MDS/MPN and mimics many clinical manifestations of JMML in terms of age of onset, aggressiveness, and organ infiltration with monocytes/macrophages. Our data suggest that the timing of the loss of PTEN protein plays a critical role in determining the disease severity in myeloid malignancies. This model may be useful for studying the pathogenesis of pediatric diseases with alterations in the Ras pathway.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Liu, Y Lucy', 'Yan, Yan', 'Webster, Cody', 'Shao, Lijian', 'Lensing, Shelly Y', 'Ni, Hongyu', 'Feng, Wei', 'Colorado, Natalia', 'Pathak, Rupak', 'Xiang, Zhifu', 'Hauer-Jensen, Martin', 'Li, Shaoguang', 'Zhou, Daohong', 'Emanuel, Peter D']","['Liu YL', 'Yan Y', 'Webster C', 'Shao L', 'Lensing SY', 'Ni H', 'Feng W', 'Colorado N', 'Pathak R', 'Xiang Z', 'Hauer-Jensen M', 'Li S', 'Zhou D', 'Emanuel PD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Winthrop P.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of the PIM2 gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to examine its role in apoptosis of the blastic cells. We analyzed the PIM2 expression in 148 patients: 91 with AML, 57 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 24 healthy controls by Real-Time PCR and Western blot. Inhibition of the PIM2 gene in human leukemic HL60 cell line was performed with RNAi and apoptosis rate was analyzed. Our results indicate that overexpression of PIM2 in AML is associated with low complete remission rate, high-risk cytogenetics, shorter leukemia-free survival, and event-free survival. Cytometric analysis of HL60/PAC-GFP and HL60/PAC-GFP-shPIM2 cells revealed an increase in the number of apoptotic cells after inhibition of PIM2 gene. In summary, the elevated expression of PIM2 in blastic cells is associated with poor prognosis of AML patients and their resistance to induction therapy.",,"['Kapelko-Slowik, Katarzyna', 'Owczarek, Tomasz B', 'Grzymajlo, Krzysztof', 'Urbaniak-Kujda, Donata', 'Jazwiec, Bozena', 'Slowik, Miroslaw', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz', 'Ugorski, Maciej']","['Kapelko-Slowik K', 'Owczarek TB', 'Grzymajlo K', 'Urbaniak-Kujda D', 'Jazwiec B', 'Slowik M', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Ugorski M']","['a Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation , Wroclaw Medical University , Wroclaw , Poland ;', 'b Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy Polish Academy of Sciences , Wroclaw , Poland ;', 'c Department of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology , Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences , Wroclaw , Poland ;', 'c Department of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology , Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences , Wroclaw , Poland ;', 'a Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation , Wroclaw Medical University , Wroclaw , Poland ;', 'a Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation , Wroclaw Medical University , Wroclaw , Poland ;', 'd Department of Ophthalmology , Wroclaw Medical University , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'a Department of Hematology, Neoplastic Blood Disorders and Bone Marrow Transplantation , Wroclaw Medical University , Wroclaw , Poland ;', 'b Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy Polish Academy of Sciences , Wroclaw , Poland ;', 'c Department of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology , Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences , Wroclaw , Poland ;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/01/15 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/01/15 06:00'],"['2016/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2015.1124991 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 Sep;57(9):2140-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2015.1124991.

While the etiologic mechanisms and the glial subtypes involved remain unresolved, infection of NG2 glia was recently observed to correlate spatially and temporally with altered neuronal physiology and spongiogenesis. Since one role of NG2 cells is to serve as oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitor cells (OPCs), we examined here whether their infection by neurovirulent (FrCasE) or nonneurovirulent (Fr57E) ecotropic MLVs influenced their viability and/or differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that OPCs, but not OLs, are major CNS targets of both FrCasE and Fr57E. We also show that MLV infection of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in culture did not affect survival, proliferation, or OPC progenitor marker expression but suppressed certain glial differentiation markers. Assessment of glial differentiation in vivo using transplanted transgenic NPCs showed that, while MLVs did not affect cellular engraftment or survival, they did inhibit OL differentiation, irrespective of MLV neurovirulence. In addition, in chimeric brains, where FrCasE-infected NPC transplants caused neurodegeneration, the transplanted NPCs proliferated. These results suggest that MLV infection is not directly cytotoxic to OPCs but rather acts to interfere with OL differentiation. Since both FrCasE and Fr57E viruses restrict OL differentiation but only FrCasE induces overt neurodegeneration, restriction of OL maturation alone cannot account for neuropathogenesis. Instead neurodegeneration may involve a two-hit scenario where interference with OPC differentiation combined with glial Env-induced neuronal hyperexcitability precipitates disease. IMPORTANCE: A variety of human and animal retroviruses are capable of causing central nervous system (CNS) neurodegeneration manifested as motor and cognitive deficits. These retroviruses infect a variety of CNS cell types; however, the specific role each cell type plays in neuropathogenesis remains to be established. The NG2 glia, whose CNS functions are only now emerging, are a newly appreciated viral target in murine leukemia virus (MLV)-induced neurodegeneration. Since one role of NG2 glia is that of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), we investigated here whether their infection by the neurovirulent MLV FrCasE contributed to neurodegeneration by affecting OPC viability and/or development. Our results show that both neurovirulent and nonneurovirulent MLVs interfere with oligodendrocyte differentiation. Thus, NG2 glial infection could contribute to neurodegeneration by preventing myelin formation and/or repair and by suspending OPCs in a state of persistent susceptibility to excitotoxic insult mediated by neurovirulent virus effects on other glial subtypes.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Surveys of somatic alterations in solid tumors have shown sporadic 13q14.3 loss in many different tumor types, but not at high frequency in any specific tumor type. In our recent survey of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray data from 127 000 cancer-free or solid tumor cases, we observed mosaic 13q14.3 loss as common autosomal somatic large structural events (>2 Mb in size) in blood and buccal-derived DNA. Herein, we examined this region more closely investigating structural mosaic events <2 Mb using SNP microarray data in 46 254 non-hematologic cancer cases and 36 229 controls. We detected 60 individuals with 13q14.3 mosaic loss, 1 mosaic copy neutral uniparental disomy and 13 individuals with homozygosity. Although 13q14.3 loss size was variable, the minimally deleted region (MDR) (chr13: 49 590 000-49 983 100; GRCh36) was comparable to what is classically reported in MBL and CLL. Breakpoint analysis of the estimated boundaries reveals enrichment for genes and open chromatin. The frequency of 13q14.3 loss significantly increases with increasing age (P-value=0.028), but was not significantly different between non-hematological cancer cases and controls (0.084% versus 0.058%; P-value=0.19). These findings suggest that mosaic 13q14.3 losses accumulate with age. Individuals with detected mosaic 13q14.3 deletions may be early, undetected cases of MBL or CLL, but not necessarily all will develop MBL and CLL.",,"['Machiela, Mitchell J', 'Zhou, Weiyin', 'Caporaso, Neil', 'Dean, Michael', 'Gapstur, Susan M', 'Goldin, Lynn', 'Stevens, Victoria L', 'Yeager, Meredith', 'Chanock, Stephen J']","['Machiela MJ', 'Zhou W', 'Caporaso N', 'Dean M', 'Gapstur SM', 'Goldin L', 'Stevens VL', 'Yeager M', 'Chanock SJ']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Center for Cancer Research, Frederick National Laboratory, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Z01 CP010178-06/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Breakage', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mosaicism', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",PMC4880507,['NIHMS744056'],2016/01/15 06:00,2017/04/07 06:00,['2016/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['jhg2015166 [pii]', '10.1038/jhg.2015.166 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2016 May;61(5):411-8. doi: 10.1038/jhg.2015.166.

Thus, t(8;21)(q22;q22) and del(5q) appear to be mutually exclusive, and the association between them has not been characterized yet. Here, we report an 81-year-old woman with coexistent t(8;21)(q22;q22) and del(5q) at initial diagnosis. The bone marrow was infiltrated with 18.4% myeloblasts, and showed marked myeloid and erythroid dysplasia. Myeloblasts were positive for CD19 and CD56 as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. G-banding and spectral karyotyping showed 46,XX,del(5)(q?),t(8;21)(q22;q22)[18]/46,XX[2]. Both del(5)(q?) and t(8;21)(q22;q22) were present in a single clone. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase spreads detected a RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion signal on the der(8)t(8;21)(q22;q22), and confirmed deletion of CSF1R signaling at 5q33-q34 on the del(5)(q?). Furthermore, FISH on interphase nuclei revealed that the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion signal and deletion of CSF1R signaling were found in 66.0% and 58.0% of interphase cells, respectively, suggesting that del(5)(q?) occurred in cells with RUNX1/RUNX1T1. These results indicated a diagnosis of AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1/RUNX1T1 rather than MDS, even though the percentage of bone marrow myeloblasts was less than 20%.

In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical impact of TIGIT in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and dissect the role of TIGIT in the pathogenesis of leukemia progression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TIGIT expression on T cells from peripheral blood collected from patients with AML was examined by flow cytometry. The correlation of TIGIT expression to clinical outcomes, including rate of complete remission and relapse post-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in AML patients, was analyzed. Phenotypic and functional study (cytokine release, proliferation, killing, and apoptosis) of TIGIT-expressing T cells were performed. Using siRNA to silence TIGIT, we further elucidated the regulatory role of TIGIT in the T-cell immune response by dissecting the effect of TIGIT knockdown on cytokine release and apoptosis of T cells from AML patients. RESULTS: TIGIT expression on CD8(+) T cells is elevated in AML patients and high-TIGIT correlates with primary refractory disease and leukemia relapse post-alloSCT. TIGIT(+) CD8(+) T cells display phenotypic features of exhaustion and exhibit functional impairment manifested by low production of cytokines and high susceptibility to apoptosis. Importantly, their functional defects are reversed by TIGIT knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: TIGIT contributes to functional T-cell impairment and associates with poor clinical outcome in AML. Our study suggests that blockade of TIGIT to restore T-cell function and antitumor immunity may represent a novel effective leukemia therapeutic. Clin Cancer Res; 22(12); 3057-66.

Several superficial lymph nodes (Lymphonodi mandibulares, parotidei and mammariae) were enlarged, had a tight-elastic consistency and were freely movable. The histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of skin biopsies showed the presence of multifocal cutaneous T-cell lymphosarcomas consistent with a skin leukosis. Bovine leukemia virus infection was excluded by serological investigation of a milk sample and virological examination of a tissue sample, respectively. Seven weeks after the first clinical examination, the cow deteriorated rapidly and was euthanized.

Drug interactions with sirolimus, voriconazole, and rifampin are particularly difficult because of the complex and simultaneous enzyme inhibition and induction mechanisms. We report a hematopoietic cell transplantation patient receiving sirolimus and voriconazole who was given rifampin while being treated for presumed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus meningitis. Summary A 31 year-old female received a nonmyeloablative allogeneic umbilical cord hematopoietic cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Her graft versus host disease and antifungal prophylaxis included sirolimus and voriconazole, respectively. Therapeutic drug monitoring prior to admission revealed a stable outpatient sirolimus regimen of 0.4 mg orally daily (trough goal 3-12 mcg/L). She was admitted to the inpatient hematopoietic cell transplantation service and diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and presumed bacterial meningitis 217 days after transplant. Intravenous rifampin and vancomycin were initiated and voriconazole was changed to micafungin. Sirolimus trough concentrations were undetectable two days after starting rifampin. Therapeutic sirolimus concentrations were achieved four days later, at a sirolimus dose of 16-18 mg orally daily. Rifampin was discontinued after nine days and the sirolimus dose was adjusted accordingly, maintaining therapeutic levels throughout follow-up. The patient suffered a flare of chronic skin graft versus host disease requiring etanercept, high-dose systemic steroids, and topical steroids. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the management of sirolimus during the transition from voriconazole inhibition to rifampin induction.

However, this aspect has been mostly neglected in the literature investigating choice of treatment for chronic hematological conditions. In this paper, a patient centered model and a shared decision making (SDM) approach to treatment switch in chronic hematological conditions, in particular chronic myeloid leukemia, atrial fibrillation, and beta-thalassemia is proposed. These pathologies have a series of implications requiring important decisions about new available treatments. Although new generation treatments may provide a significant improvement in patient's health and health-related quality of life (HrQoL), a significant percentage of them is uncertain about or refuse treatment switch, even when strongly suggested by healthcare guidelines. Possible cognitive and emotional factors which may influence decision making in this field and may prevent appropriate risk-and-benefits evaluation of new treatment approaches are reviewed. Possible adaptive strategies to improve quality of care, patient participation, adherence to treatment and final satisfaction are proposed, and implications relatively to new treatment options available are discussed.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, race may have differential effect on GVHD dependent on the graft source. North American Caucasian and Japanese patients receiving their first allogeneic BMT or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling for leukemia were eligible. BMT was performed in 13% of the Caucasian patients and in 53% of the Japanese patients. On multivariate analysis, the interaction term between race and graft source was not significant in any of the models, indicating that graft source does not affect the impact of race on outcomes. The risk of grade III or IV acute GVHD was significantly lower in the Japanese patients compared with the Caucasian patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.96), which resulted in lower risk of nonrelapse mortality in the Japanese patients (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.89). The risk of relapse was also lower in this group. The lower risks of nonrelapse mortality and relapse resulted in lower overall mortality rates among the Japanese patients.

Doxorubicin intercalates into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and disrupts genes encoding for polypeptides that make adenosine triphosphate. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined mtDNA copy numbers per cell and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 64 childhood survivors of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had been treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute childhood ALL protocols and had received doxorubicin alone (42%) or doxorubicin with the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane (58%). The number of mtDNA copies per cell and the OXPHOS enzyme activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (complex I [CI]) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV [CIV]) were measured with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction immunoassays and thin-layer chromatography, respectively. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 7.8 years after treatment, the median number of mtDNA copies per cell for patients treated with doxorubicin alone (1106.3) was significantly higher than the median number for those who had also received dexrazoxane (310.5; P = .001). No significant differences were detected between the groups for CI or CIV activity. CONCLUSIONS: Doxorubicin-treated survivors had an increased number of PBMC mtDNA copies per cell, and concomitant use of dexrazoxane was associated with a lower number of mtDNA copies per cell. Because of a possible compensatory increase in mtDNA copies per cell to maintain mitochondrial function in the setting of mitochondrial dysfunction, overall OXPHOS activity was not different between the groups. The long-term sustainability of this compensatory response in these survivors at risk for cardiac dysfunction over their lifespan is concerning.",['(c) 2016 American Cancer Society.'],"['Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Anderson, Lynn M', 'Miller, Tracie L', 'Gerschenson, Mariana', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Franco, Vivian I', 'LiButti, Daniel E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Vrooman, Lynda M', 'Sallan, Stephen E']","['Lipshultz SE', 'Anderson LM', 'Miller TL', 'Gerschenson M', 'Stevenson KE', 'Neuberg DS', 'Franco VI', 'LiButti DE', 'Silverman LB', 'Vrooman LM', 'Sallan SE']","[""Wayne State University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan."", 'Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detriot, Michigan.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology Cell and Molecular Biology, John A.

Mutations in the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) gene were found to cause Weaver syndrome, and have been associated with hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We present the first report of a patient with Weaver syndrome, who developed AML and harbored an EZH2 mutation. The clinical course of the 16-year-old female adolescent patient was complicated by a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Genomic DNA was isolated from bone marrow cells at AML diagnosis. Polymerase chain reactions were performed with primers covering all exons of the EZH2 gene. We found a novel heterozygous EZH2 mutation within exon 5 that caused an amino acid change from proline to leucine at position 132 (p.Pro132Leu) within the catalytic D1 domain. Analysis of a remission sample also showed this mutation, indicating a germline mutation. It remains to be elucidated whether EZH2 mutations contribute to disease severity in specific AML cases.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Usemann, Jakob', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Schafer, Vivien', 'Lehmberg, Kai', 'Seeger, Karl']","['Usemann J', 'Ernst T', 'Schafer V', 'Lehmberg K', 'Seeger K']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital (UKBB) Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med Genet A,American journal of medical genetics.

METHODS: We performed a specific and efficient knockdown of endogenous MLL-AF9 in the human monoblastic AML cell line THP1. RESULTS: The knockdown associated miRNA expression profile revealed 21 MLL-AF9 dependently expressed miRNAs. Gene ontology analyses of target genes suggested an impact of these miRNAs on downstream gene regulation via targeting of transcriptional modulators as well as involvement in many functions important for leukemia maintenance as e.g. myeloid differentiation, cell cycle and stem cell maintenance. Furthermore, we identified one of the most intensely repressed miRNAs, miR-511, to raise CCL2 expression (a chemokine ligand important for immunosurveillance), directly target cyclin D1, inhibit cell cycle progression, increase cellular migration and promote monoblastic differentiation. With these effects, miR-511 may have a therapeutic potential as a pro-differentiation agent as well as in leukemia vaccination approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new insights into the understanding of miRNAs as functional mediators of the leukemogenic fusion gene MLL-AF9 and opens new opportunities to further investigate specific therapeutic options for AML via the miRNA level.",,"['Fleischmann, Katrin K', 'Pagel, Philipp', 'von Frowein, Julia', 'Magg, Thomas', 'Roscher, Adelbert A', 'Schmid, Irene']","['Fleischmann KK', 'Pagel P', 'von Frowein J', 'Magg T', 'Roscher AA', 'Schmid I']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Research Center, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Lindwurmstrasse 2a, 80337, Munich, Germany. katrin.fleischmann@med.uni-muenchen.de."", 'Lehrstuhl fur Genomorientierte Bioinformatik, Technische Universitat Munchen, Maximus-von-Imhof-Forum 3, 85354, Freising, Germany. philipp.pagel@t-online.de.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Research Center, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Lindwurmstrasse 2a, 80337, Munich, Germany.

In recent decades, cancer treatments have been modified with the goal of reducing life-threatening late effects. METHODS: We evaluated late mortality among 34,033 patients in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort who survived at least 5 years after childhood cancer (i.e., cancer diagnosed before the age of 21 years) for which treatment was initiated during the period from 1970 through 1999. The median follow-up was 21 years (range, 5 to 38). We evaluated demographic and disease factors that were associated with death from health-related causes (i.e., conditions that exclude recurrence or progression of the original cancer and external causes but include the late effects of cancer therapy) using cumulative incidence and piecewise exponential models to estimate relative rates and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Of the 3958 deaths that occurred during the study period, 1618 (41%) were attributable to health-related causes, including 746 deaths from subsequent neoplasms, 241 from cardiac causes, 137 from pulmonary causes, and 494 from other causes. A reduction in 15-year mortality was observed for death from any cause (from 12.4% in the early 1970s to 6.0% in the 1990s, P<0.001 for trend) and from health-related causes (from 3.5% to 2.1%, P<0.001 for trend). These reductions were attributable to decreases in the rates of death from subsequent neoplasm (P<0.001), cardiac causes (P<0.001), and pulmonary causes (P=0.04). Changes in therapy according to decade included reduced rates of cranial radiotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (85% in the 1970s, 51% in the 1980s, and 19% in the 1990s), of abdominal radiotherapy for Wilms' tumor (78%, 53%, and 43%, respectively), of chest radiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma (87%, 79%, and 61%, respectively), and of anthracycline exposure. Reduction in treatment exposure was associated with reduced late mortality among survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms' tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy of lowering therapeutic exposure has contributed to an observed decline in late mortality among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer.

However, the precise mechanism of their inhibitory effect on tumors is unknown. To determine the mechanism of the inhibitory effects of DHPs, we examined the effects of DHPs on leukemia K562 cells. As a result, certain DHPs used in this study exhibited growth-inhibitory activity according to a clear structure-activity relationship. The most potent DHP, 12AC3O, induced apoptosis in K562 cells, but not in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) or fibroblast cells. 12AC3O induced apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and thereafter through the extrinsic pathway. The activity of the former pathway was partly attenuated by a JNK inhibitor. Interestingly, 12AC3O induced apoptosis by trapping a large amount of ROS, leading to an extremely lower intracellular ROS level compared with that in the cells in the steady-state condition.

METHODS: Data from 304 consecutive autologous peripheral blood stem cell donors mobilized with hematopoietic growth factor (usually G-CSF), associated or not with chemotherapy, at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein between February 1999 and June 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. The objective was to obtain at least 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg of body weight. Pre-mobilization factors analyzed included patient's age, gender and diagnosis. Post mobilization parameters evaluated were pre-apheresis peripheral white blood cell count, immature circulating cell count, mononuclear cell count, peripheral blood CD34+ cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin level. The effect of pre and post-mobilization factors on hematopoietic stem cell collection yield was investigated using logistic regression analysis (univariate and multivariate approaches). RESULTS: Pre-mobilization factors correlating to poor CD34 + cell yield in univariate analysis were acute myeloid leukemia (p = 0.017) and other hematological diseases (p = 0.023). Significant post-mobilization factors included peripheral blood immature circulating cells (p = 0.001), granulocytes (p = 0.002), hemoglobin level (p = 0.016), and CD34+ cell concentration (p < 0.001) in the first harvesting day. However, according to multivariate analysis, peripheral blood CD34+ cell content (p < 0.001) was the only independent factor that significantly correlated to poor hematopoietic stem cell yield.

METHODS: Between January 1997 and March 2004 a total of 15100 patients were referred to the Centro de Hematologia de Sao Paulo for hematological investigation of several diagnoses (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation abnormalities, adenomegaly, leukemia and others). Of those, 1057 were referred because of thrombocytopenia and were divided into two groups: Group Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, with no identifiable cause; and Group Other thrombocytopenia, which included low normal platelet counts cause to be established, hepatitis C and HIV infection, hypersplenism, EDTA-induced artifacts, laboratory error, and other causes. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping was done in 115 cases to identify platelet autoantibodies (direct method). RESULTS: Of the total number of patients, 1057 (7%) presented low platelet counts, 670 were females (63.4%) and age range of one to 75 years. Of the 115 cases (9.7%) submitted to immunophenotyping, the results were positive in 40% and the test was inconclusive in 5%. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was found in 52% of patients, more often in women. Hepatitis C virus infection was found in 7% and HIV infection in 1%. Low normal platelet counts were found in 17%, laboratory errors in 6%, and laboratory artifacts in 1% of cases. Platelet autoantibodies were found in 76.9% of all idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura cases. It was negative in 83.3% of the low normal counts.

In spite of substantial recent improvements in treatment regimens, hemorrhagic death remains the main cause of induction failure. In this review, we delineate recent understanding of the pathophysiology and management of the hemorrhagic diathesis of APL. RECENT FINDINGS: Laboratory and clinical data suggest that the malignant leukocytes mediate the hemorrhagic diathesis associated with APL through multiple mechanisms which lead to a combination of consumptive coagulopathy and primary hyperfibrinolysis. Exposure of tissue factor and Annexin II by the leukemic blasts is the main determinants of these processes. Promyelocyte-derived microparticles have recently been implicated in the coagulopathy as well. Total white cell count and platelet count have emerged as good general predictors of hemorrhagic death, along with the different routine hemostatic parameters. Prompt treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, with or without arsenic trioxide, is the most important step in preventing bleeding complications. Repletion of coagulation factors and platelets with blood products remains the mainstay of supportive treatment, whereas the role of recombinant soluble thrombomodulin is currently being investigated. SUMMARY: The coagulopathy of APL is multifactorial, with both disseminated intravascular coagulation and primary hyperfibrinolysis mediated largely by the malignant leukocytes.",,"['Mantha, Simon', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Soff, Gerald A']","['Mantha S', 'Tallman MS', 'Soff GA']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Thrombomodulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombomodulin/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,,2016/01/14 06:00,2016/11/05 06:00,['2016/01/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000221 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Mar;23(2):121-6. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000221.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined whether the added costs have been ""worth"" the benefits among older adults with CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed trends in health care costs and survival over time of 2164 CML patients over age 65 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare-linked database. We estimated life expectancy over a 15-year duration after diagnosis using a Weibull survival model and projected the corresponding costs using a 2-part model, adjusting for patient characteristics. We estimated population-level survival, total health care costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (expressed as cost per life year gained) over the period of 1995-2007. RESULTS: We found that therapeutic improvements in the treatment of CML have been associated with survival gains among older adults. Mean life expectancy was 2.2 years in 1995 and increased to 4.2 years in 2007. During the same timeframe, CML care costs have increased, from $127,000 in 1995 to $278,000 in 2007 (2010 dollars), mostly due to increasing tyrosine kinase inhibitor costs. The aggregated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $74,000/life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that, despite high costs, CML care may provide reasonable value for money among older patients between 1995-2007. Our study sheds light on the value of health care spending on CML by considering both the costs and the benefits. Future research should investigate strategies to improve treatment adherence to maximize the value of CML care.",,"['Lin, Pei-Jung', 'Winn, Aaron N', 'Parsons, Susan K', 'Neumann, Peter J', 'Weiss, Elisa S', 'Cohen, Joshua T']","['Lin PJ', 'Winn AN', 'Parsons SK', 'Neumann PJ', 'Weiss ES', 'Cohen JT']","['*Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health, Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA daggerDepartment of Health Policy and Management, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC double daggerCenter for Health Solutions, Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA section signPatient Access and Outcomes, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, White Plains, NY.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/economics/therapeutic use', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*economics/*mortality/*therapy', 'Life Expectancy/trends', 'Male', 'Medicare/statistics & numerical data', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'SEER Program/statistics & numerical data', 'United States']",,,2016/01/14 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2016/01/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MLR.0000000000000496 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Care. 2016 Apr;54(4):380-5. doi: 10.1097/MLR.0000000000000496.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To estimate both the clinical and the economic outcomes of rituximab for its approved hematological uses at the population level. RESEARCH DESIGN: Analyses using cancer registry incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, and outcomes data from SEER data linked with Medicare administrative claims (SEER-Medicare data). These results were incorporated into an epidemiological simulation model of the population over time. SUBJECTS: We modeled all United States patients from 1998 to 2013 diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. MEASURES: Using this model, we estimated the life-years saved, as well as their economic benefit, in the United States population. We also estimated the incremental cost of adding rituximab to chemotherapy. All economic inputs were based on Medicare reimbursed amounts inflated to 2013 dollars. RESULTS: There were 279,704 cumulative life-years saved which were valued at $25.44 billion. The incremental direct medical cost of rituximab was estimated to be $8.92 billion, resulting in an incremental economic gain of $16.52 billion.

However, safety concerns related to the inability to control CAR-T cells once infused into the patient remain a significant challenge. Here we report the engineering of recombinant antibody-based bifunctional switches that consist of a tumor antigen-specific Fab molecule engrafted with a peptide neo-epitope, which is bound exclusively by a peptide-specific switchable CAR-T cell (sCAR-T). The switch redirects the activity of the bio-orthogonal sCAR-T cells through the selective formation of immunological synapses, in which the sCAR-T cell, switch, and target cell interact in a structurally defined and temporally controlled manner. Optimized switches specific for CD19 controlled the activity, tissue-homing, cytokine release, and phenotype of sCAR-T cells in a dose-titratable manner in a Nalm-6 xenograft rodent model of B-cell leukemia. The sCAR-T-cell dosing regimen could be tuned to provide efficacy comparable to the corresponding conventional CART-19, but with lower cytokine levels, thereby offering a method of mitigating cytokine release syndrome in clinical translation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this methodology is readily adaptable to targeting CD20 on cancer cells using the same sCAR-T cell, suggesting that this approach may be broadly applicable to heterogeneous and resistant tumor populations, as well as other liquid and solid tumor antigens.",,"['Rodgers, David T', 'Mazagova, Magdalena', 'Hampton, Eric N', 'Cao, Yu', 'Ramadoss, Nitya S', 'Hardy, Ian R', 'Schulman, Andrew', 'Du, Juanjuan', 'Wang, Feng', 'Singer, Oded', 'Ma, Jennifer', 'Nunez, Vanessa', 'Shen, Jiayin', 'Woods, Ashley K', 'Wright, Timothy M', 'Schultz, Peter G', 'Kim, Chan Hyuk', 'Young, Travis S']","['Rodgers DT', 'Mazagova M', 'Hampton EN', 'Cao Y', 'Ramadoss NS', 'Hardy IR', 'Schulman A', 'Du J', 'Wang F', 'Singer O', 'Ma J', 'Nunez V', 'Shen J', 'Woods AK', 'Wright TM', 'Schultz PG', 'Kim CH', 'Young TS']","['Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Chemistry and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019;', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019; Department of Chemistry and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037 schultz@scripps.edu chkim@calibr.org tyoung@calibr.org.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019; schultz@scripps.edu chkim@calibr.org tyoung@calibr.org.', 'Department of Biology, California Institute for Biomedical Research, La Jolla, CA 92019; schultz@scripps.edu chkim@calibr.org tyoung@calibr.org.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM062159/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM062159-14/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (GCN4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', '33173-53-4 (4-azidophenylalanine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Azides', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/*methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphopenia/etiology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenylalanine/analogs & derivatives', 'Protein Engineering/methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*immunology', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/genetics/immunology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/transplantation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4743815,,2016/01/14 06:00,2016/06/14 06:00,['2016/01/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1524155113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1524155113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Jan 26;113(4):E459-68. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1524155113.

Despite impressive clinical efficacy, the general application of current CAR-T--cell therapy is limited by serious treatment-related toxicities. One approach to improve the safety of CAR-T cells involves making their activation and proliferation dependent upon adaptor molecules that mediate formation of the immunological synapse between the target cancer cell and T-cell. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of structurally defined semisynthetic adaptors we refer to as ""switch"" molecules, in which anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibody fragments are site-specifically modified with FITC using genetically encoded noncanonical amino acids. This approach allows the precise control over the geometry and stoichiometry of complex formation between CD19- or CD22-expressing cancer cells and a ""universal"" anti-FITC-directed CAR-T cell. Optimization of this CAR-switch combination results in potent, dose-dependent in vivo antitumor activity in xenograft models. The advantage of being able to titrate CAR-T-cell in vivo activity was further evidenced by reduced in vivo toxicity and the elimination of persistent B-cell aplasia in immune-competent mice.

These sequences are specific to the human normal bcr and the hybrid bcr-abl genes, protein products of which are responsible for some leukemia. SPR sensors based on resonance phenomena in nanoscale gold films are well suited for label-free, real-time investigations of the macromolecule interactions. Thermodynamic parameters obtained using the web server DINAMelt allowed supposing the possibility for realization (a) stringency control based on the ionic strength of the hybridization buffer and (b) stringency control based on the temperature elevation. The first one resulted in that the discrimination index of completely complementary and partially complementary oligonucleotides depending on the target concentration varied from 1.3 to 1.8 in 2 x SSC and from 2.0 to 2.9 in 0.5 x SSC. For implementation of the second stringency control strategy, SPR spectrometer measuring flow cell with built-in high-precision temperature control and regulation as well as corresponding software was created. It is shown that the duplexes formed by the immobilized probes mod-Ph and completely complementary oligonucleotides P1 remained without significant changes until ~50 degrees C, while the duplexes formed with partially complementary oligonucleotide Bcrex14 almost entirely disrupted at 40 degrees C. Thus, the absolutely effective thermodiscrimination of this pair of oligonucleotides was achieved in this temperature range (40-50 degrees C).",,"['Matsishin, M J', 'Ushenin, Iu V', 'Rachkov, A E', 'Solatkin, A P']","['Matsishin MJ', 'Ushenin IuV', 'Rachkov AE', 'Solatkin AP']","['Institute of High Technologies, Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University, 64 Volodymyrska Str., 01003, Kyiv, Ukraine. matsishinnicolas@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Biomolecular Electronics, Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, 150 Zabolotnogo Str., 03680, Kyiv, Ukraine. matsishinnicolas@gmail.com.', 'V.

However, whether the association is the same for measures of abdominal or whole body adiposity is unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to compare cancer risk, associated with body mass index (BMI), an indicator of whole body adiposity, with indicators of abdominal adiposity in studies in which these indicators have been directly measured. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search from 1974 (EMBASE) and 1988 (PubMed) to September 2015 with keywords related to adiposity and cancer. Included studies were limited to cohort studies reporting directly measured anthropometry and performing mutually adjusted analyses. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were identified, with two reporting on breast cancer, three on colorectal cancer, three on endometrial cancer, two on gastro-oesophageal cancer, two on renal cancer, one on ovarian cancer, one on bladder cancer, one on liver and biliary tract cancer and one on leukaemia. Evidence suggests that abdominal adiposity is a stronger predictor than whole body adiposity for gastro-oesophageal, leukaemia and liver and biliary tract cancer in men and women and for renal cancer in women. Abdominal adiposity was a stronger predictor for bladder and colorectal cancer in women, while only BMI was a predictor in men. In contrast, BMI appears to be a stronger predictor for ovarian cancer. For breast and endometrial cancer, both measures were predictors for cancer risk in postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Only few studies used mutually adjusted and measured anthropometric indicators when studying adiposity-cancer associations. Further research investigating cancer risk and adiposity should include more accurate non-invasive indicators of body fat deposition and focus on the understudied cancer types, namely leukaemia, ovarian, bladder and liver and biliary tract cancer.",,"['De Ridder, Josefine', 'Julian-Almarcegui, Cristina', 'Mullee, Amy', 'Rinaldi, Sabina', 'Van Herck, Koen', 'Vicente-Rodriguez, German', 'Huybrechts, Inge']","['De Ridder J', 'Julian-Almarcegui C', 'Mullee A', 'Rinaldi S', 'Van Herck K', 'Vicente-Rodriguez G', 'Huybrechts I']","['Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'GENUD ""Growth, Exercise, Nutrition and Development"" Research Group, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Dietary Exposure Assessment Group (DEX), International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, 69372, Lyon Cedex 08, France.', 'Dietary Exposure Assessment Group (DEX), International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, 69372, Lyon Cedex 08, France.', 'Biomarkers Group, International Agency for Research on Cancer, 150 Cours Albert Thomas, 69372, Lyon Cedex 08, France.', 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'GENUD ""Growth, Exercise, Nutrition and Development"" Research Group, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Department of Physiatrist and Nursing, Faculty of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Zaragoza, Huesca, Spain.', 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium. huybrechtsi@iarc.fr.', 'Dietary Exposure Assessment Group (DEX), International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, 69372, Lyon Cedex 08, France. huybrechtsi@iarc.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['*Adiposity', 'Anthropometry', 'Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Obesity/epidemiology', 'Obesity, Abdominal/*epidemiology', 'Risk']",,,2016/01/14 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2016/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10552-015-0709-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-015-0709-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2016 Mar;27(3):291-300. doi: 10.1007/s10552-015-0709-y.

This study was aimed at evaluating the association between lifestyle factors and the risk of hematological malignancies in an adult population. METHODS: Data were drawn from a population-based case-control study carried out in Italy and included 294 cases (199 lymphoid and 95 myeloid) and 279 controls. Analyses were performed using standard multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Hair dye use for at least 15 years was associated with a higher risk of lymphoid malignancies among females (OR 2.3, 95 % CI 1.0-4.9, p = 0.036, test for trend). Furthermore, a protective effect of a moderate to heavy tea consumption on the risk of myeloid malignancies was observed (OR 0.4, 95 % CI 0.2-0.9, p = 0.017). No association was found for the use of alcoholic beverages and tobacco smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the potential carcinogenic effect of prolonged hair dye use observed in previous investigations. The excess risk could be explained by exposure to a higher concentration of toxic compounds in hair products used in the past.

However, diagnostic interpretation of MFC readouts for APL depends on individual experience and knowledge, which inevitably increases the risk of arbitrariness. We appraised the feasibility of using stepwise discriminant function analysis (SDFA) based on MFC to optimize the minimal variables needed to distinguish APL from other acute myeloid leukemia (AML) without complicated data interpretation. Samples from 327 patients with APL (n = 51) and non-APL AML (n = 276) were randomly allocated into training (243 AML) and test sets (84 AML) for SDFA. The discriminant functions from SDFA were examined by correct classification, and the final variables were validated by differential expression. Finally, additional 20 samples from patients with atypical APL and AML confusable with APL were also identified by SDFA method and morphological analysis. The weighed discriminant function reveals seven differentially expressed variables (CD2/CD9/CD11b/CD13/CD34/HLA-DR/CD117), which predict a molecular result for APL characterization with an accuracy that approaches 99% (99.6 and 98.8% for AML samples in training and test sets, respectively). Furthermore, the SDFA outperformed either single variable analysis or the more limited 3-component analysis (CD34/CD117/HLA-DR) via separate SDFA, and was also superior to morphological analysis in terms of diagnostic efficacy. The established SDFA based on MFC with seven variables can precisely and rapidly differentiate APL and non-APL AML, which may contribute to the urgent initiation of all-trans-retinoic acid-based APL therapy.",,"['Chen, Zhanguo', 'Li, Yan', 'Tong, Yongqing', 'Gao, Qingping', 'Mao, Xiaolu', 'Zhang, Wenjing', 'Xia, Zunen', 'Fu, Chaohong']","['Chen Z', 'Li Y', 'Tong Y', 'Gao Q', 'Mao X', 'Zhang W', 'Xia Z', 'Fu C']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 99 Zhangzhidong Road, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 99 Zhangzhidong Road, Wuhan, Hubei, China. yanlitf1120@163.com.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 99 Zhangzhidong Road, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory, Central Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Central Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 99 Zhangzhidong Road, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 99 Zhangzhidong Road, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,,2016/01/14 06:00,2017/01/17 06:00,['2016/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-015-1923-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-015-1923-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2016 Mar;103(3):306-15. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1923-9.

This challenge is partly attributed to the heterogeneous responses elicited by BET inhibition (BETi), including cellular differentiation, senescence, and death. In this study, we performed phenotypic and gene-expression analyses of treatment-naive and engineered tolerant cell lines representing human melanoma and leukemia to elucidate the dominant features defining response to BETi. We found that de novo and acquired tolerance to BETi is driven by the robustness of the apoptotic response, and that genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of the apoptotic signaling network can modify the phenotypic response to BETi. We further reveal that the expression signatures of the apoptotic genes BCL2, BCL2L1, and BAD significantly predict response to BETi. Taken together, our findings highlight the apoptotic program as a determinant of response to BETi, and provide a molecular basis for patient stratification and combination therapy development.",['(c)2016 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Conery, Andrew R', 'Centore, Richard C', 'Spillane, Kerry L', 'Follmer, Nicole E', 'Bommi-Reddy, Archana', 'Hatton, Charlie', 'Bryant, Barbara M', 'Greninger, Patricia', 'Amzallag, Arnaud', 'Benes, Cyril H', 'Mertz, Jennifer A', 'Sims, Robert J 3rd']","['Conery AR', 'Centore RC', 'Spillane KL', 'Follmer NE', 'Bommi-Reddy A', 'Hatton C', 'Bryant BM', 'Greninger P', 'Amzallag A', 'Benes CH', 'Mertz JA', 'Sims RJ 3rd']","['Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts. robert.Sims@constellationpharma.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology']",,,2016/01/14 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2016/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-15-1458 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1458 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2016 Mar 15;76(6):1313-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1458.

METHODS: In this study we retrospectively analyzed 53 refractory or relapsed CN- AML patients receiving the therapy including decitabine combined with CAG and CAG- like regimen in our center from April 2011 to October 2014. The clinical characteristics and ORR were further analyzed. Based on gene mutations, these patients could be divided into 2 groups: DNMT3A(+) AML patientsn=24and DNMT3A- AML patientsn=29. RESULTS: The median age of DNMT3A(+)AML patients was 46 years old, higher white blood cells and bone marrow blasts were observed in DNMT3A+ AML group. The ORR and complete responseCRrate of DNMT3A+ group were 62.50% and 54.17%, respectively. No differences were observed in ORR and CR ratesP>0.05between these two groups.

MVA is further metabolized to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a precursor of cholesterol and sterols. FPP is also converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and these lipids are used for post-translational modification of proteins that are involved in various aspects of tumor development and progression. Many studies showed that the MVA pathway is up-regulated in several cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma; as well as breast, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal and prostate cancers. Several mechanisms may be involved in dysregulation of this pathway. They include p53 mutation, a mutation in HMG-CoAR and sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein SCAP as its regulator, PKB/Akt activation, decreased AMPK activation, and activation of transcription factors such as: SREBP and HIF-1. Statins as inhibitors of MVA pathway might be useful for cancer prevention and/or treatment through their interactions with essential cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. Other inhibitors are also designed for inhibition of this key pathway and their mechanism of action was investigated.

However, their propensity to cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has not been systematically examined. A literature search identified published Phase I-III clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies (otlertuzumab, brentuximab, obinutuzumab, ibritumomab, ofatumumab); tyrosine kinase inhibitors (alvocidib [flavopiridol], dinaciclib, ibrutinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, idelalisib, venetoclax [ABT-199]); proteasome inhibitors (oprozomib, carfilzomib); chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells; and the proapoptotic agent lenalidomide. Abstracts from major congresses were also reviewed. Idelalisib and ofatumumab had no reported TLS. TLS incidence was </=5 % with brentuximab vedotin (for anaplastic large-cell lymphoma), carfilzomib and lenalidomide (for multiple myeloma), dasatinib (for acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and oprozomib (for various hematologic malignancies). TLS incidences were 8.3 and 8.9 % in two trials of venetoclax (for chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]) and 10 % in trials of CAR T cells (for B-cell malignancies) and obinutuzumab (for non-Hodgkin lymphoma). TLS rates of 15 % with dinaciclib and 42 and 53 % with alvocidib (with sequential cytarabine and mitoxantrone) were seen in trials of acute leukemias. TLS mitigation was employed routinely in clinical trials of alvocidib and lenalidomide. However, TLS mitigation strategies were not mentioned or stated only in general terms for many studies of other agents. The risk of TLS persists in the current era of novel and targeted therapy for hematologic malignancies and was seen to some extent with most agents. Our findings underscore the importance of continued awareness, risk assessment, and prevention to reduce this serious potential complication of effective anticancer therapy.",,"['Howard, Scott C', 'Trifilio, Steven', 'Gregory, Tara K', 'Baxter, Nadine', 'McBride, Ali']","['Howard SC', 'Trifilio S', 'Gregory TK', 'Baxter N', 'McBride A']","['University of Memphis, School of Health Studies, Memphis, TN, 38002, USA.

Recently, RIT1 (Ras-like without CAAX 1) has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of some patients. We report a series of 44 patients from 30 pedigrees (including nine multiplex families) with mutations in RIT1. These patients display a typical Noonan gestalt and facial phenotype. Among the probands, 8.7% showed postnatal growth retardation, 90% had congenital heart defects, 36% had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a lower incidence compared with previous report), 50% displayed speech delay and 52% had learning difficulties, but only 22% required special education. None had major skin anomalies. One child died perinatally of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Compared with the canonical Noonan phenotype linked to PTPN11 mutations, patients with RIT1 mutations appear to be less severely growth retarded and more frequently affected by cardiomyopathy. Based on our experience, we estimate that RIT1 could be the cause of 5% of Noonan syndrome patients. Because mutations found constitutionally in Noonan syndrome are also found in several tumors in adulthood, we evaluated the potential contribution of RIT1 to leukemogenesis in Noonan syndrome. We screened 192 pediatric cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (96 B-ALL and 96 T-ALL) and 110 cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemias (JMML), but detected no variation in these tumoral samples, suggesting that Noonan patients with germline RIT1 mutations are not at high risk to developing JMML or ALL, and that RIT1 has at most a marginal role in these sporadic malignancies.",,"['Cave, Helene', 'Caye, Aurelie', 'Ghedira, Nehla', 'Capri, Yline', 'Pouvreau, Nathalie', 'Fillot, Natacha', 'Trimouille, Aurelien', 'Vignal, Cedric', 'Fenneteau, Odile', 'Alembik, Yves', 'Alessandri, Jean-Luc', 'Blanchet, Patricia', 'Boute, Odile', 'Bouvagnet, Patrice', 'David, Albert', 'Dieux Coeslier, Anne', 'Doray, Berenice', 'Dulac, Olivier', 'Drouin-Garraud, Valerie', 'Gerard, Marion', 'Heron, Delphine', 'Isidor, Bertrand', 'Lacombe, Didier', 'Lyonnet, Stanislas', 'Perrin, Laurence', 'Rio, Marlene', 'Roume, Joelle', 'Sauvion, Sylvie', 'Toutain, Annick', 'Vincent-Delorme, Catherine', 'Willems, Marjorie', 'Baumann, Clarisse', 'Verloes, Alain']","['Cave H', 'Caye A', 'Ghedira N', 'Capri Y', 'Pouvreau N', 'Fillot N', 'Trimouille A', 'Vignal C', 'Fenneteau O', 'Alembik Y', 'Alessandri JL', 'Blanchet P', 'Boute O', 'Bouvagnet P', 'David A', 'Dieux Coeslier A', 'Doray B', 'Dulac O', 'Drouin-Garraud V', 'Gerard M', 'Heron D', 'Isidor B', 'Lacombe D', 'Lyonnet S', 'Perrin L', 'Rio M', 'Roume J', 'Sauvion S', 'Toutain A', 'Vincent-Delorme C', 'Willems M', 'Baumann C', 'Verloes A']","['Department of Genetics, Assistance Publique -

Evodiamine is a chemical extracted from the Evodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth, we showed that evodiamine could induce anti-proliferation and apoptosis in four wild-type EGFR NSCLC cell lines, and combining evodiamine with erlotinib might successfully inhibit cell proliferation and survival in wild-type EGFR NSCLC cells, characterized as erlotinib-resistant. In addition, evodiamine plus erlotinib significantly increased the apoptotic rate of NSCLC cells, as compared to single agent treatment alone. Further investigation of the mechanism underlying these effects revealed that evodiamine plus erlotinib might downregulate Mcl-1 expression through the mTOR/S6K1 control of its translation. Thus, our study has revealed evodiamine as a pertinent sensitizer to erlotinib and the strategy of combining erlotinib with evodiamine appears to be an attractive option for reversing resistance to erlotinib.",,"['Li, Yang-Ling', 'Pan, Yi-Ni', 'Wu, Wen-Jue', 'Mao, Shi-Ying', 'Sun, Jiao', 'Zhao, Yi-Ming', 'Dong, Jing-Yin', 'Zhang, Da-Yong', 'Pan, Jian-Ping', 'Zhang, Chong', 'Lin, Neng-Ming']","['Li YL', 'Pan YN', 'Wu WJ', 'Mao SY', 'Sun J', 'Zhao YM', 'Dong JY', 'Zhang DY', 'Pan JP', 'Zhang C', 'Lin NM']","[""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Affiliated Hangzhou Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, No. 261 Huansha Road, Hangzhou, 310006, Zhejiang, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, No. 51 Huzhou Street, Hangzhou, 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, No. 51 Huzhou Street, Hangzhou, 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, No. 51 Huzhou Street, Hangzhou, 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Emergency Room, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Medical College of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, No. 51 Huzhou Street, Hangzhou, 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, No. 51 Huzhou Street, Hangzhou, 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, No. 51 Huzhou Street, Hangzhou, 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, No. 51 Huzhou Street, Hangzhou, 310015, Zhejiang, China. zhangchong@zucc.edu.cn.', ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. lnm1013@163.com."", 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Affiliated Hangzhou Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, No. 261 Huansha Road, Hangzhou, 310006, Zhejiang, China. lnm1013@163.com.', ""Hangzhou Translational Medicine Research Center, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. lnm1013@163.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'C01825BVNL (evodiamine)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kD, polypeptide 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",,,2016/01/14 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2016/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-015-0726-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-015-0726-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2016 Feb;33(2):16. doi: 10.1007/s12032-015-0726-4.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for community diabetes screening recommend using fasting glucose >/= 7 mmol/l and/or HbA1c >/= 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) for diagnosis and, fasting glucose 5.5-6.9 mmol/l or HbA1c 42-47 mmol/mol (6-6.5%) to indicate high risk. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivities of fasting glucose and HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in childhood HSCT survivors. METHOD: The patients were 35 (male = 19) HSCT survivors from a single UK centre under follow-up from 2006 to 2013. Patients had a median age (range) of 19.2 (13.1-26.2) years and had been treated for acute lymphoblastic (n = 31) or myeloid (n = 4) leukaemia when aged 7.8 (2.4-16.7) years. The outcome measures were oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting glucose and HbA1c . RESULTS: OGTT identified 6 patients with diabetes (120-min glucose >/= 11.1 mmol/l), 12 with impaired glucose tolerance (120-min glucose 7.8-11.0 mmol/l) and 2 with impaired fasting glucose (>/= 7 mmol/l).

In this study, the ultrastructures of mouse primed ESCs grown on hAECs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Consistent with mouse naive ESCs, the undifferentiated mouse primed ESC line ESD-EpiSC [ESC-derived epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs)] revealed typical characteristics, including large nuclei, reticulated nucleoli, scanty cytoplasm, and low cytoplasm-to-nuclear ratios. Cells had prominent Golgi apparatus and well-developed endoplasmic reticulum. Adjacent cells were tightly in contact with dense junction desmosomes. However, in EpiSC colonies, cell contact was no longer close like naive ESCs, and differentiated cells existed. The differentiated cells had small nucleoli with large cytoplasm, which represented primitive mesenchyme. Phagosomes or apoptotic cells were also common in the cytoplasm of differentiated cells, which suggests a differentiation potential. When exposed to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ESD-EpiSCs could convert to naive-like cells. We further analyzed the ultrastructure of converted EpiSCs (cESCs). As compared to ESD-EpiSCs, cESCs showed similar ultrastructural characteristics as naive ESCs.

Patients undergoing long-term thiopurine treatment are at a higher risk of developing sunlight-induced skin cancers than the general population. This side effect originates from the cellular metabolization of thiopurine prodrugs to form 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine, which can absorb UVA radiation, populating its reactive triplet state and leading to oxidatively generated damage. However, the photo-oxidation mechanism is not fully understood. In this contribution, the oxidation potential and the adiabatic triplet energy of 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine are estimated computationally, whereas the intrinsic rate of triple-state decay and the rate constant for triplet quenching by molecular oxygen are determined using time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. A singlet oxygen quantum yield of 0.24 +/- 0.02 is measured in aqueous solution (0.29 +/- 0.02 in acetonitrile). Its magnitude correlates with the relatively low percentage of triplet-O2 collision events that generate singlet oxygen (SDelta = 37%). This behavior is rationalized as being due to the exergonic driving force for electron transfer between the triplet state of 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine and molecular oxygen (DeltaGET = -69.7 kJ mol(-1) ), resulting in the formation of a charge-transfer complex that favors nonradiative decay to the ground state over triplet energy transfer.",['(c) 2016 The American Society of Photobiology.'],"['Pollum, Marvin', 'Ortiz-Rodriguez, Luis A', 'Jockusch, Steffen', 'Crespo-Hernandez, Carlos E']","['Pollum M', 'Ortiz-Rodriguez LA', 'Jockusch S', 'Crespo-Hernandez CE']","['Department of Chemistry and Center for Chemical Dynamics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Chemistry and Center for Chemical Dynamics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY.', 'Department of Chemistry and Center for Chemical Dynamics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""2133-81-5 (alpha-2'-deoxythioguanosine)"", 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxygen/*chemistry', 'Prodrugs', 'Thionucleosides/chemistry']",,,2016/01/13 06:00,2018/03/29 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/php.12563 [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2016 Mar;92(2):286-292. doi: 10.1111/php.12563.

Imatinib can hinder the inhibitory effects of BCR-ABL1 on mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, so mitochondrial mutagenesis can be important for its action. To explore the mechanisms of imatinib resistance we created a mouse-derived CML model cells consisting of parental 32D cells (P) and cells transfected with the BCR-ABL1 gene (S cells) or its variants with the Y253H or T315I mutations (253 and 315 cells, respectively), conferring resistance to imatinib. A fraction of the S cells was cultured in increasing concentrations of imatinib, acquiring resistance to this drug (AR cells). The 253, 315 and AR cells, in contrast to S cells, displayed resistance to imatinib. We observed that the T315I cells displayed greater extent of H2O2-induced mtDNA damage than their imatinib-sensitive counterparts. No difference in the sensitivity to UV radiation was observed among all the cell lines. A decrease in the extent of H2O2-induced mtDNA damage was observed during a 120-min repair incubation in all cell lines, but it was significant only in imatinib-sensitive and T315I cells. No difference in the copy number of mtDNA and frequency of the 3,867-bp deletion was observed and genotoxic stress induced by H2O2 or UV did not change this relationship. In conclusion, some aspects of mtDNA mutagenesis, including sensitivity to oxidative stress and DNA repair can contribute to imatinib resistance in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells.",,"['Blasiak, Janusz', 'Hoser, Grazyna', 'Bialkowska-Warzecha, Jolanta', 'Pawlowska, Elzbieta', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Blasiak J', 'Hoser G', 'Bialkowska-Warzecha J', 'Pawlowska E', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Flow Cytometry, Medical Center for Postgraduate Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Infectious and Liver Diseases, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Orthodontics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis']",,,2016/01/13 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1668 [pii]', '10.18388/abp.2015_1189 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2016;63(2):365-70. doi: 10.18388/abp.2015_1189.

Nanocarriers are one of the promising approaches to selectively target tumor cells, frequently leading to improve drug therapeutic index. Ellipticine is an anticancer agent that functions through multiple mechanisms. Here, the toxic effects of an anticancer drug ellipticine encapsulated in a micellar nanotransporter and free ellipticine on human HL-60 leukemia cells and formation of ellipticine-derived DNA adducts by both forms of the drug in these cells were investigated. METHODS: The toxicity of modified ellipticine on cells was compared to that of free ellipticine using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide cytotoxicity assay. 32P-postlabeling was utilized to determine ellipticine-DNA adducts in treated cells. RESULTS: The comparison of efficiencies of free ellipticine and ellipticine-micelles [the poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(allyl glycidyl ether) block copolymer] to form ellipticine-derived DNA adducts in leukemia HL-60 cells and to act as cytotoxic agent on these cells was performed. Exposure of HL-60 cells to ellipticine in micelles resulted in formation of ellipticine-DNA adducts and caused the cytotoxic effect on these cells. The influence of ellipticine in micelles on HL-60 cells was very similar to that of free ellipticine. The ellipticine half maximal inhibition concentration was determined as 1.3+/-0.3 micromol.L(-1) and 1.4+/-0.3 micromol.L(-1) for ellipticine and ellipticine in micelles, respectively. Likewise, the levels of ellipticine-DNA adducts generated in HL-60 cells by both forms of ellipticine were analogous. CONCLUSION: The results found in this work demonstrate similar cytotoxicity and DNA-damaging effects of ellipticine and its micellar form on leukemia HL-60 cells in vitro.",,"['Stiborova, Marie', 'Manhartova, Zuzana', 'Hodek, Petr', 'Adam, Vojtech', 'Kizek, Rene', 'Eckschlager, Tomas', 'Frei, Eva']","['Stiborova M', 'Manhartova Z', 'Hodek P', 'Adam V', 'Kizek R', 'Eckschlager T', 'Frei E']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Metallomics and Nanotechnology, Mendel University in Brno and Central European Institute of Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Metallomics and Nanotechnology, Mendel University in Brno and Central European Institute of Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Medical Faculty, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Division of Preventive Oncology, National Center for Tumour Diseases, German Cancer Research Center, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Neuro Endocrinol Lett,Neuro endocrinology letters,8008373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Micelles)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Adducts/*drug effects', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Liver/*drug effects', '*Micelles', 'Rats']",,,2016/01/13 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['NEL360915A20 [pii]'],ppublish,Neuro Endocrinol Lett. 2015;36 Suppl 1:22-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The FitBit is a fitness tracker that downloads activity measurements to the Internet in real time. In this feasibility study, we explored if children who received daily FitBit coaching for 2 weeks before a maintenance steroid pulse had an increase in steps per day and determined the relationship between steps per day prepulse and fatigue postpulse. PROCEDURE: Seventeen children in ALL maintenance, aged 6-15, wore the FitBit for 3 days to establish a baseline. A tailored weekly step goal was then set with the child and parent. Daily emails with feedback and FitBit screenshots were sent over the 2-week intervention. Self-report of fatigue was measured at baseline, after 2 weeks (i.e. before the steroid pulse), and after 5 days of steroids. RESULTS: There was a trend toward increased steps per day from weeks 1-2 (P = 0.079); fatigue was low and did not increase during the corticosteroid pulse. A significant correlation (r = -0.66, P = 0.005) was found between the steps per day during week 2 and fatigue after the steroid pulse with higher steps associated with lower fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was feasible in this small sample. The average steps each time period (week 1, week 2, and during steroids) was over 10,000, demonstrating that children with ALL can be active during treatment. Physical activity may be protective of fatigue during a corticosteroid pulse.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hooke, Mary C', 'Gilchrist, Laura', 'Tanner, Lynn', 'Hart, Nicole', 'Withycombe, Janice S']","['Hooke MC', 'Gilchrist L', 'Tanner L', 'Hart N', 'Withycombe JS']","['School of Nursing, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', ""Children's Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."", ""Children's Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."", ""Children's Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."", ""Children's Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."", 'Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Accelerometry/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Fatigue/etiology/prevention & control', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Male', 'Motor Activity/*physiology', 'Pilot Projects', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications']",,,2016/01/13 06:00,2016/07/19 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25860 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Apr;63(4):684-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25860.

The combination of these two core pharmacophores with modification in the C-8 position of the PBD ring with alkyl spacers afforded oxygen-tethered compounds 5a-5d and amide-tethered analogues 11a-11d with improved anticancer activity for two melanoma cell lines, A375 and RPMI7951, differing in their p53 status. The agents 5a-5d were cytotoxic in melanoma compared to agents 11a-11d. In particular, compounds 5b and 5c were found to possess the most potent activity compared with other hybrid agents and were proved with the help of quantitative structure activity relationship studies (QSAR). These PBD conjugates caused S phase arrest for the A375 cell line via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM-Rad3-related (ATR) and checkpoint kinases 1 (Chk1) activation. Moreover, the PBD-GA induced A375 apoptotic cell death followed through p53 (ATM downstream target) increase, B-cell leukemia-xL (Bcl-xL) and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsimt) decrease, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3/Poly Adp Ribose Polymerase (PARP) cleavage. On the other hand, mutant p53 RPMI7951 cell death occurred by PBD-GA-mediated mitochondria- and caspase-dependent pathways via lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), but not through p53 signaling. Finally, compound 5b was shown to reduce murine melanoma size in a mouse model.

In the relapse setting, very limited therapeutic options are available and in most cases only palliative care can be offered to patients. The effect of a composite formulation that contains several antioxidants, Ocoxin Oral solution (OOS), was tested in this condition. When analyzed in vitro, OOS exhibited anti-AML action that was both time and dose dependent. In vivo OOS induced a ralentization of tumor growth that was due to a decrease in cell proliferation. Such effect could, at least partially, be due to an increase in the cell cycle inhibitor p27, although other cell cycle proteins seemed to be altered. Besides, OOS induced an immunomodulatory effect through the induction of IL6. When tested in combination with other therapeutic agents normally used in the treatment of AML patients, OOS demonstrated a higher antiproliferative action, suggesting that it may be used in combination with those standard of care treatments to potentiate their antiproliferative action in the AML clinic.",,"['Diaz-Rodriguez, Elena', 'Hernandez-Garcia, Susana', 'Sanz, Eduardo', 'Pandiella, Atanasio']","['Diaz-Rodriguez E', 'Hernandez-Garcia S', 'Sanz E', 'Pandiella A']","['Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Catalysis, S.L., Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Ocoxin)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '19F5HK2737 (Pantothenic Acid)', '7733-02-0 (Zinc Sulfate)', '8059-24-3 (Vitamin B 6)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Folic Acid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Pantothenic Acid', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Random Allocation', 'Vitamin B 12/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin B 6/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Zinc Sulfate']",PMC4868752,,2016/01/13 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['6862 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.6862 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Feb 2;7(5):6231-42. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.6862.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'antioxidants', 'cell cycle', 'p27']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the anticancer activities of norcantharidin with respect to neuroblastoma, and its underlying mechanisms, have not been investigated. Therefore, our study was designed to determine the efficacy of norcantharidin on SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell death and to elucidate detailed mechanisms of activity. In the present study, norcantharidin suppressed the proliferation and cloning ability of SK-N-SH cells in a dose-dependent manner, apparently by reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential and arresting SK-N-SH cells at the G2/M stage, accompanied by elevated expressions of p21 and decreased expressions of cyclin B1 and cell division control 2. Treatment by norcantharidin induced significant mitophagy and autophagy, as demonstrated by a decrease in Translocase Of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 20 (TOM20), increased beclin1 and LC3-II protein expression, reduced protein SQSTM1/p62 expression, and accumulation of punctate LC3 in the cytoplasm of SK-N-SH cells. In addition, norcantharidin induced apoptosis through regulating the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein/B-cell lymphoma 2 and B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein/myeloid cell leukemia 1 and activating caspase-3 and caspase-9-dependent endogenous mitochondrial pathways. We also observed an increase in phosphor-AMP-activated protein kinase accompanied with a decrease in phosphor-protein kinase B and mammalian target of rapamycin expression after treatment with norcantharidin. Subsequent studies indicated that norcantharidin participates in cellular autophagy and apoptosis via activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases/c-Jun pathway. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that norcantharidin can reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential, induce mitophagy, and subsequently arouse cellular autophagy and apoptosis; the AMP-activated protein kinase, protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases/c-Jun signaling pathways are widely involved in these processes. Thus, the traditional Chinese medicine norcantharidin could be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating neuroblastoma.",,"['Han, Zeping', 'Li, Baoxia', 'Wang, Juanjuan', 'Zhang, Xiangqiang', 'Li, Zhenhua', 'Dai, Liting', 'Cao, Mingrong', 'Jiang, Jianwei']","['Han Z', 'Li B', 'Wang J', 'Zhang X', 'Li Z', 'Dai L', 'Cao M', 'Jiang J']","['1 Department of Laboratory, Central Hospital of Panyu, Guangzhou, China.', '2 State Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '4 Department of General Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '8452E71EO7 (norcantharidin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC5616112,,2016/01/13 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['1533034615624583 [pii]', '10.1177/1533034615624583 [doi]']",ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2017 Feb;16(1):33-44. doi: 10.1177/1533034615624583.

DF has a recognized role as an endothelial protective agent, although its precise mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction of DF with endothelial cells (ECs). A human hepatic EC line was exposed to different DF concentrations, previously labeled. Using inhibitory assays and flow cytometry techniques along with confocal microscopy, we explored: DF-EC interaction, endocytic pathways, and internalization kinetics. Moreover, we evaluated the potential role of adenosine receptors in DF-EC interaction and if DF effects on endothelium were dependent of its internalization. Confocal microscopy showed interaction of DF with EC membranes followed by internalization, though DF did not reach the cell nucleus even after 24 hours. Flow cytometry revealed concentration, temperature, and time dependent uptake of DF in 2 EC models but not in other cell types. Moreover, inhibitory assays indicated that entrance of DF into ECs occurs primarily through macropinocytosis. Our experimental approach did not show any evidence of the involvement of adenosine receptors in DF-EC interaction. The antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties of DF seem to be caused by the interaction of the drug with the cell membrane. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the precise mechanisms of action of DF as a therapeutic and potential preventive agent on the endothelial damage underlying different pathologic situations.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Palomo, Marta', 'Mir, Enrique', 'Rovira, Montse', 'Escolar, Gines', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Diaz-Ricart, Maribel']","['Palomo M', 'Mir E', 'Rovira M', 'Escolar G', 'Carreras E', 'Diaz-Ricart M']","['Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain; and Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hospital Clinic, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic, and.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain; and Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hospital Clinic, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic, and.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hospital Clinic, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic, and.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain; and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Hospital Clinic, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic, and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', '438HCF2X0M (defibrotide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Antioxidants/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/pathology/prevention & control', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/metabolism', 'Pinocytosis/drug effects', 'Polydeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacokinetics', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",PMC4817313,,2016/01/13 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30304-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-10-676114 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Mar 31;127(13):1719-27. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-10-676114.

Consistent with these findings, loss-of-function human TRAF3 mutations are common in B-cell cancers, particularly multiple myeloma and B-cell lymphoma. B cells of B-cell-specific TRAF3(-/-) mice (B-Traf3(-/-)) display remarkably enhanced survival compared with littermate control (WT) B cells. The mechanism for this abnormal homeostatic survival is poorly understood, a key knowledge gap in selecting optimal treatments for human B-cell cancers with TRAF3 deficiency. We show here for the first time to our knowledge that TRAF3 is a resident nuclear protein that associates with the transcriptional regulator cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in both mouse and human B cells. The TRAF-C domain of TRAF3 was necessary and sufficient to localize TRAF3 to the nucleus via a functional nuclear localization signal. CREB protein was elevated in TRAF3(-/-) B cells, without change in mRNA, but with a decrease in CREB ubiquitination. CREB-mediated transcriptional activity was increased in TRAF3-deficient B cells. Consistent with these findings, Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic target of CREB-mediated transcription, was increased in the absence of TRAF3 and enhanced Mcl-1 was suppressed with CREB inhibition. TRAF3-deficient B cells were also preferentially sensitive to survival inhibition with pharmacologic CREB inhibitor. Our results identify a new mechanism by which nuclear TRAF3 regulates B-cell survival via inhibition of CREB stability, information highly relevant to the role of TRAF3 in B-cell malignancies.",,"['Mambetsariev, Nurbek', 'Lin, Wai W', 'Stunz, Laura L', 'Hanson, Brett M', 'Hildebrand, Joanne M', 'Bishop, Gail A']","['Mambetsariev N', 'Lin WW', 'Stunz LL', 'Hanson BM', 'Hildebrand JM', 'Bishop GA']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242; Immunology Graduate Program, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242; Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242;', 'Immunology Graduate Program, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242;', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242; Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242;', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242;', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242;', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242; Immunology Graduate Program, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242; Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242; Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242; Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Research (151), Iowa City, IA 52246 gail-bishop@uiowa.edu.']",['eng'],"['CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI028847/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI028847/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007485/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32AI007485/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX001702/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 AI028847/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM007337/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007337/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3)', '0 (TRAF3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3/*physiology']",PMC4743771,,2016/01/13 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1514586113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1514586113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Jan 26;113(4):1032-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1514586113.

This fact represents a fundamental conundrum, because hematopoietic cells in young children should have fewer mutations (including oncogenic ones) than such cells in adults. Here, we present the results of stochastic modeling of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clonal dynamics, which demonstrated that early HSC pools were permissive to clonal evolution driven by drift. We show that drift-driven clonal expansions cooperate with faster HSC cycling in young children to produce conditions that are permissive for accumulation of multiple driver mutations in a single cell. Later in life, clonal evolution was suppressed by stabilizing selection in the larger young adult pools, and it was driven by positive selection at advanced ages in the presence of microenvironmental decline. Overall, our results indicate that leukemogenesis is driven by distinct evolutionary forces in children and adults.",,"['Rozhok, Andrii I', 'Salstrom, Jennifer L', 'DeGregori, James']","['Rozhok AI', 'Salstrom JL', 'DeGregori J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045; Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045; Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045; Integrated Department of Immunology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045; Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045; Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045 james.degregori@ucdenver.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA180175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA180175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mutation', 'Stochastic Processes']",PMC4743806,,2016/01/13 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1509333113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1509333113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Jan 26;113(4):1050-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1509333113.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We obtained aggregate data on relapse and survival outcomes for 16,623 patients age 1 to 18 years old with newly diagnosed ALL treated between 1996 and 2007 by 10 cooperative study groups from around the world. The proportion of patients eligible for prophylactic CRT varied from 0% to 33% by trial and was not related to the proportion eligible for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in first complete remission. Using a random effects model, with CRT as a dichotomous covariate, we performed a single-arm meta-analysis to compare event-free survival and cumulative incidence of isolated or any CNS relapse and isolated bone marrow relapse in high-risk subgroups of patients who either did or did not receive CRT. RESULTS: Although there was significant heterogeneity in all outcome end points according to trial, CRT was associated with a reduced risk of relapse only in the small subgroup of patients with overt CNS disease at diagnosis, who had a significantly lower risk of isolated CNS relapse (4% with CRT v 17% without CRT; P = .02) and a trend toward lower risk of any CNS relapse (7% with CRT v 17% without CRT; P = .09). However, this group had a relatively high rate of events regardless of whether or not they received CRT (32% [95% CI, 26% to 39%] v 34% [95% CI, 19% to 54%]; P = .8). CONCLUSION: CRT does not have an impact on the risk of relapse in children with ALL treated on contemporary protocols.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Vora, Ajay', 'Andreano, Anita', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Moericke, Anja', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Goulden, Nicholas', 'Taskinen, Mervi', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Vora A', 'Andreano A', 'Pui CH', 'Hunger SP', 'Schrappe M', 'Moericke A', 'Biondi A', 'Escherich G', 'Silverman LB', 'Goulden N', 'Taskinen M', 'Pieters R', 'Horibe K', 'Devidas M', 'Locatelli F', 'Valsecchi MG']","[""Ajay Vora, Sheffield Children's Hospital and University of Sheffield, Sheffield; Nicholas Goulden, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom; Anita Andreano and Maria Grazia Valsecchi, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan; Andrea Biondi, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza; Franco Locatelli, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, and University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy; Ching-Hon Pui, St Jude Children's Research Hospital and University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN; Stephen P.

We analyzed the genome-wide distributions of Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB) transposon insertions as well as MLV retrovirus and HIV lentivirus insertions in human CD4(+) T cells with respect to a panel of 40 chromatin states. The distribution of SB transposon insertions displayed the least deviation from random, while the PB transposon and the MLV retrovirus showed unexpected parallels across all chromatin states. Both MLV and PB insertions are enriched at transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and co-localize with BRD4-associated sites. We demonstrate physical interaction between the PB transposase and bromodomain and extraterminal domain proteins (including BRD4), suggesting convergent evolution of a tethering mechanism that directs integrating genetic elements into TSSs. We detect unequal biases across the four systems with respect to targeting genes whose deregulation has been previously linked to serious adverse events in gene therapy clinical trials. The SB transposon has the highest theoretical chance of targeting a safe harbor locus in the human genome.

These parameters were determined by a mathematical modeling approach based on the maximum-likelihood estimation method, using the results of a nationwide serological survey of prevalence in cattle and passive surveillance records. The best-fit distribution to estimate the disease incubation period was determined to be the Weibull distribution, with a median and average incubation period of 7.0 years.

Previous studies have classified the env sequences of BLV provirus from different geographic locations into eight genetic groups. To investigate the genetic variability of BLV in South America, we performed phylogenetic analyses of whole genome and partial env gp51 sequences of BLV strains isolated from Peru, Paraguay and Bolivia, for which no the molecular characteristics of BLV have previously been published, and discovered a novel BLV genotype, genotype-9, in Bolivia. RESULTS: In Peru and Paraguay, 42.3 % (139/328) and over 50 % (76/139) of samples, respectively, were BLV positive. In Bolivia, the BLV infection rate was up to 30 % (156/507) at the individual level. In Argentina, 325/420 samples were BLV positive, with a BLV prevalence of 77.4 % at the individual level and up to 90.9 % at herd level. By contrast, relatively few BLV positive samples were detected in Chile, with a maximum of 29.1 % BLV infection at the individual level. We performed phylogenetic analyses using two different approaches, maximum likelihood (ML) tree and Bayesian inference, using 35 distinct partial env gp51 sequences from BLV strains isolated from Peru, Paraguay, and Bolivia, and 74 known BLV strains, representing eight different BLV genotypes from various geographical locations worldwide. The results indicated that Peruvian and Paraguayan BLV strains were grouped into genotypes-1, -2, and -6, while those from Bolivia were clustered into genotypes-1, -2, and -6, and a new genotype, genotype-9. Interestingly, these results were confirmed using ML phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences obtained by next generation sequencing of 25 BLV strains, assigned to four different genotypes (genotypes-1, -2, -6, and -9) from Peru, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Comparative analyses of complete genome sequences clearly showed some specific substitutions, in both structural and non-structural BLV genes, distinguishing the novel genotype-9 from known genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate widespread BLV infection in South American cattle and the existence of a new BLV genotype-9 in Bolivia. We conclude that at least seven BLV genotypes (genotypes-1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -9) are circulating in South America.",,"['Polat, Meripet', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Hosomichi, Kazuyoshi', 'Kim, Jiyun', 'Miyasaka, Taku', 'Yamada, Kazunori', 'Arainga, Mariluz', 'Murakami, Tomoyuki', 'Matsumoto, Yuki', 'de la Barra Diaz, Veronica', 'Panei, Carlos Javier', 'Gonzalez, Ester Teresa', 'Kanemaki, Misao', 'Onuma, Misao', 'Giovambattista, Guillermo', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Polat M', 'Takeshima SN', 'Hosomichi K', 'Kim J', 'Miyasaka T', 'Yamada K', 'Arainga M', 'Murakami T', 'Matsumoto Y', 'de la Barra Diaz V', 'Panei CJ', 'Gonzalez ET', 'Kanemaki M', 'Onuma M', 'Giovambattista G', 'Aida Y']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. palati.mairepati@riken.jp.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Science, The University of Tokyo, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. palati.mairepati@riken.jp.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. takesima@riken.jp.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Science, The University of Tokyo, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. takesima@riken.jp.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa University, Takara-machi 13-1, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8640, Japan. khosomic@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. mukti8181@hotmail.com.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. takumiyasaka0712@gmail.com.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. kyamada@ecei.tohoku.ac.jp.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. m.araingaramirez@unmc.edu.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. tmurakam@umich.edu.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. pipora331@gmail.com.', 'LAVET, Carampangue 595, Valdivia, Chile. lab.lavet@gmail.com.', 'Department of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, National University of La Plata, 60 and 118, CC 296, 1900, La Plata, Argentina. javierpanei@fcv.unlp.edu.ar.', 'IGEVET, CCT La Plata-CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias, National University of La Plata, 60 and 118, CC 296, 1900, La Plata, Argentina. javierpanei@fcv.unlp.edu.ar.', 'Department of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, National University of La Plata, 60 and 118, CC 296, 1900, La Plata, Argentina. etgonzal@fcv.unlp.edu.ar.', 'Institute for Animal Science, Shitara-cho, Aichi, 441-2433, Japan. misaokanemaki@yahoo.co.jp.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. pochi-ko@deluxe.ocn.ne.jp.', 'IGEVET, CCT La Plata-CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias, National University of La Plata, 60 and 118, CC 296, 1900, La Plata, Argentina. ggiovam@yahoo.com.ar.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. aida@riken.jp.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Science, The University of Tokyo, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. aida@riken.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bolivia/epidemiology', 'Cattle', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*virology', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Genome, Viral', '*Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Paraguay/epidemiology', 'Peru/epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology']",PMC4709907,,2016/01/13 06:00,2016/10/13 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-016-0239-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-016-0239-z [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2016 Jan 12;13:4. doi: 10.1186/s12977-016-0239-z.,,,,20160112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the JAK2 V617F, CALR and STAT5 activation status in patients with CML and thrombocytosis (CML-T) that mimicked ET, trying to identify a common mechanism for thrombocytosis in MPN. METHODS: Blood and bone marrow morphological findings were reviewed from seven CML-T, four otherwise typical CML and one CML in blast phase. All cases were analysed for BCR-ABL1, JAK2 V617F and CALR exon 9 mutation and p-STAT5 expression. RESULTS: Four of seven cases of CML-T had marked thrombocytosis (>1000x10(9)/L). Eleven of 12 cases had megakaryocyte morphology typical for CML. All cases were BCR-ABL1 positive. Eleven of 12 cases were negative for JAK2 V617F, while STAT5 was activated in six of seven CML-T and in four of five CML cases. No case had a detectable CALR exon 9 mutation. One case of CML developed ET-like morphology and had JAK2 V617F detected while in molecular remission for CML. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of BCR-ABL1 is critical in the distinction of ET from CML. Thrombocytosis and STAT5 activation in CML-T are not consistently associated with CALR exon 9 or JAK2 V617F mutation.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Elevated Evi1 expression in AML is associated with unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, Evi1 is one of the strong candidate in molecular target therapy for the leukemia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, vital to many cell functions that negatively regulate gene expression by translation or inducing sequence-specific degradation of target mRNAs. As a novel biologics, miRNAs is a promising therapeutic target due to its low toxicity and low cost.

These studies are part of a broad category termed two-phase studies. Common examples include the nested case-control and the case-cohort designs. For two-phase studies, appropriate weighted survival estimates have been derived; however, no estimator of cumulative incidence accounting for competing events has been proposed. This is relevant in the presence of multiple types of events, where estimation of event type specific quantities are needed for evaluating outcome. METHODS: We develop a non parametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function of events accounting for possible competing events. It handles a general sampling design by weights derived from the sampling probabilities. The variance is derived from the influence function of the subdistribution hazard. RESULTS: The proposed method shows good performance in simulations. It is applied to estimate the crude incidence of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in groups defined by a genotype not available for everyone in a cohort of nearly 2000 patients, where death due to toxicity acted as a competing event. In a second example the aim was to estimate engagement in care of a cohort of HIV patients in resource limited setting, where for some patients the outcome itself was missing due to lost to follow-up. A sampling based approach was used to identify outcome in a subsample of lost patients and to obtain a valid estimate of connection to care. CONCLUSIONS: A valid estimator for cumulative incidence of events accounting for competing risks under a general sampling design from an infinite target population is derived.",,"['Rebora, Paola', 'Antolini, Laura', 'Glidden, David V', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Rebora P', 'Antolini L', 'Glidden DV', 'Valsecchi MG']","['Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, via Cadore 48, Monza, 20900, Italy. paola.rebora@unimib.it.', 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, via Cadore 48, Monza, 20900, Italy. laura.antolini@unimib.it.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.

Subtype distribution is different throughout the world. Some reports from the Middle East are in record. This article is trying to report the subtype distribution of lymphoma in Iran and compare it to that of Western, Far East Asian and Middle Eastern countries. A retrospective study was done on all lymphomas diagnosed in a large referral center in the South of Iran during a time period between 2009 and 2014. All diagnoses have been made according to 2008 WHO classification. A total number of 1085 cases with diagnoses of lymphoma retrieved. Twenty-nine cases (2.6 % of all) were precursor lymphoid neoplasm, 608 cases (56 % of all) were mature B cell neoplasm, 115 cases (10.5 % of all) were mature T and NK cell neoplasm, and 333 cases (30.6 % of all) were Hodgkin lymphoma. The six most frequent subtypes of mature B cell neoplasm were diffuse large B cell lymphoma, NOS (57 %), Burkitt lymphoma (7 %), small lymphocytic lymphoma (6.9 %), mantle cell lymphoma (5.7 %), extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma (5.2 %) and follicular lymphoma (3.6 %). Among mature T and NK cell neoplasm, mycosis fungoides was the most common type (43.4 %) followed by peripheral T cell lymphoma, NOS (20 %) and angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (9.9 %). Of Hodgkin lymphoma cases, 90.6 % were classical type and 9.3 % were nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. Extranodal involvement was seen in 42.2 % and GI tract was the most common site.

However, few studies have examined the impact of the grade of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) on post-transplant outcomes for CMML. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 141 patients with CMML who underwent allo-HSCT between 1987 and 2010, and achieved neutrophil engraftment. The effects of acute GVHD (aGVHD) or chronic GVHD (cGVHD) on overall survival (OS), leukemia-associated mortality (LAM), and transplant-related mortality were evaluated by hazards regression models, in which the onset date of aGVHD or cGVHD was treated as a time-dependent covariate. Grade I aGVHD was associated with better OS and lower LAM (P=0.042, P=0.033, respectively) than no GVHD in univariate analyses, but not in the multivariate analyses.

While the role of d-CRLF2 in children has been extensively described, little is known about its role and impact in adult ALL. METHODS: Expression levels of CRLF2 were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR in 102 newly-diagnosed adult B-NEG ALL and correlated with the clinico-biological characteristics and outcome. Incidence and clinical impact of the P2RY8/CRLF2 transcript was also assessed. RESULTS: High CRLF2 levels, as continuous variable, were significantly associated with hyperleucocytosis (p=0.0002) and thrombocytopenia (p=0.005); when a cut-point at DeltaCt</=8 was applied, 35 cases (34.3%), mostly males (80%), proved positive for CRLF2 expression. High CRLF2 levels, as continuous or categorical variable, were associated with a worse disease-free (p=0.003 and p=0.015) and overall survival (p=0.017 and 0.0038). Furthermore, when CRLF2 was analyzed as a categorical variable, a high statistical association was found with IKZF1 deletion and mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway (p=0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively). Finally, the P2RY8/CRLF2 transcript, identified in 8/102 patients (7.8%), was associated with a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In adult B-NEG ALL, high CRLF2 expression is associated with distinct clinico-biological features and an unfavourable prognosis in both univariate and multivariate analysis; similarly, P2RY8/CRLF2 positivity correlates with a poor outcome. The quantification of CRLF2 is an important prognostic marker in adult B-lineage ALL without known genetic lesions.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Hypercholesterolemia facilitates lymphoma lymphoblastic cell growth and in time turns in hypocholesterolemia that is a sign of tumour progression. The present study examined how and where the cholesterol acts in cancer cells when you reproduce in vitro an in vivo hypercholesterolemia condition. METHODS: We used non-Hodgkin's T cell human lymphoblastic lymphoma (SUP-T1 cell line) and we studied cell morphology, aggressiveness, gene expression for antioxidant proteins, polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase and actin, cholesterol and sphingomyelin content and finally sphingomyelinase activity in whole cells, nuclei and nuclear lipid microdomains. RESULTS: We found that cholesterol changes cancer cell morphology with the appearance of protrusions together to the down expression of beta-actin gene and reduction of beta-actin protein. The lipid influences SUP-T1 cell aggressiveness since stimulates DNA and RNA synthesis for cell proliferation and increases raf1 and E-cadherin, molecules involved in invasion and migration of cancer cells. Cholesterol does not change GRX2 expression but it overexpresses SOD1, SOD2, CCS, PRDX1, GSR, GSS, CAT and PNKP. We suggest that cholesterol reaches the nucleus and increases the nuclear lipid microdomains known to act as platform for chromatin anchoring and gene expression. CONCLUSION: The results imply that, in hypercholesterolemia conditions, cholesterol reaches the nuclear lipid microdomains where activates gene expression coding for antioxidant proteins.

In the last few years it has been shown that the beneficial effects of hMSC may be due to paracrine effects and, at least in part, mediated by extracellular vesicles (EV). EV have emerged as important mediators of cell-to-cell communication. Flow cytometry (FCM) is a routine technology used in most clinical laboratories and could be used as a methodology for hMSC-EV characterization. Although several reports have characterized EV by FCM, a specific panel and protocol for hMSC-derived EV is lacking. The main objective of our study was the characterization of hMSC-EV using a standard flow cytometer. METHODS: Human MSC from bone marrow of healthy donors, mesenchymal cell lines (HS-5 and hTERT) and a leukemic cell line (K562 cells) were used to obtain EV for FCM characterization. EV released from the different cell lines were isolated by ultracentrifugation and were characterized, using a multi-parametric analysis, in a conventional flow cytometer. EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), western blot (WB) and Nano-particle tracking analysis (NTA) was also performed. RESULTS: EV membranes are constituted by the combination of specific cell surface molecules depending on their cell of origin, together with specific proteins like tetraspanins (e.g. CD63). We have characterized by FCM the EV released from BM-hMSC, that were defined as particles less than 0.9 mum, positive for the hMSC markers (CD90, CD44 and CD73) and negative for CD34 and CD45 (hematopoietic markers). In addition, hMSC-derived EV were also positive for CD63 and CD81, the two characteristic markers of EV. To validate our characterization strategy, EV from mesenchymal cell lines (hTERT/HS-5) were also studied, using the leukemia cell line (K562) as a negative control. EV released from mesenchymal cell lines displayed the same immunophenotypic profile as the EV from primary BM-hMSC, while the EV derived from K562 cells did not show hMSC markers. We further validated the panel using EV from hMSC transduced with GFP. Finally, EV derived from the different sources (hMSC, hTERT/HS-5 and K562) were also characterized by WB, TEM and NTA, demonstrating the expression by WB of the exosomal markers CD63 and CD81, as well as CD73 in those from MSC origin. EV morphology and size/concentration was confirmed by TEM and NTA, respectively. CONCLUSION: We described a strategy that allows the identification and characterization by flow cytometry of hMSC-derived EV that can be routinely used in most laboratories with a standard flow

Newly available markers, such as genomic mutations, may be used to improve the accuracy of an existing classifier by reclassifying patients from a heterogenous group into a higher or lower risk category. The statistical tools typically applied to develop the initial classifiers are not easily adapted toward this reclassification goal. In this article, we develop a new method designed to refine an existing prognostic classifier by incorporating new markers. The two-stage algorithm called Boomerang first searches for modifications of the existing classifier that increase the overall predictive accuracy and then merges to a prespecified number of risk groups. Resampling techniques are proposed to assess the improvement in predictive accuracy when an independent validation data set is not available. The performance of the algorithm is assessed under various simulation scenarios where the marker frequency, degree of censoring, and total sample size are varied. The results suggest that the method selects few false positive markers and is able to improve the predictive accuracy of the classifier in many settings. Lastly, the method is illustrated on an acute myeloid leukemia data set where a new refined classifier incorporates four new mutations into the existing three category classifier and is validated on an independent data set.","['(c) 2016, The International Biometric Society.']","['Devlin, Sean M', 'Ostrovnaya, Irina', 'Gonen, Mithat']","['Devlin SM', 'Ostrovnaya I', 'Gonen M']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, U.S.A.. devlins@mskcc.org.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, U.S.A.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, U.S.A.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Algorithms', '*Biomarkers', 'Classification/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Methods', 'Mutation', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Sample Size']",PMC4940305,['NIHMS757524'],2016/01/13 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/biom.12469 [doi]'],ppublish,Biometrics. 2016 Sep;72(3):995-1002. doi: 10.1111/biom.12469.

Our study was aimed to determine the role of DLX4 methylation in regulating DLX4 expression and further analyze its clinical significance in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. DLX4 methylation level was detected by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) was used for demethylation studies. Clinical significance of DLX4 methylation was obtained by the comparison between the patients with and without DLX4 methylation. DLX4 was significantly methylated in AML patients compared with controls (P < 0.001). DLX4 methylation was negatively associated with DLX7 (the shorter DLX4 isoform) (R = -0.202, P = 0.021) but not BP1 (the longer DLX4 isoform) (R = -0.049, P = 0.582) expression in AML patients. DLX7 and BP1 messenger RNA (mRNA) were significantly increased after 5-aza-dC treatment in leukemic cell lines THP1 and Kasumi-1. DLX4 methylated patients showed significantly higher frequency of U2AF1 mutation compared with DLX4 unmethylated patients (P = 0.043). Both all AML and non-M3 patients with DLX4 methylation presented significantly lower complete remission rate than those with DLX4 unmethylation (P = 0.001 and <0.001, respectively). DLX4 methylated cases had significantly shorter overall survival than DLX4 unmethylated cases among both all AML (P = 0.003), non-M3 AML (P = 0.001), and cytogenetically normal AML (P = 0.032). Multivariate analysis confirmed that DLX4 methylation was independent risk factor in both all AML and non-M3 patients. Our study indicates that DLX4 hypermethylation is negatively associated with DLX7 expression and predicts poor clinical outcome in de novo AML patients.",,"['Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Wang, Yu-Xin', 'Yang, Dong-Qin', 'Yang, Lei', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Yang, Jing', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhou JD', 'Zhang TJ', 'Wang YX', 'Yang DQ', 'Yang L', 'Ma JC', 'Wen XM', 'Yang J', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. linjiangmail@sina.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. qianjun0007@hotmail.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (DLX4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Deoxycytidine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/01/13 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-4364-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-4364-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Jul;37(7):8951-60. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-4364-4.

However, the molecular mechanism of its overexpression remains not elucidated. MiR-320 has been reported to be down-regulated in various types of cancer, and bioinformatics prediction indicated that it may regulate the expression of Mcl-1. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of miR-320 and its target gene Mcl-1 in cervical cancer progression and to assess their clinical significance. miR-320 and Mcl-1 expressions in human cervical cancer tissues were investigated by qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. The clinicopathological implications of these molecules were analyzed. Bioinformatic prediction and luciferase assays were employed to identify the predicted microRNA (miRNA) which regulates Mcl-1. The apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion assays were performed to investigate the effect of miR-320 on the cervical cancer cells. MiR-320 expression is significantly down-regulated versus Mcl-1 expression is up-regulated in cervical cancer tissues compared with normal controls with a negative correlation between them. Luciferase assay showed that miR-320 negatively regulates Mcl-1 expression. In addition, miR-320 induces apoptosis via down-regulation of Mcl-1 and activation of caspase-3 but inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis in cervical cancer cells. Our studies show that miR-320 expression is decreased in cervical cancer, and its expression is negatively correlated with Mcl-1 expression in cervical cancer. In addition, miR-320 inhibits cervical cancer progression by down-regulation of Mcl-1. These results indicate that miR-320 may be an important biomarker and target for diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer patient.",,"['Zhang, Ting', 'Zou, Ping', 'Wang, Tiejun', 'Xiang, Jingying', 'Cheng, Jing', 'Chen, Daozhen', 'Zhou, Jianwei']","['Zhang T', 'Zou P', 'Wang T', 'Xiang J', 'Cheng J', 'Chen D', 'Zhou J']","['Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214002, China. zhangting040715@163.com.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Toxicology, Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment Cancer Center; School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. zhangting040715@163.com.', 'Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214002, China.', 'Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214002, China.', 'Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214002, China.', 'Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214002, China.', 'Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214002, China.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Toxicology, Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment Cancer Center; School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. jwzhou@njmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN320 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/pathology', 'Caspase 3/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*genetics/*parasitology']",,,2016/01/13 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-4771-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-4771-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2016 Jul;37(7):8931-40. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-4771-6.

Phase 2 studies of clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine (CLDA) as frontline therapy for elderly AML patients demonstrated high response and acceptable toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We hypothesized that induction therapy with CLDA provides equivalent outcomes to but is less toxic than intensive induction in these patients. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a propensity score-matched comparison of AML patients age >/= 60 years given induction CLDA versus idarubicin and cytarabine (IA). Ninety-five patients in both groups were matched according to their propensity score. RESULTS: We did not observe statistically significant differences in response, overall survival, or mortality rate between the two induction regimens. However, CLDA produced significantly fewer grade 3 or worse toxicities (46% for CLDA vs. 62% for IA; P = .03). Furthermore, among responders, the median response duration was significantly longer with CLDA when we censored patients who underwent stem cell transplantation (15.9 months for CLDA vs. 7.0 months for IA; P = .033).

The specific cause of AML is unclear, but it induces abnormality of white blood cells that grow rapidly and accumulate in bone marrow interfering with the production and functions of the normal blood cells. AML patients face poor prognosis and low quality of life during chemotherapy or transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells due to the progressive impairment of their immune system. The goal of this study is to find natural products that have the potential to delay growth or eliminate the abnormal leukemic cells but cause less harmful effect to the body's immune system. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The unsaponified fraction of Riceberry rice bran (RBDS) and the main pure compound, gramisterol, were studied for cytotoxicity and biological activities in WEHI-3 cells and in the leukemic mouse model induced by transplantation of WEHI-3 cells intraperitoneally. In the in vitro assay, RBDS and gramisterol exerted sub-G1 phase cell cycle arrest with a potent induction of apoptosis. Both of them effectively decreased cell cycle controlling proteins (cyclin D1 and cyclin E), suppressed cellular DNA synthesis and mitotic division, and reduced anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 protein, but increased apoptotic proteins (p53 and Bax) and activated caspase-3 enzyme in the intrinsic cell death stimulation pathway. In leukemic mice, daily feeding of RBDS significantly increased the amount of immune function-related cells including CD3+, CD19+, and CD11b+, and elevated the serum levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-12beta cytokines, but suppressed IL-10 level. At the tumor sites, CD11b+ cells were polarized and became active phagocytotic cells. Treatment of mice normal immune cells with gramisterol alone or a combination of gramisterol with cytokines released from RBDS-treated leukemic mice splenocytes culture synergistically increased pSTAT1 transcriptional factor that up-regulated the genes controlling cell survival and function. Phosphorylation of STAT1 was absent in WEHI-3. Instead, similar treatments significantly decreased pSTAT3 signaling that regulates transcription of genes controlling tumor growth and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Rice bran gramisterol possesses a promising anti-cancer effect against a tumor of white blood cells and induces the production of anti-cancer immune-related cytokines. Gramisterol induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via suppression of pSTAT3 signaling control of tumor cells' growth and progression. Gramisterol increased IFN-gamma production and prevented the dysfunctional immune system of leukemic mice by enhancing pSTAT1 transcription signal controlling proliferation and functions of hematopoietic cells in the spleen. Together with IFN-gamma, gramisterol efficiently facilitates leukemic mice immune system modulation leading to improvement of the AML condition. Administration of RBDS containing gramisterol potentiates immune recovery of leukemic mice and extends their survival. This finding encourages the medicinal application of rice bran gramisterol as a palliative treatment or an alternative agent for future drug development against AML.",,"['Somintara, Somsuda', 'Leardkamolkarn, Vijittra', 'Suttiarporn, Panawan', 'Mahatheeranont, Sugunya']","['Somintara S', 'Leardkamolkarn V', 'Suttiarporn P', 'Mahatheeranont S']","['Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (24-methylenelophenol)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cholestadienols)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sterols)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cholestadienols/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin E/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Immune System', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oryza/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sterols/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC4709086,,2016/01/12 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2016/01/12 06:00'],"['2015/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0146869 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-41317 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jan 11;11(1):e0146869. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0146869. eCollection 2016.,,,,20160111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, there are few data regarding its use in patients who relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). We report clinical data from five CLL patients treated with ibrutinib for relapse after first or even second allogeneic transplantation. Additionally, we performed analyses on cytokine levels and direct measuring of CD4 Th1 and CD4 Th2 cells to evaluate possible clinically relevant immunomodulatory effects of ibrutinib. All patients achieved partial responses including one minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative remission. Within 1 year of follow-up, no relapse was observed. One patient died of severe pneumonia while on ibrutinib treatment. Beside this, no unexpected adverse events were observed. Flow cytometry and analyses of T cell-mediated cytokine levels (IL10 and TNFalpha) did not reveal substantial changes in T-cell distribution in favor of a CD4 Th1 T-cell shift in our patients.

We evaluated the rate of alloimmunization in two groups of chronically transfused patients (A - not phenotyped and B - phenotyped for Rh/K antigens before the first transfusion) with primary haematological disorders and its distribution among the main haematological diseases, in order to adopt an efficient transfusional strategy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: As methodology, we used the SIBAS and SAM databases for the retrospective study of all patients with primary haematological disorder between January 2011 and April 2013. RESULTS: A statistical difference in the rate of alloimmunization comparing groups A and B was found (P <0.0001). We also observed that alloimmunization was not homogeneously distributed in all primary haematological diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The Rh/K phenotype should be performed on all patients diagnosed with bone marrow failure, plasma cell dyscrasia and myelodysplastic syndrome in order to avoid alloimmunization.

In addition, inhibitory mechanisms--especially local inhibitory mechanisms, which ensure proper spatial and kinetic controls of activation--are not well understood. Here, we identified two phosphoinositide phosphatases, synaptojanin 2 and SHIP1, that function in periodic traveling waves of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. The local, phase-shifted activation of lipid phosphatases generates sequential waves of phosphoinositides. By acutely perturbing phosphoinositide composition using optogenetic methods, we showed that pulses of PtdIns(4,5)P2 regulate the amplitude of cyclic membrane waves while PtdIns(3,4)P2 sets the frequency. Collectively, these data suggest that the spatiotemporal dynamics of lipid metabolism have a key role in governing cortical oscillations and reveal how phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) activity could be frequency-encoded by a phosphatase-dependent inhibitory reaction.",,"['Xiong, Ding', 'Xiao, Shengping', 'Guo, Su', 'Lin, Qingsong', 'Nakatsu, Fubito', 'Wu, Min']","['Xiong D', 'Xiao S', 'Guo S', 'Lin Q', 'Nakatsu F', 'Wu M']","['Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Bioimaging Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Bioimaging Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Bioimaging Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Neurochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Bioimaging Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Chem Biol,Nature chemical biology,101231976,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (synaptojanin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cerebral Cortex/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cytoskeleton/genetics', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Lipid Metabolism/physiology', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats']",,,2016/01/12 06:00,2016/07/07 06:00,['2016/01/12 06:00'],"['2015/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['nchembio.2000 [pii]', '10.1038/nchembio.2000 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Chem Biol. 2016 Mar;12(3):159-66. doi: 10.1038/nchembio.2000.

This results in the activation of an evolutionary conserved stress response termed ER stress that, if unresolved, induces apoptosis. Previously the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-Only Protein Puma was identified as a mediator of ER stress-induced apoptosis in neurons. In the search of alternative contributors to ER stress-induced apoptosis, a downregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 was noted during ER stress in both mouse cortical neurons and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Downregulation of Mcl-1 was associated with an upregulation of microRNA-29a (miR-29a) expression, and subsequent experiments showed that miR-29a targeted the 3'-untranslated region of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, Mcl-1. Inhibition of miR-29a expression using sequence-specific antagomirs or the overexpression of Mcl-1 decreased cell death following tunicamycin treatment, while gene silencing of Mcl-1 increased cell death. miR-29a did not alter the signalling branches of the ER stress response, rather its expression was controlled by the ER stress-induced transcription factor activating-transcription-factor-4 (ATF4).

Here, we report that a recombinant, truncated human NME7, referred to as NME7AB here, induces a stable naive-like state in human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells without the use of inhibitors, transgenes, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), feeder cells, or their conditioned media. Evidence of a naive state includes reactivation of the second X chromosome in female source cells, increased expression of naive markers and decreased expression of primed state markers, ability to be clonally expanded and increased differentiation potential. RNA-seq analysis shows vast differences between the parent FGF2 grown, primed state cells, and NME7AB converted cells, but similarities to altered gene expression patterns reported by others generating naive-like stem cells via the use of biochemical inhibitors. Experiments presented here, in combination with our previous work, suggest a mechanistic model of how human stem cells regulate self-replication: an early naive state driven by NME7, which cannot itself limit self-replication and a later naive state regulated by NME1, which limits self-replication when its multimerization state shifts from the active dimer to the inactive hexamer.","['(c) 2016 The Authors STEM CELLS published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of', 'AlphaMed Press.']","['Carter, M G', 'Smagghe, B J', 'Stewart, A K', 'Rapley, J A', 'Lynch, E', 'Bernier, K J', 'Keating, K W', 'Hatziioannou, V M', 'Hartman, E J', 'Bamdad, Cynthia C']","['Carter MG', 'Smagghe BJ', 'Stewart AK', 'Rapley JA', 'Lynch E', 'Bernier KJ', 'Keating KW', 'Hatziioannou VM', 'Hartman EJ', 'Bamdad CC']","['Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Minerva Biotechnologies, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Human Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'X Chromosome/genetics']",,,2016/01/11 06:00,2017/01/11 06:00,['2016/01/11 06:00'],"['2015/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.2261 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2016 Apr;34(4):847-59. doi: 10.1002/stem.2261.

Thus, CD123 is considered as a particularly important target candidate for antibody-derived diagnosis and therapy. In the present work, we constructed an immunized murine antibody phage display library and isolated the functional anti-CD123 Single-chain fragment variable (scFv) clones. We also introduced fusing variable light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains with a new 18-amino acid residue linker as an alternative to conventional linkers. CD123-specific phage clones were progressively enriched through 4 rounds of biopanning, validated by phage ELISA, and anti-CD123 scFv clones with highest affinity were produced in Escherichia coli. The expression and purification of soluble scFv were verified by Western blot, and the results were indicative of the functionality of our proposed linker. The purified scFv specifically recognized CD123 by ELISA and flow cytometry, without any cross-reactivity with other related cell markers.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern of mucocutaneous manifestations in adult Asian patients with leukemia and to establish their relation with the leukemia type. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After previous consent, 196 consecutively registered patients with leukemia aged >/=18 years were recruited. All patients were prospectively followed for 3 months to evaluate the patterns of mucocutaneous involvement. The mucocutaneous manifestations were categorized into specific lesions with leukemic infiltration and non-specific lesions. RESULTS: Seventy-nine (40.3%) of 196 (males 128 and females 68) recruited patients showed one or more mucocutaneous manifestations. The total number of complaints observed was 87 with mean number of dermatoses per patient being 0.44. Specific manifestations (leukemia cutis) were present in six (3.06%) and nonspecific mucocutaneous manifestations in 73 (37.2%, reactive dermatoses n = 21 and infections n = 52). Cutaneous viral infections were significantly associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P < 0.005).

This pilot study was aimed at describing the prevalence of psychological morbidities among AYAs with hematologic malignancies during curative-intent therapy and early survivorship and at examining provider perceptions of psychological morbidities in their AYA patients. METHODS: Patients aged 15 to 39 years with acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma who were undergoing curative-intent therapy (on-treatment group) or were in remission within 2 years of therapy completion (early survivors) underwent a semistructured interview that incorporated measures of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress (PTS). A subset of providers (n = 15) concomitantly completed a survey for each of the first 30 patients enrolled that evaluated their perception of each subject's anxiety, depression, and PTS. RESULTS: Sixty-one of 77 eligible AYAs participated. The median age at diagnosis was 26 years (range, 15-39 years), 64% were male, and 59% were non-Hispanic white. On-treatment demographics differed significantly from early-survivor demographics only in the median time from diagnosis to interview. Among the 61 evaluable AYAs, 23% met the criteria for anxiety, 28% met the criteria for depression, and 13% met the criteria for PTS; 46% demonstrated PTS symptomatology. Thirty-nine percent were impaired in 1 or more psychological domains. Psychological impairments were as frequent among early survivors as AYAs on treatment. Provider perceptions did not significantly correlate with patient survey results. CONCLUSIONS: AYAs with hematologic malignancies experience substantial psychological morbidities while they are undergoing therapy and during early survivorship, with more than one-third of the patients included in this study meeting the criteria for anxiety, depression, or traumatic stress.

This is critical for patients with an incurable disease such as cancer. Biomarker trajectories are usually not linear, nor even monotone, and vary greatly across individuals. Therefore, it is difficult to fit them with parametric models. With this consideration, we propose an approach for dynamic prediction that does not need to model the biomarker trajectories. Instead, as a trade-off, we assume that the biomarker effects on the risk of disease recurrence are smooth functions over time. This approach turns out to be computationally easier. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach achieves stable estimation of biomarker effects over time, has good predictive performance, and is robust against model misspecification. It is a good compromise between two major approaches, namely, (i) joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data and (ii) landmark analysis. The proposed method is applied to patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. At any time following their treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, longitudinally measured BCR-ABL gene expression levels are used to predict the risk of disease progression.

It has been also described that different types of lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma exhibit expression of divergent gammac cytokines and their receptors, as they may promote malignant transformation of lymphoid cells or on the contrary lead to tumor regression by inducing cell-cycle arrest. Therefore, cytokine-based or cytokine-directed blockade in cancer immunotherapy has currently revolutionized the development of cancer treatment. In this review, we will discuss about the role of gammac cytokines and their signaling pathways in hematological malignancies and also propose a novel alternative approach that regulates gammac cytokine responsiveness by gammac in hematological malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

HOXA9 and MEIS1 are considered to be the most critical targets of MLL fusions and their coexpression rapidly induces AML. MEIS1 and PBX3 are not individually able to transform cells and were therefore hypothesized to function as cofactors of HOXA9. However, in this study, we demonstrate that coexpression of PBX3 and MEIS1 (PBX3/MEIS1), without ectopic expression of a HOX gene, is sufficient for transformation of normal mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vitro. Moreover, PBX3/MEIS1 overexpression also caused AML in vivo, with a leukemic latency similar to that caused by forced expression of MLL-AF9, the most common form of MLL fusions. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of hematopoietic cells demonstrated that PBX3/MEIS1 overexpression, but not HOXA9/MEIS1, HOXA9/PBX3, or HOXA9 overexpression, recapitulated the MLL-fusion-mediated core transcriptome, particularly upregulation of the endogenous Hoxa genes. Disruption of the binding between MEIS1 and PBX3 diminished PBX3/MEIS1-mediated cell transformation and HOX gene upregulation. Collectively, our studies strongly implicate the PBX3/MEIS1 interaction as a driver of cell transformation and leukemogenesis, and suggest that this axis may play a critical role in the regulation of the core transcriptional programs activated in MLL-rearranged and HOX-overexpressing AML. Therefore, targeting the MEIS1/PBX3 interaction may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to treat these AML subtypes.",['(c)2016 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Li, Zejuan', 'Chen, Ping', 'Su, Rui', 'Hu, Chao', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Elkahloun, Abdel G', 'Zuo, Zhixiang', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Arnovitz, Stephen', 'Weng, Hengyou', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Li, Shenglai', 'Huang, Hao', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Wang, Gang Greg', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Liu, Paul P', 'Jin, Jie', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Li Z', 'Chen P', 'Su R', 'Hu C', 'Li Y', 'Elkahloun AG', 'Zuo Z', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Arnovitz S', 'Weng H', 'Wang Y', 'Li S', 'Huang H', 'Neilly MB', 'Wang GG', 'Jiang X', 'Liu PP', 'Jin J', 'Chen J']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. chen3jj@uc.edu zli7@bsd.uchicago.edu.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.

The optimal therapeutic approaches to adult patients with ETP-ALL/LBL are poorly characterized. In this study, we compared the outcomes of adults with ETP-ALL/LBL who received treatment on frontline regimens with those of patients with other T-ALL/LBL immunophenotypic subtypes. Patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL/LBL who received frontline chemotherapy between the years 2000 and 2014 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were identified and immunophenotypically categorized into early, thymic, and mature per the World Health Organization (WHO) classification using CD1a and surface CD3 status. Patients with ETP-ALL/LBL were identified on the basis of the following immunophenotypes: CD1a(-), CD8(-), CD5(-)(dim), and positivity for 1 or more stem cell or myeloid antigens. A total of 111 patients with T-ALL/LBL (68% T-ALL; 32% T-LBL) with adequate immunophenotype data were identified. The median age was 30 years (range, 13-79). There was no difference in the outcomes of patients based on the WHO subtypes. Nineteen patients (17%) had ETP-ALL/LBL. The complete remission rate /complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery rate in patients with ETP-ALL/LBL was significantly lower than that of non-ETP-ALL/LBL patients (73% vs 91%;P= .03). The median overall survival for patients with ETP-ALL/LBL was 20 months vs not reached for the non-ETP-ALL/LBL patients (P= .008). ETP-ALL/LBL represents a high-risk disease subtype of adult ALL.

Survey instruments included the Sydney Post BMT Survey, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-BMT, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21, the Chronic GVHD Activity Assessment-Patient Self Report (Form B), the Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory. We found most BMT survivors (74%) would prefer LTFU with their transplantation physicians alone or in combination with transplantation center-linked services (satellite clinics or telemedicine) Over one-quarter indicated a preference for receiving comprehensive post-transplantation care in a ""satellite"" clinic staffed by their BMT team situated closer to their place of residence, with higher income, higher educational level, and sexual morbidity being significant social factors influencing this preference. Regular exercise was reported less often in those who preferred telemedicine, which may reflect reduced mobility. The factor most strongly associated with a preference for transplantation center follow-up was the severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Full- and part-time work were negatively associated with transplantation center follow-up, possibly implying decreased dependency on the center and some return to normalcy. This study is the first to explore the preferences of BMT survivors for long-term post-transplantation care. These data provides the basis for LTFU model of care development and health service reform consistent with the preferences of BMT survivors.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The goal of this study was to determine whether LIF protects neurons during stroke by upregulating superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3). Animals were administered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 125 mug/kg LIF at 6, 24, and 48 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion or sham surgery. Neurons were isolated from rat pups on embryonic day 18 and used between 7 and 15 days in culture. Cells were treated with LIF and/or 10 muM Akt inhibitor IV with PBS and 0.1 % DMSO acting as vehicle controls. Neurons transfected with scrambled or SOD3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) were subjected to 24-h ischemia after PBS or LIF treatment. LIF significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and SOD3 expression in ipsilateral brain tissue compared to PBS. Following 24-h ischemia, LIF reduced cell death and increased SOD3 messenger RNA (mRNA) in vitro compared to PBS. Adding Akt inhibitor IV with LIF counteracted the decrease in cell death. Partially silencing the expression of SOD3 using siRNA prior to LIF treatment counteracted the protective effect of LIF-alone PBS treatment. These results indicate that LIF protects neurons in vivo and in vitro via upregulation of SOD3.",,"['Davis, Stephanie M', 'Collier, Lisa A', 'Leonardo, Christopher C', 'Seifert, Hilary A', 'Ajmo, Craig T Jr', 'Pennypacker, Keith R']","['Davis SM', 'Collier LA', 'Leonardo CC', 'Seifert HA', 'Ajmo CT Jr', 'Pennypacker KR']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, University of South Florida, 12901 Bruce B.

We aimed to assess peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) lymphocyte status at the diagnosis and during different TKI therapies and correlate it with treatment responses. METHODS: BM and PB samples were acquired from 105 first-line TKI-treated patients. Relative number of BM lymphocytes was evaluated from MGG-stained BM aspirates, and immunophenotypic analyses were performed with multicolour flow cytometry. RESULTS: Early 3-month expansion of BM lymphocytes was found during all different TKIs (imatinib n = 71, 20 %; dasatinib n = 25, 21 %; nilotinib n = 9, 22 %; healthy controls n = 14, 12 %, p < 0.0001). Increased PB lymphocyte count was only observed during dasatinib therapy. The BM lymphocyte expansion was associated with early molecular response; patients with 3-month BCR-ABL1 <10 % showed higher lymphocyte counts than patients with BCR-ABL1 >10 % (23 vs. 17 %, p < 0.05). Detailed phenotypic analysis showed that BM lymphocyte expansion consisted of various lymphocyte subclasses, but especially the proportion of CD19+ B cells and CD3negCD16/56+ NK cells increased from diagnostic values. During dasatinib treatment, the lymphocyte balance in both BM and PB was shifted more to cytotoxic direction (increased CD8+CD57+ and CD8+HLA-DR+ cells, and low T regulatory cells), whereas no major immunophenotypic differences were observed between imatinib and nilotinib patients. CONCLUSIONS: Early BM lymphocytosis occurs with all current first-line TKIs and is associated with better treatment responses. PB and BM immunoprofile during dasatinib treatment markedly differs from both imatinib- and nilotinib-treated patients.",,"['El Missiry, Mohamed', 'Adnan Awad, Shady', 'Rajala, Hanna L', 'Al-Samadi, Ahmed', 'Ekblom, Marja', 'Markevan, Berit', 'Astrand-Grundstrom, Ingbritt', 'Wold, Maren', 'Svedahl, Ellen Rabben', 'Juhl, Birgitte Ravn', 'Bjerrum, Ole Weis', 'Haulin, Inger', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['El Missiry M', 'Adnan Awad S', 'Rajala HL', 'Al-Samadi A', 'Ekblom M', 'Markevan B', 'Astrand-Grundstrom I', 'Wold M', 'Svedahl ER', 'Juhl BR', 'Bjerrum OW', 'Haulin I', 'Porkka K', 'Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Mustjoki S']","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Haartmaninkatu 8, P.O.

In this study, we addressed whether such CMV-induced imprints on the donor NK cell repertoire influenced the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Hierarchical clustering of high-resolution immunophenotyping data covering key NK cell parameters, including frequencies of CD56(bright), NKG2A(+), NKG2C(+), and CD57(+) NK cell subsets, as well as the size of the educated NK cell subset, was linked to clinical outcomes. Clusters defining naive (NKG2A(+)CD57(-)NKG2C(-)) NK cell repertoires in the donor were associated with decreased risk for relapse in recipients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.27; p < 0.001). Furthermore, recipients with naive repertoires at 9-12 mo after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had increased disease-free survival (HR, 7.2; 95% CI: 1.6-33; p = 0.01) and increased overall survival (HR, 9.3; 95% CI: 1.1-77, p = 0.04). Conversely, patients with a relative increase in differentiated NK cells at 9-12 mo displayed a higher rate of late relapses (HR, 8.41; 95% CI: 6.7-11; p = 0.02), reduced disease-free survival (HR, 0.12; 95% CI: 0.12-0.74; p = 0.02), and reduced overall survival (HR, 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01-0.69; p = 0.02). Thus, our data suggest that naive donor NK cell repertoires are associated with protection against leukemia relapse after allogeneic HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Bjorklund, Andreas T', 'Clancy, Trevor', 'Goodridge, Jodie P', 'Beziat, Vivien', 'Schaffer, Marie', 'Hovig, Eivind', 'Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf', 'Ljungman, Per T', 'Malmberg, Karl-Johan']","['Bjorklund AT', 'Clancy T', 'Goodridge JP', 'Beziat V', 'Schaffer M', 'Hovig E', 'Ljunggren HG', 'Ljungman PT', 'Malmberg KJ']","['Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden; Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden;', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, 0310 Oslo, Norway; Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, 0310 Oslo, Norway;', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, 0310 Oslo, Norway;', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden;', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden;', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, 0310 Oslo, Norway; Institute of Cancer Genetics and Informatics, Oslo University Hospital, 3010 Oslo, Norway; Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, 0316 Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden;', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden;', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden; Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, 0310 Oslo, Norway; K.G.

Haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 causes familial platelet disorder with predisposition to myeloid malignancies (FPD/MM). However, the molecular mechanism of FPD/MM remains unknown. Here we show that murine Runx1(+/-) hematopoietic cells are hypersensitive to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), leading to enhanced expansion and mobilization of stem/progenitor cells and myeloid differentiation block. Upon G-CSF stimulation, Runx1(+/-) cells exhibited a more pronounced phosphorylation of STAT3 as compared with Runx1(+/+) cells, which may be due to reduced expression of Pias3, a key negative regulator of STAT3 signaling, and reduced physical sequestration of STAT3 by RUNX1. Most importantly, blood cells from a FPD patient with RUNX1 mutation exhibited similar G-CSF hypersensitivity. Taken together, Runx1 haploinsufficiency appears to predispose FPD patients to MM by expanding the pool of stem/progenitor cells and blocking myeloid differentiation in response to G-CSF.",,"['Chin, D W L', 'Sakurai, M', 'Nah, G S S', 'Du, L', 'Jacob, B', 'Yokomizo, T', 'Matsumura, T', 'Suda, T', 'Huang, G', 'Fu, X-Y', 'Ito, Y', 'Nakajima, H', 'Osato, M']","['Chin DW', 'Sakurai M', 'Nah GS', 'Du L', 'Jacob B', 'Yokomizo T', 'Matsumura T', 'Suda T', 'Huang G', 'Fu XY', 'Ito Y', 'Nakajima H', 'Osato M']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, A*STAR, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamato, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamato, Japan.', ""Department of Paediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, A*STAR, Singapore.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamato, Japan.', 'Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, A*STAR, Singapore.', 'Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (PIAS3 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Haploinsufficiency', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC4742622,,2016/01/09 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2016/01/09 06:00'],"['2015/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj2015105 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2015.105 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 Jan 8;6:e379. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2015.105.,,,,20160108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This results in increased apoptotic activity through the intrinsic pathway involved in rupture of mitochondrial membrane and release of cytochrome C. Evidence for inhibition of ERK1/2 by deguelin and escape of BAD phosphorylation at serine 112 through ERK/RSK pathway has been further fortified by obtaining similar results by silencing ERK 1/2 each with specific siRNAs.

Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) as providers of pro-apoptotic molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), can be considered as an effective anti-cancer therapy candidate. Therefore, in this study we assessed the role of tumor necrosis factor-producing mesenchymal stem cells oin apoptosis of B-CLL cells resistant to fludarabine- based chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, after isolation and culture of AD-MSCs, a lentiviral LeGO-iG2-TRAIL-GFP vector containing a gene producing the ligand pro-apoptotic with plasmid PsPAX2 and PMDG2 virus were transfected into cell-lines to generate T293HEK. Then, T293HEK cell supernatant containing the virus produced after 48 and 72 hours was collected, and these viruses were transduced to reprogram AD-MSCs. Apoptosis rates were separately studied in four groups: group 1, AD-MSCs-TRAIL; group 2, AD-MSCs-GFP; group 3, AD-MSCs; and group 4, CLL. RESULTS: Observed apoptosis rates were: group 1, 42 +/- 1.04%; group 2, 21 +/- 0.57%; group 3, 19+/- 2.6%; and group 4, % 0.01 +/- 0.01. The highest rate of apoptosis thus occurred ingroup 1 (transduced TRAIL encoding vector). In this group, the average medium-soluble TRAIL was 72.7pg/m and flow cytometry analysis showed a pro-apoptosis rate of 63 +/- 1.6%, which was again higher than in other groups.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence rates of different types of cancer in Sulaymaniyah from January-2006 to January-2014. The data were compared with those reported for other middle east countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study depended on data collected from Hiwa hospital cancer registry unit, death records and histopathology reports in all Sulaymaniyah teaching hospitals, using international classification of diseases. RESULTS: A total of 8,031 cases were registered during the eight year period, the annual incidence rate in all age groups rose from 38 to 61.7 cases/100,000 population/year, with averages over 50 in males and 50.7 in females. The male to female ratio in all age groups were 0.98, while in the pediatric age group it was 1.33. The hematological malignancies in all age groups accounted for 20% but in the pediatric group around half of all cancer cases. Pediatric cancers were occluding 7% of total cancers with rates of 10.3 in boys and 8.7 in girls. The commonest malignancies by primary site were leukemia, lymphoma, brain, kidney and bone. In males in all age groups they were lung, leukaemia, lymphoma, colorectal, prostate, bladder, brain, stomach, carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) and skin, while in females they were breast, leukaemia, lymphoma, colorectal, ovary, lung, brain, CUP, and stomach. Most cancers were increased with increasing age except breast cancer where decrease was noted in older ages. High mortality rates were found with leukemia, lung, lymphoma, colorectal, breast and stomach cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We here found an increase in annual cancer incidence rates across the period of study, because of increase of cancer with age and higher rates of hematological malignancies.

The ubiquitination pathway facilitates degradation of damaged proteins and regulates growth and stress responses. This pathway is altered in various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer. Recently it has been reported that expression of newly characterized human genes, UBE2Q1 and UBE2Q2, putative members of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family (E2), has been also changed in colorectal cancer. Epigenetics is one of the fastest-growing areas of science and nowadays has become a central issue in biological studies of diseases. According to the lack of information about the role of epigenetic changes on gene expression profiling of UBE2Q1 and UBE2Q2, and the presence of CpG islands in the promoter of these two human genes, we decided to evaluate the promoter methylation status of these genes as a first step. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The promoter methylation status of UBE2Q1 and UBE2Q2 was studied by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in tumor samples of 60 colorectal cancer patients compared to adjacent normal tissues and 20 non-malignant controls. The frequency of the methylation for each gene was analyzed by chi-square method. RESULTS: MSP results revealed that UBE2Q2 gene promoter were more unmethylated, while a higher level of methylated allele was observed for UBE2Q1 in tumor tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues and the non malignant controls.

RESULTS: The expression level of miR-155 was significantly higher in AML patients than in controls. Besides, a lowest miR-155 level was found in favorable prognosis group and t (15; 17)/M3 subgroup compared to the rest, while a higher level in C-Kit/FLT3-ITD mutation and relatively lower level existed in ""Negative"" mutation group.

Such an approach requires know of the mechanisms involved in the resistance and survival of leukemia cells. Previous studied has found that Preferentially Expressed Antigen of Melanoma (PRAME) is overexpressed in the leukemia cells, and knockdown of PRAME promoted apoptosis in leukemia K562 cells. In the present study, we investigated whether inhibition of PRAME could sensitize K562 cells to chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: K562 cells were treated with PRAME siRNA, and/or adriamycin (ADR), and cell viability and apoptosis, mRNA and protein expression levels were, then, evaluated. Furthermore, the efficacy of PRAME siRNA combined with ADR was further examined in established xenograft models. RESULTS: PRAME suppression was sufficient to induce spontaneous apoptosis of K562 cells. PRAME knockdown showed antiproliferative effects and induced tumor regression in established K562 xenograft models. ADR showed antitumor activity against K562 cells, co-treatment with PRAME siRNA induced an increased apoptosis rate than the sum of the single-treatment rates and promoted tumor regression without enhanced body weight loss in the K562 xenograft models. CONCLUSIONS: PRAME is responsible for the inherent low levels of spontaneous apoptosis in K562 cells. The combination of PRAME siRNA with ADR induced more intense apoptosis compared with each single treatment. PRAME siRNA in combination with ADR is well tolerated and shows greater efficacy than either agent alone in mouse xenograft models.",,"['Yan, H', 'Zhao, R-M', 'Wang, Z-J', 'Zhao, F-R', 'Wang, S-L']","['Yan H', 'Zhao RM', 'Wang ZJ', 'Zhao FR', 'Wang SL']","[""Department of Medical Imaging, People's Hospital of Rizhao, Rizhao, China. lysrmyyblood@126.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics']",,,2016/01/09 06:00,2016/11/03 06:00,['2016/01/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2015 Dec;19(24):4827-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we firstly integrated the protein interaction data and expression profiles to infer and reweight the normal and AML networks using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Next, clustering-based on maximal cliques (CMC) approach and a maximum weight bipartite matching method were implemented to infer the condition-specific modules and capture the disturbed modules, respectively, from two conditional networks. Then, the gene compositions and functional enrichment analysis were performed to identify the dysregulated genes and pathways. Finally, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was implemented to study the expression level of several key genes in AML patients. RESULTS: In two conditional-specific networks, universal changes of gene correlations were revealed, making the differential correlation density among disrupted module pairs. In this work, a total of 84 altered modules were identified by comparing modules in normal and AML networks. Functional enrichment analysis showed that genes in altered modules mainly involved in cell cycle, nucleic acids and cancer signaling process, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and changed gene correlations were mainly participated in natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity and acute myeloid leukemia pathway. The key genes, such as MYC, EGFR, MAPK1 and CCNA1, were all significantly differentially expressed in AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: This module approach effectively identifies dysregulated pathways and genes associated with AML. The considerable differences of gene correlations yield to these dysfunctional modules, and the coordinated disruption of these very modules contributes to leukemogenesis.",,"['Fang, Y', 'Xie, L-N', 'Liu, X-M', 'Yu, Z', 'Kong, F-S', 'Song, N-X', 'Zhou, F']","['Fang Y', 'Xie LN', 'Liu XM', 'Yu Z', 'Kong FS', 'Song NX', 'Zhou F']","['Department of Hematology, Jinan Military General Hospital, Jinan, China. fangzhoumed@yeah.net.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2016/01/09 06:00,2016/11/03 06:00,['2016/01/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2015 Dec;19(24):4811-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, some genetic and epidemiological studies have highlighted a role for RNase L polymorphisms, particularly R462Q, in the progression of prostate cancer. OBJECTIVES: The focus of this study was on the association of XMRV and RNase L R462Q variants with the risk of prostate cancer in Iranian patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 40 and 80 individuals with sporadic prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia, respectively, were included. The presence of XMRV was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of integrase and nested-PCR for the gag genes. The RNase L R462Q polymorphism analysis was carried out by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: In a total of 40 sporadic prostate cancer and 80 benign prostatic hyperplasia cases, no XMRV was detected by real-time PCR and nested-PCR. RNase L R462Q polymorphism analysis reveals that although there was an increase in the risk of prostate cancer correlated with the Q/Q allele of RNase L at position 462, the frequencies of the RNase L R462Q alleles were not statistically significant between the prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia groups (OR = 2.75 (95% CI = 0.67 - 11.3), P = 0.29).

Transcription at the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus targets CSR-associated DNA damage and is promoted by the BRCT domain-containing PTIP (Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein). Although PTIP is a unique component of the mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3)/MLL4 chromatin-modifying complex, the mechanisms for how PTIP promotes transcription remain unclear. Here we dissected the minimal structural requirements of PTIP and its different protein complexes using quantitative proteomics in primary lymphocytes. We found that PTIP functions in transcription and CSR separately from its association with the MLL3/MLL4 complex and from its localization to sites of DNA damage. We identified a tandem BRCT domain of PTIP that is sufficient for CSR and identified PA1 as its main functional protein partner. Collectively, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that a PTIP-PA1 subcomplex functions independently from the MLL3/MLL4 complex to mediate transcription during CSR. These results further our understanding of how multifunctional chromatin-modifying complexes are organized by subcomplexes that harbor unique and distinct activities.",['(c) 2016 Starnes et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Starnes, Linda M', 'Su, Dan', 'Pikkupeura, Laura M', 'Weinert, Brian T', 'Santos, Margarida A', 'Mund, Andreas', 'Soria, Rebeca', 'Cho, Young-Wook', 'Pozdnyakova, Irina', 'Kubec Hojfeldt, Martina', 'Vala, Andrea', 'Yang, Wenjing', 'Lopez-Mendez, Blanca', 'Lee, Ji-Eun', 'Peng, Weiqun', 'Yuan, Joan', 'Ge, Kai', 'Montoya, Guillermo', 'Nussenzweig, Andre', 'Choudhary, Chunaram', 'Daniel, Jeremy A']","['Starnes LM', 'Su D', 'Pikkupeura LM', 'Weinert BT', 'Santos MA', 'Mund A', 'Soria R', 'Cho YW', 'Pozdnyakova I', 'Kubec Hojfeldt M', 'Vala A', 'Yang W', 'Lopez-Mendez B', 'Lee JE', 'Peng W', 'Yuan J', 'Ge K', 'Montoya G', 'Nussenzweig A', 'Choudhary C', 'Daniel JA']","['Chromatin Structure and Function Group, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Chromatin Structure and Function Group, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Chromatin Structure and Function Group, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Proteomics and Cell Signaling Group, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA;', 'Chromatin Structure and Function Group, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Chromatin Structure and Function Group, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Adipocyte Biology and Gene Regulation Section, Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA;', 'Protein Production and Characterization Platform, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Chromatin Structure and Function Group, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Protein Production and Characterization Platform, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Department of Physics, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052, USA;', 'Protein Production and Characterization Platform, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;', 'Adipocyte Biology and Gene Regulation Section, Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA;', 'Department of Physics, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052, USA;', 'Developmental Immunology Group, Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden;', 'Adipocyte Biology and Gene Regulation Section, Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA;', 'Protein Production and Characterization Platform, The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2200, Denmark;

The impact of selective removal of FIV-positive cats on the apparent prevalence in the remaining population over this three-year period was also assessed. The seroprevalences over three years were 18.8 per cent for FIV and 0.7 per cent for FeLV. For FIV, the seroprevalence decreased significantly from the first year of the programme (2010; 30.5 per cent) to the last (2012; 13.1 per cent). Sex (male) and age (adult and old cats) were risk factors, while the year of sampling (years 2011 and 2012) was a protective factor. Age, sex and location were the most relevant predictors of FIV status. The data presented in this study revealed a very high FIV seroprevalence in Belgian stray cats, while FeLV was almost absent.

To solve the problem, copper (Cu) with a much higher thermal conductivity and lower cost was introduced to generate a novel Cu-Au alloy nanostructure produced by a simple, gentle and one-pot synthetic method. Having the good qualities of both Cu and Au, the irregularly-shaped Cu-Au alloy nanostructures showed several advantages over traditional Au nanorods, including a broad and intense near-infrared (NIR) absorption band from 400 to 1100 nm, an excellent heating performance under laser irradiation at different wavelengths and even a notable photostability against melting. Then, via a simple conjugation of fluorophore-labeled aptamers on the Cu-Au alloy nanostructures, active targeting and signal output were simultaneously introduced, thus constructing a theranostic platform based on fluorophore-labeled, aptamer-coated Cu-Au alloy nanostructures. By using human leukemia CCRF-CEM cancer and Cy5-labeled aptamer Sgc8c (Cy5-Sgc8c) as the model, a selective fluorescence imaging and NIR photothermal therapy was successfully realized for both in vitro cancer cells and in vivo tumor tissues. It was revealed that Cy5-Sgc8c-coated Cu-Au alloy nanostructures were not only capable of robust target recognition and stable signal output for molecular imaging in complex biological systems, but also killed target cancer cells in mice with only five minutes of 980 nm irradiation. The platform was found to be simple, stable, biocompatible and highly effective, and shows great potential as a versatile tool for cancer theranostics.",,"['Ye, Xiaosheng', 'Shi, Hui', 'He, Xiaoxiao', 'Yu, Yanru', 'He, Dinggeng', 'Tang, Jinlu', 'Lei, Yanli', 'Wang, Kemin']","['Ye X', 'Shi H', 'He X', 'Yu Y', 'He D', 'Tang J', 'Lei Y', 'Wang K']","['State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Institute of Biology, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China. kmwang@hnu.edu.cn xiaoxiaohe@hnu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Institute of Biology, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China. kmwang@hnu.edu.cn xiaoxiaohe@hnu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Institute of Biology, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China. kmwang@hnu.edu.cn xiaoxiaohe@hnu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Institute of Biology, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China. kmwang@hnu.edu.cn xiaoxiaohe@hnu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Institute of Biology, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China. kmwang@hnu.edu.cn xiaoxiaohe@hnu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Institute of Biology, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China. kmwang@hnu.edu.cn xiaoxiaohe@hnu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Institute of Biology, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China. kmwang@hnu.edu.cn xiaoxiaohe@hnu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Institute of Biology, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China. kmwang@hnu.edu.cn xiaoxiaohe@hnu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,"['0 (Alloys)', '0 (Coated Materials, Biocompatible)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)']",IM,"['*Alloys/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Coated Materials, Biocompatible/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Copper/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Gold/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy', 'Theranostic Nanomedicine/*methods']",,,2016/01/09 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/01/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c5nr07017a [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2016 Jan 28;8(4):2260-7. doi: 10.1039/c5nr07017a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of regulatory molecules activated in early embryonic development play a critical role in the maintenance of function of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Homeobox transcription factors are an important class of early embryonic developmental regulators determining hematopoietic development. However, the effect of homeobox protein Hox-B4 (HOXB4) ectopic expression on the development of hemangioblasts has not been fully addressed. This study aimed to investigate the role of Hoxb4a, an ortholog gene of HOXB4 in zebrafish, in the hematopoietic development in zebrafish. A transgenic zebrafish line was established with Cre-loxP system that stably overexpressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Hoxb4a protein under the control of hemangioblast-specific lmo2 promoter. Overexpression of Hoxb4a in the development of hemangioblasts resulted in a considerable increase in the number of stem cell leukemia (scl) and lmo2-positive primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells occurring in the posterior intermediate cell mass (ICM). Interestingly, Hoxb4a overexpression also disrupted the development of myelomonocytes in the anterior yolk sac and the posterior ICM, without affecting erythropoiesis in the posterior ICM. Taken together, these results indicate that Hoxb4a favours the development of hematopoietic progenitor cells originated from hemangioblasts in vivo.",['(c) 2015 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty

This study examines healthcare outcomes among elderly Medicare beneficiaries with CML who started nilotinib or dasatinib after imatinib. Research design and methods Patients were identified in the Medicare Research Identifiable Files (2006-2012) and had continuous Medicare Parts A, B, and D coverage. Main outcome measures Treatment patterns, overall survival (OS), monthly healthcare resource utilization and medical costs were measured from the second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) initiation (index date) to end of Medicare coverage. Results Despite similar adherence, dasatinib patients (N = 379) were more likely to start on the recommended dose (74% vs. 53%; p < 0.001), and to have dose reductions (21% vs. 11%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94; p = 0.002) or dose increases (9% vs. 7%; adjusted HR = 1.81; p = 0.048) than nilotinib patients (N = 280). Fewer nilotinib patients discontinued (59% vs. 67%; adjusted HR = 0.80; p = 0.026) or switched to another TKI (21% vs. 29%; adjusted HR = 0.72; p = 0.044) than dasatinib patients. Nilotinib patients had longer median OS (>4.9 years vs. 4.0 years; p = 0.032) and 37% lower mortality risk than dasatinib patients (adjusted HR = 0.63; p = 0.008). Nilotinib patients had 23% fewer inpatient admissions, 30% fewer emergency room visits, 13% fewer outpatient visits (all p < 0.05), and lower monthly medical costs (by $513, p = 0.024) than dasatinib patients. Limitations Lack of clinical assessment (disease phase and response to first-line therapy) and retrospective nature of study (unobservable potential confounding factors, non-randomized treatment choice). Conclusions In the current study of elderly CML patients, initiation of second-line TKIs frequently occurs at doses lower than the recommended starting doses and, despite this, many patients require dose adjustments. Here, nilotinib patients required fewer dose adjustments than dasatinib patients. Further research focusing on elderly CML patients is warranted in order to help define future best clinical practices.",,"['Smith, B Douglas', 'Liu, Jun', 'Latremouille-Viau, Dominick', 'Guerin, Annie', 'Fernandez, Daniel', 'Chen, Lei']","['Smith BD', 'Liu J', 'Latremouille-Viau D', 'Guerin A', 'Fernandez D', 'Chen L']","['a Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins , Baltimore , MD , USA ;', 'b Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , USA ;', 'c Analysis Group Inc. , Montreal, Quebec, Canada ;', 'c Analysis Group Inc. , Montreal, Quebec, Canada ;', 'b Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , USA ;', 'd Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , East Hanover , NJ , USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",,,2016/01/09 06:00,2017/09/05 06:00,['2016/01/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2016.1140030 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2016 May;32(5):817-27. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2016.1140030.

However, current diagnostic methods are of limitation in many aspects, such as detecting range, time-consuming, specificity and sensitivity. In this report, we apply our new-developing pathogen detection method to clarify that Propionibacterium acnes is the causative agent of a two-year-old boy with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia presenting clinical symptoms including serious rash and hyperpyrexia while traditional clinical methods of diagnosis fail to detect the pathogenic agent and multiple antimicrobial drugs are almost ineffective Propionibacterium acnes is confirmed to be the infectious agent by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. CASE PRESENTATION: After haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a two-year-old boy with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia presented to a pediatrist in a medical facility with hyperpyrexia and red skin rash which later changed to black skin rash all over his body. Traditional diagnostic assays were unrevealing, and several routine antimicrobial treatments were ineffective, including the vancomycin, meropenem, tobramycin, cefepime and rifampin. In this case, pediatrist resorted to the next-generation sequencing technology for uncovering potential pathogens so as to direct their use of specific drugs against pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, based on the BGISEQ100 (Ion Proton System) which performed sequencing-by-synthesis, with electrochemical detection of synthesis, and each such reaction coupled to its own sensor, which are in turn organized into a massively parallel sensor array on a complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor chip, we detect and identify the potential pathogens. As a result, we detected a significantly higher abundance of skin bacteria Propionibacterium acnes in patient's blood than controls. It had been reported that patients infected by Propionibacterium acnes almost always had history of immunodeficiency, trauma or surgery. Considering this possible cause, antimicrobial treatment was adjusted to target this rare opportunistic pathogen. Fever and black skin rashes were rapidly reduced after administrating specific drugs against Propionibacterium acnes. CONCLUSION: This case showed our new-developing pathogen detection method was a powerful tool in assisting clinical diagnosis and treatment. And it should be paid more attention to Propionibacterium acnes infection in clinical cases.",,"['Ye, Mingzhi', 'Wei, Wei', 'Yang, Zhikai', 'Li, Yingzhen', 'Cheng, Shaomin', 'Wang, Kang', 'Zhou, Tianliangwen', 'Sun, Jingmeng', 'Liu, Sha', 'Ni, Na', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Jiang, Hua']","['Ye M', 'Wei W', 'Yang Z', 'Li Y', 'Cheng S', 'Wang K', 'Zhou T', 'Sun J', 'Liu S', 'Ni N', 'Jiang H', 'Jiang H']","['BGI-Guangdong, BGI-Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 510006, China. yemzchina@163.com.', 'BGI-Guangzhou, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Cancer Trans-Omics Research, Guangzhou, China. yemzchina@163.com.', 'BGI-Guangdong, BGI-Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 510006, China. weiwei3@genomics.cn.', 'BGI-Guangdong, BGI-Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 510006, China. 568329311@qq.com.', 'BGI-Guangdong, BGI-Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 510006, China. liyingzhen@genomics.cn.', 'BGI-Guangdong, BGI-Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 510006, China. chengshaomin@genomics.cn.', 'BGI-Guangdong, BGI-Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 510006, China. wangkang1@genomics.cns.', 'BGI-Guangdong, BGI-Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 510006, China. 408915649@qq.com.', 'BGI-Guangdong, BGI-Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 510006, China. 840796596@qq.com.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Center, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou, 510000, China. 972930260@qq.com.', 'BGI-Guangdong, BGI-Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 510006, China. nina@genomics.cn.', 'BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China. jianghui@genomics.cn.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Center, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou, 510000, China. weimeitiantang1213@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', 'VJT6J7R4TR (Rifampin)']",IM,"['DNA, Bacterial', 'Fever', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*diagnosis/microbiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/*diagnosis/microbiology', '*Propionibacterium acnes', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rifampin', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",PMC4705617,,2016/01/09 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2016/01/09 06:00'],"['2015/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-015-1306-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-015-1306-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2016 Jan 8;16:5. doi: 10.1186/s12879-015-1306-0.,,,,20160108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first variant is represented by nodular aggregates of clonally expanded plasmacytoid dendritic cells found in lymph nodes, skin, and bone marrow ('Mature plasmacytoid dendritic cells proliferation associated with myeloid neoplasms'). This entity is rare, although likely underestimated in incidence, and affects predominantly males. Almost invariably, it is associated with a myeloid neoplasm such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or other myeloid proliferations with monocytic differentiation. The concurrent myeloid neoplasm dominates the clinical pictures and guides treatment. The prognosis is usually dismal, but reflects the evolution of the associated myeloid leukemia rather than progressive expansion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. A second form of plasmacytoid dendritic cells tumor has been recently reported and described as 'blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm'. In this tumor, which is characterized by a distinctive cutaneous and bone marrow tropism, proliferating cells derive from immediate CD4(+)CD56(+) precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The diagnosis of this form can be easily accomplished by immunohistochemistry, using a panel of plasmacytoid dendritic cells markers. The clinical course of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is characterized by a rapid progression to systemic disease via hematogenous dissemination. The genomic landscape of this entity is currently under intense investigation.

Fresh peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) aliquots from 238 G-CSF-mobilized allografts were extensively characterized by immunophenotype. Subset-specific transplanted cells were correlated with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), malignant disease relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and overall survival. Of 238 assessable alloHCT recipients, 185 patients (78%) received reduced-intensity conditioning and 152 (64%) antithymocyte globulin-based serotherapy. Incidences of aGVHD and cGVHD were 58% and 48%, respectively. Median follow-up was 21 months (range, 1.4 to 41.1). In multivariable analyses adjusted for relevant clinical factors, allograft activated natural killer (NK) cells (CD56(+)CD16(+)CD69(+)CD158b(+)) were associated with a significantly lower risk of aGVHD (P = .0016; HR, .51; 95% confidence interval, .33 to .78), whereas late-activated HLA-DR(+) CD3(+) cells were associated with significantly higher aGVHD (P < .0005; HR, 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.55 to 3.43). In a subgroup of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), receipt of an allograft from an older donor (>/=40 years) was associated with a higher incidence of relapse (P = .0042; HR, 2.99); allograft content of early activated CD3(+) cells (CD3(+)CD69(+); P = .0024; HR, .4) and NKT cells (CD3(+)CD56(+); P = .0006; HR, .54) were associated with a lower incidence of relapse. Presence of HLA-Bw4-80Ile(+) genotype was associated with lower relapse incidence. In conclusion, activated NK cells within PBSC allografts associate with lower aGVHD risk, whereas HLA-DR(+) T cells associate with higher aGVHD and cGVHD risk. NKT cells and early activated T cells are associated with lower relapse risk in AML and MDS patients. These findings may have implications in therapeutic targeting of select populations in the allograft to minimize incidence of GVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Causative mutations are found in DNA mismatch repair genes PMS2, MSH6, MSH2 or MLH1 that are well known in the context of Lynch syndrome. CMMRD follows an autosomal recessive inheritance trait and is characterized by childhood brain tumors and hematological malignancies as well as gastrointestinal cancer in the second and third decades of life. There is a high risk of multiple cancers, occurring synchronously and metachronously. In general, the prognosis is poor. About one third of CMMRD patients develop hematological malignancies as primary (sometimes the only) malignancy or as secondary neoplasm. T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, mainly of mediastinal origin, are the most frequent hematological malignancies. Besides malignant diseases, non-neoplastic features are frequently observed, e.g. cafe-au-lait spots sometimes resembling neurofibromatosis type I, hypopigmented skin lesions, numerous adenomatous polyps, multiple pilomatricomas, or impaired immunoglobulin class switch recombination. Within the present review, we summarize previously published CMMRD patients with at least one hematological malignancy, provide an overview of steps necessary to substantiate the diagnosis of CMMRD, and refer to the recent most relevant literature.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The cancer death rate has dropped by 23% since 1991, translating to more than 1.7 million deaths averted through 2012. Despite this progress, death rates are increasing for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and uterine corpus, and cancer is now the leading cause of death in 21 states, primarily due to exceptionally large reductions in death from heart disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of adult stem cell transplant recipients who received CBI for de novo hemorrhagic cystitis as inpatients on the bone marrow transplant service at Washington University from 2011-2013. Patients who had a history of genitourinary malignancy and/or recent surgical urologic intervention were excluded. Multiple variables were examined for association with death. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients met our inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 48 years (23-65). Common malignancies included acute myelogenous leukemia (17/33, 57%), acute lymphocytic leukemia (3/33, 10%), and peripheral T cell lymphoma (3/33, 10%). Median time from stem cell transplant to need for CBI was 2.5 months (0 days-6.6 years). All patients had previously undergone chemotherapy (33/33, 100%) and 14 had undergone prior radiation therapy (14/33, 42%). Twenty-eight patients had an infectious disease (28/33, 85%), most commonly BK viremia (19/33, 58%), cytomegalovirus viremia (17/33, 51%), and bacterial urinary tract infection (8/33, 24%). Twenty-two patients expired during the same admission as CBI treatment (22/33 or 67% of total patients, 22/28 or 79% of deaths), with a 30-day mortality of 52% and a 90-day mortality of 73% from the start of CBI. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic cystitis requiring CBI is a symptom of severe systemic disease in stem cell transplant patients. The need for CBI administration may be a marker for mortality risk from a variety of systemic insults, rather than directly attributable to the hematuria.",,"['Raup, Valary T', 'Potretzke, Aaron M', 'Manley, Brandon J', 'Brockman, John A', 'Bhayani, Sam B']","['Raup VT', 'Potretzke AM', 'Manley BJ', 'Brockman JA', 'Bhayani SB']","['Division of Urology, Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Division of Urology, Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Division of Urology, Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Division of Urology, Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Division of Urology, Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Brazil,Int Braz J Urol,International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,101158091,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Cystitis/etiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', 'Hematuria/etiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Therapeutic Irrigation/methods', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4756938,,2016/01/09 06:00,2016/05/26 06:00,['2016/01/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['IBJUv41n6a14 [pii]', '10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2014.0655 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Braz J Urol. 2015 Nov-Dec;41(6):1126-31. doi: 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2014.0655.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CXCR4/SDF-1 axis is a potential therapeutic target in AML to reduce the enhanced survival and proliferation of leukemic cells, with current drug development efforts focusing on antagonists and blocking antibodies. The RNAi technology mediated by siRNA is a promising alternative; however, further development of clinically relevant siRNA carriers is needed since siRNA on its own is an incompetent silencing agent. Here, we report on lipid-substituted polymeric carriers for siRNA delivery to AML cells, specifically targeting CXCR4. Our results demonstrate an effective suppression of CXCR4 protein with the polymeric siRNA delivery in AML THP-1 cells. The suppression of CXCR4 as well as its ligand, SDF-1 (CXCL12), decreased THP-1 cell numbers due to reduced cell proliferation. The reduced proliferation was also observed in the presence of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC), suggesting that our approach would be effective in the protective bone marrow microenvironment. The combination of CXCR4 silencing and cytarabine treatment resulted in more effective cytotoxicity when the cells were co-incubated with hBMSC. We observed a decrease in the toxicity of the lipopolymer/siRNA complexes when THP-1 cells were treated in the presence of hBMSC but this effect did not negatively affect CXCR4 silencing. In addition, siRNA delivery to mononuclear cells derived from AML patients led to significant CXCR4 silencing in 2 out of 5 samples, providing a proof-of-concept for clinical translation. We conclude that decreasing CXCR4 expression via lipopolymer/siRNA complexes is a promising option for AML therapy and could provide an effective alternative to current CXCR4 inhibition strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Increased apoptosis and aberrantly functioning progenitors are thought to contribute to this phenotype. As is the case for other malignancies, overcoming apoptosis is believed to be important in progression toward acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using the NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) transgenic mouse model of MDS, we previously reported that overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, blocked apoptosis and improved cytopenias, paradoxically, delaying leukemic progression. To further understand this surprising result, we examined the role of p53 and its pro-apoptotic effectors, PUMA and NOXA in NHD13 mice. The absence of p53 or PUMA but not NOXA reduced apoptosis and expanded the numbers of MDS-repopulating cells. Despite a similar effect on apoptosis and cell numbers, the absence of p53 and PUMA had diametrically opposed effects on progression to AML: absence of p53 accelerated leukemic progression, while absence of PUMA significantly delayed progression. This may be explained in part by differences in cellular responses to DNA damage. The absence of p53 led to higher levels of gamma-H2AX (indicative of persistent DNA lesions) while PUMA-deficient NHD13 progenitors resolved DNA lesions in a manner comparable to wild-type cells. These results suggest that targeting PUMA may improve the cytopenias of MDS without a detrimental effect on leukemic progression thus warranting further investigation.",,"['Guirguis, A A', 'Slape, C I', 'Failla, L M', 'Saw, J', 'Tremblay, C S', 'Powell, D R', 'Rossello, F', 'Wei, A', 'Strasser, A', 'Curtis, D J']","['Guirguis AA', 'Slape CI', 'Failla LM', 'Saw J', 'Tremblay CS', 'Powell DR', 'Rossello F', 'Wei A', 'Strasser A', 'Curtis DJ']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Bone Marrow Research Laboratories, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Bioinformatics Platform, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Biomedical and Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI), Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-HOXD13 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA Damage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4987724,,2016/01/09 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/01/09 06:00'],"['2015/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2015159 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2015.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2016 Jun;23(6):1049-59. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2015.159.

Actinomycetes are known for L-asparaginase activity. In the current study, 80 actinomycetes were isolated from various soil habitats by serial dilution technique. Presence of L-asparaginase was investigated in a total of 240 actinomycetes by tubed agar method using modified M-9 medium. A total of 165 actinomycetes were found positive for L-asparaginase activity. Among these, 57 actinomycetes producing larger zones of L-asparagine hydrolysis were further screened for their capacity to produce glutaminase-free L-asparaginase. Four L-glutaminase-free actinomycetes were found to be potential L-asparaginase producers. These actinomycetes were identified as Streptomyces cyaneus (SAP 1287, CFS 1560), S. exfoliates (CFS 1557) and S. phaeochromogenes (GS 1573) on the basis of morphological and biochemical identification studies. Maximum L-asparaginase activity (19.2 Uml(-1)) was observed in culture filtrate of S. phaeochromogenes under submerged fermentation.

In this study, we reported our experience with LD-AraC in patients >/= 70 years old and compared the results to those of intensive chemotherapy, best supportive care (BSC), or hypomethylating agents in the same age population. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2014, 60 patients received LD-AraC at 20 mg once or twice daily by subcutaneous injection for 10 consecutive days every 4-6 weeks. RESULTS: Complete remission rate with LD-AraC was 7% versus 56% with intensive chemotherapy and 21% with hypomethylating agents. Median overall survival (OS) of patients treated with LD-AraC was 9.6 months with 3-year OS of 12%. Survival with LD-AraC was better than with BSC only (P = 0.001). Although not statistically significant, intensive chemotherapy and hypomethylating agents tended to be better than LD-AraC in terms of OS (median: 12.4 months and 16.1 months, respectively). There was no clear evidence that a beneficial effect of LD-AraC was restricted to any particular subtype of patients, except for cytogenetics. There was a trend for a better OS in LD-AraC treated patients in the setting of clinical trials as compared with those treated outside of a clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a trend in favor of intensive chemotherapy and hypomethylating agents over LD-AraC, no real significant advantage could be demonstrated, while LD-AraC showed a significant advantage comparatively to BSC.

Wilms' tumor -1 gene is a novel prognostic factor, minimal residual disease marker and therapeutic target in acute leukemia. AIM OF THE WORK: The aim of this work was to study the impact of WT-1 gene expression in the prognosis of ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 40 Egyptian children with newly diagnosed ALL who were subjected to full history taking, thorough clinical examination and laboratory investigations including; complete blood count, LDH, BM aspiration, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, FISH technique for detection of t(12;21) and t(9;22) and assessment of WT-1 Gene by real-time PCR in BM samples at time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Positive WT-1 gene expression was found in 22 cases (55%) and negative expression in 18 cases (45%). Positive WT-1 gene expression group (n=22) includes 14 males and 8 females with mean age at presentation of 5.261 +/- 0.811 while negative WT-1 gene expression group (n=18) includes 12 males and 6 females with mean age at diagnosis of 9.669 +/- 3.731 with significantly older age in negative WT-1 gene expression group but no significant differences between positive and negative WT-1 gene expression groups regarding sex and clinical presentations. There were no significant differences in platelets and WBCs counts, hemoglobin and LDH levels and the number of peripheral blood and BM blast cells at diagnosis between positive and negative WT-1 gene expression groups but after induction therapy there were significantly lower BM blast cells in positive WT-1 gene expression group. There were no statistically significant differences between positive and negative WT-1 gene expression groups regarding immunophenotyping and chromosomal translocations including t(12;21) and t(9;22). There were a significantly higher relapse and death rate and a lower rate of CR, DFS, and OAS in negative WT-1 gene expression group. MRD at end of induction therapy was found in 14 cases out of 40 patients. There were significantly higher number of patients with MRD+ in negative WT-1 gene expression group (After the therapy 20 out of 22 (89%) patients with positive WT-1 gene expression attained a negative MRD, while only 6 out of 18 (33%) with negative WT-1 attained a negative MRD) (p-value = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION: WT-1 gene expression is an important prognostic factor in patients with ALL, being able to prognosticate a negative MRD.

Array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can detect submicroscopic copy number changes, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and uniparental disomy (UPD) regions. The purpose of this study was detection of the size of del(13)(q14) deletion in our group of patients, comparing the size of the monoallelic and biallelic deletions, detection of LOH and UPD regions. RESULTS: We have investigated 40 CLL/SLL patients by karyotype, FISH and CGH and SNP array. Mutational status was of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IGVH) was also examined. The size of deletion ranged from 348,12 Kb to 38.97 Mb. Detected minimal deleted region comprised genes: TRIM13, miR-3613, KCNRG, DLEU2, miR-16-1, miR-15a, DLEU1. The RB1 deletions were detected in 41 % of cases. The average size in monoallelic 13q14 deletion group was 7,2 Mb while in biallelic group was 4,8 Mb. In two cases 13q14 deletions were located in the bigger UPD regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that bigger deletion including RB1 or presence of biallelic 13q14 deletion is not sufficient to be considered as adverse prognostic factor in CLL/SLL.

Here we report a small molecule inhibitor (Cbz-B3A) of mTORC1 signaling. Cbz-B3A inhibits the phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and blocks 68% of translation. In contrast, rapamycin preferentially inhibits the phosphorylation of p70(S6k) and blocks 35% of translation. Cbz-B3A does not appear to bind directly to mTORC1, but instead binds to ubiquilins 1, 2, and 4. Knockdown of ubiquilin 2, but not ubiquilins 1 and 4, decreases the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, suggesting that ubiquilin 2 activates mTORC1. The knockdown of ubiquilins 2 and 4 decreases the effect of Cbz-B3A on 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Cbz-B3A slows cellular growth of some human leukemia cell lines, but is not cytotoxic. Thus Cbz-B3A exemplifies a novel strategy to inhibit mTORC1 signaling that might be exploited for treating many human diseases. We propose that Cbz-B3A reveals a previously unappreciated regulatory pathway coordinating cytosolic protein quality control and mTORC1 signaling.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Coffey, Rory T', 'Shi, Yuntao', 'Long, Marcus J C', 'Marr, Michael T 2nd', 'Hedstrom, Lizbeth']","['Coffey RT', 'Shi Y', 'Long MJ', 'Marr MT 2nd', 'Hedstrom L']","['From the Graduate Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, MS008.', 'the Graduate Program in Chemistry, MS015.', 'the Graduate Program in Biochemistry and Biophysics, MS009.', 'the Department of Biology, MS009 and Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, MS029, and.', 'the Department of Biology, MS009 and the Department of Chemistry, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02453-9110 hedstrom@brandeis.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM100921/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007122/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5 RO1 GM100921/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 GM007122/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Cbz-B3A)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Arginine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Carbamates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4777855,,2016/01/08 06:00,2016/08/10 06:00,['2016/01/08 06:00'],"['2015/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)43159-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.691584 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Mar 4;291(10):5221-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.691584.

Empiric fixed-dose-escalation strategies in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients have failed to achieve target MPA exposure. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of a pharmacokinetics-based dosing approach using a novel continuous infusion (CI) method of administration of MMF in pediatric HCT recipients. All patients received a myeloablative conditioning with cyclosporine A and MMF for GVHD prophylaxis. MMF was initiated on day 0 at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 8 hours. Based on steady-state pharmacokinetics, MMF was converted to CI to target a total MPA AUC(0-24) of 40 to 80 mug.hour/mL. The MMF dose was adjusted to maintain a total MPA steady-state concentration (Css) of 1.7 to 3.3 mug/mL. During the CI schedule, MPA AUC(0-24) was maintained at a mean of 40.1 mug.hour/mL (range, 20.6 to 63.8), and 17 of 19 patients (89%) achieved MPA Css within target of 1.7 to 3.3 mug/mL. Eighteen of 19 patients (95%) achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 13 days (range, 8 to 41) post-transplant and platelet engraftment at 39 days (range, 17 to 298) days post-transplant. Six of 18 assessable patients (33%) developed stages II to IV acute GVHD and 2 of 15 (13%) developed chronic GVHD. The MMF dose was reduced in 9 patients due to gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 6), low blood counts (n = 4), and viral infection (n = 3). Five patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapsed, of whom 4 have died. Fifteen of 19 patients are alive with a median follow-up of 2.4 years (range, .4 to 4.9), with 3-year event-free and overall survival rates of 68% and 79%, respectively. In this pilot study of pharmacokinetically directed MMF dosing, we observed no toxic deaths, excellent engraftment, and low rates of grades III to IV acute and chronic GVHD. We found significantly lower half-life and higher drug clearance in pediatric HCT recipients compared with stable pediatric renal transplant patients or adult transplant patients. This regimen deserves further validation in a larger cohort of pediatric patients undergoing myeloablative transplantation.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, with increasing tumor grade, tumors themselves express NKG2D to self-stimulate oncogenic pathways. To confirm that cancer cells themselves express NKG2D, we have now investigated the role of the tumoral NKG2D in NK cell-mediated immune surveillance. Both anti-NKG2D and shRNA to that down-regulated tumoral NKG2D increased the number of cells in G1 phase and S phase, increased the expression of cyclin E-CDK2 and decreased P21. In addition, CD107a, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha increased when the cells were treated with anti-NKG2D which suggests that blocking tumoral NKG2D could augment tumor surveillance of NK cells.

Dogs also develop B-CLL, but there is no systematic description of the disease in dogs. Understanding the epidemiology of B-CLL in dogs may help practitioners recognize the disease and position the dog as a model for future genetic studies. OBJECTIVES: To describe B-CLL presentation in dogs, its clinicopathologic findings, and breed predisposition. ANIMALS: Four hundred and ninety-one dogs with B-CLL and 5,673 control dogs with suspicion of a lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD). METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional study of dogs for which samples were submitted to the Colorado State University Clinical Immunology Laboratory for immunophenotyping between 2010 and 2014. To assess breed predilection, dogs with B-CLL were compared to those with suspicion of other LPDs using logistic regression. RESULTS: The median age was 11 years with no sex predilection. Half of the dogs presented with peripheral lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly and 26% had anemia. Eleven small-breed dogs had significantly increased odds of B-CLL. In addition, English Bulldogs had an increased risk and a unique presentation: these dogs were diagnosed at a median of 6 years and expressed lower class II MHC and CD25. CONCLUSIONS: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is overrepresented in small-breed dogs. Future genetic studies of these breeds may identify genetic risk factors. The unique presentation of English Bulldogs provides evidence of multiple forms of this disease. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether presenting signs are associated with survival.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Furthermore, both proteins can efficiently stabilize the mRNA of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(CIP1). Since acute myeloid leukemia (AML) differentiation requires cell cycle arrest and RBM38 as well as DND1 have antiproliferative functions, we hypothesized that decreased RBM38 and DND1 expression may contribute to the differentiation block seen in this disease. We first quantified RBM38 and DND1 mRNA expression in clinical AML patient samples and CD34(+) progenitor cells and mature granulocytes from healthy donors. We found significantly lower RBM38 and DND1 mRNA levels in AML blasts and CD34(+) progenitor cells as compared to mature neutrophils from healthy donors. Furthermore, the lowest expression of both RBM38 and DND1 mRNA correlated with t(8;21). In addition, neutrophil differentiation of CD34(+) cells in vitro with G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) resulted in a significant increase of RBM38 and DND1 mRNA levels. Similarly, neutrophil differentiation of NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells was associated with a significant induction of RBM38 and DND1 expression. To address the function of RBM38 and DND1 in neutrophil differentiation, we generated two independent NB4RBM38 as well as DND1 knockdown cell lines. Inhibition of both RBM38 and DND1 mRNA significantly attenuated NB4 differentiation and resulted in decreased p21(CIP1) mRNA expression. Our results clearly indicate that expression of the RNA binding proteins RBM38 and DND1 is repressed in primary AML patients, that neutrophil differentiation is dependent on increased expression of both proteins, and that these proteins have a critical role in regulating p21(CIP1) expression during APL differentiation.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, relapse rates after HSCT in complete remission (CR) are reported between 30% and 70%. In addition, numerous studies suggested that secondary viral infection from a variety of viruses including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus (Adv), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are among the most common causes of death post-HSCT. Currently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based T cells have been developed to treat AML in clinical studies, while virus-specific cytotoxic T cells (VST) have been proven to be able to effectively prevent or treat viral infection after HSCT. Thus it would be desirable to develop T cells with the ability of simultaneously targeting AML relapse and viral infection. In this article, we now describe the generation of VST cells that are engineered to express CAR for a specific AML cell-surface antigen CD123 (CD123-CAR-VST). Using Dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with EBV, Adv, and CMV peptides as sources of viral antigens, we generated VST from A2 donor peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC). VST were then transduced with retroviral vector encoding CD123-CAR to generate CD123-CAR-VST. We demonstrated that CD123-CAR-VST recognized EBV, Adv, and CMV epitopes and had HLA-restricted virus-specific cytotoxic effector function against EBV target. In addition, CD123-CAR-VST retained the specificity against CD123-positive AML cell lines such as MOLM13 and THP-1 in vitro. Thus our results suggested that CD123-CAR-VST might be a valuable candidate to simultaneously prevent or treat relapse and viral infection in AML HSCT recipients.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their function remains largely elusive. Here, we show that Nup98-HoxA9, a fusion between Nup98 and the homeobox transcription factor HoxA9, forms nuclear aggregates that frequently associate with facultative heterochromatin. We demonstrate that stable expression of Nup98-HoxA9 in mouse embryonic stem cells selectively induces the expression of Hox cluster genes. Genome-wide binding site analysis revealed that Nup98-HoxA9 is preferentially targeted and accumulated at Hox cluster regions where the export factor Crm1 is originally prebound. In addition, leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1, disassembled nuclear Nup98-HoxA9 dots, resulting in the loss of chromatin binding of Nup98-HoxA9 and Nup98-HoxA9-mediated activation of Hox genes. Collectively, our results indicate that highly selective targeting of Nup98-fusion proteins to Hox cluster regions via prebound Crm1 induces the formation of higher order chromatin structures that causes aberrant Hox gene regulation.",,"['Oka, Masahiro', 'Mura, Sonoko', 'Yamada, Kohji', 'Sangel, Percival', 'Hirata, Saki', 'Maehara, Kazumitsu', 'Kawakami, Koichi', 'Tachibana, Taro', 'Ohkawa, Yasuyuki', 'Kimura, Hiroshi', 'Yoneda, Yoshihiro']","['Oka M', 'Mura S', 'Yamada K', 'Sangel P', 'Hirata S', 'Maehara K', 'Kawakami K', 'Tachibana T', 'Ohkawa Y', 'Kimura H', 'Yoneda Y']","['Laboratory of Nuclear Transport Dynamics, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biomedical Innovation, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Nuclear Transport Dynamics, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Nuclear Transport Dynamics, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Osaka City University, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Bioscience and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biomedical Innovation, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism']",PMC4718815,,2016/01/08 06:00,2016/10/13 06:00,['2016/01/08 06:00'],"['2015/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7554/eLife.09540 [doi]'],epublish,Elife. 2016 Jan 7;5:e09540. doi: 10.7554/eLife.09540.,,,,20160107,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0854-083X'],['NOTNLM'],"['Chromatin', 'Crm1', 'Hox', 'Leukemia', 'Nucleoporin', 'Nup98', 'cell biology', 'chromosomes', 'genes', 'human', 'mouse']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease affects quality of life (QOL) and poses an economic burden on patients, payers, and society. The objective of this review was to quantify the economic burden and quality-of-life effects and identify the gaps that should be addressed by future research. METHODS: Free-text and subject heading searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Database, and the Web of Science Core Collection database were conducted to identify observational and interventional studies reporting costs and/or quality-of-life effects published up to 2 October 2015. Studies were included irrespective of whether they were conducted prospectively or retrospectively. The focus population consisted of adult patients aged 18 years or older affected by any stage of CLL. Studies were included regardless of whether the underlying population was treated at baseline or not. Risk of bias was assessed using a quality checklist developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project for (randomized) controlled trials, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies. Economic evaluations were rated using a checklist developed by Stuhldreher et al. (Int J Eat Disord 45:476-91, 2012). RESULTS: From 2451 records identified, 27 studies were found to be eligible for inclusion. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to methodology, perspective, and data used. Annual direct costs per person ranged from US$4491 in Germany to US$43,913 in the USA. The share of costs attributable to drug treatment varied between 26.2 and 79 %. Indirect costs amounted to US$4208. Severity of disease was a predictor for quality of life, whereas differences by age and sex were mainly present in subdomains. Comparisons of treated and untreated populations resulted in an increase of quality of life in favor of treated populations in the long-term perspective. Differences between treatments were small. Consequently, cost effectiveness in decision-analytic models did not depend on whether quality of life or survival are used to describe the benefits of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although the quantity and the quality of health economic and quality-of-life evidence have substantially increased, there is still a need for studies that take a patient or societal perspective. Factors that influence costs and the quality of life of patients seem to be well-established, while longitudinal lifetime cost studies at the population level are still scarce.",,"['Frey, Simon', 'Blankart, Carl R', 'Stargardt, Tom']","['Frey S', 'Blankart CR', 'Stargardt T']","['Hamburg Center for Health Economics, Universitat Hamburg, Esplanade 36, 20354, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Hamburg Center for Health Economics, Universitat Hamburg, Esplanade 36, 20354, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research, School of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Hamburg Center for Health Economics, Universitat Hamburg, Esplanade 36, 20354, Hamburg, Germany. tom.stargardt@wiso.uni-hamburg.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,,"['*Cost of Illness', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*economics/psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years']",,,2016/01/08 06:00,2017/01/26 06:00,['2016/01/08 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40273-015-0367-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s40273-015-0367-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2016 May;34(5):479-98. doi: 10.1007/s40273-015-0367-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
