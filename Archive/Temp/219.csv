The target-derived molecules that induce, these changes have not been identified. Neuropoietic cytokines, including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), induce the same phenotypic changes in sympathetic neurons in vitro as sweat glands and periosteum do in vivo, raising the possibility that one of these factors mediates induction of cholinergic traits and VIP by these target tissues. Because CNTF and LIF have overlapping functions and signalling pathways, they could act interchangeably or in concert to influence neurotransmitter expression. To determine whether CNTF or CNTF and LIF together are responsible for the induction of cholinergic and peptidergic function in vivo, we analyzed the neurotransmitter properties of sweat gland innervation in mice lacking CNTF or CNTF and LIF. We find that, as in wild-type mice, gland innervation in mice lacking one or both molecules appropriately expresses cholinergic properties and VIP immunoreactivity. Furthermore, footpads of mice lacking one or both genes contain choline acetyltransferase activity comparable to that of wild-type mice, and CNTF- or CNTF/LIF-deficient mice possess the normal complement of active sweat glands. We analyzed the innervation of a second, recently identified cholinergic sympathetic target, the periosteum, which is the connective tissue surrounding bone. Periosteal innervation of mice lacking CNTF, LIF, or both, like that of wild-type mice, is immunoreactive for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, a recently identified cholinergic marker, and VIP. These results provide evidence that neither CNTF, LIF, nor a combination of the two are required for the developmental change from noradrenergic to cholinergic function that occurs in sympathetic innervation of sweat glands and periosteum.","['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)']",['NS023678/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The ability of AS-101 to potentiate the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and augment cytokine production in vivo has led to clinical trials on AS-101 which are currently being carried out in cancer patients. In the present study we show that AS-101 selectively augments the release of TNF alpha and IL-1 alpha and inhibits the release of IL-10 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages and human monocytes. It does not significantly affect the release of IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). By itself AS-101 does not induce the release of any of these cytokines. Analysis of IL-10 and TNF alpha RNA levels using semiquantitative PCR reveals that AS-101 blocks the transcription of IL-10 mRNA, but does not significantly affect TNF alpha mRNA. Although both AS-101 and interferon (IFN)-gamma inhibit IL-10, AS-101, unlike IFN-gamma, does not prime macrophages for LPS-induced nitric oxide release and does not appear to significantly affect monocyte HLA-DR expression.

Moreover, recent genetic research has shown mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene and GR protein which are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of leukaemia, hereditary glucocorticoid resistance and Nelson's syndrome.

In most cases these receptors share common signal transducing receptor components in the same family, which explains the functional redundancy of haematopoietic cytokines. Interleukin-6 and related cytokines, interleukin-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1, are all pleiotrophic, from the haematopoietic to the nervous system, and exhibit overlapping biological activities. Receptors for these cytokines fall into the class I cytokine receptor family. Functional receptor complexes for the interleukin-6 family of cytokines share a membrane glycoprotein 130 (gp130) as a critical component for signal transduction. In these receptor complexes, gp130 and ligand-specific chains possess no intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain but are associated with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Ligand stimulation triggers homo- or heterodimerization of gp130, leading to activation of the associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and subsequent modification of transcription factors.

The pipecolinate derivative VX-710 has previously been demonstrated to reverse MDR1-mediated multidrug resistance at concentrations of 0.5-2.5 microM by direct interaction with P-glycoprotein and inhibition of its drug efflux activity. In this study we investigated whether VX-710 as well as four other known MDR1 modulators could also reverse multidrug resistance mediated by MRP. VX-710 at 0.5-5 microM restored senstivity of MRP-expressing HL60/ADR promyelocytic leukemia cells to the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin, etoposide and vincristine. VX-710 was approximately 2-fold more effective than verapamil, MS-209 and CsA in modulating MRP-mediated multidrug resistance, whereas GF120918 had no significant effect. VX-710 was also more effective than verapamil, MS-209 and CsA in restoring the daunorubicin accumulation deficit in HL60/ADR cells and in increasing calcein uptake. A photoaffinity analog of VX-710, [3H]VF-13,159, specifically photo labeled the MRP protein and unlabeled VX-710 inhibited this binding in a concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest that VX-710 is not only a potent modulator of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance, but also affects multidrug resistance in MRP-expressing cells and may exert its action, at least in part, by binding directly to MRP.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Acridines)', '0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '0 (VF 13,159)', '0BJK6B565B (dofequidar)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '3KG76X4KJK (biricodar)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'N488540F94 (Elacridar)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

VX-710 at 0.5-5 microM restored sensitivity of a variety of multidrug resistant cells to the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide or paclitaxel, including drug-selected human myeloma and epithelial carcinoma cells, and human MDR1 cDNA-transfected mouse leukemia and fibroblast cells. Uptake experiments showed that VX-710 at 0.5-2.5 microM fully restored intracellular accumulation of [14C]doxorubicin in multidrug resistant cells, suggesting that VX-710 inhibits the drug efflux activity of P-glycoprotein. VX-710 effectively inhibited photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein by [3H]azidopine or [125I]iodoaryl azidoprazosin with EC50 values of 0.75 and 0.55 microM.

We have also studied the relationship between the concentrations of MTX and 7-OHMTX in saliva and the unbound concentrations in plasma. Twelve patients (36 infusions) were studied during treatment with high-dose MTX as remission consolidation therapy (5-8 g/m2 by 24 h i.v. infusion followed by leucovorin rescue). Plasma and saliva concentrations of MTX and 7-OHMTX were determined concomitantly by HPLC at 20 h and at various times following infusion. Unbound plasma concentrations of MTX and 7-OHMTX were determined after ultrafiltration. Oral toxicity was graded according to the WHO criteria (grade 0-4). The concentrations of MTX and 7-OHMTX in saliva were not directly related to the development of mucositis. In patients with oral mucositis (WHO grade 1 or greater), the ratio to 7-OHMTX and MTX in saliva at 20 h was significantly lower than in patients without symptoms (p = 0.014, Mann Whitney rank sum test), but not at 42 and 66 h after starting the infusion. The salivary concentration of 7-OHMTX at 20 h ranged from undetectable (less than 1 nmol/l) to 1.6 micromol/l. No significant correlation was found between the unbound and total plasma concentrations of MTX and 7-OHMTX and the drug concentrations in saliva at different points in time. The concentrations of 7-OHMTX in saliva were 11, 23 and 13% of the unbound plasma concentrations at 20, 42 and 66 h, respectively, after starting the infusion. The respective median corresponding values for MTX were 1.6, 16.1 and 61.6%. The results suggest that determinations of saliva concentrations of MTX and 7-OHMTX may predict oral mucositis. This opens up the possibility of early identification of patients at high risk of developing oral mucositis in order to intensify topical or systemic treatment of these patients.","['X019Z9S1DL (7-hydroxymethotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

A cDNA isolated from a mouse embryo library was 89% identical to FGFR-3 in both its coding and 3' untranslated regions. However, the region homologous to exons 5 to 9 of FGFR-3 was missing. In addition, the ORF was interrupted by several stop codons and frame shifts, indicating that this sequence is not functional. These transcripts were therefore copied from a novel FGFR-3 pseudogene, that we called psiFGFR-3. Partial analysis of this gene showed the absence of introns, which is a characteristic feature of a processed pseudogene. psiFGFR-3 gene was localized on Chromosome 1H4-6. Its transcription was shown to be antisense and its expression was restricted to fetal tissues. These results indicate that psiFGFR-3 has been inserted in Chromosome 1 in antisense orientation close to a heterologous promoter.","['0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Fgfr3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3)']",,['GENBANK/U52463'],,,,,,,,,

Purified epithelial and stromal cells were prepared from luteal-phase endometrium. Specific receptors were demonstrated by binding of 125I-ET-1 and proliferative effects of ET-1 and/or other growth factors determined by uptake of [3H]thymidine by cells in serum-free culture. 125I-ET-1 bound to both epithelial (2516 +/- 820 c.p.m./well) and stromal (6368 +/- 1350 c.p.m./well) cells and was displaced by ET-1 (1 mumol l-1). There were no proliferative effects of ET on epithelial cells. ET-1 (10 nmol l-1) stimulated uptake of [3H]thymidine by stromal cells under serum-free conditions in 13/20 individual cell preparations, to 149 +/- 13% of control (untreated = 100%) with dose-dependence between the range of 1 to 100 nmol l-1. Stimulation by fetal calf serum was to 377 +/- 126% of control. The effects on proliferation by other growth factors (dose; % of control +/- S.E.M., number of positive/total number of cell preparations) were: IGF-I (13 nmol l-1; 182 +/- 14, 4/4), epidermal growth factor (EGF; 4.8 nmol l-1; 132 +/- 5%, 7/7), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (0.4 nmol l-1; 146 +/- 3, 2/2) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (0.4 nmol 1-1; 110 +/- 2, 3/3). All stimulations except that of EGF were significant and dose-responsive but only insulin was additive with ET (350 +/- 35, 5/5). ET-1 also stimulated expression of the the AP-1 cis element c-jun, this being maximal at 60 min of exposure to mitogen.

The addition of L-arginine completely restored the growth of T lymphoblastoid cells that had been inhibited by arginine deiminase. The addition of L-ornithine also partially restored it. This enzyme suppressed interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and IL-2 receptor expression in T cells stimulated by non-specific mitogens. The morphologic features of dying cells and DNA fragmentation indicated that arginine deiminase induced apoptotic cell death in T lymphoblasts. Cell cycle analysis revealed that G1-->S transition was blocked in cell treated with arginine deiminase, accompanied by the increase of apoptotic nuclei in the sub-G1 fraction. In conclusion, the deletion of the essential nutrient L-arginine by arginine deiminase significantly inhibited cell growth and activation in T lymphoblasts, accompanied by the induction of apoptotic cell death.","['EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.3.6 (arginine deiminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,

A number of studies, most of them serologic, have attempted to demonstrate human infection with these viruses. The lack of antibodies in apparently exposed groups of persons suggests an absence of infection. However, another possible explanation is that humans may be immunologically unresponsive to infection with these viruses. Although attempts to infect normal human cells in vitro with many of these viruses have not been reported, BLV and BIV appear to grow poorly or not at all. On the other hand, ALSV subgroup D infect and transform human cells in vitro. However, the production of infectious virus in vitro has been low or nonexistent. This may explain the absence of antibodies in human populations. Furthermore, many of the methods used to detect infection, either directly or indirectly, have either low sensitivity or problems with specificity. Several epidemiologic studies have tried to show a relationship between human and animal leukemia or lymphoma. In many of these studies the actual exposure to retroviruses is unknown and exposure to animals may merely represent exposure to other risk factors that are more important but were either not considered or are undefined; alternatively, a common exposure may be responsible for malignancy in humans and animals with no interspecies relationship. Based on the reported studies, these viruses appear unlikely to be responsible for any significant occurrence of human disease, particularly lymphoid malignancies. Although a definitive statement of no risk to human health is probably unwarranted, the evidence to date indicates that the risk is low and perhaps nonexistent. Thus, no specific public health recommendations regarding retrovirus-infected animals or poultry are warranted at this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The nucleic acid-based, PCR-amplified assays are finding increased clinical use as the veterinary and livestock industry seek earlier detection of infection for eventual corrective management decisions. We are evolving from a point of disease diagnosis by tumor identification through conventional histopathology, to molecular diagnostics for early identification of retroviral nucleic acid (provirus). The clinical use of antibody-based assays lies in the simplicity of testing large numbers of animals, the relative sensitivity of the assays, and the low cost of testing. Although the pathogenicity of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) for cattle has been well documented, the disease potential for bovine immunodeficiency-like virus (BIV) for cattle is still being determined. Nevertheless, pressure to test for retroviral infections of livestock and, when feasible, removal of these infected animals from the herd will be increased.","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with EWS and ERG clones showed the fused signals on the der(21) chromosome, but no ERG signals on the chromosome 22 homologs. Thus, our RT-PCR and FISH analyses indicated that the chromosome 22 fragment containing the 5' portion of EWS had been inverted and inserted into chromosome 21 and had fused to the 3' portion of ERG.

Furthermore, this home-made assay was compared with two commercially available ELISA kits. The results led to the conclusion that these three assays are far from being equivalent between each other, in terms of sensitivity towards non-glycosylated vs glycosylated LIF. Two major parameters must be incriminated: the glycosylation status of the LIF molecule used as the calibrator, and the binding characteristics of the monoclonal antibodies used to set up these assays toward LIF derived from Escherichia coli or from eukaryotic cells.

In this age of cost-effectiveness, it will be difficult to arrange third-party reimbursement for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant that may lead to medical charges of between $100,000 and $200,000. However, the cost of standard medical care for patients with SADS is not trivial. Dialysis for an SLE patient with renal failure costs $40,000 per year, while the medical resources required to care for a patient with progressive multiple sclerosis may exceed $35,000 per year. Unique BMT regimen-related toxicities may occur, including intracranial hemorrhage in the SLE or rheumatoid arthritis patient who has vasculitis; acute neurologic decompensation in patients with multiple sclerosis, especially if the conditioning regimen contains neurotoxic agents that cross a compromised blood-brain barrier; respiratory failure in patients with myasthenia gravis; and increased renal or pulmonary toxicity in patients with scleroderma and parenchymal fibrosis. Scleroderma-associated gastrointestinal dysmotility and bacterial overgrowth may also lead to greater fungal and bacterial infections [76]. BMT is currently considered appropriate therapy for patients with chronic-phase Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and indolent lymphomas who otherwise have a relatively long life expectancy of 5 and 10 years, respectively. The roughly similar long survival but greater functional impairment of patients with SADS may justify consideration of immune ablation and hematopoietic stem cell rescue.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Umbilical cord blood offers the clinician a source of hematopoietic stem cells that is rarely contaminated by latent viruses and is readily available. Moreover, the collection of umbilical cord blood poses no risk to the donor; there is no need for general anesthesia or blood replacement, and the procedure causes no discomfort. Whether cord blood lymphocytes are as likely to cause GVHD as lymphocytes from older individuals is unknown. Current clinical experience would suggest that the incidence may be low. Few of the patients transplanted with umbilical cord blood thus far have developed clinically significant GVHD, including recipients of HLA-disparate grafts. These results and associated laboratory findings pose intriguing possibilities for the future of umbilical cord blood stem cells in the setting of unrelated transplantation. With the marked incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD that is currently observed after unrelated bone marrow transplantation, a reduction in incidence or severity would be a major advancement in this field. In the setting of autologous trans-plantation, there are other intriguing possibilities; for example, cord blood may be an optimal source of pluripotential stem cells for gene therapy. The large-scale collection and storage of cord blood stem cells has become a reality. Pilot programs for the banking of unrelated umbilical cord blood have already begun in the United States and Europe. Not only is there the potential for reducing the time from search initiation to the time of donor stem cell acquisition but also there is the potential for reducing the risks associated with unrelated bone marrow transplantation. There is also the hope of remedying the shortage of donors from ethnic and racial backgrounds that are currently underrepresented in most unrelated donor programs. Even with the creation of such banks, it should not be forgotten that the collection of umbilical cord bloods should at least be considered when a child with leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, marrow failure syndrome, immunodeficiency state, or inborn error of metabolism has a mother who is pregnant. The clinical results to date in small recipients would suggest that it is at least as good as bone marrow; but additional patients and more time will be needed to finalize this conclusion.",,"['P01-CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The identity of the effector cells and target antigens remains unclear, but no doubt future experiments will begin to dissect out the complex cellular and cytokine interactions that mediate GVL reactivity. It also remains unclear whether GVL is distinct from GVHD; ultimately, the ability to harness GVL without excessive toxicity from GVHD will be a central challenge in BMT and cellular immunotherapy.

METHODS: With their informed consent, patients had 0.1 ml of the aqueous humor in the anterior chamber collected with a needle under an operating microscope. An aliquot of the collected sample from patients without steroid therapy was examined by May-Giemsa staining and immunocytochemically. The presence of the HTLV-1-infected cells was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the gag and pol regions of the provirus genome. The population of the infected cells was compared by PCR testing the amplification of the virus genome from 60 cells, or determining the endpoint of successful amplification of the twofold dilution series of the samples, collected from the aqueous humor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were obtained at the same time. Expression of viral and cytokine genes was studied by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). The interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in the aqueous humor of patients with HU and control subjects was measured by a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: The number of the infiltrating cells ranged from 475 to 3563 (mean = 2111) per 0.1 ml of aqueous humor, and all the identifiable cells were lymphocytes. Most of them were CD3-positive T cells (mean = 78%), whereas CD4-positive cells constituted less than half (mean = 35.3%). HTLV-1 provirus was detected by PCR in the infiltrating cells of 36 of 38 patients with HU tested, whereas it was detected in 1 of 4 seropositive patients with other entities of uveitis. A higher population of the infected cells in the aqueous humor than in the PBMC was found in seven of nine patients with HU by two independent approaches. Expression of HTLV-1 env or pX genes or both was shown in all 12 patients with HU tested by RT-PCR. IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was detected by RT-PCR in 10 of these 12 patients, whereas those of interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-2, interleukin-4, and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha were not, and that of interferon-gamma was detected in only 1 patient. The IL-6 level was elevated significantly in the aqueous humor of nine patients with HU compared with that of five control subjects (520.2 +/- 841 pg/ml versus 2.77 +/- 1.59 pg/ml, P < 0.01 by Mann-Whitney test). CONCLUSIONS: HU is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration with a predominance of T cells and by the presence and probable accumulation of HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes in the affected eye. Production of viral antigens and IL-6 by the infiltrating cells could be responsible for the development of HU.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The generated PML-RAR alpha fusion interferes with wild type RAR alpha-mediated transcription and disrupts subnuclear compartments, known as PML bodies. Both defects are corrected by all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy which induces differentiation of leukemic cells and clinical remission. In a rare APL syndrome associated with t(11;17), fusion of the RAR alpha gene with the PLZF gene, encoding a Zinc-finger protein produces two reciprocal RAR alpha chimeras. Although PLZF-RAR alpha and PML-RAR alpha are similar in their apparent dominant negative effects, t(11;17)-associated APL is refractory to ATRA therapy. In a yeast two-hybrid genetic screening, we isolated clones encoding the GAL4 transactivation domain fused to various parts of PLZF. Using these autonomously transactivating hybrids, similar in structure to the RAR alpha-PLZF fusion, we mapped the DNA-binding domain of PLZF to the last five Zinc-fingers, a region retained in RAR alpha-PLZF chimera and characterized a specific PLZF target sequence.

This includes an increase in p53 (wild-type), a decrease in BCL2, a p53-dependent increase in the BCL2 family member BAX, and increases in Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible (GADD) genes such as GADD45; these changes occur as early events in a sequence that culminates in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. DNA damaging agents have now been tested for effects on expression of another BCL2 family member, MCL1, a gene expressed during ML-1 cell differentiation. Expression of MCL1 was found to increase upon exposure of ML-1 cells to various types of DNA damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, ultraviolet radiation, and alkylating drugs. The increase in MCL1 occurred rapidly and was transient, levels of the MCL1 mRNA being elevated within 4 h and having returned to near baseline within 24 h. An increase in the Mcl1 protein was also seen, with the maximal increase occurring at an intermediate dose of IR (5 Gray) and lesser increases occurring at either lower or higher doses. The increase in expression of MCL1 was further studied using a panel of human cell lines that includes cells containing or not containing alterations in p53 as well as cells sensitive or insensitive to the apoptosis-inducing effects of DNA damage. The DNA damage-induced increase in MCL1 mRNA did not depend upon p53 as it was seen in cells lacking functional p53. However, the increase did depend upon susceptibility to apoptosis as it was not seen in cells insensitive to apoptosis-induction by DNA damaging agents. These findings demonstrate that cytotoxic DNA damage causes an increase in the expression of MCL1 along with increases in GADD45 and BAX and a decrease in BCL2. Furthermore, while the increase in GADD45 is seen both in cells that undergo growth arrest and in cells that undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage, alterations in the profile of expression of BCL2 family members occur exclusively in cells that undergo the apoptotic response, with some family members increasing through p53-dependent (BAX) and others through p53-independent (MCL1) pathways. Overall, expression MCL1 can increase during the induction of cell death as well as during the induction of differentiation.","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'AT5C31J09G (Methyl Methanesulfonate)']",['CA54385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we demonstrate that the actin-cleaving ICE-family protease in the apoptotic cell extract is the activated CPP-32/apopain. CPP-32 effectively cleaves actin protein to 15 kDa and 31 kDa fragments. Studies with an antibody raised against Gly-Gln-Val-Ile-Thr peptide, the N-terminal sequence of the cleaved 15 kDa actin fragment, showed that actin is also cleaved in vivo during the development of apoptosis. Moreover, Benzyloxycarbonyl-Glu-Val-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6,-dichlorobenzene (Z-EVD-CH2-DCB), a selective inhibitor of CPP-32(-like) protease, efficiently inhibited the cleavage of actin and the apoptosis of VP-16-treated U937 cells.

In this article, the authors report four cases with complementary pathophysiologic examinations. METHODS: Four patients with hypercalcemia that indicated RS were admitted to the study unit between 1980 and 1994 with the following diagnoses: transformation of mixed follicular lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, respectively, in 3 men ages 60 to 73 years, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a woman 73 years of age. Radiologic and histologic features were reported. Circulating levels of parathormone-related peptide (PTHrP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured. RESULTS: Radiologic skeletal abnormalities were found in three of three cases: osteopenia twice and multifocal osteolysis once. All four patients had large cell lymphoma (LCL). Bone resorption assessed histomorphometrically was elevated in two of two cases. Serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were high in three of three and one of three cases, respectively. Elevated values were also found in four patients with LCL but without hypercalcemia. The serum PTHrP level was increased in the only hypercalcemic patient tested and values were normal in the three control patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hypercalcemia arising in a patient with a low grade lymphoproliferative disorder may indicate RS. Hypercalcemia is due to increased bone resorption, which may be caused by the secretion of osteoclast-stimulating factors by the LCL invading the bone marrow. Independently, TNF-alpha and/or IL-6 were unlikely causative factors of hypercalcemia in the patients in this study; however, synergism with PTHrP was suspected in one case.","['0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We studied 19,229 patients who received allogeneic transplants (97.2 percent) or syngeneic transplants (2.8 percent) between 1964 and 1992 at 235 centers to evaluate the risk of the development of a new solid cancer. Risk factors relating to the patient, the transplant, and the course after transplantation were evaluated. RESULTS: The transplant recipients were at significantly higher risk of new solid cancers than the general population (observed cases, 80; ratio of observed to expected cases, 2.7; P<0.001). The risk was 8.3 times higher than expected among those who survived 10 or more years after transplantation. The cumulative incidence rate was 2.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.0 percent) at 10 years and 6.7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.7 to 9.6 percent) at 15 years. The risk was significantly elevated (P<0.05) for malignant melanoma (ratio of observed to expected cases, 5.0) and cancers of the buccal cavity (11.1), liver (7.5), brain or other parts of the central nervous system (7.6), thyroid (6.6), bone (13.4), and connective tissue (8.0). The risk was higher for recipients who were younger at the time of transplantation than for those who were older (P for trend <0.001). In multivariate analyses, higher doses of total-body irradiation were associated with a higher risk of solid cancers. Chronic graft-versus-host disease and male sex were strongly linked with an excess risk of squamous-cell cancers of the buccal cavity and skin. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation have an increased risk of new solid cancers later in life.

We demonstrate here that phorbol ester, a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, synergistically augments the antileukemic actions of the NO in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Exposure of cells to sodium nitro-prusside (SNP; 0.5 to 2 mM), a NO-generating agent, induced time- and concentration-related increases in morphological changes, including condensation of nuclear chromatin, nuclear fragmentation, and the apoptotic peak of propidium iodide-stained nuclei by flow cytometry. Phorbol ester alone had a small effect on inducing DNA damage, whereas SNP in combination with phorbol ester at all concentrations tested markedly increased the extent of fragmentation. Maximal potentiation of fragmentation (e.g., four- to fivefold greater than that obtained with 0.5 mM SNP alone) was observed with simultaneous treatment of phorbol ester. Similar results were obtained with another commonly used NO donor agents such as SNAP (0.5 mM) and GSNO (0.5 mM). DNA fragmentation of HL-60 cells was also augmented by 100 U/ml human recombinant interferon-gamma but not by 1.5% (v/v) DMSO or 1 microM retinoic acid. The stage-2 tumor promotor mezerein also mimicked the effect of phorbol ester to induce NO-induced apoptosis. In contrast, PKC inhibitors such as staurosporine and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine partially blocked high concentration of SNP (2-3 mM)-induced apoptosis, suggesting that activation of PKC closely relates to the potentiation of the activity of NO on HL-60 cell apoptosis. Under the same conditions, SNP in combination with phorbol ester caused apoptosis in another transformed cell line, U-937 cells, but was ineffective at inducing apoptosis in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that exposure of HL-60 cells to phorbol ester renders them more susceptible to NO-induced DNA damage and that this phenomenon contributes to the cytotoxic effects of the NO-PKC combination in myeloid leukemia cells.","['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Total nucleated human bone marrow cells were transduced using GaLV vectors packaged with either amphotropic or GaLV envelopes. Transduction efficiency was assayed by the generation of G418-resistant colony forming units. We found that GaLV vectors could transduce both BFU-E and CFU-C hematopoietic progenitors, and that their efficiency was at least equivalent to an amphotropically packaged Moloney mouse leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based vector. Moreover, vectors derived from the GaLV-SEATO strain and bearing amphotropic envelope were best for gene transfer into BFU-E, whereas vectors derived from the GaLV-SF strain and bearing GaLV envelope transduced CFU-C at higher efficiency. Thus, GaLV-based retroviral vectors are promising new tools for gene transfer into human hematopoietic cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its expression is thought to be related closely to the extravascular infiltration of the leukemia cells. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), the etiological agent of ATL, produces Tax protein, which is implicated in leukemogenesis through its transactivating effect on various cellular genes. In this study we investigated the transactivating effect of HTLV-1 Tax on the alpha 1-->3 fucosyltransferase Fuc-T VII, the putative rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of sialyl Lewis X in human leukocytes using JPX-9 cells. JPX-9 is a subclone of a non-ATL human lymphocytic leukemia cell line, Jurkat, and was established by introducing a metallothionein promoter-driven Tax expression plasmid. The JPX-9 cells as well as parental Jurkat cells did not express Fuc-T VII mRNA under normal culture conditions. When cultured in the presence of 10 microM CdCl2, Tax was induced and a significant amount of the Fuc-T VII message was ascertained by Northern blotting. The amount of the message was 24.5 times as much as was detected in non-treated cells, and was comparable to that which appeared by TPA stimulation of the cells, which is supposed to simulate the sequence of events occurring in normal activation of T lymphocytes activated by more physiological stimuli. Sialyl Lewis X determinant was expressed at the surface of CdCl2-treated cells, while the determinant was not detectable on either unstimulated JPX-9 or parental Jurkat cells. These results indicate that expression of sialyl Lewis X on leukemic cells in patients with ATL is at least partly due to the transactivation of the Fuc-T VII gene induced by the HTLV-1 Tax, and suggest that this leads to the accelerated extravascular infiltration of ATL cells.","['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Selectins)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.152 (galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The inactivated enzyme regained its full activity when chromatographed by anion-exchange chromatography, suggesting that none of the compounds inhibited the amidohydrolase in a covalent manner. Accordingly, Lineweaver-Burk profiles showed competitive inhibition by each compound. Conversely, the irreversible inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase As, methyl-arachidonoyl-fluoro-phosphonate (MAFP), covalently inhibited the amidohydrolase. MAFP was active at concentrations 10(3) times lower than those reported for phospholipase A2 inhibition, and is the most potent anandamide amidohydrolase inhibitor so far described (IC50 = 1-3 nM).

Recent reports suggest that glucose-derived oxidants are capable of oxidising LDL. In this report, the effect of glucose-mediated oxidation of LDL upon the macrophage like cell line, P388D(1), was examined. Glucose-mediated oxidation of LDL was assessed by changes in the electrophoretic mobility of LDL and by analysis of lipid content using gas chromatography. The presence of Cu(II) (0.5 microM) was essential for the oxidation of LDL. The oxidation was potentiated by glucose in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At the concentration of LDL used (1 mg/ml), high concentrations of glucose (up to 500 mM) were required to oxidise LDL. The electrophoretic mobility of LDL correlated with the degree of lipid oxidation; both correlated with an inhibitory effect of oxidised LDL upon P388D(1) DNA synthesis. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DETAPAC), a transition metal chelator, and aminoguanidine (AMG), an anti-glycation agent, inhibited the oxidation of LDL and attenuated the effects on DNA synthesis. Thus, glucose can mediate transition metal-dependent oxidation of LDL to a level that can affect P388D(1) cells, a mechanism which might have relevance to accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic patients.","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'SCQ4EZQ113 (pimagedine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The conclusions of this analysis extend and strengthen the previously made hypothesis on the Moloney murine leukemia virus: The evolution of the nucleotide sequence appears to have occurred mainly through at least three overlapping levels of duplication: (1) The distributions of overrepresented (3-6)-mers are consistent with the universal rule of a trend toward TG/CT excess and with the persistence of a certain degree of symmetry between the two strands of DNA. This suggests one or several original tandemly repeated sequences and some inverted duplications. (2) The existence of two general core consensuses at the level of these (3-6)-mers supports the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin of vertebrate retroviruses. Consensuses more specific to certain sequences are compatible with phylogenetic trees established independently. The consensuses could correspond to intermediary evolutionary stages. (3) Most of the (3-6)-mers with a significantly higher than average frequency appear to be internally repeated (with monomeric or oligomeric internal iterations) and seem to be at least partly the cause of the bias observed by other researchers at the level of retroviral nucleotide composition.

Cladribine is a prodrug and needs intracellular phosphorylation to active nucelotides. The intracellular concentration of these metabolites is several hundred-fold higher than that of cladribine in plasma and they are retained in leukaemia cells with half-lives between 9 and > 30 hours depending on diagnosis and sampling schedule. There is no correlation between the plasma concentration of cladribine and that of the intracellular metabolites. The renal clearance of cladribine is 51% of total clearance and 21 to 35% of an intravenously administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

When patients do not have an HLA-matched donor, alternative marrow sources should be explored. The way to allow survival in some patients is to perform two- or three loci HLA mismatched BMT. Preliminary results with BMT in partially-matched, related donors performed at Veterans General Hospital-Taipei are reported. METHODS: Between 1985 and 1994, a total of 121 patients were enrolled in this study. Ten patients received BMT with HLA partially-matched, related donor, including 2 acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), 5 chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and 3 severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Three and four hematologically malignant patients received cyclophosphamide (Cy) + radiotherapy (RT) and Cy + Busulfan(Bu) preconditioning regimens, respectively; three SAA patients received standard Cy + RT regimen. Additional prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) consisted of methotrexate (MTX) and cyclosporin-A (CSA). The median follow up was 36 months. Seven were 2-loci disparate and 3 were 3-loci. RESULTS: Engraftment developed with a mean of 20.9 days after transplant. Nonengraftment rate was 1/10 (10%), delayed graft failure 2/10(20%) and venoocculsive disease (VOD) 1/10(10%). The percentage of patients who developed grade II to IV acute GVHD was low (13.6% of those mismatched at 0 locus, 31.6% mismatched at 1 loci and 14.3% at > or = 2 loci. p = 0.181). Extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 16.7% (34.1% of those mismatched at 0 locus, 41.2% mismatched at 1 loci and 16.7% at 2 loci. p = 0.492). There were five deaths. The other 5 still survived at 36 months of follow-up. Log-rank analysis revealed no statistical significance between those mismatched at > or = 2 vs at 1 (p = 0.146) but the difference between those mismatched at > or = 2 and at 0 (p = 0.0359) was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: When patients requiring BMT without an HLA identical sibling donor, an alternative transplant from haploidentical family members remains a viable option, especially when a patient has CML, SAA or other refractory hematologic malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

To consider the impact of published data on immunophenotyping hairy-cell leukaemias, a total of 50 diagnostic biopsies were systematically analysed with a panel of eight antibodies and compared with cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), 20 follicular centre lymphomas, 20 lympho-plasmacytoid immunocytomas, 10 small-cell T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 20 cases of benign nodular lymphatic hyperplasia. The panel of eight antibodies comprised DBA44, CD45, CD20, CD45R, CD45RO, CD43 and the CD68 antibodies KP1 and Ki-M1P. The hairy-cell leukaemias were staged histologically into four categories of bone marrow infiltration. DBA44 reacted positively in 47/50 cases. CD45 and the B-cell markers CD20 and CD45R reacted in 49/50 and 43/50 cases, respectively. One CD68 marker, KP1, was positive in 38/50 cases but the other-Ki-M1P-only in 1/50 cases. Chronic lymphatic leukaemia cases, the other B-cell NHLs and lymphatic hyperplasias showed strong positivity for CD20 and CD45R, but only the immunocytomas reacted with DBA44 in 7/20 cases. The T-cell NHLs and hyperplasias showed a strong positivity for the T-cell markers CD45RO and CD43. The CD68-marker Ki-M1P revealed a high specificity since it was negative in all NHLs and positive only in one hairy-cell leukaemia. Methyl-methacrylate embedding of bone marrow biopsies under cold polymerization produces a high quality of histo- and cytomorphology, resulting in greater diagnostic reliability and the detection of low-stage infiltration of hairy-cell leukaemia. DBA44 appears as a highly specific antibody to mark hairy-cells since only immunocytomas reacted positively in a few cases. A small panel of antibodies including DBA44.

Evidence of the correlation of BDV infection with these disorders remained unclear. Kagoshima is known to be one of the major areas in which human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is endemic; this is the first isolated human retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia with neurological symptoms. The present study aimed to clarify whether BDV and HTLV-1 infections are associated with psychiatric disorders among Japanese patients. Subjects were 346 patients with psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, 179; mood disorder, 123; and others, 44) and 70 healthy controls. Anti-BDV antibodies from plasma samples were screened by the indirect immunofluorescence (IF) method using BDV-infected MDCK cells. Results revealed that only three samples were found to be weakly positive for BDV in the IF assay and seronegative by Western blot (immunoblot) assay. Furthermore, BDV-p24 related RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 106 of 346 psychiatric patients and 12 or 70 healthy controls by p24-reverse transcription PCR was examined. Two mood disorder patients were positive for BDV-p24 RNA but seronegative.

In the present study we investigated different biochemical events that may play a role in signal transduction pathways culminating in the expression of c-fos mRNA in rat basophilic leukaemia cells. Similar to IgE-mediated cell degranulation we demonstrated inhibition of the c-fos signal in the absence of calcium and after preincubation of cells with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Activation of RBL-2H3 cells by short term PMA treatment failed to induce cell degranulation or expression of mRNA for c-fos. Depletion of protein kinase C by PMA pre-treatment resulted in substantial inhibition of the c-fos signal. In contrast to IgE-mediated cell degranulation, expression of mRNA for c-fos was not dependent on continued receptor aggregation. In addition, we demonstrate that c-fos mRNA expression is not restricted to Fc epsilon RI activation but can be induced by a variety of IgE independent mechanisms including calcium influx by ionophore A 23187 and stimulation of G proteins.","['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,

HEL cells grow in suspension in culture medium, but attach and spread on fibronectin when treated with 10 nM phorbol myristate acetate. If the spread cells are treated with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate, about 50% of the cells polarize and form very striking elongated processes. Time-lapse video microscopy showed that elongation develops in these cells because the anterior pole of the cell, which bears a small ruffled membrane, moves slowly (approximately 0.16 microgram/min) forward on the substratum elongating the posterior pole or tail behind it. Using indirect immunofluorescence we found that elongation of the tail correlates with the development of long microtubule bundles emanating from the centrosome, which is located posterior to the nucleus on the trailing side of the cell. Incubation with nocodazole, which inhibited development of the long microtubules and the elongation, resulted in a centrosome positioned over the nucleus in 45% of the cells and extension of the membrane ruffling to many points around the cell's periphery. Unexpectedly, time-lapse video microscopy demonstrated that the treated cultures also contained some smaller cells with very marked anterior ruffles and short tails. These cells moved rapidly about the culture dish (maximum 0.8 microgram/min; average 0.5 microgram/min). In these fast moving cells the centrosome was also located posterior to the nucleus. Several recent reports have stressed the importance of relocation of the centrosome to an anterior position in cells developing polarity after experimental wounding. Our results show that both striking polarization and rapid motility can occur without such a relocation. The polarity induced in the HEL cells correlates most clearly with the limitation of membrane ruffling to one region; this limitation is removed by microtubule disassembly. We therefore propose that localized ruffling is the critical first step in polarized motility generally, and that centrosomal position is related to other factors.","['63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['5-T32-GMO7170/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR40840/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL15835/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis of these patients with conventional chemotherapy has been dismal and only allogeneic bone marrow transplantation offers a potential cure. We describe two patients who developed MDS after chemo/radiotherapy and had a spontaneous recovery. One patient was treated with MOPP-ABVD hybrid therapy for Hodgkin's disease, developed pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia and dyserythropoiesis associated with monosomy 7. The other was treated with a combination of chemotherapy including VP-16 for Ewing's sarcoma, developed thrombocytopenia, marrow hypoplasia and dyserythropoiesis associated with an 11q23 translocation. Both patients received rhG-CSF after their cycles of chemotherapy and were considered for a bone marrow transplant. Marrow aspirates at frequent intervals showed gradual disappearance of the abnormal clone with parallel normalization of the peripheral count. In both patients G-CSF might have played a role in the development of the abnormal clone.

Using mainly reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the TEL-AML1 chimeric transcript has been observed in 22-27% of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in particular in the early B-lineage ALL subtype, making it the most common genetic lesion in these patients. The vast majority of acute myeloid leukemias, other ALL subtypes and even adults with early B-lineage ALL were TEL-AML1-negative. We determined whether the TEL-AML1 fusion gene can also be observed in continuous human leukemia cell lines with an early B-lineage phenotype. Twenty-nine such cell lines established from children (n = 13) or adults (n = 13) with early B-lineage ALL and five cell lines derived from chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis or B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were investigated for the occurrence of the TEL-AML1 rearrangement by RT-PCR. While all 13 adult early B-lineage ALL cell lines and the five cell lines from other leukemias or lymphomas were negative, 1/13 pediatric cell lines (cell line REH) was found to be positive for TEL-AML1; though neither reciprocal AML1-TEL, nor normal TEL, mRNA was detectable by RT-PCR in this cell line. These findings agreed with the results of conventional cytogenetic and FISH analysis of REH which was found to carry the der(21) partner only of t(12;21)(p13;q22), probably resulting from a complex translocation, t(4;12;21;16)(q32;p13;q22;q24.3). Hybridization with flanking cosmid clones (179A6 and 148B6), covering exons 1 and 8 respectively of TEL, confirmed a rearrangement accompanying the t(12;21), and showed cryptic deletion of the residual allele resulting from an apparently reciprocal t(5;12)(q31;p13). These findings in REH provide a further example of, and possible cytogenetic mechanism for, the paradigm of TEL-AML1 fusion accompanied by deletion of the residual TEL allele. The low rate of early B-lineage ALL cell lines carrying this translocation contrasts clearly with the relative high frequency of TEL-AML1-positive cases in primary material. It is possible that expression of the fusion product hampers the in vitro growth and establishment in culture of such leukemic cells. Nevertheless, the cell line REH represents a powerful tool for the further molecular characterization of this unique breakpoint and can serve as a positive control in routine PCR reactions.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The percentage of leukemic cells expressing L-selectins (Leu-8) was high in CLL (52% of positive cases) and integrin expression (LFA-1, VLA-4, 5) was low (19 and 33%, respectively), while a reverse pattern, low Leu-8 (17%), and a high VLA-4 (77%), was observed in non-CLL cases. The expression of LFA-1 alpha-chain was variable in non-CLL cases, and the LFA-1 heterodimer was expressed on most clonal B cell in NHLs (92%).

In the HL-60 wild-type (WT) early promyelocytic leukemia cell line, granulocytic differentiation appears to be directly mediated by the nuclear receptor RAR alpha. An HL-60 subline resistant to RA (HL-60 R) contains a point mutation which results in a truncation of 52 amino acids at the COOH end of RAR alpha. Cross-talk between differentiation, clonal inhibition of growth and apoptosis was studied using HL-60 WT, HL-60 R, and HL-60 R infected by a retroviral vector containing RAR alpha (LX) as targets, which were cultured with various retinoids, vitamin D3 analogs, HMBA, or DMSO. None of these compounds induced significant differentiation of HL-60 R and HL-60 LX, but they did induce differentiation of HL-60 WT. In contrast, retinoids inhibited the clonal proliferation of HL-60 WT, HL-60 R, and HL-60 LX. Vitamin D3 analogs including KH1060 stimulated the clonal growth of HL-60 R; but they inhibited clonal growth of HL-60 WT and LX. Levels of Bcl-2 strongly decreased in HL-60 WT and LX after treatment by retinoids, while no change in expression occurred in HL-60 R. Neither KH 1060 nor 9-cis RA induced apoptosis of HL-60 R, but these agents did induce apoptosis in HL-60 LX WT. Taken together, we showed that HL-60 R has a global defect in its ability to be induced to differentiate by a variety of pathways, not merely the retinoid pathway. Furthermore, our HL-60 models showed that inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis and differentiation can be dissociated. Clinically, these results suggest that several putative differentiation agents may have anti-cancer (antiproliferative) activities, even though they do not induce differentiation of the cancer cells.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoids)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments were performed in a coculture system with cloned murine fibroblasts, which efficiently block spontaneous ex vivo apoptosis of BCP and thus allows the assessment of cytokine-induced growth inhibition. TGF-beta significantly reduced cell viability of highly purified, FACS isolated CD10+/CD19+ leukemic BCP by a mean of 53% (P = 0.0001). The loss of cell viability was accompanied by a significant increase of apoptosis with a mean of 70% (P = 0.0028). The TGF-beta effect was blocked specifically by a monoclonal anti-TGF-beta antibody. Induction of apoptotic cell death by TGF-beta was not accompanied by reduction of bcl-2 protein expression. TGF-beta transcription was not detected in the leukemic pre-B cell line BLIN-1, but in the murine fibroblasts. The growth inhibitory effect of TGF-beta was not restricted to leukemic BCP.

In primary leukemic neutrophils from patients with CML, the major tyrosine phosphorylated protein is CRKL, an SH2-SH3-SH3 adapter protein which has an overall homology of 60% to CRK, the human homologue of the v-crk oncogene. In cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL, CRKL was tyrosine phosphorylated, while CRK was not. We looked for changes in CRK- and CRKL-binding proteins in Ba/F3 hematopoietic cell lines which were transformed by BCR/ABL. Anti-CRK II or anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates were probed by far Western blotting with CRK II- or CRKL-GST fusion proteins to display CRK- and CRKL-coprecipitating proteins. There was a striking qualitative difference in the proteins coprecipitating with CRKL and CRK II. In untransformed cells, three major proteins coprecipitated with CRKL, identified as C3G, SOS and c-ABL. Each of these proteins was found to interact with the CRKL-SH3 domains, but not the SH2 domain. After BCR/ABL transformation, the CRKL SH3-domain binding proteins did not change, with the exception that BCR/ABL now coprecipitated with CRKL. Compared to CRKL, very few proteins coprecipitated with CRK II in untransformed, quiescent cells. After BCR/ABL transformation, both the CRKL- and CRK-SH2 domains bound to a new complex of proteins of approximate molecular weight 105-120 kDa. The major protein in this complex was identified as p120CBL. Thus, in these hematopoietic cell lines, CRKL is involved to a greater extent than CRK II in normal signaling pathways that involve c-ABL, C3G and SOS. In BCR/ABL-transformed cells, CRKL but not CRK II, appears to form complexes which potentially link BCR/ABL, c-ABL, C3G, and SOS to the protooncoprotein, p120CBL.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk)', '0 (Son of Sevenless Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbl protein, mouse)']","['CA36137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

This family is mainly characterized by the presence of two conserved domains (BTG boxes A and B) of as yet undetermined function which are separated by a non-conserved 20-25 amino acid sequence.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)']",,['GENBANK/Z72000'],,,,,,,,,

One of the most common genetic changes is the breakage of the TAL1 gene, which was originally described to be involved in the T-ALL carrying the t(1;14)(p32;q11) translocation. Site-specific deletions in the TAL1 gene are reported to occur in 12-26% of T-ALL with apparently normal karyotype. In order to investigate the presence of other subkaryotypic abnormalities involving the 1p32 chromosomal region, where TAL1 gene is mapped, we assessed losses of heterozygosity (LOH) for microsatellite markers, in a series of 22 children with T-ALL. Microsatellite polymorphic markers flanking the TAL1 gene (D1S211, D1S197, D1S200 and D1S220) were analyzed to detect LOH. Eight patients displayed LOH for at least one of the markers, suggesting the existence of hot spot regions at the short arm of chromosome 1. Two out of 11 with no molecular evidences of TAL1 gene involvement, compared to six out of 11 in the group of TAL1 rearranged gene, showed LOH at 1p32. TAL1 gene rearrangements and clonal LOH may represent two independent events, but could be related to the same causes. For the first time this study provides evidences that LOH at 1p32 region, occurs in T-ALL in the same region known to be involved in chromosomal deletions and translocations. LOH mapping may help to define the location of a new putative tumor-suppressor gene implicated in the transformation and progression of children T-ALL.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The activation of EVI1 often follows a chromosomal rearrangement involving band 3q26, and the two most frequent rearrangements are the t(3;3)(q21;q26) and the inv(3)(q21q26). EVI1 exists also as a longer protein that includes 188 additional amino acids at the N-terminus, named MDS1/EVI1. Both genes are expressed at very low levels in the normal bone marrow. The genomic region between the first coding exon of MDS1/EVI1 and the first coding exon of EVI1 is 150-300 kb. The majority of the chromosomal breakpoints at the 5' end of EVI1 in the t(3;3) resulting in EVI1 activation have been mapped in this region. As a consequence of the t(3;3), the cell would be unable to express MDS1/EVI1, although it would express EVI1. We have compared the transcriptional activity of MDS1/EVI1 and EVI1, and we show that MDS1/EVI1 is a strong activator of promoters containing the AGATA motif, whereas EVI1 is a repressor. In addition, whereas EVI1 represses activation by the GATA-1 erythroid factor, MDS1/EVI1 does not, and is itself repressed by EVI1. By gene fusion to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, we further show that the activation properties of MDS1/EVI1 are restricted to an acidic segment encoded by the second and third exons in the 5' untranslated region of EVI1. We have also examined the relative expression of the two genes in normal bone marrow and in the bone marrow of leukemia patients with 3q26 rearrangements. Our results indicate that the rearrangements at 3q26 affect expression of EVI1, but not of MDS1/EVI1. We propose that rearrangements at 3q26 involving EVI1 could result in leukemia by a two-step process involving first transcriptional disruption of MDS1/EVI1, and next by inappropriately activating expression of EVI1.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']","['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Pneumonia was clinically and microbiologically documented in 15 cases, six had proven infections but normal chest radiograph, and 14 were classified as fever of unknown origin. Longitudinal studies revealed a sustained increase of sICAM-1 plasma levels associated with pneumonia. Increase of sICAM-1 plasma levels distinguished patients with pneumonia from those with fever not related to pneumonia (positive predictive value 0.87, negative predictive value 0.94). Plasma levels of sICAM-1 were elevated in both, fungal and non-fungal pneumonia. Increases of sICAM-1 paralleled first radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrations in most cases.

A complex network of molecular interactions has been identified. In particular, a class of cell cycle inhibitory proteins has been cloned and characterized but details of the molecular mechanism of their action have yet to be resolved. These inhibitors regulate the progression through G1 and the G1/S transition via the inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity. The potential function of these negative regulators as tumor suppressors provides new insights into the link between the cell cycle and oncogenesis. p27 is a potent inhibitor of Cdks. In quiescent cells p27 accumulates without an increase in mRNA or protein synthesis. Cell cycle regulation of p27 levels, both in normal and transformed human cells, occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and, compared to proliferating cells, quiescent cells contain a far lower amount of p27 ubiquitinating activity. The specific proteolysis of p27 is probably involved in the pathway of activation of Cdks. p27 is a phosphoprotein and its phosphorylation is cell cycle regulated. Often phosphorylation is a signal for ubiquitination. p27 is phosphorylated exclusively on serine by Erk1 and almost exclusively on threonine by Cdk1 in in vitro experiments. This finding raises the question of whether and how phosphorylation by these kinases is involved in the process of p27 proteolysis.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']","['CA42580-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66229-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We report here the expression profile of MDM-2 and p53 proteins in 87 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as detected by immunoblot analysis. The MDM-2 proteins (p57, p59, p67, and p90) were found to be overexpressed in different combinations in 56/87 (64%) of cases of CLL when compared with normal volunteers. The MDM-2 protein p57 was predominantly overexpressed 46/87 (53%) in CLL. In 22/87 (25%) cases of CLL p57 was overexpressed alone, and in 24/87 (28%) cases it was co-overexpressed with other MDM-2 proteins p59/p67/p90. Six of the 87 cases of CLL showed overexpression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 by immunoblot analysis, and five of those cases also co-overexpress MDM-2 protein p57. No statistically significant correlation of MDM-2 protein overexpression to clinical disease stage and history of previous chemotherapy of CLL patients has been found. However, considering the oncogenic potential of overexpressed MDM-2 proteins, a possible role of MDM-2 proteins in the promotion of CLL disease remains to be evaluated.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",['HL-02229/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

By definition, this should be a phosphoprotein which interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in G0 or early G1, and is capable of binding to and potentiating the activity of DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha). This protein should also be an ATP-dependent helicase which interacts with the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, RP-A. Because of these requirements, a TAg homologous protein could be expected to contain epitopes with amino acid sequences similar to those of TAg at critical functional sites, such as ATP, pRb and pol alpha binding sites. TAg and a putative cellular homolog of TAg, DNA pol alpha accessory protein (alpha AP), were compared for pRb and pol alpha interaction, and for immunological identity. The analyses utilized immunoaffinity-purified TAg and pRb from a baculovirus expression system, and DNA pol alpha/primase and alpha AP chromatographically isolated from a mouse lymphocytic leukemia cell line. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the pol alpha or pRb binding sites on TAg interacted with alpha AP strongly enough to be employed for immunoaffinity purification of alpha AP. Anti-pRb and anti-TAg reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated pRb bound to TAg and pRb bound to alpha AP. The functional consequences of pol alpha interaction with TAg or alpha AP in the presence or absence of pRb was determined using pol alpha nucleotide incorporation assays. alpha AP exhibited the capacity to stimulate pol alpha activity, a capacity which was diminished in the presence of pRb. Lastly, TAg and alpha AP independently co-purified with pol alpha through a multi-step chromatographic protocol. These data indicate that a pol alpha accessory protein, alpha AP, exhibits functional and immunological similarities to SV40 TAg, suggest that alpha AP is involved in regulation of the initiation of DNA synthesis, and support the proposal that alpha AP may be a normal cell protein homologous to SV40 large T antigen.","['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Primase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Nucleotidyltransferases)']","['AG06347/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG07739/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

It is highly homologous to the putative metastasis suppressor nm23-H1 gene and the closely related nm23-H2 gene. When overexpressed in the myeloid precursor 32Dcl3 cell line, it inhibited granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-stimulated granulocytic differentiation and induced apoptosis. We have now found that the expression of DR-nm23 is not restricted to hematopoietic cells but is also detected in an array of solid tumor cell lines, including carcinoma of the breast, colon, and prostate, as well as the glioblastoma cell line T98G. We have also isolated both the gene and its 5'-flanking region and found that DR-nm23 localizes on chromosome 16q13. The gene consists of six exons and five introns. When fused in-frame to the nucleotide sequence for the green fluorescent protein and transfected in SAOS-2 cells, it generates a protein of the predicted size that localizes to the cytoplasm. The 5'-flanking region of DR-nm23 does not contain a canonical TATA box or a CAAT box, but it is G+C rich and contains two binding sites for the developmentally regulated transcription factor activator protein 2 (AP-2). Transient expression assays of DR-nm23 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs demonstrated that the segment from nucleotides -1028 to +123 has the highest activity in hematopoietic K562 cells and in TK-ts13 hamster fibroblasts. Moreover, AP-2 induced a 3-fold transactivation of the DR-nm23 5'-flanking segment from nucleotides -1676 to +123 and interacted specifically with oligomers containing putative AP-2 binding sites (-936 to -909, and -548 to -519) as indicated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, nuclear run-on assays from high and low DR-nm23-expressing cells (K562 and CCRF-CEM, respectively) revealed similar transcription rates. Therefore, the regulation of the DR-nm23 gene expression might involve other mechanisms occurring at posttranscriptional and/or translational levels.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,['GENBANK/U80813'],,,,,,,,,

To better define the incidence of 13q deletions and trisomy 12, FISH analysis was also performed using a cosmid probe that recognized a DNA sequence between the Rb gene and the D13S25 locus at band 13q14 and a chromosome 12-specific pericentromeric probe. All patients were characterized by cytoimmunological and hematological studies. Fourteen cases displayed three fluorescent signals in 41-98% interphase cells when hybridized to the BCL1 yeast artificial chromosome probe, documenting the presence of BCL1 translocation (BCL1-positive cases). The presence of t(11;14)(q13;q32) was ascertained in 12 cases using CCA and by dual color interphase FISH using the BCLI probe and a 14q telomere probe in 2 karyotypically normal cases. The remaining 43 cases had two signals in more than 95% interphase cells (BCL1-negative) and did not have the t(11;14) at CCA. Although 13q14 deletions were seen by means of CCA in only 5 of 14 BCL1-positive cases, hemizygous or homozygous deletions at band 13q14 were detected by FISH in 11 of 14 BCL1-positive cases, as compared with 17 of 43 BCL1-negative cases (P = 0.01). A subclone with trisomy 12 in addition to BCL1 translocation and del(13q14) was present in four BCL1-positive cases. We arrived at the following conclusions: (a) FISH with this BCL1 YAC probe is an efficient method for the detection of the t(11;14) and of the corresponding involvement of the BCL1 locus in this lymphoproliferative disorder; (b) the majority of BCL1-positive atypical CLLs by French-American-British criteria may carry 13q14 deletions; (c) the recognition of this cytogenetic subset of atypical CLL, sharing some immunological and cytogenetic features with mantle cell lymphoma, may be important, because these patients usually present isolated peripheral blood and marrow lymphocytosis, with or without mild to moderate spleen involvement, and may require early cytotoxic treatment.","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",['CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

In the present studies, we demonstrate that in human AML HL-60 cells that express Bcl-2 but little Bcl-xL (HL-60/neo cells), paclitaxel-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is followed by increased intracellular free Bax levels. This, in turn, is followed by the cleavage and activation of the key cysteine protease, CPP32beta/Yama, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, resulting in the DNA fragmentation of apoptosis. Cotreatment with the benzoquinone ansamycin Geldanamycin depleted Raf-1 but did not decrease Bcl-2 levels or impair paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation in HL-60/neo cells. Also, Geldanamycin did not affect paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of HL-60/neo cells. As compared to the control HL-60/neo, HL-60/Bcl-xL cells contain Bcl-2 as well as an enforced overexpression of Bcl-xL. Immunoprecipitation studies with anti-Bcl-2 and/or anti-Bcl-x antibodies demonstrated that HL-60/Bcl-xL cells possess lower free Bax but higher levels of Bax heterodimerized to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Following treatment of HL-60/Bcl-xL cells with paclitaxel, although Bcl-2 phosphorylation was observed, it was not followed by increased free Bax levels, cleavage of CPP32beta/Yama and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, or induction of the DNA fragmentation of apoptosis. These findings indicate the order of molecular events leading to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and show that Raf-1 may not be involved in paclitaxel-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 or apoptosis of HL-60 cells.","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical surface marker analysis (SMA) is somewhat costly, fixation-dependent, and difficult to objectively quantitate. Two-color flow cytometric (TCFCM) SMA allows for more quantitative dual marker analysis of a wide range of surface antigens, and is less expensive. Ex vivo fine-needle aspiration (xvFNA) has been reliably used for FCM DNA analysis. The procedure has also been used to harvest tumor cells for xenotransplantation. In this study, we attempted to test the reliability of material obtained by xvFNA for SMA. We also designed an algorithm initiated by cytological assessment of the xvFNA smears in order to tailor the panel of antibodies required for TCFCM SMA of the aspirates. We performed 20 xvFNAs on freshly resected specimens from 19 patients with suspected lymphoproliferative disorders. The specimens included 12 lymph node biopsies, seven splenectomies, and one breast biopsy. There were 10 male and nine female patients with a median age of 58 yr. The aspirate cell suspensions were examined by FCM within 24 hr of harvesting. The number of markers used ranged from four to 14 with an average of eight. The diagnoses included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 5), lymphocytic leukemia (n = 5), reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (n = 8), and Hodgkin's disease (n = 1). Combining cytological assessment of the xvFNA smears and TCFCM SMA, the diagnosis was reached prior to histopathologic examination in 17 cases (90%). The two remaining cases showed a reactive pattern on cytology and a polyclonal FCM SMA profile, and the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and toxoplasmosis was made on histological examination. Our study suggests that xvFNA provides adequate material for TCFCM SMA. An algorithm combining xvFNA cytology, FCM SMA, and histological examination is appropriate for the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders in most instances with maximal resource utilization and minimal expense.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous soluble mediators regulate these reactions, including leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine which may play an important role in inducing acute-phase protein synthesis by hepatocytes during inflammation. This study was designed to determine the effects of LIF on the human monocyte/macrophage lineage and provide a better definition of its behaviour during systemic inflammation. In-vitro exposure of human long-term bone marrow cultures to recombinant human LIF significantly increased (about two-fold) the number of multinucleated cells (MNC) formed after three weeks of culture. These LIF-induced MNC expressed tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and LIF increased this intracellular activity by about 50%. MNC displayed phagocytotic activity but were unable to degrade sperm whale dentin or respond to human calcitonin.

Structural rearrangements, or deletions, of the 13q12 region have been implicated in a range of myeloproliferative neoplasms, and other haematopoietic malignancies. In particular, seven cases of a t(8;13)(p11;q12.1) rearrangement have been noted in patients with an atypical myeloproliferative disorder associated with T-cell leukemia and eosinophilia. We have previously identified a CEPH mega YAC, 943E4, which crosses the translocation breakpoint in archival tumour samples from two patients with this t(8;13) translocation. As an initial step in the characterisation of this translocation breakpoint, we have generated a fine structure physical map of this 1.9 Mb YAC. We have used the method of YAC fragmentation to generate a series of deletion constructs of known size, which provide discreet physical landmarks convenient for mapping genetic markers along the 943E4 YAC. Analysis of these deletion constructs defined the order of ESTs and microsatellite markers in 943E4 as: cen-NIB1257-(ATP1AL1/D13S283)-D13S179E-(D13S5 04E/D13S505E)-D13S824E-D13S182E -D13S221-tel.

Moreover, evolution of this phenomenon during progression of myelofibrosis (assessed by morphometry of silver-stained sequential biopsies) and its predictive value were investigated. In IMF, morphometric measurements revealed a rate of ISEL-positive cells that was significantly higher than previously published data on the normal bone marrow and in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, but lower than in the myelodysplastic syndromes. However, NN with their tightly packed (nuclear) lobules and condensed chromatin were not reactive. Statistical evaluation failed to show a significant correlation between incidence of apoptotic cells and fiber density or an increase in this feature associated with progression of fibro-osteosclerotic marrow changes and prognosis. The failure of NN to react in ISEL implicates an absence of DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis.

Excellent agreement between the two methods was observed (r = 0.936) using a variety of antitumour agents, with some notable exceptions. In the Bax (human synovial sarcoma) cell line MTT colour production by control cells was very low, thus MTT-->formazan production could not be relied upon as a definitive end point equating with cell number. In contrast, colour production of control cells using the LDH assay was significantly greater and all cultures tested were suitable for titration of chemosensitivity. There was a discrepancy between IC50 values obtained either by cell counting or MTT in the HTB88 (human leiomyosarcoma) line treated with 5-FU (59.9 microM vs > 200 microM, respectively). However, cell counting agreed well with the LDH assay (IC50 47.3 microM).

The relationship of this gene to surface markers largely remains unclear. Therefore, we have studied the association of MDR1 gene expression with the expression of specific surface markers in AML. MDR1 RNA expression of leukemic cells was determined by slot blot analysis. Expression of P-glycoprotein and surface markers (CD7, CD13, CD19, CD34, HLA-DR, TdT, blood group H) was assessed by immunocytochemistry. MDR1 RNA (n = 79) and P-glycoprotein (n = 52) expression were detected in 63% and 63% of the patients, respectively. CD7, CD13, CD19, CD34, HLA-DR, TdT and blood group H were positive in 17%, 84%, 0%, 51%, 82%, 11% and 11% of the patients.

However, P-glycoprotein expression was more frequent in HLA-DR positive than in HLA-DR negative patients (47% versus 10%, p = 0,04). Consistent with the latter finding, patients with intermediate or high MDR1 RNA expression expressed HLA-DR more frequently than patients with negative or weak MDR1 RNA expression (96% versus 76%, p = 0,03).

Major breakpoint cluster region (M-BCR) rearrangement was detected by the Southern blot analysis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the presence of b3a2 BCR/ABL mRNA transcripts. The patient achieved complete remission by conventional remission induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. M-BCR rearrangement could not be detected during complete remission. After hematological remission of an 8-month duration, the patient relapsed and died of respiratory distress due to pneumonia. Our case indicate Ph-positive AML with M-BCR rearrangement actually exists. Ph-positive AML carries either M-BCR rearrangement expressing the P210 BCR-ABL or minor breakpoint cluster region (m-BCR) rearrangement producing the P190 BCR-ABL.

All patients received GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine A plus methotrexate. The mean number of days required to achieve > or = 0.5 x 109/l neutrophil count after alloBMT was 17 (median 17, range 9 to 27 days) and 19 patients (28.8%) had rapid neutrophil recovery within 15 days after alloBMT. The haematological recovery was more rapid in the 38 patients without GVHD or with only grade I GVHD. Furthermore, 50% and 40% of patients receiving 10 (n = 18) or 5 (n = 20) micrograms/kg/day G-CSF had rapid neutrophil recovery within 15 days after alloBMT, versus only 7.1% of patients not receiving G-CSF post-transplant (n = 28), p < 0.001. The neutrophil recovery was similar in patients receiving either fresh or cryopreserved allografts and either TBI-containing or busulfan-containing conditioning regimen. A significant correlation was found between neutrophil recovery and either the MNC or CFU-GM content of the allografts, r = 0.33, p < 0.01. The mean number of days required for neutrophil recovery was only 16 days (median 16, range 9 to 24 days) in patients receiving allografts containing > 1 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg (n = 28) versus 19 days (median 19, range 13 to 27 days) in patients receiving allografts containing < 1 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg (n = 35). Three patients receiving allografts containing less than 0.5 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg had primary neutrophil engraftment failure. The mean number of days required to achieve 20 x 109/l platelet count was 21 (median 20, range 11 to 50 days) and 30 patients (46.9%) had platelet recovery within 20 days after alloBMT. The platelet recovery after alloBMT was not significantly affected by the type of leukaemia, conditioning regimen, or G-CSF administration. The mean number of days required for platelet recovery after alloBMT was only 20 days (median 18 days) in patients receiving allografts containing > 1.0 x 10(5) BFU-E/kg (n = 35) versus 23 days (median 20 days) in patients receiving allografts containing < 1.0 x 10(5) BFU-E/kg (n = 24). Seven patients receiving allografts containing less than 0.5 x 10(5) BFU-E/kg had primary platelet engraftment failure. The present study has identified the high number of progenitor cells in the allografts infused and the daily administration of G-CSF post-transplant as the optimal combination for a rapid neutrophil recovery after alloBMT. More significantly, the number of BFU-E in allografts was the most significant factor to determine platelet recovery after alloBMT. The development of GVHD of grade II or more during the first weeks after alloBMT was associated with slower haematological recovery and longer period of fever during neutropenia and hospitalisation.","['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to include this entity in the differential diagnosis when encountering GI bleeding particularly in a patient previously diagnosed with myeloid leukemia or preleukemia.

After infection of 1-day-old chicks, greater tissue expression was observed in line 21 chicks, which mostly developed a tolerant viremic infection, than in Brown Leghorn chicks, which developed virus-neutralizing antibodies. An acutely transforming virus, strain 966, derived from HPRS-103-induced myeloid leukosis, showed a tropism similar to HPRS-103. The HPRS-103 strain showed a lower propensity to replicate in the medullary region of the lymphoid follicles of the bursa of Fabricius than did the RAV-1 strain of subgroup A avian leukosis virus. This low bursal tropism may be a factor in why HPRS-103 does not induce lymphoid leukosis. The HPRS-103 and 966 virus replicated in blood monocyte cultures from chickens from the six lines, indicating a tropism for the myelomonocytic cell lineage. In comparison, as previously reported, RAV-1 did not replicate well in the monocyte cultures, whereas RAV-2, a subgroup B avian leukosis virus, did replicate. The tropism of HPRS-103 for monocytes may relate to its ability to cause myeloid leukosis. Monocyte and bone marrow cell cultures from the six lines ranked similarly in differences in susceptibility to transformation by 966 virus and showed evidence that their relative susceptibilities correlated with susceptibility of chickens from these lines to induction of myeloid leukosis by HPRS-103, suggesting common tissue-specific viral and host factors involved in oncogenesis by these two viruses.","['0 (Gene Products, gag)']",,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Symptoms of meningitis and sepsis (fever, headache, changes in mental status) were seen in three patients who were severely neutropenic and undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for CNS relapse of their underlying malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), n = 2; Burkitt's lymphoma, n = 1). Chemotherapy had included cytosine arabinoside administered 7-14 days prior to presenting with sepsis and meningitis. All three patients had buccal mucositis or sinusitis. Blood cultures and CSF cultures showed S. mitis resistant to penicillin but sensitive to vancomycin. Vancomycin, at a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day to maximize CNS levels of antibiotic, was administered to all three children. RESULTS: Two of the patients recovered from S. mitis meningitis; recovery was associated with an improvement in their peripheral granulocyte counts. One patient, who remained neutropenic, died despite being treated with both intravenous and intraventricular vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Physicians caring for patients who are neutropenic and febrile need to be aware of the risk of meningitis occurring with S. mitis sepsis. Early treatment with high dosages of vancomycin (60 mg/kg/day) and an attempt to limit the duration of neutropenia are important factors in the outcome of such patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Imaging studies revealed multiple mass lesions in the liver, kidneys, and lungs. Liver biopsy was obtained. Immunocytochemistry for T and B lymphocytes and in situ hybridization for evidence of latent EBV infection was performed. RESULTS: Hepatic portal tracts were infiltrated with lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and large atypical mononuclear cells. Both T and B lymphocytes were present, but the large atypical cells were of B origin and were positive for latent EBV infection. Chemotherapy was discontinued, and the patient was treated with intravenous gammaglobulin, interferon, and acyclovir. He had an excellent response and has been free of disease for 19 months. CONCLUSION: EBV-related LPD can complicate the course of patients with ALL in remission. The clinical findings and diagnosis in patients with ALL are similar to other immunocompromised patients. Withdrawal of chemotherapy and treatment with immune modulators should be strongly considered.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Some patients also had concurrent central nervous system (CNS) relapse. Therapy consisted of cytosine arabinoside, 1 g/m2/day given as a 6-h infusion, followed by bolus idarubicin, 5 mg/m2/day, both daily for 6 days. Children achieving remission received maintenance therapy with 3 days of etoposide, 100 mg/m2/day, followed by ifosfamide, 2.8 g/m2/day, alternating every 3 weeks with 3 days of cytosine arabinoside and idarubicin in the dosages described earlier.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Those studied were 33 patients aged < or =18 years with either acute leukemia in first complete remission (CR) (n = 29) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase (n = 4) who received 1,320 cGy FTBI followed by high-dose VP-16 (60 mg/kg) as a preparatory regimen for BMT from matched sibling donors. Patients with acute leukemia included 18 with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), one with biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL), and 10 with selected ""high-risk"" acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Patients with ALL were selected for a high risk for recurrence: those who failed standard remission induction chemotherapy, had a t(9;22) or t(4;11) chromosomal translocation, or had certain clinical high-risk features. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, 28 patients are alive, all of them in continued complete remission for 1.1-7.8 years (median, 5.3 years; mean, 4.9 years). The Kaplan-Meier projected event-free survival (EFS) is 84.5% at 7 years, and the actuarial recurrence hazard is 6.5%. All surviving patients have a performance status of >80%. CONCLUSION: This result of early BMT in a two-institution study of pediatric patients with hematopoietic malignancies suggests that (a) matched sibling allogeneic BMT after conditioning with FTBI and high-dose VP-16 is an excellent treatment for pediatric patients with high-risk leukemia, and (b) children may have a better prognosis than adults treated with allogeneic BMT. Larger multiinstitutional cooperative trials for pediatric patients are needed to confirm this result.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']","['P01-CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA 49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

A new therapy designed specifically for infants with ALL was initiated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1984 until 1990, 82 eligible infants <1 year of age were entered on a Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) protocol 8493 for infant ALL. Compared to older patients, infants at diagnosis had more overt CNS leukemia (26%), higher initial WBC count (56% >50,000/microl), and a higher likelihood of CD-10 (CALLA) negative lymphoblasts (55%). A translocation involving chromosome 11 at band q23 was detected in 27 of 64 cytogenetically informative cases. Treatment was based upon two institutional pilot studies utilizing chemotherapy doses based upon body weight. Important components included remission induction with cyclophosphamide (Ctx), vincristine (Vcr), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and prednisone (Pred) (COAP); consolidation therapy with teniposide (VM-26) and Ara-C; and continuation therapy with alternating pulses of COAP with VM-26/Ara-C separated by a methotrexate (Mtx) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) backbone plus CNS therapy consisting of standard triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) (Mtx/hydrocortisone/Ara-C), which avoided the use of radiotherapy in this population. RESULTS: Seventy-six infants achieved a complete remission (93%). Fifty patients have relapsed: 35 isolated marrow relapses, five isolated CNS relapses, eight combined marrow and CNS relapses, and two other relapses. Actuarial event-free survival was 28% (SE = 5%) at 4 years. Infants >274 days (9 months) at diagnosis had a better outcome than those <274 days. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a modest outcome improvement in comparison to previous experience with ALL for infants treated on POG trials.

Owing to the risk of late side effects, the Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) replaced CNS irradiation with systemic high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) in 1992. A prospective study of the effects of HDMTX and intrathecal MTX on CNS function is in progress at our center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six ALL patients underwent (99m)Tc-HMPAO single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examination of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF): three owing to neurological symptoms during treatment for ALL and the other three as part of the study. RESULTS: All the patients had various degrees of disturbed rCBF, which was more pronounced in the patients with neurological symptoms. One patient had severe symptoms and impaired rCBF after three intrathecal injections of MTX but before administration of HDMTX. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired cerebral perfusion was found in patients with and without neurological symptoms during treatment for ALL. The impact of these findings is still unknown, from both the long- and the short-term perspective.

However, it is unclear whether the cytologic features, immunophenotype or grade of malignancy of the cells infiltrating the kidney differ from those of the primary tumor. This study was performed on 120 autopsy cases with the following diagnoses: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML, n = 22; subtypes M1 + M2, n = 12, subtype M4, n = 10), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML, n = 7), agnogenic myeloid metaplasia/myelofibrosis (AMM/MF, n = 6), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n = 6), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, n = 9), other low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (low-grade NHL, n = 24), high-grade NHL (n = 21) and multiple myeloma (MM, n = 25). Renal involvement was investigated by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. It was found in 34% of the cases, and was most common in ALL (83%) and low-grade NHL (50%) and least common in high-grade NHL (10%) and MM (12%). Dense infiltration of almost the entire kidney was most commonly seen in AML, low-grade NHL and ALL. Infiltration was bilateral and involved both the cortex and medulla in the majority of cases. When involvement of other organs was compared with that of the kidney, the lung was found to be involved in approximately the same number of cases, but liver involvement was more common and heart involvement less common. Reactive lymphocytic infiltration of the kidney was found in 18 of the 120 cases (15%), and was distinguished from scanty tumorous infiltration by immunohistochemical staining. No major phenotypical differences were found between the tumor cells infiltrating the kidney and those of the primary tumors in the bone marrow or lymph nodes. However, in one case of CML, the cells infiltrating the kidney were negative for KP1 and chloroacetate esterase, but could be identified by reactivity for CD34. The grade of malignancy in NHL was similar in both the nodal and renal manifestations.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Six years previously, the patient had undergone a bone marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukaemia. She had developed a deep vein thrombosis, a pulmonary embolus, and a severe graft-versus-host reaction of the skin, leading to markedly reduced mouth opening. The hip operation was performed using PDA following antithrombotic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin. Blood could initially be aspirated after advancing the PDA catheter, and a second puncture of the epidural space 1 segment higher enabled correct placement of the catheter. The patient received 500 ml Dextran 60 perioperatively and the operation was completed without any further problems. The PDA catheter was removed 2 h after the operation following the return of movement of both thighs. Fourteen hours after the completion of surgery it was noticed that the dressing over the epidural puncture site was bloodstained, the patient was incontinent, and complete loss of movement of the operated leg was present. An epidural haematoma was the suspected cause, but could not be definitely confirmed by a CT scan. Nevertheless, a laminectomy was undertaken to evacuate the suspected haematoma. As expected, tracheal intubation was only possible bronchoscopically. Intraoperatively, some low-grade epidural oozing at the level of the initial puncture site was observed, and a hemilaminectomy of 5 was performed. For the first time postoperatively, the bleeding time was measured and was markedly prolonged to 20 min (as described by Mielke, normal value up to 8 min). A coagulopathy was suggested, with the differential diagnosis of impaired platelet function. The paralysis of the plantar flexors and extensors and some sensory loss were still present 6 months after the operation. It remains uncertain whether the PDA in a patient receiving low-molecular-weight heparin resulting in a the suspected epidural haematoma was the cause of the neurological sequelae and in agreement with the consultant neurologist, we believe that a direct traumatic lesion of the L5/S1 segment or damage to the sciatic nerve are also likely causes of the symptoms. Undoubtedly, the lack of adequate postoperative neurological monitoring and the intraoperative administration of dextran despite the known epidural vascular lesion deserve criticism. This case report demonstrates the often complex development of neurological complications after nerve blocks, where a definite cause can frequently not be determined.","['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight)']",,,Neurologische Komplikation nach Totalendoprothesen-implantation der Hufte in Katheterperiduralanasthesie.,,,,,,,,

We report 15 positive cultures and 6 cases of infection among immunocompromised adults at our institution over a 10-year period and review the English-language literature on C. meningosepticum. Excluding the present series, there are 308 reports of positive cultures in the literature, of which 59% were determined to represent true infections. Sixty-five percent of those infected were younger than 3 months of age. Meningitis was the most common infectious syndrome among neonates, seen in 84% of cases and associated with a 57% mortality rate. Less commonly reported infections among infants included sepsis (13%) and pneumonia (3%). Pneumonia was the most frequent infection among the postneonatal group, accounting for 40% of cases, followed by sepsis (24%), meningitis (18%), endocarditis (3%), cellulitis (3%), abdominal infections (3%), eye infections (3%), and single case reports of sinusitis, bronchitis, and epididymitis. The 6 cases in our series were all adults, with a mean age of 58.7 years. Sites of C. meningosepticum infection were limited to the lungs, bloodstream, and biliary tree. Infection in our series was associated with prolonged hospitalization, prior exposure to multiple antibiotics, and host immunocompromise, particularly neutropenia. C. meningosepticum is resistant to multiple antibiotics, and disk dilution is notoriously unreliable for antibiotic sensitivity testing. Sensitivity testing on the 15 isolates from our institution revealed the most efficacious antibiotics to be minocycline (100% sensitive), rifampin (93%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (67%), and ciprofloxacin (53%). In contrast to reports in the literature, the isolates in our series displayed widespread resistance to vancomycin (100% resistant or intermediately sensitive), erythromycin (100%), and clindamycin (86%). These findings have important implications for the clinician when choosing empiric antibiotic regimens for patients with risk factors for C. meningosepticum infection.","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antitubercular)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)', 'VJT6J7R4TR (Rifampin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The COSY (correlated spectroscopy) spectra of [Pt(2-pyc)(dpa)]+ and [Pt(2-pys)(dpa)]+ further support the structures of the above complexes with three nitrogen and one oxygen donor atoms in the first coordination sphere of platinum(II) with 1,2-diamine or alpha-diimine and 2-pyridinecarboxylate anion behaving as bidentate ligands.

Imipenem-resistant PA bactereamias were associated with a higher incidence of septic shock (40% vs 19.8%) p. 161 0.02) and death 33.3%) than were ISPA bacteraemias. Since 1992, when first IRPA appeared, the incidence of imipenem-resistance increased tenfold, and in 1994, up to 10% of the PA populations causing bloodstream infections in cancer patients in our centre were imipenem-resistant.","['0 (Thienamycins)', '71OTZ9ZE0A (Imipenem)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In view of the unacceptably high mortality due to disseminated candidiasis, it is rational to focus on augmentation of host defense mechanisms in addition to conventional antifungal therapy. In vitro, a variety of immunomodulators, including tumor necrosis factor, interferon-g, and the hematopoietic growth factors, enhance the killing of Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Various studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of immunomodulatory therapy in animal models of disseminated candidiasis. For further preclinical and clinical studies, recombinant interferon-g, interleukin-1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and the other hematopoietic growth factors are currently the most promising immunomodulators.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, novel ligands having symmetrized coordination environment consisting of two histidine units and a pyridine (HPH) were prepared. Oxygen activating efficiency of the iron complexes of the synthetic ligands increased by introducing electron donating substituent into the pyridine ring.

Additionally, the function of P-gp was determined with the rhodamine-123 (R-123) accumulation test in combination with or without verapamil and expressed as the R123 accumulation ratio. Fractionated idarubicin (12 mg/m2/week) was given to 36 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, and eight chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients in blast crisis. Furthermore, 11 AML and four ALL patients were treated with fractionated daunorubicin at a dose of 50 mg/m2/week. All patients had been pretreated with drugs inducing P-gp-related resistance including daunorubicin and/or doxorubicin or vindesine (CML patients). Of 71 pretreated patients, 51 (72%) had a P-gp value between 25 and 98%. Six of these patients with increased P-gp expression had a nonpumping P-gp; four of them were CD34 positive. Of 51 patients with increased P-gp expression, 30 (59%) were CD34 positive. With regard to idarubicin monotherapy, overall response was 33/56 (59%) patients, and 23/33 (70%) responding patients showed a P-gp expression between 25 and 95%.

In the period 1980-1992 cancer was the cause of death of 718 children. Leukaemia was responsible for 34.5% of all childhood cancer deaths and 1.5% of all childhood deaths. The mortality of all malignant neoplasms in children decreased significantly (p = 0.0004) from 54.8 per million in 1980 to 33.9 per million in 1992. This trend is mainly due to the reduction in mortality of leukaemia, which has decreased from 22.3 per million in 1980 to 13.1 per million in 1992 (p = 0.0003). The age group 0-4 years experienced the highest overall cancer mortality (46.7 per million). The decreasing trends are primarily caused by better diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and most probably not by decreasing incidence. Due to the small number of cases this positive effect can only be demonstrated in leukaemia mortality, but not for other cancer sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, three cell types including a tumor neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro-2a), an oligodendrocyte primary culture, and a nonneuronal acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (Reh) were used to conduct successful nonradioactive in situ hybridization. Two cDNA probes were used. A 1 kb probe was used to identify the expression of proteolipid protein (PLP) mRNA in a primary culture of oligodendrocytes. A 760 bp cDNA was used to identify the expression of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1) mRNA in Neuro-2a and Reh cells. The probes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP, denatured, and hybridized with cells fixed on coverslips. The efficiency of the labeling was tested using dot blot analysis by comparing the intensity of our labeled probes with known concentration of the probe labeled by the provider. The nonspecific signals were washed off, followed by detection of a signal specific to the gene. The specificity of the probes was determined by treating the cells with RNase A, hybridizing with bacterial Dig-labeled cDNA (pBR322) and hybridizing the tissues in the absence of labeled probe. During the labeling step, we found that addition of co-precipitants, such as tRNA or glycogen, during precipitation of the labeled probe followed by overnight incubation at -20 C is essential for good recovery of labeled cDNA. Dissolving the labeled probe in a buffer solution containing sodium dodecyl sulfate improves the quantity of the labeling. At the cellular level, prehybridization treatments optimize the permeability of the cell and allow efficient penetration of the labeled probe. Fixing with paraformaldehyde or an ethanol-acetic acid mixture can preserve the structure of cultured cells. To increase the signal to noise ratio, cells were treated with 0.2 N HCl followed by extensive washes using a solution with a high salt concentration and containing dextran sulfate. This treatment significantly improves the signal and reduces the background in cell cultures, but not in tissue sections. The ability to reuse the labeled probe-hybridization mixture is another advantage for using nonradioactive in situ hybridization.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,

(-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) with a triphenol residue moderately inhibited histamine release, whereas diphenolic (+)-catechin (C) and (-)-epicatechin (EC) did not. The magnitude of the inhibitory effect was in the order EGCG > ECG > EGC. Among simple polyphenols, the triphenol compounds, pyrogallol (PG) and gallic acid (GA) exerted inhibitory activity, but the diphenols, pyrocatechol, hydroquinone, and resorcinol did not. In addition, the mixture of PG and GA inhibited histamine release as strongly as EGCG with two triphenol residues. Similarly, they inhibited histamine release induced by IgE-antigen complex stimulation more efficiently than that induced by A23187 stimulation. EGCG did not inhibit the increase of intracellular Ca2+ in RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with A23187 or IgE antigen. These results indicate that the triphenol structure plays an important role in the inhibitory activity of tea polyphenols.

In contrast, cAMP accumulation in response to cholera toxin (CHO; 10(-4) gml-1, 120 min) was not different in control subjects (70.07 +/- 31.30 pmol 10(-6) cells) and CLL patients (stage A 95.24 +/- 123.07, stage B 70.76 +/- 57.37, stage C 33.21 +/- 33.73 pmol 10(-6) cells). When stimulated with forskolin (100 mumol L-1, 15 min), control MNLs produced about ten-fold more cAMP than CLL MNLs (188.56 +/- 92.53 vs. 17.88 +/- 10.32 pmol 10(-6) cells); this response was not stage dependent. Taken together, the results show that the beta 2-AR transmembrane signalling is impaired in CLL patients. The correlation of some beta 2-AR signalling defects with disease progression suggests that they may contribute to the disease progression of CLL patients.","['0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to initiation of therapy 31P spectra of sera of patients with acute leukemia differed from spectra of sera of normal individuals. Peak intensities of the PL were low in relation to Pi. During therapy leading to remission, resonance from PL progressively increased approximately to the spectral pattern in normal sera.

It is not known, however, whether a similar phenomenon occurs in leukemia. Angiogenesis was characterized immunohistochemically by factor VIII staining of bone marrow biopsies and quantified by assessment of microvessel density using previously described techniques. We evaluated bone marrow biopsies from 40 children with newly diagnosed, untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In 22 of the patients, we also evaluated angiogenesis after the completion of remission induction chemotherapy. Control specimens were obtained from children undergoing staging evaluations at the time of diagnosis of solid tumors and lymphomas. Microvessels were counted throughout the entire core specimen in consecutive x 200 fields, and a median count per field (cpf) was calculated. In addition, the number of microvessels in the single x 200 field with the highest microvessel density was designated as the ""hot spot."" Biopsies from children with leukemia and from controls showed median microvessel densities of 42 and 6 counts per field, respectively (P < or = 0.0001). Microvessel density of the hot spots of leukemia specimens and controls were also significantly different, 51 and 8, respectively (P < or = 0.0001). A computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction model of bone marrow vascularity showed a complex, arborizing branching of microvessels in leukemic specimens compared with single, straight microvessels without branching in controls. Urinary basic fibroblast growth factor, a potent angiogenic factor, was measured in 22 of the children with newly diagnosed leukemia and in 39 normal, age-matched controls. Urinary basic fibroblast growth factor levels were increased in all 22 patients before treatment, were variable during induction chemotherapy, and demonstrated statistically insignificant decreases at the time of complete remission. These findings suggest that leukemia cells induce angiogenesis in the bone marrow and that leukemia might be angiogenesis dependent and raise the possibility for a role of antiangiogenic drugs in the treatment of leukemia.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",['CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC1857903,,,,

Among the 49 gliomas, immunopositivity (defined as > or = 10%) was observed for Bcl-2 in 45 (92%), Bcl-X in 48 (98%), Mcl-1 in 49 (100%), and Bax in 48 (98%) of 49 specimens. In 11 (37%) of 30 astrocytomas (WHO grades I to III), the tumor specimens were composed predominantly of malignant cells with strong-intensity Bcl-2 immunostaining, whereas none of the 19 GMs (WHO grade IV) exhibited strong-intensity Bcl-2 immunoreactivity (P = 0.001). Similarly, Mcl-1 immunointensity was strong in 15 (50%) of 30 astrocytomas, compared with only 2 (11%) of 19 GMs (P = 0.005). The percentage of Mcl-1-immunopositive tumor cells was also higher in astrocytomas than GMs (P < 0.002). Thus, contrary to a priori expectations, the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 was significantly higher in astrocytomas than in GMs. Of the 16 MBs, immunopositivity was found for Bcl-2 in 4 (25%), Bcl-X in 9 (56%), Mcl-1 in 8 (50%), and Bax in 16 (100%) of the cases. The intensity of immunostaining was strong for Bcl-2 in only 1 (6%) specimen, for Bcl-X in 3 (19%), and for Mcl-1 in 2 (12.5%), in contrast to Bax immunostaining, which was strong in 12 (75%) tumors. Significantly higher percentages of Bax-immunopositive tumor cells were also found in MBs, compared with Bcl-2, Bcl-X, and Mcl-1 (P < 0.0001). All 19 NBs were immunopositive for Bcl-2, Bcl-X, Mcl-1, and Bax. Higher percentages of Bcl-X- and Mcl-1-immunopositive tumor cells were observed in well differentiated tumors (P = 0.04 and 0.004, respectively). The intensity of Mcl-1 immunostaining was also generally higher in differentiated than undifferentiated NBs (strong immunointensity in 7 of 10 versus 0 of 9; P = 0.002). Conversely, strong-intensity Bax immunostaining was associated with undifferentiated histology (5 of 9 (56%) versus 1 of 10 (10%); P = 0.03). Taken together, these findings begin to delineate trends in the regulation of the relative levels of the Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-X, Mcl-1, and Bax in gliomas, MBs, NBs, and some of their histological subtypes. The suggestion that expression of some of these Bcl-2 family genes may be differentially regulated in association with tumor progression and differentiation provides insights into the diverse biology and clinical behavior of these tumors of nervous system origin.","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",['CA-60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC1857882,,,,

We also showed that the integrity of the HIV-1 matrix domain is critical for the incorporation of wild-type HIV-1 Env protein but not for the incorporation of a truncated form which lacks the 144 C-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane glycoprotein. We report here that the C-terminal truncation of the transmembrane glycoprotein also allows the efficient incorporation of HIV-1 Env proteins into viral particles formed by the Gag proteins of the widely divergent Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV). Additionally, pseudotyping of a Mo-MLV-based vector with the truncated rather than the full-length HIV-1 Env allowed efficient transduction of human CD4+ cells.

The hybrid virus could be propagated in human T-cell lines, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of rhesus macaques, and in CD4- B-cell lines. Because of the expanded cell tropism, the hybrid virus might have a selective advantage in comparison to parental viruses. Therefore, emerging chimeric viruses may be considered a serious risk of xenotransplantation. A note of caution is also suggested for the use of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors for human gene therapy.","['0 (Gene Products, env)']",,,,,,,PMC191473,,,,

Bovine sera from animals naturally infected with BLV blocked gp51 binding to recombinant BLVRcp1. In contrast, virus-neutralizing MAbs specific for gp51 F, G, and H epitopes did not prevent gp51-receptor attachment. Furthermore, gp51 neutralization epitopes F, G, and H were accessible to antibodies following gp51 attachment to BLVRcp1. This finding implies that virus neutralization by MAbs to defined BLV gp51 epitopes can occur subsequent to virus engagement of the receptor while polyclonal sera can specifically block virus attachment to the receptor.

Recent studies have demonstrated that expression of HIV mutant transdominant proteins, RNA decoys, and ribozymes efficiently inhibited HIV replication. We have previously shown that an RNA decoy (stem-loop II of the Rev response element of HIV type 1 [HIV-1], named SL2) and a ribozyme (Rz) targeting the U5 region of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), combined in a fusion molecule, was more efficient in inhibiting HIV-1 replication than the ribozyme or the decoy alone. In this study, we expressed this fusion molecule in a retrovirus-based double-copy vector to obtain higher expression of this molecule. Furthermore, we inserted a sequence internally to drive expression of another fusion molecule with a ribozyme targeting the env/rev region linked to SL2 to obtain a triple-copy vector. These multigene antiviral vectors were subsequently transduced or transfected into human CD4+ T cells (Molt-4). Results showed that the translocation of the SL2-Rz cassette from the 3' to the 5' LTR occurred in 80% of the transduced cells. The numbers of ribozyme RNA transcripts, estimated by competitive-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, were 1.2 x 10(5), 1.2 x 10(4), and 1.5 x 10(3) copies per cell for the triple-copy, double-copy, and single-copy vectors, respectively. Cell challenge with multiple subtypes of HIV-1 (clades A to E) showed commensurate levels of virus inhibition for the three vectors. This study suggests that the combination of multiple anti-HIV genes, such as ribozymes and decoys, targeting multiple sites of HIV RNA and expressed at high levels are promising for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.","['0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",['DK49618/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC191434,,,,

This report presents an analysis of the functional interactions between Rex and the x-III proteins, results of which suggest a role for the x-III proteins as negative regulators of Rex function. Cotransfection assays demonstrated that the x-III proteins were able to inhibit the ability of Rex to activate the expression of a Rex-dependent mRNA. Analysis of intracellular compartmentalization in actinomycin D-treated cells showed that coexpression of the x-III proteins resulted in the sequestration of Rex into the nuclear compartment. Subcellular fractionation studies showed that Rex was preferentially localized in the cytoplasmic or nuclear fraction depending on its phosphorylation status and that coexpression of Rex with the x-III proteins changed the phosphorylation pattern of Rex and the intracellular distribution of the x-III proteins. In vitro protein binding assays demonstrated the formation of Rex-Rex homomultimeric complexes; however, mixed Rex/x-III multimers were not detected. These findings indicated a correlation between phosphorylation and intracellular trafficking of Rex and suggested that the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of the x-III proteins might result from an interference with these processes.","['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,,,,,PMC191405,,,,

These samples were derived from two groups of children with ALL: 17 good outcome patients who are in long-term continuous complete remission and 17 poor outcome patients who did not achieve a complete remission or relapsed within 6 months of achieving remission. RESULTS: Two children within the poor outcome group were found to have p53 gene mutations. Furthermore, five poor outcome patients were shown to have greater than 10-fold overexpression of mdm-2 protein compared with the mean level of mdm-2 protein measured in the good outcome group.

The limited number of clinically useful genetic markers in this leukemia subtype prompted us to assess TEL status as a predictor of treatment outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined the status of the TEL gene (rearranged or germline) in 188 cases of B-precursor acute leukemia using Southern blot analysis and related the findings to event-free survival. All comparisons of outcome were stratified by treatment regimen, risk classification, age, and leukocyte count. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (26%) had a rearranged TEL gene. At 5 years of follow-up, an estimated 91% +/- 5% (SE) of this group were event-free survivors, compared with only 65% +/- 5% of the group with germline TEL (stratified log-rank P = .011). For nonhyperdiploid patients, the odds ratio of an adverse event in the germline TEL group to that for the rearranged TEL group was 4.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.86 to 8.84). The relationship of TEL rearrangement to a favorable prognosis was independent of recognized good-risk features in B-precursor leukemia, including age, initial leukocyte count, and hyperdiploidy. CONCLUSION: Rearrangement of the TEL gene distinguishes a large subset of children with favorable-prognosis B-precursor leukemia who cannot be identified by standard prognostic features. It may be possible to treat these patients less aggressively without loss of therapeutic efficacy.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']","['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients undergoing induction therapy for acute leukemia were randomized to receive prophylactic apheresis platelet concentrates when the platelet count was either < or = 10,000/microL or < or = 20,000/microL. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the total number of bleeding episodes per patient with a median of four in the < or = 10,000/microL arm and two in the < or = 20,000/microL arm (25th to 75th percentiles of 2, 7 and 1, 5, respectively; P = .12). Patients randomized to the < or = 10,000/microL arm received more platelet transfusions for bleeding [one (0, 2) v zero (0, 0); P = .0003]. In contrast, patients on the < or = 20,000/microL arm received more platelet transfusions for prophylactic indications [10 (5, 14) v six (3, 8); P = 0.001], as would be expected, but less for bleeding. Nevertheless, the total number of platelet transfusions given to patients on the < or = 20,000/microL arm was higher and nearly significant [11 (6, 15) v seven (5, 11); P = .07]. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to RBC transfusion requirements, febrile days, days hospitalized, days thrombocytopenic, need for HLA-matched platelets, remission rate, or death during induction chemotherapy. No patient in either group died from hemorrhage or underwent major surgery for bleeding complications. CONCLUSION: Giving prophylactic platelets at a threshold of < or = 10,000/microL compared with < or = 20,000/microL can decrease the total utilization of platelets with only a small adverse effect on bleeding, and no statistically significant effect on morbidity.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with active HCL were treated with 2-CdA by continuous intravenous infusion at 0.1 mg/kg/d for a total of 7 days at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center between September 1990 and August 1992. Here we report on all patients followed-up until April 1996. RESULTS: At 3 months after treatment, complete response (CR) occurred in 37 patients (76%) and partial response (PR) occurred in 12 patients (24%), for an overall response rate of 100% (95% confidence interval, 94% to 100%). At a median follow-up of 55 months, the relapse-free survival is 80% and overall survival is 95%. Ten patients (20%) have relapsed. Of the 26 patients in whom lymphocyte phenotyping was performed, four were found to have a CD25-negative phenotype. All four of these patients had PRs only and all relapsed. Eight patients have been re-treated with 2-CdA, and all achieved at least a partial remission; two of these have already relapsed with remission durations of less than 1 year. Five second malignancies have occurred in four patients. CONCLUSION: With a median follow-up of more than 4 years, 39 patients (80%) continue in remission. Only two deaths have occurred. A CD25-negative phenotype may predict for a poorer response to 2-CdA. Patients who relapse may be re-treated with 2-CdA, but subsequent remissions may be of shorter duration.

The growth effect of PAB13, PAB15 and PAB23 was investigated in relation to their phosphodiesterase-inhibitory action and their activity on purinoceptors. Inhibition in cell growth was up to 71.0%, 76.3% and 89.7% for PAB23, PAB13 and PAB15, respectively and 100% for adenosine. Cell viability was affected in a concentration-dependent manner by PAB13, PAB15 and adenosine, with a correlation between growth inhibition and cytotoxicity. These effects of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine derivatives were found to be unrelated to an action on purinoceptors, but rather appear quantitatively linked to their ability in inducing apoptosis through their cAMP-increasing and phosphodiesterase-inhibitory potency.","['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of such compounds in vivo will depend on their transport into the relevant nitric oxide synthase-containing cells; in fact, inhibition may actually be augmented if cellular uptake of L-arginine is also blocked by the analogs. Because vascular endothelial cells synthesize vasoactive nitric oxide under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions, we have performed inhibition analyses with novel arginine analogs to determine the substrate specificity of the primary L-arginine transport system.

Dixon plots suggest competitive inhibition and apparent Ki values, which ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 mM, estimated for each inhibitor. Some influence of amino acid side chain structure could be detected, but in general, the data establish that this transport system accepts a broad range of arginine derivatives. Loading the cells with individual arginine analogs resulted in trans-stimulation of arginine uptake suggesting that they serve as substrates of System y+ as well as inhibitors.

METHODS: Formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue blocks of 12 cases of B-SLL and 12 cases of MCL were retrieved from the files of the Department of Pathology, Southampton University Hospitals Trust. Following antigen retrieval, where appropriate, sections were stained for CD3, CD5, CD20, CD23, CD43, Cyclin D, PGP9.5, and MIB1 using a streptavidin-biotin complex technique. RESULTS: CD20 stained the neoplastic cells of B-SLL and MCL, and CD3 labelled the reactive T cells in these tumours. In B-SLL, the T cells were generally dispersed among the tumour cells, whereas in MCL they often formed bands around tumour cell nodules. CD5 could be detected on T cells, following antigen retrieval. The level of expression on B cells of B-SLL and MCL was generally too low to allow detection in paraffin wax embedded tissues. CD23 stained B-SLL but not MCL. However, it could be detected in only five of the 12 cases of B-SLL. CD43 could be detected in most cases of B-SLL and MCL. It is not, therefore, of value in distinguishing between these tumours. It will, however, help in the differentiation of B-SLL and MCL from other low grade B cell lymphomas, such as follicle centre cell and marginal zone lymphomas. Cyclin D was expressed in all of the MCL but in none of the B-SLL. PGP9.5 showed reactivity in most cases of MCL and much weaker reactivity in B-SLL. The proliferation indexes of MCL were generally higher than those of B-SLL, as measured by MIB1 labelling. Both tumours, however, showed a wide range of values and considerable overlap. CONCLUSION: Staining for Cyclin D is the most reliable immunohistochemical mean of differentiating between B-SLL an MCL.

We examined the integrin-triggered cell survival signal and associated pathways in CD3+ T cells derived from 69 HIV-1-infected individuals in comparison with healthy controls. We found beta1 integrin-mediated costimulation of TCR-induced T cell proliferation and protection from aberrant cell death to be absent in the majority of patients with AIDS, but intact in asymptomatic, infected individuals. The lack of integrin-mediated rescue may be partly due to an early impairment of TCR/integrin-costimulated secretion of IFN-gamma, a type 1 lymphokine that protects against TCR-induced apoptosis of T cells from HIV-seropositive donors, but not loss of integrin expression. The mechanism of integrin hyporesponsiveness appeared to correlate with a failure of the integrin-generated signal to induce pp125FAK mRNA and protein expression. Protein kinase C activation in CD3+ T cells following integrin stimulation was also impaired in HIV-infected individuals, mostly among the symptomatic/AIDS patients. Protein kinase C inactivation in T cells was shown to have a destabilizing effect in vitro on pp125FAK mRNA that contains an AUUUA motif in the 3'-untranslated region, a consensus sequence for the AU-rich elements responsible for mRNA destabilization. These aberrant changes in pp125FAK expression may have direct significance to the overall immunopathogenesis during infection with HIV-1.","['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,

Human TEC express TGF-beta R and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and produce TGF-beta 3 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, EGF has been shown to increase IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 mRNA and protein levels in human TEC. Since EGF has been shown to modulate TGF-beta effector functions, we determined whether TGF-beta can modulate EGF-mediated increases in cytokine gene expression in human TEC. We established that a single TEC expresses both EGF receptor and TGF-beta R. TGF-beta plus EGF synergistically increased leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), additively increased IL-6, but had little effect on IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA levels. In contrast, TGF-beta alone increased LIF and IL-6, had little effect on IL-1 alpha, and slightly decreased IL-1 beta mRNA levels. The increases in LIF and IL-6 mRNA levels by TGF-beta plus EGF correlate with the increases in LIF and IL-6 concentrations in TEC culture supernatants as detected by ELISA. We also determined the mechanism responsible for the increases in cytokine mRNA levels. TGF-beta plus EGF did not affect transcription of LIF and IL-6 genes; this suggests that the increases in the steady state levels of cytokine mRNA were mediated post-transcriptionally, most likely at the level of mRNA stability. Our data demonstrate that TGF-beta modulates TEC cytokine production.

BCLL is associated with secondary immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia. It has been suggested that T-cell dysregulation may play a role in the hypogammaglobulinemia and in the increased incidence of autoimmunity in BCLL patients. We attempted to transfer human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BCLL patients in different stages of the disease into immunodeficient mice. PBMC from BCLL patients in stage 0, stages I to II, and stages III to IV were transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of lethally irradiated Balb/c or beige/nude/Xid (BNX) mice radioprotected with bone marrow (BM) from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Different engraftment profiles were found in the chimeric mice 2 weeks after transplantation of PBMC according to the disease stage of the BCLL donors. Infusion of PBMC from donors in stage 0 led to marked engraftment of human T cells, whereas the human tumor cells could hardly be detected. In contrast, chimeric mice receiving PBMC from patients in stage III to IV disease exhibited engraftment with a dominance of tumor cells, compared with a miniscule level of T cells. The ability of the engrafted cells to produce human Ig was also found to be correlated with the disease stage of the donor, although all donors had the same magnitude of hypogammaglobulinemia. Total human Ig production in the chimeric mice was normal in mice receiving PBMC from donors in stage 0, whereas in chimeric mice engrafted with PBMC from donors in stages III to IV almost no human Igs could be detected. This differential reconstitution of antibody production in the mouse model according to the stage of the patient's disease will allow further studies on possible cellular interactions between malignant and immune cells in BCLL.",['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],,,,,,,,,,,

Before immune cell transfer, recipient DBA/2 mice were sublethally irradiated with 5 Gy to prevent host-versus-graft reactivity. Recipients were either bearing syngeneic metastatic ESb lymphomas (GVL system) or were normal, non-tumor-bearing mice (GVH system). We previously reported that this adoptive immunotherapy protocol (ADI) had pronounced GVL activity and led to immune rejection of even advanced metastasized cancer. In this study, monoclonal antibodies were used for immunohistochemical analysis of native frozen tissue sections from either spleen or liver to distinguish donor from host cells, to differentiate between CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes, and to stain sialoadhesin-positive macrophages at different time points after cell transfer. The kinetics of donor cell infiltration in spleen and liver differed in that the lymphoid organ was infiltrated earlier (days 1 to 5 after transfer) than the nonlymphoid organ (days 5 to 20). After reaching a peak, donor cell infiltration decreased gradually and was not detectable in the spleen after day 20 and in the liver after day 30. The organ-infiltrating donor immune cells were mostly T lymphocytes and stained positive for CD4 or CD8 T-cell markers. A remarkable GVL-associated observation was made with regard to a subset of macrophages bearing the adhesion molecule sialoadhesin (SER+ macrophages). In the livers of tumor-bearing mice, their numbers increased between days 1 and 12 after ADI by a factor greater than 30. Double-staining for donor cell marker and SER showed that the sialoadhesin-expressing macrophages were of host origin. The SER+ host macrophages from GVL livers were isolated by enzyme perfusion and rosetting 12 days after ADI, when they reached peak values of about 60 cells per liver lobule, and were tested, without further antigen addition, for their capacity to stimulate an antitumor CD8 T-cell response. The results of this immunologic analysis suggest that these cells in the liver function as scavengers of the destroyed metastases and as antigen-processing and -presenting cells for antitumor immune T cells.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1)', '0 (Siglec1 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies showed that such SEA-directed T cells efficiently lysed chronic B-lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. Next, we made a mutated SEA-protein A (SEAm-PA) fusion protein with more than 1,000-fold reduced binding affinity for MHC class II compared with native SEA. The fusion protein was successfully used to direct T cells to B-CLL cells coated with different B lineage-directed monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). In this communication, we constructed a recombinant anti-CD19-Fab-SEAm fusion protein. The MHC class II binding capacity of the SEA part was drastically reduced by a D227A point mutation, whereas the T-cell activation properties were retained. The Fab part of the fusion protein displayed a binding affinity for CD19+ cells in the nanomolar range. The anti-CD19-Fab-SEAm molecule mediated effective, specific, rapid, and perforin-like T-cell lysis of B-CLL cells at low effector to target cell ratios. Normal CD19+ B cells were sensitive to lysis, whereas CD34+ progenitor cells and monocytes/macrophages were resistant. A panel of CD19+ B-cell lines representing different B-cell developmental stages were efficiently lysed, and the sensitivity correlated with surface ICAM-1 expression. The anti-CD19-Fab-SEAm fusion protein mediated highly effective killing of tumor biopsy cells representing several types of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Humanized severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice carrying Daudi lymphoma cells were used as an in vivo therapy model for evaluation of the anti-CD19-Fab-SEAm fusion protein.

To attempt to improve on these systems, an International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop combined cytogenetic, morphological, and clinical data from seven large previously reported risk-based studies that had generated prognostic systems. A global analysis was performed on these patients, and critical prognostic variables were re-evaluated to generate a consensus prognostic system, particularly using a more refined bone marrow (BM) cytogenetic classification. Univariate analysis indicated that the major variables having an impact on disease outcome for evolution to acute myeloid leukemia were cytogenetic abnormalities, percentage of BM myeloblasts, and number of cytopenias; for survival, in addition to the above, variables also included age and gender. Cytogenetic subgroups of outcome were as follows: ""good"" outcomes were normal, -Y alone, del(5q) alone, del(20q) alone; ""poor"" outcomes were complex (ie, > or = 3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 anomalies; and ""intermediate"" outcomes were other abnormalities. Multivariate analysis combined these cytogenetic subgroups with percentage of BM blasts and number of cytopenias to generate a prognostic model. Weighting these variables by their statistical power separated patients into distinctive subgroups of risk for 25% of patients to undergo evolution to acute myeloid leukemia, with: low (31% of patients), 9.4 years; intermediate-1 (INT-1; 39%), 3.3 years; INT-2 (22%), 1.1 years; and high (8%), 0.2 year. These features also separated patients into similar distinctive risk groups for median survival: low, 5.7 years; INT-1, 3.5 years; INT-2, 1.2 years; and high, 0.4 year. Stratification for age further improved analysis of survival.

The internal PS is externalized when cells undergo apoptosis; however, the mechanism for this is largely unknown. To study the mechanism of PS externalization during development of apoptosis, we examined the correlation between the activation of interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) family protease and PS externalization in human monocytic leukemia U937 cells and in their apoptosis-resistant variants, UK711 and UK110, after treatment with etoposide and anti-Fas antibody. We found that PS externalization accompanied the development of apoptosis and the activation of ICE family proteases in these cell lines. Furthermore, inhibitors of ICE family proteases, Z-Asp and Z-VAD, prevented apoptosis and PS externalization in etoposide-treated U937 cells. These results indicate that PS externalization is a downstream event of ICE family protease activation during apoptosis development. Because ICE family proteases play a crucial role in apoptosis, PS externalization could be a rational and useful marker for the development of apoptosis.","['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although several lines of evidence indicate that CD30L plays a key role as a paracrine- or autocrine-acting surface molecule in the deregulated cytokine cascade of Hodgkin's disease, little is known regarding its distribution and biologic significance in other human hematopoietic malignancies. By analyzing tumor cells from 181 patients with RNA studies and immunostaining by the anti-CD30L monoclonal antibody M80, we were able to show that human hematopoietic malignancies of different lineage and maturation stage display a frequent and broad expression of the ligand. CD30L mRNA and surface protein were detected in 60% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), 54% of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs), and in a consistent fraction (68%) of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. In this latter group, hairy cell leukemia and high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) expressed a higher surface density of CD30L as compared with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and low-grade B-NHL. Purified plasmacells from a fraction of multiple myeloma patients also displayed CD30L mRNA and protein. A more restricted expression of CD30L was found in T-cell tumors that was mainly confined to neoplasms with an activated peripheral T-cell phenotype, such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, peripheral T-NHL, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. In contrast, none of the T-lineage ALLs analyzed expressed the ligand. In AML, a high cellular density of CD30L was detected in French-American-British M3, M4, and M5 phenotypes, which are directly associated with the presence on tumor cells of certain surface structures, including the p55 interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain, the alpha(M) (CD11b) chain of beta2 integrins, and the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54). Analysis of normal hematopoietic cells evidenced that, in addition to circulating and tonsil B cells, a fraction of bone marrow myeloid precursors, erythroblasts, and subsets of megakaryocytes also express CD30L. Finally, we have shown that native CD30L expressed on primary leukemic cells is functionally active by triggering both mitogenic and antiproliferative signals on CD30+ target cells. As opposed to CD30L, only 10 of 181 primary tumors expressed CD30 mRNA or protein, rendering therefore unlikely a CD30-CD30L autocrine loop in human hematopoietic neoplasms. Taken together, our data indicate that CD30L is widely expressed from early to late stages of human hematopoiesis and suggest a regulatory role for this molecule in the interactions of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells with CD30+ immune effectors and/or microenvironmental accessory cells.","['0 (CD30 Ligand)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (TNFSF8 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The association of -7/7q- with myeloid leukemia suggests that these regions contain a novel tumor suppressor gene(s) whose loss of function contributes to leukemic transformation or tumor progression. Based on chromosome banding analysis, two critical regions have been identified: one in band 7q22 and a second in bands 7q32-q35. We analyzed bone marrow and blood samples from 21 patients with myeloid leukemia (chronic myeloid leukemia, n = 2; de novo MDS, n = 4; de novo AML, n = 13; t-AML, n = 2) that on chromosome banding analysis exhibited deletions (n = 19) or reciprocal translocations (n = 2) of band 7q22 using fluorescence in situ hybridization. As probes, we used Alu-polymerase chain reaction products from 22 yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones that span chromosome bands 7q21.1-q32, including representative clones from a panel of YACs recognizing a contiguous genomic DNA fragment of 5 to 6 Mb in band 7q22. In the 19 cases with deletions, we identified two distinct commonly deleted regions: one region within band 7q22 was defined by the two CML cases; the second region encompassed a distal part of band 7q22 and the entire band 7q31 and was defined by the MDS/AML cases. The breakpoint of one of the reciprocal translocations was mapped to 7q21.3, which is centromeric to both of the commonly deleted regions. The breakpoint of the second translocation, which was present in unstimulated bone marrow and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated blood of an MDS patient, was localized to a 400-kb genomic segment in 7q22 within the deletion cluster of the MDS/AML cases. In conclusion, our data show marked heterogeneity of 7q22 deletion and translocation breakpoints in myeloid leukemias, suggesting the existence of more than one pathogenetically relevant gene.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of Shc in established murine fibroblasts results in oncogenic transformation, indicating that Shc has oncogenic potential. Shc proteins contain a carboxy terminal SH2 domain and a novel non-SH2 phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain that specifically recognizes a phosphorylated NPXpY motif in target proteins such as the epidermal growth factor receptor. We show here that Shc is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in all primary acute myeloid leukemias analyzed and that, in some of these leukemias, Shc is associated through its PTB domain with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 140 kD (p140) in vivo. In factor-dependent cells, this 140-kD protein can be tyrosine-phosphorylated in vitro in response to cytokines involved in myeloid proliferation and differentiation, ie, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and colony-stimulating factor-1. A similar or identical protein of 140 kD is constitutively bound to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 in the same acute myeloid leukemias. In addition to p140, other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 61 and 200 kD are constitutively associated with Shc in some of the leukemias analyzed.

To determine the incidence of abnormalities of p53, we analyzed 19 cases of B-PLL by DNA blot to assess loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 17p13.3, by immunocytochemistry to assess p53 expression, and by direct DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified exons 5 to 9 of the p53 gene. LOH was detected in 10 of 19 (53%) cases, p53 expression was detected in 8 of 17 (47%), and p53 mutations were detected in 10 of 19 (53%) cases. The pattern of mutations was distinct from that observed in other B-cell malignancies. Six cases exhibited missense mutations; 4 were transversions and 2 were transitions. The G:C --> A:T transition at cathepsin G dinucleotides commonly reported in p53 mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other hematologic malignancies was observed in only 1 case of B-PLL. Three cases exhibited deletions (ranging from 3 to 35 bp in length) and one case exhibited a 2-bp insertion. In 1 case, a 27-bp deletion resulted in the expression of a p53 protein lacking 9 amino acids from the DNA binding region. All samples with p53 mutation showed loss of germline p53 sequences. However, 3 of 10 showed no LOH by Southern blot, indicating a localized deletion around the p53 locus at 17p13.1. Five of the 10 cases with p53 mutation exhibited detectable p53 expression, including 4 cases with p53 missense mutation and 1 case with deletion. Two of 7 cases with no detectable mutation of p53 nevertheless overexpressed p53. Therefore, there was no correlation between protein expression and p53 mutation in B-PLL. Our data indicate that the overall abnormalities of p53 occurred in 14 of 19 (75%) cases of B-PLL. The frequency of p53 mutation (53%) in B-PLL is the highest reported in B-cell malignancies and may be responsible for the frequent resistance to therapy of this disease. In addition, the pattern of p53 mutation was different from that observed in CLL and other hematologic malignancies and may indicate that a distinct pathogenic mechanism operates in B-PLL.",['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-seven percent of the newly diagnosed patients had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 200 mg/dL during asparaginase therapy; 15 patients (42%) had levels greater than 400 mg/ dL, 7 with levels greater than 1,000 mg/dL. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia did not vary by type of asparaginase or risk status of ALL (defined by white blood cell count and age). None of the 7 patients with triglyceride levels greater than 1,000 mg/dL developed pancreatitis. In contrast, 4 of the 13 patients without triglyceride elevation developed pancreatitis; 3 of the 4 patients had fasting studies at the height of their abdominal pain. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of lipid subclasses showed a significant increase in the smaller, denser forms of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and negligible chylomicron fraction in a subset of patients with marked triglyceride elevation. Lipoprotein lipase activity was consistently above normative values for all levels of triglyceride and could not be explained by obesity or hyperglycemia. Apolipoprotein B(100) levels increased during asparaginase therapy, although the mechanism of this remains unclear. LDL reciprocally decreased with increased VLDL during asparaginase therapy. After asparaginase therapy, triglyceride levels (mean, 73 mg/dL [SD 33]) were significantly lower than levels obtained during asparaginase therapy. Triglyceride levels for survivors did not differ from the normal range or postasparaginase levels in the newly diagnosed patients. These data show a striking temporal association between asparaginase therapy and hypertriglyceridemia. Changes in cholesterol, in contrast, were not temporally related to asparaginase treatment. Cholesterol levels were elevated (>200 mg/dL) in 20% of the patients after asparaginase, which may be due to continued treatment with corticosteroids. The mean cholesterol level of long-term survivors of 177 mg/dL was significantly higher than the norm (P = .045). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were significantly lower than normal at all time periods and for both populations; 25% of survivors had HDL levels less than 35 mg/dL. We conclude that modifications in asparaginase therapy are not necessary. In cases of triglyceride elevation greater than 2,000 mg/dL when the risk of pancreatitis is increased, close clinical monitoring is imperative. Larger studies are needed to determine the incidence of dyslipidemia in long-term survivors of ALL as well as the relationship between lipid abnormalities and other late effects of treatment, notably obesity and cardiomyopathies.","['0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)', '0 (Apolipoprotein B-100)', '0 (Apolipoproteins B)', '0 (Cholesterol, HDL)', '0 (Cholesterol, LDL)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Triglycerides)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']","['CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK02456/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R 000199/FD/FDA HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

We have previously cloned a cDNA for the murine 150-kD protein, SHIP, and found that it encodes a unique signaling intermediate that binds the SHC PTB domain through at least one tyrosine phosphorylated (NPXY) site in the carboxyl-terminal region. SHIP also contains several potential SH3 domain-binding sites, an SH2 domain for binding other tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, and an enzymatic activity that removes the phosphate from the 5 position of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate or from inositol 1,3,4,5-phosphate. SHIP has a negative effect on cell growth and therefore loss or modification may have profound effects on hematopoietic cell development. In this study, we have cloned a cDNA for human SHIP and examined mRNA and protein expression of SHIP and related species in bone marrow and blood cells. Flow cytometry indicates that at least 74% of immature CD34+ cells express SHIP cross-reacting protein species, whereas within the more mature population of CD33+ cells, only 10% of cells have similar expression. The majority of T cells react positively with the anti-SHIP antibodies, but significantly fewer B cells are positive. Immunoblotting detects up to seven different cross-reacting SHIP species, with peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibiting primarily a 100-kD protein and a CD34+ acute myeloblastic leukemia expressing mainly 130-kD and 145-kD forms of SHIP. Overall, these results indicate that there is an enormous diversity in the size of SHIP or SHIP-related mRNA and protein species.

One pathway of apoptosis in malignant lymphoid cells is mediated by the Fas antigen. We studied the human myeloma (8226) and T-cell leukemia (CEM) cell lines selected for resistance to the anthracenes, doxorubicin or mitoxantrone, by continuous culture in the presence of either agent. We found that these drug-resistant cell lines were also resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The degree of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis correlated directly with the level of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. These observations indicate that, as cancer cell lines develop mechanisms of drug resistance, they may also develop mechanisms of resistance to physiologic signals of apoptosis. Two mechanisms of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis were observed in these cell lines. One mechanism was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the surface expression of Fas antigen. Analysis of RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays showed that the reduction of Fas antigen expression occurred at the level of transcription. A second mechanism of drug resistance showed no decrease of Fas antigen expression; however, the apoptotic response was diminished. In this situation, removal of the chemotherapeutic agent resulted in a partial reversion to chemosensitivity and re-expression of the Fas antigen, but these cell lines did not regain the ability to undergo apoptosis in response to cross-linking by anti-Fas antibody. These findings support the hypothesis that apoptosis mediated by both chemotherapeutic agents and physiologic stimuli may share a common downstream effector. The demonstration that selection for drug resistance in hematopoietic cell lines results in a simultaneous resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis may have clinical implications in the development of strategies for the treatment of resistant disease. Further analysis of the molecular mechanisms of Fas expression and function will facilitate the design of biological response modifying agents for the treatment of malignancy.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of acute leukemia is established in most cases by a bone marrow aspirate that demonstrates at least 30% blast cells. The traditional criteria to distinguish between AML and ALL rely on morphology and cytochemical reactions. Immunologic analysis of antigen expression and analysis for numerical or structural chromosomal abnormalities of leukemia cells are routinely feasible. Karyotypic analysis is of prognostic importance and should be performed on all diagnostic specimens of bone marrow aspirate. Immunophenotypic analysis may be useful to confirm the disease classification in selected cases. The importance of the routine immunophenotypic characterization of acute leukemia, however, is controversial. The subtypes that must be recognized because of the need for specific treatment include (a) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is the M3 subtype of AML, and (b) the L3 subtype or mature B-cell ALL. Induction therapy for acute leukemia is treatment intended to achieve induction of complete remission (CR). Complete remission is defined as the absence of morphologic evidence of leukemia after recovery of the peripheral blood cell counts. Failure to achieve CR may be attributed to death during chemotherapy-induced bone marrow hypoplasia or to drug resistance manifested either as failure to achieve hypoplasia or as persistent leukemia after recovery from hypoplasia. Postremission therapy is treatment administered in CR to prevent or delay relapse of the leukemia. However, the majority of patients have disease relapse. Intensification of therapy is a treatment strategy designed to overcome resistance to chemotherapy. Recent clinical trials of intensified induction or postremission therapy suggest improved outcome. However, the toxic effects of dose intensification can be substantial, limiting any potential benefit of this approach. Identification of prognostic factors may allow one to estimate the likelihood of an outcome, to determine an optimal treatment strategy. It is well established that age at the time of diagnosis, leukemia cell karyotype, and whether the leukemia is de novo or secondary are factors that influence treatment decisions. Patients with favorable prognostic factors should probably receive conventional therapy. Patients with unfavorable prognostic factors have shown little benefit from conventional therapy. In addition, factors that indicate poor outcome with conventional therapy are also predictive of poor outcome with intensified therapy. Consequently, these patients should be considered for investigational therapeutic strategies. The bias may be to counsel them to accept the potential increased morbidity of such treatment before there is definite evidence of the possibility of improved outcome. Induction chemotherapy for younger patients with AML (less than 55 years of age) in general consists of one or more courses of cytarabine (ara-C) and an anthracycline or an anthracycline derivative. Randomized trials have failed to confirm that treatment with either etoposide or high-dose ara-C induces disease remission. Patients with secondary AML, high levels of CD34 antigen expression, or an unfavorable karyotype, however, may benefit from ind",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, preliminary findings have shown that Ig V genes of IgA and IgG CLLs may be somatically mutated, suggesting that isotype-switched CLLs may represent a ""subtype"" of the disease. To investigate the degree and nature of somatic mutations and the role of antigen (Ag) in the clonal selection and expansion of isotype-switched CLLs, and to determine whether specific oncogene or tumor suppressor gene mutations are associated with isotype-switched CLLs, we analyzed the expressed Ig VH gene, bcl-1 and bcl-2 proto-oncogene, and p53 tumor suppressor gene configurations of 3 IgA-, 1 IgG-, and 1 IgA/ IgG-expressing CLLs. These isotype-switched CLL B cells expressed surface HLA-DR, CD19, CD23, and CD5, and displayed no alterations of the bcl-1 and bcl-2 oncogenes and the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. The cDNA VH-D-JH gene sequence was joined with that of the C alpha gene in the B cells of the three IgA CLLs, and with that of the C gamma gene in the IgG CLL B cells. In the IgA/IgG-coexpressing CLL B cells, identical VH-D-JH cDNA sequences were spliced to either C alpha or C gamma genes. In all five CLLs, the pattern of C mu DNA probe hybridization to the digested genomic DNAs was consistent with deletion of the C mu exon from the rearranged Ig gene locus, suggesting that these CLL B cells had undergone DNA switch recombination. In one IgA CLL, the expressed VH gene was unmutated. In all other class-switched CLLs, the Ig VH segment gene was mutated, but the point mutations were not associated with intraclonal diversification. In one IgA and in the IgA/IgG-coexpressing CLL, the nature and distribution of the mutations were consistent with Ag selection. These findings suggest that IgA- and/or IgG-expressing CLLs represent, in their VH gene structure, transformants of B cells at different stages of ontogeny. They also suggest that Ag may play a role in the clonal selection of some of these isotype-switched leukemic cells, but bcl-1 and bcl-2 oncogene rearrangements and p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation are not associated with the pathogenesis of isotype-switched CLLs.","['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']","['R01 AR040908/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-40908/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-68541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY-06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/U22381', 'GENBANK/U22387', 'GENBANK/U22388', 'GENBANK/U22389', 'GENBANK/U22390', 'GENBANK/U22391']",,,,,PMC4631049,,['NIHMS727950'],,

However, the frequency of the ""double-null"" genotype, lacking both GSTM1 and GSTT1, was higher in black patients with ALL (8 of 34 or 23.5%) than in black controls (3.9%) (P = .0005), but this was not the case in white patients with ALL (10 of 163 or 6.1%) compared to white controls (8.0%) (P = .68). In stratified analyses, the GST double-null genotype was not associated with other characteristics that might differ between whites and blacks with ALL, such as age, T-lineage immunophenotype, presenting white blood cell count, DNA index, or insurance status. The null genotype for GSTM1, GSTT1, or both was not found to be a prognostic factor for disease-free survival or probability of hematologic remission; central nervous system relapse tended to be less common in those with the GSTM1 null genotype (P = .054). The double-null genotype for GSTM1 and GSTT1 is more common among blacks but not whites with childhood ALL. These data suggest that GST genotype, coupled with unidentified additional risk factors, may play a role in risk of childhood ALL in American blacks.",['EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)'],"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/U01317', 'GENBANK/X68676', 'GENBANK/X79389']",,,,,,,,,

Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Recently, several authors have detected the HTLV-1 genome in genomic DNA from patients with CTCL and proposed a causal relation of HTLV-1 to CTCL. However, it remains controversial because these studies contain some problems in materials used to detect HTLV-1. We investigated both fresh and cultured T lymphocytes (128 specimens) derived from 50 Japanese patients with CTCL, where HTLV-1 is endemic, by using polymerase chain reaction with four sets of primers including gag, pol, env, and pX regions of HTLV-1 to elucidate the relationship between HTLV-1 and CTCL in Japan. However, none of the 128 DNA specimens revealed positive for HTLV-1 in contrast to the previous studies. We conclude that CTCL, which does not include HTLV-1, is present although the pathogenesis of CTCL may be different by areas or races.","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,

One hour pulse-treatment with 3 microM etoposide caused topoisomerase associated, primary DNA breakage, which was rapidly followed by apoptosis. By contrast, these effects were not observed upon pulse-treatment with 6 microM ICRF-193. However, continuous treatments with subcytotoxic concentrations of etoposide (0.15 microM) and ICRF-193 (0.3 microM) produced several similar effects, namely decreased cell proliferation, accumulation of cells at G2, increase in cell mass, and induction of differentiation. Under these conditions, etoposide produced a biphasic activation of protein kinase C, which consisted in an early transient activation (from hours 1 to 6) of the membrane-bound enzyme followed by a later activation (hour 48) of the total, membrane-bound and cytosolic enzyme. By contrast, ICRF-193 only provoked a late activation (from hours 72 to 96) of the total enzyme. When used at differentiation-inducing concentrations, both topoisomerase inhibitors caused a great stimulation of AP-1 binding activity, with maximum value at hour 12 in etoposide-treated cells and at hour 48 in ICRF-193-treated cells. By contrast, the binding activity of the NF-kappa(B) and EGR-1 transcription factors was little affected. It is concluded that topoisomerase II inhibitors may induce the differentiation of promonocytic cells, independently of their capacity to cause DNA strand breaks. However, there are other effects, such as the early activation of protein kinase C, which are probably derived from the production of primary DNA breakage by some anti-topoisomerase drugs.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Diketopiperazines)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', ""21416-68-2 (4,4'-(1,2-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediyl)bis-2,6-piperazinedione)"", '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We now show that specific residues located within the Pbx homeodomain are essential for cooperative DNA binding with Hox and Engrailed gene products. Within the N-terminal region of the Pbx homeodomain, we have identified a residue that is required for cooperative DNA binding with three Hox gene products but not for cooperativity with Engrailed-2 (En-2). Furthermore, there are similarities between heterodimeric interactions involving the yeast mating type proteins MATa1 and MATalpha2 and those that allow the formation of Pbx/Hox and Pbx/En-2 heterodimers. Specifically, residues located in the a1 homeodomain that were previously shown to form a hydrophobic pocket allowing the alpha2 C-terminal tail to bind, are also required for Pbx/Hox and Pbx/En-2 cooperativity. Furthermore, we show that three residues located in the turn between helix 1 and helix 2, characteristic of many atypical homeodomain proteins, are required for cooperative DNA binding involving both Hox and En-2. Replacement of the three residues located in the turn between helix 1 and helix 2 of the Pbx homeodomain with those of the atypical homeodomain proteins controlling cell fate in the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis, bE5 and bE6, allows cooperative DNA binding with three Hox members but abolishes interactions with En-2.

The evidence for a role of extrinsic factors is strongest for development of rodent rod photoreceptors ('rods'). In an effort to identify molecules that may regulate rod development, a number of known factors were assayed in vitro. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was found to have a range of effects on retinal cells. Addition of CNTF to postnatal rat retinal explants resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of differentiating rods. Conversly, the number of cells expressing markers of bipolar cell differentiation was increased to a level not normally seen in vivo or in vitro. In addition, a small increase in the percentage of cells expressing either a marker of amacrine cells or a marker of Muller glia was noted. It was determined that many of the cells that would normally differentiate into rods were the cells that differentiated as bipolar cells in the presence of CNTF. Prospective rod photoreceptors could make this change even when they were postmitotic, indicating that at least a subset of cells fated to be rods were not committed to this fate at the time they were born. These findings highlight the distinction between cell fate and commitment. Resistance to the effect of CNTF on rod differentiation occurred at about the time that a cell began to express opsin. The time of commitment to terminal rod differentiation may thus coincide with the initiation of opsin expression. In agreement with the hypothesis that CNTF plays a role in rod differentiation in vivo, a greater percentage of cells were observed differentiating as rod photoreceptors in mouse retinal explants lacking a functional CNTF receptor, relative to wild-type littermates.","['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Rod Opsins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",['EY09676/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The present study evaluates the application of this method for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). For this purpose leukemia cells with known aneuploidy were serially diluted with diploid bone marrow cells obtained after chemotherapy. These mixed samples were immunophenotyped using antibodies CD34, CD10, or CD19 and processed for DNA staining with propidium iodide. Fifty thousand cells were measured for each experiment and the results were compared with the analysis of control sample without added aneuploid cells. Aneuploid cells diluted to 1% were not detectable in 6/15 cases when DNA content analysis was used alone, and in dilutions of < 1%, these cells were not detectable. When DNA content and immunophenotype were simultaneously measured, aneuploidy was detectable in 15/15 cases at 1.00%, 6/6 at 0.50%, 16/16 at 0.10%, and 16/17 at 0.05%.

We report the case of a 43-year-old patient treated with cytarabine, daunorubicin, and thioguanine for acute myelogenous leukemia who developed painful, red nodules in both axillae on the third day of chemotherapy. The lesions healed spontaneously without sequelae and reappeared once when chemotherapy was readministered. Histologic examination and immunohistochemical staining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and S100 revealed necrosis of eccrine and apocrine glands. As a secondary event, neutrophils, histiocytes, and lymphocytes of T and B cell types were infiltrating the glandular coils. Electron microscopic examination confirmed the presence of severe cellular degeneration of the secretory epithelia and coiled sweat ducts. Ultrastructural features and absence of labeling with a nick-end labeling technique were consistent with a non-apoptotic mode of cell death. Our findings strongly suggest a cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents as accumulated in the secretory epithelia of sweat glands. Distal ducts and myoepithelial cells remained intact and may account for rapid regeneration of the glandular structures after discontinuation of chemotherapy. In view of the involvement of both eccrine and apocrine glands, we suggest the term neutrophilic hidradenitis, which is part of the spectrum of drug-associated sweat gland reactions.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coloring Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Such signaling has been observed in both normal and malignant cells of the B and T cell lineage. Cross-linking of MHC-I on the pre-B-acute-lymphocytic cell line KM-3 induces an apoptotic process, which becomes evident after approximately 12 h. In order to better understand the mechanisms regulating this apoptotic process, we have investigated both gene expression and the effect of cross-linking on certain intracellular events. Differential display PCR was used to isolate two gene fragments whose level of expression was associated with the induction of apoptosis as they were downregulated in KM-3 cells following MHC-I cross-linking. These genes encode novel molecules whose function remains to be elucidated. It was further demonstrated that the apoptotic process was not accompanied by changes in [Ca2+]i, the level of activation of NF-kappaB, or changes in protein kinase C activity and that the initiation of apoptosis could be prevented by phorbol ester treatment. It is thus suggested that multiple, fine-tuned molecular events determine the outcome of cross-linking of MHC-I in this pre-B-lymphocytic cell line.","['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA Probes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,"['GENBANK/U77669', 'GENBANK/U77670']",,,,,,,,,

Eighteen relevant community-based and 16 industry-based studies were located. Four of seven studies of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer in the aggregate identified relative risks of 1.8 or more, and eight of 14 total leukemia studies yielded relative risks in that range. The few available studies of specific histologic types of leukemia do not indicate larger or more consistent elevations in risk for AML compared to other leukemia cell types. Sporadic reports have linked benzene to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, but most studies do not indicate a positive association. Limitations in study quality, particularly exposure assessment, pervade all of the studies reviewed, and the distinction between studies addressing benzene and those addressing jobs in industries that use benzene is somewhat arbitrary. Nonetheless, the epidemiologic evidence linking benzene to leukemia in the aggregate, as well as for subtypes other than AML, is no less persuasive than that for AML alone.",['J64922108F (Benzene)'],['T32-ES07018/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Guanosine is known to potentiate the anti-tumour effects of some chemotherapeutic agents. Administration of acriflavine (15 mg kg-1 day-1, i.m., 14 days) to ICR mice subcutaneously implanted with Ehrlich carcinoma resulted in approximately 30% inhibition in tumour growth. In contrast, minor tumour growth inhibition was observed in animals treated with guanosine at the same daily dose. Treatment of animals with both acriflavine and guanosine (AG60, 1:1, w/w) at 30 mg kg-1 resulted in approximately 65% inhibition in tumour growth rate. Whereas treatment with acriflavine or guanosine resulted in 70% or 30% decrease in tumour weight, respectively, treatment of tumour-implanted mice with AG60 (30 mg kg-1) resulted in a 96% decrease in tumour weight, relative to control, 14 days after tumour-cell implantation. Dose-related inhibition in tumour growth rate was also observed in animals treated with AG60, with maximum (65%) inhibition noted at a dose of 30 mg kg-1 (ED50 23 mg kg-1). Suppression of body weight increase and elevated plasma glucose levels by acriflavine or AG60 indicated that glucose utilization might be impaired. The anti-tumour effect of AG60 was also determined in CDF1 mice intraperitoneally implanted with Ehrlich ascitic tumour. Ehrlich ascitic tumour proliferation was completely suppressed by AG60 (30 mg kg-1, i.p.). Microscopic analyses of intraperitoneal touch-prints revealed that AG60 was more effective in suppressing tumour proliferation than acriflavine alone. Fluorescent microscopic examinations demonstrated that acriflavine avidly bound with Yac-1 cell plasma membrane, leading to morphological changes in the cells, such as bleb formations, swelling and ballooning. The time-related changes in tumour cell morphology by acriflavine or AG60 might represent energy depletion, followed by osmotic lysis as a result of cationic influx. Enhanced anti-tumour activity of acriflavine in combination with guanosine might be explained by the blocking of nutrient transport through selective acriflavine binding with plasma membrane and by concomitant guanosine perturbation of cellular ATP production. This study demonstrates that guanosine enhances the anti-tumour effects of acriflavine against a variety of cancer cells without serious adverse effects, providing a preclinical basis for potential application of this combination against cancer proliferation.","['0 (Blood Glucose)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '1T3A50395T (Acriflavine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor with broad specificity, enhances the cytotoxic effects of various antitumor agents with different modes of action. The topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide, has shown clinical activity against a wide range of tumor types. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of staurosporine on etoposide-induced cell death processes in a human tumor of epithelial origin. METHODS: Modulation of etoposide-induced apoptosis by staurosporine in HeLa cells was assessed by cell morphology, extraction of low molecular weight DNA, quantitation of DNA-protein complexes, and measurements of rates of DNA synthesis. The effects on cellular genes implicated in apoptosis were determined by Northern and Western blotting, along with assays of cyclin-dependent kinase activities. RESULTS: Staurosporine exhibited a two- to three-fold potentiation of apoptosis caused by etoposide in HeLa cells when applied concurrently, or immediately following etoposide removal, but did not alter the quantity of DNA-protein complexes produced by etoposide. Etoposide-induced apoptosis, and its potentiation by staurosporine, were associated with reduced c-myc expression, and a moderate increase in p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA and protein levels. Inhibitors of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, which exhibit greater specificity than staurosporine, were without effect on apoptosis caused by etoposide, whereas use of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate, resulted in its abrogation. The potentiation of etoposide-induced apoptosis by staurosprine was associated with a significant increase in cyclin A-dependent kinase activity. In addition, etoposide caused substantial inhibition of DNA synthesis. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that staurosporine potentiates apoptosis through events which occur downstream of DNA damage, and implicate unscheduled activation of cyclin A-dependent kinase during inhibition of DNA synthesis as a possible cause.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']","['CA 53184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

However, yolk sac cells from AML1-ETO/+ mice differentiated into macrophages in haematopoietic colony forming unit (CFU) assays, unlike Cbfa2-/- or Cbfb-/-cells, which form no colonies in vitro.

The ML patients received granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in addition after chemotherapy.

After a median interval of 17 days (range 8-43), the middle fluorescence fraction (MFR) began to rise, preceding high fluorescence ratio (HFR) reticulocytes by a median of 1 day in AL patients with complete or partial remission. In ML patients, MFR and HFR reticulocytes appeared more often simultaneously after a median interval of only 11 days (range 8-15) and increased faster during the first week of marrow recovery showing a pattern different from AL. Granulocytes passed the critical limit of 0.5 x 10(9)/l at a median of 5 days after appearance of MFR reticulocytes in AL but in ML on the same day as MFR and HFR (day 0). The absolute reticulocyte concentration reached the lower limit of the reference range after about 10 days in AL. Thus, finding MFR and, to a lesser extent, HFR at very low cell concentrations, may serve as sensitive early indicators of marrow recovery after chemotherapy and are much more sensitive parameters than the absolute reticulocyte concentration.

Moreover, measurement of the RNA content of reticulocytes makes possible the identification of the youngest highly fluorescent macroreticulocytes (HFR) prematurely delivered from bone marrow in conditions of increased erythropoietic stimulation. The aim of this study was the definition, using the dedicated flow cytometers Sysmex R-1000 or R-3000 (Toa Medical Electronics Ltd, Kobe, Japan), of reticulocyte absolute number and HFR percentage in patients with haematological disorders prior to any treatment. Analysis of 54 healthy subjects and 100 untreated patients with five types of haematological disease is presented. In haemolytic anaemias (15 cases) both the reticulocyte count and HFR were greatly increased and the reticulocyte count was inversely correlated with Hb level, as in the reference population. In polycythaemia vera (20 cases) reticulocytes were moderately increased and directly correlated with Hb. In dyserythropoietic syndromes (20 cases) reticulocytes were low and HFR moderately increased; HFR showed an inverse correlation with Hb. In acute myeloid leukaemia (30 cases) reticulocytes were low and HFR increased; reticulocytes correlated with both HFR and Hb. In acute lymphoid leukaemia (15 cases), while the reticulocyte count did not differ from the reference group, the HFR was increased.

These primitive cells produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) that are measured in secondary clonogenic assays. Addition of stromal cells to normal adherent haemopoietic progenitor cells reduced CFU-GM production by 80% (P =0.0002) after 1 week of incubation. In long-term culture (LTC), in the presence of stroma. the normal adherent cells did not produce significant numbers of CFU-GM until 3-4 weeks later which suggests that stromal cells reduce the probability of quiescent cell activation. This effect could not be attributed to soluble inhibitory factors and was specific to stroma grown with, rather than without, methylprednisolone. It was blocked by heparanase (H'ase) II treatment of stromal cells, by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) treatment of progenitor cells, by antibody blocking of beta1 integrin molecules or by exposure to glucose/N-acetyl-D-glucosamine/alpha-methyl-D-mannoside, but not by exposure to galactose or fructose. Moreover, these interventions enabled the progenitor cells to respond to stimulatory factors in the culture supernatant. We interpret these results as support for a model involving primitive progenitor cell binding to stroma by PI-CAM/HS, beta1 integrin activation via lectin-like interactions and the transduction of signals which reduce the ability of primitive cells to respond to ambient stimulators. This model provides a mechanism for the maintenance of the quiescent state of stem cells by adhesion to stromal cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate predominant expression of the CD95 gene in a cell lineage-specific manner, we have determined the CD95 expression patterns in cell lines of myeloid, T-, pre-B- or B-cell origin as well as those established from Hodgkin's disease (HD). Our results reveal constitutive transcriptional activation of the CD95 gene in all cell lines derived from the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Despite the ubiquitous expression of CD95 transcripts in haemopoietic cells, the corresponding protein was undetectable in 2/5 cell lines derived from Burkitt lymphomas and 6/16 leukaemia cell lines of the megakaryocytic or monocytic lineage. In an effort to identify apoptosis-resistant cell lines resulting from mutations in the death-signalling domain of CD9 5 or from defects in the apoptotic pathway or in survival programmes, we applied a CD95-mediated apoptosis assay. However, 21/38 CD95-expressing cell lines were sensitive upon induction with an anti-CD95 antibody whereas the remaining cell lines (predominantly of myeloid derivation) were resistant to antibody-induced cell death. Resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis was not due to mutations within the CD95 open reading frame as confirmed by a combined reverse transcription PCR sequencing method. Five myeloid out of 13 tumour lines with the apoptosis-resistance phenotype analysed showed programmed cell death, when protein synthesis was blocked by treatment with cycloheximide prior to CD95-mediated induction. These data suggest an active cellular mechanism for the maintenance of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. Elucidating the steps in such an active process of resistance to apoptosis might be expected to provide new approaches for therapeutic intervention in certain tumours.","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

For quantification, we applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and calculated the D value. The D value was evaluated from the degree of shift in two profiles according to the increase of fluorescence intensity due to the specific binding of biotin-labelled Epo to EpoR. A good correlation was observed between the number of EpoR calculated by 125I-Epo binding assay and the D value. Then, EpoR expression on bone marrow cells from normal individuals was studied by three-colour flow cytometry. In normal bone marrow, the number of EpoR on cells was highest in CD34+CD38 cells (approximately 1600 sites/cell), and decreased in the following order: CD34+CD38- cells > CD34+CD38+ cells > CD34-CD38+ cells. Glycophorin A (GpA) positive erythroid cells also expressed EpoR, and their CD34+ fraction expressed more EpoR than their CD34- fraction. However, the expression levels of EpoR of these fractions were lower than CD34+CD38- cells. These results indicated that EpoR was highly expressed on CD34+ haemopoietic progenitors from very early stages of differentiation without expression of CD38 antigen, and that the level of expression decreased with erythroid differentiation as well as with various lineage commitment in human bone marrow cells.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, three complementary techniques were utilized to follow caspase activation during the course of etoposide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 human leukemia cells. Immunoblotting revealed that levels of procaspase-2 did not change during etoposide-induced apoptosis, whereas levels of procaspase-3 diminished markedly 2-3 h after etoposide addition. At the same time, cytosolic peptidase activities that cleaved DEVD-aminotrifluoromethylcoumarin and VEID-aminomethylcoumarin increased 100- and 20-fold, respectively; but there was only a 1. 5-fold increase in YVAD-aminotrifluoromethylcoumarin cleavage activity. Affinity labeling with N-(Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylglutamyl-Nepsilon-biotin yllysyl)aspartic acid [(2,6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone indicated that multiple active caspase species sequentially appeared in the cytosol during the first 6 h after the addition of etoposide. Analysis on one- and two-dimensional gels revealed that two species comigrated with caspase-6 and three comigrated with active caspase-3 species, suggesting that several splice or modification variants of these enzymes are active during apoptosis. Polypeptides that comigrate with the cytosolic caspases were also labeled in nuclei of apoptotic HL-60 cells. These results not only indicate that etoposide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells is accompanied by the selective activation of multiple caspases in cytosol and nuclei, but also suggest that other caspase precursors such as procaspase-2 are present but not activated during apoptosis.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']","['073915/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the ability of SCF to affect the erythropoietin signaling pathway, we studied the effect of SCF on EPOR phosphorylation, SHC/ERK-1 activity, and cell proliferation and apoptosis in EPO-dependent HCD57 cells. Treatment of these cells with SCF resulted in phosphorylation of the EPOR. However, SCF-dependent phosphorylation of the EPOR did not initiate an EPO-like intracellular signal. SCF induced proliferation, SHC phosphorylation, and activation of ERK-1 but did not activate the JAK/STAT pathway. SCF stimulated SHC phosphorylation and ERK-1 activation independent of the EPOR in cells where the EPOR was down-regulated; the presence of the EPOR appeared to facilitate SCF activation of SHC and ERK-1. Furthermore, treatment of HCD57 cells with SCF increased cell number over a 3-day treatment, but apoptosis was observed in these cells. These data may illustrate two distinct pathways for erythroid cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis in response to EPO, thereby providing a system to discriminate these intracellular signals.","['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",['R01DK39781/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The absence of a p53-dependent G1 arrest that facilitates DNA repair or apoptosis might impact critically on clinical cancer in two ways. First, by abrogating the impact on therapy that operates via genotoxic damage and apoptosis; and second, by encouraging progression either by inducing genomic instability and DNA mis-repair or by permitting survival of mutants. However, experiments examining the relationship between p53 deficiency and mutation frequency have so far failed to confirm these predictions. The precise role played by p53 is therefore unclear. We now report use of a short term in vitro approach to assess the influence of p53 on radiation-induced mutations at the hprt locus in murine B cell precursors that are normally radiation ultrasensitive.

The SH2/SH3 adapter protein CRKL is a major substrate of the deregulated BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase and is aberrantly tyrosine-phosphorylated in Ph-positive leukemia cells. In this study, experiments were pursued to identify and analyse the CRKL phosphorylation site(s). In an in vitro kinase assay, CRKL phosphorylation by the abl kinase was limited to a small region between the two CRKL SH3 domains. Within this region, mutation of tyrosine residue 207 yielded a mutant CRKL which could not be phosphorylated by BCR/ABL. Stable overexpression of CRKL or CRKL-Y207F did not transform NIH3T3 cells, while the Y207F mutation eliminated tyrosine-phosphorylation of CRKL. These studies indicate that Y207 in CRKL represents the major in vivo phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation of Y207 provides a binding site for the CRKL SH2 domain and potentially for other SH2-containing proteins. The Y207F mutation in CRKL did not enhance or decrease association with various target signalling proteins, including SOS or C3G, which interact specifically with the CRKL N-SH3 domain. These findings suggest that complex formation with cellular targets is not modulated by CRKL tyrosine-phosphorylation.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",['CA 47456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

TLS is an RNA-binding nuclear protein that is identical to hnRNP P2 and may be implicated in mRNA metabolism. When RNA polymerase II is inhibited, TLS immunostaining in the nucleus is dramatically altered, from its normal diffuse nucleoplasmic pattern to accumulation in dense nuclease-resistant aggregates. Co-immunostaining with antibodies to fibrillarin or p80 coilin and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the TLS aggregates are associated with the nucleolus and are distinct from other known structures such as the coiled body or the interchromatin granule. Injection of cells with an oligodeoxynucleotide that disrupts splicing does not result in redistribution of TLS, indicating that the event is specific to inhibition of transcription. Oncoproteins that contain the N-terminal domain from either TLS, EWS or their Drosophila homologue, SARFH (CAZ), are also targeted to the same structure. These findings suggest a correlation between the topogenic and transforming activities of TLS and EWS N-termini and imply the existence of cellular targets that are shared by the germ-line encoded proteins and their oncogenic derivatives.","['0 (Amanitins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '53-85-0 (Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole)']",['CA-60945/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 256 patients treated with HDAC (> or = 2.0 g/m2 per dose) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). From 1985 to 1994, a total of 358 cycles of HDAC were administered, using either a twice-daily schedule (n = 208) or a once-daily regimen (n = 48). In 1989, a dose-modification algorithm was initiated at our institution, which reduced ARA-C doses in the setting of renal insufficiency (RI). For patients with a serum creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 to 1.9 mg/dL during treatment, or an increase in Cr during treatment (deltaCr) of 0.5 to 1.2 mg/dL, ARA-C was decreased to 1 g/m2 per dose. For patients with a Cr > or = 2.0 mg/dL or a deltaCr greater 1.2 mg/dL, the dose was reduced to 0.1 g/m2/d. RESULTS: Overall, the incidence of NT was 16% (34 of 208) for patients treated with twice-daily HDAC and 0% (none of 48) for patients treated with daily HDAC (P = .003). NT occurred more often in patients treated on a twice-daily schedule with 3 g/m2 per dose compared with 2 g/m2 per dose (25% v 8%; P = .009). NT occurred in 55% of the twice-daily-treated patients with RI, compared with 7% of those with normal renal function (P = .00001). In patients with RI, NT occurred in none of 11 dose-modified cycles versus five of 11 (45%) total unmodified cycles (P = .01). None of 14 patients treated with once-daily HDAC given during RI developed NT, compared to 55% of patients (23 of 42) receiving twice-daily HDAC during RI (P = .009). By univariate analysis, NT was not associated with patient age or serum alkaline phosphatase, but NT was significantly increased in patients treated with twice-daily HDAC when the serum bilirubin was > or = 2.0 mg/dL compared with twice-daily HDAC given when the total bilirubin was less than 2.0 mg/dL (33% v 14%; P = .017). Multivariate analysis confirmed that RI was the most significant risk factor associated with the development of NT. CONCLUSION: HDAC NT is strongly associated with RI. The risk of HDAC NT can be reduced by the following: (1) routinely reducing the ARA-C dose from 3 to 2 g/m2 per dose; (2) modifying the ARA-C dose based on daily Cr values; and (3) administering HDAC on a once-daily rather than twice-daily schedule.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to evaluate the management of grade II or higher stage Ia tumors by close surveillance to minimize treatment, while reserving chemotherapy for patients with residual or recurrent disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1973 and 1995, 24 patients with malignant stage Ia ovarian GCT were enrolled onto a surveillance program. The group consisted of nine patients with dysgerminoma, nine with pure immature teratoma, and six with endodermal sinus tumor (with or without immature teratoma). Treatment consisted of surgical resection without adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by a surveillance program of clinical, serologic, and radiologic review, and included a second-look procedure for patients enrolled after 1982. RESULTS: All but one patient are alive and in remission after a median follow-up of 6.8 years. The 5-year overall survival is 95%, and the 5-year disease-free survival is 68%. Eight patients have required chemotherapy for recurrent disease or second primary ovarian GCT. This includes three patients with grade II immature teratoma and three patients with dysgerminoma, and a further two women with dysgerminoma who developed contralateral (presumed second primary) dysgerminoma 4.5 and 5.2 years after their first tumor. All but one, who died of a pulmonary embolus, have been successfully salvaged with chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Our experience emphasizes that patients with true stage Ia ovarian GCT are adequately managed by surgical resection followed by careful clinical, radiologic, and serologic surveillance. These patients do not require adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, thus avoiding the potential complications of secondary leukemia and infertility.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three children with CMML given BMT and reported to the European Working Group on Myelodysplastic Syndrome in Childhood (EWOG-MDS) data base were evaluated. In 25 cases, the donor was a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical or a one-antigen-disparate relative, in four cases a mismatched family donor, and in 14 a matched unrelated donor (MUD). Conditioning regimens consisted of total-body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy in 22 patients, whereas busulfan (Bu) with other cytotoxic drugs was used in the remaining patients. RESULTS: Six of 43 patients (14%), five of whom received transplants from alternative donors, failed to engraft. There was a significant difference in the incidences of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) between children transplanted from compatible/one-antigen-mismatched relatives and from alternative donors (23% and 87%, respectively; P < .005). Probabilities of transplant-related mortality for children given BMT from HLA-identical/one-antigen-disparate relatives or from MUD/ mismatched relatives were 9% and 46%, respectively. The probability of relapse for the entire group was 58%, whereas the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 31%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1985 and December 1994, 50 children with acute leukemia (15 acute myelogenous leukemia [AML], 35 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]; 22 greater than second complete remission [CR]) received BMT from a URD at the University of Minnesota. Ages ranged from 0.9 to 17.5 years (median, 8.8). Median follow-up is 2.1 years (range, 1 to 7.3). Thirty patients (60%) received bone marrow fully matched at HLA-A,B and DRB1; 20 (40%) received bone marrow with a major or minor mismatch at a single HLA-A or B locus. RESULTS: The median time to neutrophil engraftment was day 24 (range, 14 to 42 days) in those receiving matched and day 25 (range, 15 to 32 days) in those receiving mismatched marrow (P = .35). The incidence of grades III to IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7% to 39%) in matched and 32% (95% CI, 8% to 52%) in HLA-mismatched patients (P = .57). The incidence of chronic GVHD was 50% (95% CI, 28% to 72%) in matched and 57% (95% CI, 23% to 91%) in mismatched patients (P = .80). Disease-free survival for patients with ALL is 37% (95% CI, 21% to 53%) at 1 year and 30% (95% CI, 15% to 46%) at 2 years; for patients with AML, 53% (95% CI, 28% to 78%) at 1 year and 33% (95% CI, 6% to 60%) at 2 years. CONCLUSION: URD BMT is an effective treatment for children with poor-prognosis acute leukemia and should be considered for all high-risk patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult survivors (n = 580), aged > or = 18 years, who were treated before age 20 years on Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols for ALL and 396 sibling controls were administered a structured telephone interview and the Profile of Moods State (POMS), a standardized measure of affective state. RESULTS: Survivors had higher total mood scores (which indicates greater negative mood) than sibling controls (P<.01) and reported more tension (P< .01), depression (P<.01), anger (P<.01), and confusion (P<.01), but not more fatigue or less vigor. Female, minority, and unemployed survivors reported the highest total mood disturbance. Overall, survivors were more likely to be unemployed (P<.05) or working less than half-time (P<.01) compared with controls. CONCLUSION: This large, sibling-controlled, multisite study of young adult survivors of childhood ALL treated on CCG protocols after 1970 found significant increased negative mood in survivors, not accounted for by reported energy level differences, which suggests that these emotional effects are not likely the result of current illness. Survivors are less likely to be fully employed. Female, minority, and unemployed survivors are at greatest risk for emotional sequelae, a finding that indicates the need for targeted, preventive intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Induction consisted of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) 45 mg/m2 daily until complete remission (CR) and idarubicin 12 mg/m2 daily for 4 days beginning on day 5 of ATRA. Patients in CR received two courses of idarubicin 12 mg/m2 daily for 3 days and then, until 2 years post-CR date, alternated three cycles of mercaptopurine, vincristine, methotrexate, and prednisone (POMP) with one cycle of idarubicin 12 mg/m2 daily for 2 days. Results in the 43 patients treated (41 with t(15;17) on standard or Southern analysis) were compared with those in 57 historic newly diagnosed APL patients given ara-C with either doxorubicin, amsacrine (AMSA), or daunorubicin without ATRA, using logistic and Cox regression to assess effects of non-treatment-related covariates on patient outcomes. RESULTS: The CR rate in the current group was 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62% to 88%) and was not significantly different from the historic rate. In contrast, disease-free survival (DFS) in CR is superior in the current group (probability at 1 year 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.0). This has translated into superior overall DFS for the current group (P = .03 adjusting for the predictive covariates initial WBC and platelet count; 1-year DFS probability 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.82; median follow-up 102 weeks). The current treatment appears better both in patients with and without t(15; 17) on standard cytogenetic analysis. CONCLUSION: Given the difficulties inherent in comparing sequential studies and recognizing the multiple differences in treatment between current and historic groups, our results suggest that a large randomized trial incorporating use of ATRA should assess the utility of omitting ara-C from treatment of newly diagnosed APL, thus allowing delivery of more anthracycline.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'POMP protocol']",,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1997 Aug;15(8):3021-2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicenter phase II trial was conducted in 130 adult patients with ALL between 16 and 60 years of age. After standard induction therapy, postinduction chemotherapy was given: three courses of high-dose cytarabine (2,000 mg/m2 every 12 hours for four doses) in combination with amsacrine (course one), mitoxantrone (course two), and etoposide (course three). CNS prophylaxis consisted of 10 injections of intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX). Patients younger than 50 years with an HLA-identical sibling were eligible to receive allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (73%) achieved complete remission (CR); 82% were younger than 50 years and 41% were older than 50 years. Seventeen patients (13%) were resistant to chemotherapy, and 18 (14%) died during induction treatment. Only age and performance status were significantly associated with response (P<.001 and .03, respectively). Death during consolidation occurred in four patients. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 22% for the entire group and 26% for patients younger than 35 years. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years was 28% +/- 6 for patients younger than 35 years, 25% +/- 9 for patients between 35 and 50 years, and 0% for patients older than 50 years. Increasing age (P<.01) and expression of CD34 (P<.01) were adverse factors. Only three patients (3%) developed an isolated CNS relapse. CONCLUSION: Intensive consolidation including high-dose cytarabine not followed by maintenance therapy provides an outcome for adult patients with ALL that may be worse or even inferior compared with studies using long-term maintenance therapy. High-dose cytarabine in combination with IT MTX was effective for CNS prophylaxis.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with t(8;21) treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment studies were examined for the presence of EML (granulocytic sarcoma, subcutaneous nodules, leukemia cutis, or meningeal leukemia) at initial presentation. Clinical features and outcome of t(8;21) patients with and without EML were compared. RESULTS: Of 84 patients with t(8;21), eight (9.5%) had EML manifesting as granulocytic sarcoma (five paraspinal, one breast, and one subcutaneous) or symptomatic meningeal leukemia (n = 1). The pretreatment prognostic variables of t(8;21) patients with and without EML were similar. The hematologic complete remission (CR) rate for t(8;21) patients with EML was 50% versus 92% for those without EML (P=.006). The median CR duration for EML patients was 14.7 months. Patients with EML had a shorter survival (P = 0.002, median 5.4 months versus 59.5 months). This poor outcome may relate to inadequate local (radiation or intrathecal) therapy for patients with spinal or meningeal EML, resulting in residual/recurrent EML following induction chemotherapy (n = 2) or at relapse (n = 1) and permanent neurologic deficits (n = 4). Only one of the EML patients received high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) intensification; this is the only EML patient remaining alive in CR. CONCLUSION: Patients with t(8;21) and EML have a low CR rate and overall survival. An aggressive local and systemic induction therapy should be considered for this patient subset. The effectiveness of HDAC intensification in t(8;21) patients with EML is uncertain and warrants further study.",,"['26806/PHS HHS/United States', '37027/PHS HHS/United States', '59518/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase II protocol was open to all eligible patients whose local physicians obtained written permission from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to register patients onto this protocol. Of 791 national and international enrolled patients, 724 with a median age of 65 years received fludarabine, of which 703 were assessable for response. RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of assessable patients responded (95% confidence interval [CI], 29% to 36%), with 21 patients (3%) obtaining a complete response and 205 (29%) a partial response. The median duration of response was 13.1 months and the median survival time from registration was 12.6 months. Age, performance status (PS), and Rai stage correlated with survival (P < .01). Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was reported in 43% and was associated with infection in 22%. Neurotoxicity (primarily grade 1 motor dysfunction) was reported in 14% patients and correlated with age. CONCLUSION: This study describes the toxicity and activity of fludarabine in refractory CLL in a setting that more closely resembles clinical practice than most published trials. The low response rate may be related to advanced stage (89% Rai high-risk), disease-related symptoms (63% had B symptoms), and/or degree of prior treatment. Other contributing factors inherent in a group C treatment protocol included lack of central pathology review, variable supportive care, and a tendency to use this mechanism at a later stage in the disease.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a retrospective study to characterize better this new treatment modality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We surveyed 25 North American BMT programs regarding their use of donor leukocyte infusions (DLI). Detailed forms were used to gather data regarding the original BMT, relapse, DLI, response to DLI, complications of DLI, and long-term follow-up evaluation. Reports of 140 patients were thus available for analysis. RESULTS: Complete responses were observed in 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51.9% to 68.1%) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients who received DLI and did not receive pre-DLI chemotherapy; response rates were higher in patients with cytogenetic and chronic-phase relapse (75.7%; 95% CI, 68.2% to 83.2%) than in patients with accelerated-phase (33.3%; 95% CI, 19.7% to 46.9%) or blastic-phase (16.7%; 95% CI, 1.9% to 31.9%) relapse. The actuarial probability of remaining in complete remission at 2 years was 89.6%. Complete remission rates in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (n = 39) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n = 11) patients who had not received pre-DLI chemotherapy were 15.4% (95% CI, 9.6% to 21.2%) and 18.2% (95% CI, 6.6% to 29.8%), respectively. Complete remissions were also observed in two of four assessable myeloma patients and two of five assessable myelodysplasia patients. Complications of DLI included acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (60%; 95% CI, 51.4% to 68.6%), chronic GVHD (60.7%; 95% CI, 50.3% to 71.1%), and pancytopenia (18.6%; 95% CI, 12.2% to 25.0%). Pre-DLI characteristics predictive of complete response in CML patients were post-BMT chronic GVHD, pre-DLI disease status of chronic phase, and time interval between BMT to DLI less than 2 years. Acute and chronic GVHD post-DLI were highly correlated with disease response (P < .00001). CONCLUSION: DLI results in complete remissions in a high percentage of patients with relapsed chronic-phase CML. Complete remissions are observed less frequently in patients with advanced CML and acute leukemia. GVHD and pancytopenia occur commonly; GVHD is highly correlated with response.",,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1997 Feb;15(2):416-7. PMID: 9053460'],,,,,

Mucorales become pathogenic in some conditions, principally diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, trauma or burn. METHODS: We describe two cases of leukaemic patients who developed disseminated zygomycosis by Absidia corymbifera during the aplastic phase by antineoplastic chemotherapy. RESULTS: In both cases, the first symptom was high fever unresponsive to broad spectrum antibiotics neither fluconazole. Initial sites of infection were sinonasal region in one case and bowel in the other one. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture of nasal swab and peritoneal fluid respectively. One patient was early diagnosed and he received prolonged amphotericin B therapy but no surgical debridement. The other one had a postmortem diagnosis at autopsy. None of them survived. Death was directly related to the fungal infection. CONCLUSIONS: Although this infection is infrequent, it must be suspected in high-risk patients because early diagnosis and quick combined therapy appear to improve the prognosis.",,,,Zigomicosis diseminada por Absidia corymbifera en 2 pacientes leucemicos.,,,,,,,,

There are four evolutionarily conserved NFI genes (NFI-A, -B, -C and -X) that encode DNA-binding proteins of similar or identical DNA-binding specificity. To address the role of this family of highly conserved transcription/replication proteins in cell differentiation and development, we have assessed the expression of NFI proteins (by DNA binding) and mRNAs of each of the four NFI genes during the in vitro differentiation of several human leukemic cell lines. These cell lines differ in their pattern of differentiation upon exposure to the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In K562 and OCI/AML-3 cells, the levels of the four NFI mRNAs and the mobility of NFI-DNA complexes present in nuclear extracts changed during treatment with TPA. The TPA-induced change in mobility of NFI-DNA complexes in OCI/AML-3 cells was blocked by an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide. These changes in NFI protein and mRNA expression appear to be cell type-or lineage-specific since no changes were seen during the TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 or U937 cells. These studies indicate that although their DNA-binding specificities are similar, the proteins encoded by the four NFI genes may differ in their biological functions and play distinct roles in hematopoietic development.","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFIA protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Y-Box-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (YBX1 protein, human)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,"['GENBANK/U57633', 'GENBANK/U57634', 'GENBANK/U57635', 'GENBANK/U57636']",,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to determine how LIF protein was hormonally regulated in rabbit and mouse uterus using immunohistochemistry. In unmated rabbits, LIF protein was at a low level in the uterine epithelium and glands, and up-regulated by progesterone alone or estradiol-17 beta and progesterone combined. Estradiol-17 beta alone had no apparent effect. In ovariectomized mice, the level of LIF protein was very low in the uterine epithelium and glands, and was up-regulated by estradiol-17 beta alone or estradiol-17 beta and progesterone combined. Progesterone alone had no apparent effect. These results suggest that LIF protein is differentially regulated in rabbit and mouse uterus by progesterone and estrogen, respectively.

After liver transplantation, PAI-1 levels normalized in both patients and PIIINP levels declined. Both patients died due to infectious complications and multiorgan failure on days 141 and 101, respectively. Whereas the early rise of PIIINP did not correlate with the clinical onset of VOD, the results emphasise the relevance of PAI-1 for diagnosing VOD.","['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (procollagen Type III-N-terminal peptide)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Donors for BMT2 were replaced in 11 cases. Thirty-one patients were in CR (or CP) at BMT2. Earlier deaths were observed in those who received BMT2 within 12 months after BMT1, mostly caused by regimen-related toxicity and infections. Overall leukemia-free survival rate was 28% at 2 years and 16% at 4 years. Factors influencing the poor prognosis after BMT2 were early (<6 months) relapse, early (<12 months) BMT2, not in remission at BMT2, and ALL. Intensified conditioning did not affect either remission duration or LFS. Among the 39 cases observed for more than 100 days, 18 developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and showed longer remission duration than those without cGVHD.

Monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against MBP-PR were developed. Three mabs were obtained that recognized different epitopes. Two were directed against the NH2-terminus, a region that contributes to the dimerization interface. The other was specific to a peptide that lines the substrate binding pocket. This latter epitope is located just downstream of the D-T-G peptide of the catalytic site.

Risk estimates for this group were also compared to those for survivors who were less than 6 years old at the time of exposure. The cohorts studied include 807 in utero survivors and 5,545 persons exposed during childhood with all members of both groups having estimated doses of at least 0.01 Sv. The comparison group includes 10,453 persons with little (<0.01 Sv) or no exposure. Analyses were limited mainly to cancer deaths occurring between the ages of 17 and 46. Only 10 cancer deaths were observed among persons exposed in utero. However, there is a significant dose response with an estimate of excess relative risk per sievert (ERR/Sv) of 2.1 (90% confidence interval of 0.2 to 6.0). This estimate does not differ significantly from that for survivors exposed during the first 5 years of life. The cancer deaths among those exposed in utero involved leukemia (2), female-specific organs (3) and digestive organs (5). Nine deaths occurred in females, where the excess risk for all solid cancers has a 90% confidence interval on the ERR/Sv of 1.6 to 17. Significant risks were found for cancers of the digestive system [90% confidence interval (CI) on the ERR/Sv of 0.7 to 20] and for female-specific cancers (90% CI on the ERR/Sv of 0.7 to 42). These risks do not differ significantly from those seen in females exposed as children. There were no deaths from solid cancer in men exposed in utero. The ERR/Sv has an upper 95% confidence bound of 2.5 which does not differ from that for exposed children, where the upper 95% confidence bound is 1.5. The sexes differ even when female-specific cancers are excluded from the comparison. Although there were only two leukemia deaths among those exposed in utero, the leukemia death rate for this group is higher than that in the comparison group (P = 0.054) with an exposure effect that is about half the magnitude and not significantly different from that seen after childhood exposure (P = 0.103). However, there is no evidence of a dose response among those exposed in utero because no high-dose leukemia deaths were observed, a result that differs considerably from that for those exposed as children. There is a need for caution in the interpretation of these data. First, the number of cancer deaths is small; second, there is unexplained significant difference in the mortality from solid cancer between the sexes; and third, the excess of leukemia in those exposed in utero is not reflected in an increasing dose response.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effects of electric fields on cellular protein kinase C (PKC) activity and on the regulation of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1), which is responsible for a major form of drug resistance in cancer. We found that exposure of H9 human leukemia cells to 60-Hz sinusoidal electric fields (330 or 750 mV/cm for 60 min) resulted in significantly decreased PKC activity in the cytosolic fraction, whereas electric fields at higher (1250 and 3000 mV/cm) or lower (10 mV/cm) intensities had no effect on PKC activity. Exposure of these cells to electric fields (330 or 750 mV/cm for 17 h) inhibited up-regulation of MDR1 expression by treatment with 25 microM 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC). Again, lower or higher field strengths had little or no effect on the levels of AraC-induced MDR1 mRNA. Similarly, exposure of intact cells to staurosporine (100 nM), a potent PKC inhibitor, significantly reduced cytosolic PKC activity, but not that of the particulate fraction. Staurosporine also prevented AraC-induced MDR1 overexpression. These data show that intermediate-strength electric fields inhibit cytosolic PKC and suggest that electric fields and pharmacological inhibitors of PKC, such as staurosporine, affect cytosolic PKC activity and AraC-induced MDR1 overexpression through related mechanisms. Our findings also suggest the possible utility of 60-Hz electric fields for modulating multidrug resistance in tumor cells.","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",['R37CA40333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Certain characteristic immunophenotypic patterns have emerged that aid in the classification of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We describe a unique pattern of expression of CD19, a B cell-associated cell surface antigen, in cases of AML. We reviewed 59 cases of de novo AML to determine the pattern of CD19 expression in cases of AML using three different CD19 monoclonal antibodies, including B4 (Lytic), B4 89B (Coulter, Miami, Fla) and SJ25-C1 (GenTrak, Plymouth Meeting, Pa). We confirmed the known relationship between CD19 expression and t(8;21)-positive AML M2; in these cases, CD19 was detected with all three antibodies. We also found a unique pattern of CD19 expression in cases of AML with a substantial monocytic-monoblastic component. In 6 of 12 cases of AML M4 or M5, CD19 expression was evident only with the B4 (Lytic) antibody; CD19 expression was not observed using B4 89B or SJ25-C1. We did not observe any recurring chromosomal abnormalities in these cases of CD19-positive AML M4/M5; furthermore, none of these cases demonstrated a t(8;21). Using CD11b, CD14, and other myeloid markers, we found that AML M4 and AML M5 were characterized by dual populations of blasts. With the exception of a case of AML M4 eo, cases of AML M4 were associated with one population of blasts lacking both CD11b and CD14 and a second population with one or both of these antigens. Cases of AML M5 also had dual populations of blasts, but in contrast with AML M4, each population expressed CD11b, CD14, or both. Our findings suggest that specific immunophenotypic patterns, including the unique pattern of CD19 expression with the B4 (Lytic) monoclonal antibody, may prove useful in classifying cases of AML M4 and M5.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)']",,,,,['Am J Clin Pathol 1997 May;107(5):621'],,,,,,

Other leukemic lymphoproliferative disorders were excluded from this analysis. CLL cases with normal karyotypes were more likely to demonstrate typical morphology than those with clonal abnormalities (P = .042). In addition, all six cases containing isolated 13q14 abnormalities had typical morphology, compared with six of 16 other isolated abnormalities (P = .009), including one of seven cases of isolated trisomy 12. In contrast with the cases of isolated 13q14 changes, only seven of 17 cases with 13q14 as part of complex abnormalities had typical morphology (P = .012). Trisomy 12 was associated with mixed-cell morphology, particularly CLL/PL, consistent with previous reports. We conclude that isolated 13q14 abnormalities and normal karyotype are associated with typical CLL morphology, while other clonal abnormalities, including trisomy 12, are associated with mixed-cell morphology. These results further support the concept of distinct CLL subgroups based on karyotype. Furthermore, the association of trisomy 12 and complex abnormalities with mixed-cell morphology may have implications for clonal evolution in CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of growth factors can then be limited to patients most likely to benefit from them, and it may be possible to salvage patients at risk of complications of low counts early before their clinical condition deteriorates. We suggest that patients with leukocyte counts of 0.2 x 10(9)/l or less 14-16 days after BMT should be started on G-CSF or GM-CSF even if they are clinically well, and consideration should be given to a second infusion of cells.","['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Eight cases were elderly patients over 65 years old, 7 cases were refractory to previous chemotherapies, and 13 cases were relapsed cases. ETOP was administered at 25 or 50 mg per day for at least more than 3 consecutive weeks, if the peripheral white blood cell count exceeded 1,000/microliter. Complete and partial responses were obtained in 64% of all cases, especially in 81% of malignant lymphoma and ATL. Probability of survival for 3 years of malignant lymphoma and ATL was 36.7%. As mild toxicities, 2 cases (8%) had nausea and vomiting, 2 cases (8%) had diarrhea, and 3 cases (12%) had stomatitis. Grade 3 leukocytopenia was observed in 16% of cases.

Leukemic cells that have acquired the t(12;21) usually demonstrate loss of the remaining normal ETV6 (TEL) allele. Using reporter gene assays we have functionally characterized both the normal ETV6 and ETV6/CBFA2 fusion proteins in the regulation of the MCSFR proximal promoter. Neither ETV6 or ETV6/CBFA2 has any significant, detectable effect on the promoter by itself. However, both ETV6 and ETV6/CBFA2 inhibit the activation of the promoter by CBFA2B(AML1B) and C/EBPa. We have shown that a 29-bp region of the MCSFR promoter containing the binding sites for CBFA2B and C/EBPa is sufficient for the inhibition by ETV6 and ETV6/CBFA2. Mutational analysis of the MCSFR promoter revealed that binding of both CBFA2B and C/EBPa to their respective sites is necessary for the inhibition by ETV6 and ETV6/CBFA2. Deletion of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) region from the cDNAs of ETV6 and ETV6/CBFA2 decreased but did not completely abrogate the ability of either construct to inhibit promoter activation. We also found that the ETS DNA binding region of ETV6 is necessary for inhibition of the promoter. Addition of ETS1 and FLI1, two ETS family members that have homology in the 5' HLH region, but not Spi1, an ETS family member without the 5' HLH region, also inhibited reporter gene expression. Our data show that the inhibition mediated by ETV6 and ETV6/CBFA2, in the context of the MCSFR promoter, depend on interactions with other proteins, not just CBFA2B. Our results also indicate that the transactivation characteristics of ETV6/CBFA2 are a combination of positive and negative regulatory properties.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']","['T32 HD007009/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA067189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-07009/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA067189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC20023,,,,

DEK was first identified in a fusion with the CAN nucleoporin protein in a specific subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia. DEK has also been shown to be an autoantigen in patients with pauciarticular onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Further, the last 65 amino acids of DEK can partially reverse the mutation-prone phenotype of cells from patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. However, in spite of these significant disease associations, the function of DEK has remained unclear. The HIV-2 peri-ets (pets) site is a TG-rich element found between the two Elf-1 binding sites in the HIV-2 enhancer. The pets element mediates transcriptional activation whether the enhancer is stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) alone, phytohemagluttinin (PHA) alone, PMA plus PHA, soluble antibodies to the T cell receptor, immobilized antibodies to the T cell receptor, or by antigen. Previously, we purified and characterized the pets factor, demonstrating that it is a 43-kDa nuclear protein. We now describe the identification of DEK as this 43-kDa pets factor. Using a modified Southwestern screening procedure, we find that DEK can recognize the pets element. We demonstrate the ability of recombinant DEK to bind specifically to the pets site using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting. ""Supershift"" EMSA further confirms that DEK is the dominant protein binding to the pets site in T cell extracts. Our findings show that DEK is a site-specific DNA binding protein that is likely involved in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction.

In this study, the effects of chronic administration of CT-1 to mice (0.5 or 2 microg by intraperitoneal injection, twice a day for 14 days) were determined. A dose-dependent increase in both the heart weight and ventricular weight to body ratios was observed in the treated groups. The body weights of the animals were unaffected. These results indicate that CT-1 can induce cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. CT-1 was not specific for the heart, however. It stimulated the growth of the liver, kidney, and spleen, and caused atrophy of the thymus. CT-1 administration also increased the platelet counts by 70%, with no change in mean platelet volume. Red blood cell counts were increased in the treated animals, and there was a concomitant increase in haemoglobin concentration. Thus, CT-1 has a broad spectrum of biological activities in vivo. This observation is consistent with previous in-vitro findings showing that the mRNA for CT-1 is expressed in several tissues, and that CT-1 can function through binding to the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor and signalling through the gp130 pathway.","['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,

TPO initiates its biological effects by binding to the c-MPL receptor, which is a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. To define the regulation of the MPL receptor, six continuous human leukemia cell lines with megakaryocytic properties were treated with the phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), TPO and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, a cytokine known to possess inhibitory effects. We used Northern blotting and flow cytometry analysis to determine MPL mRNA and protein levels. An increase of MPL mRNA and protein expression was observed in 2/6 PMA-exposed cell lines. There is no evidence from this study that TPO or TGF-beta 1 cause any decrease or increase in MPL expression. MPL upregulation triggered by PMA was accompanied by signs of induced differentiation such as increase in CD41, CD42 and CD61 expression, increase in cell size and cessation of proliferation. These data demonstrate that MPL can be upregulated in differentiating megakaryocytic cells via stimulation of protein kinase C, the intracellular target of PMA and a key kinase in one of the second messenger signal transduction pathways. These findings further the understanding of the regulation of this molecule, a cytokine receptor that, together with its ligand TPO, appears to represent a crucial element in megakaryocytopoiesis.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, in the CCG-100 series of clinical trials (1983-1989), which tested regimens that were largely of moderate intensity, T-lineage ALL patients had an excess of adverse early events compared to patients in the B-lineage group: 3-year event-free survival (EFS) estimate, 65.8% vs 78.2% (P < 0.0001). With the introduction of more intensive chemotherapy in studies from 1989 to 1994 (CCG-1800 series).

Anti-CD95 antibody induced apoptosis in these cell lines in a manner dependent on intensity of CD95 expression. Bel-2 expression levels in these cell lines were not correlated with sensitivity to CD95-induced apoptosis. Myeloma cells from approximately 70% of cases analyzed expressed CD95, suggesting a high frequency of CD95 expression of myeloma cells. The incidence of CD95 expression in samples from extramedullary lesions were higher than those of bone marrow myeloma cells. Anti-CD95 antibody did not induce apoptosis in some freshly isolated myeloma cells despite the expression of CD95 induced apoptosis in myeloma cell lines in a manner dependent on intensity of CD95 expression. In fresh samples, intensity of CD95 expression was not correlated with apoptosis evoked by anti-CD95 antibody. Interestingly, isolated myeloma cells with an high-level expression of CD95 showed spontaneous apoptosis during in vitro incubation. This was observed in samples from cases with high serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting that the LDH was derived from cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis in vivo. Taken together, CD95 is expressed in most myeloma cell lines and in many freshly isolated myeloma cells. However, some of the latter escape from CD95-dependent apoptosis despite the expression of CD95. Moreover, some myeloma cells from cases with aggressive disease may undergo apoptosis in a CD95-independent manner. In this review, the significance of CD95 and apoptosis of myeloma cells are discussed.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed biochemical analysis showed overall structural identity between responsive and non-responsive B-CLL with respect to both transmembrane and intracellular associates of the BCR complex. However expression levels of the protein tyrosine kinase syk, which is a key enzyme for the early signalling through the BCR, were found to be markedly lower in non-proliferating B-CLL.

The actions of HGF's are determined by the cellular distribution of receptors for these HGF's within the hemopoietic tissues and by the functional program that receptor-expressing cells can execute after growth factor stimulation. Identification of stem cells and their progeny and delineation of the growth factor receptor phenotype of these cells will establish target cell range and functions of individual growth factors in hemopoiesis. Cells with specific HGF receptors can be detected and isolated by flow cytometric methods, e.g., by staining with biotinylated ligand and fluorescently-tagged streptavidin. Receptor-expressing cells can be classified on the basis of expression of the CD34 antigen and other markers that distinguish immature progenitors from more differentiated cells. Using this approach distinct expression patterns have been shown for the receptors for interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and Steel Factor (SF) on subsets of CD34+ and CD34- cells in bone marrow. Expression of the IL-3 receptor (R), IL-6R and GM-CSFR appears to be very low on the most immature subsets of CD34+ cells, but increases progressively during successive stages, of in particular myelomonocytic differentiation. In contrast, the receptor for SF, i.e., Kit, is highly expressed on very immature CD34-bright/HLA-DR-dull cells, which include stem cells. Kit levels decline during myelomonocytic and B-lymphoid differentiation whereas they increase to maximal levels during early stages of erythropoiesis. The heterogeneity in receptor expression, together with other immunophenotypic characteristics, allows for the identification of distinct progenitor cell subsets and differentiation stages within the CD34+ cell compartment. By selecting appropriate phenotypic criteria it will be possible to further dissect the stem cell compartment and eventually establish the, possibly heterogeneous, HGF receptor phenotype of pluripotent stem cells.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed an expansion of gamma delta T lymphocytes, mild CD4 T lymphocytopenia, and a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio (0.2). Two subpopulations of gamma delta T lymphocytes were found (CD3+/CD4-/CD8+, 47%; CD3+/CD4-/CD8-, 53%), the vast majority of which expressed V-delta 1. An infectious cause for the patient's gamma delta T lymphocytosis could not be found. The sputum was chronically colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, and the organism produced TSST-1 in vitro. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed marked lymphocytosis, but gamma delta T lymphocytes were not overrepresented in the BAL. Lymphocyte functional studies revealed poor proliferative responses to mitogens and staphylococcal superantigens and diminished cytokine production. V-delta 1 T lymphocytes from the patient's blood were not expanded in vitro in response to staphylococcal superantigens. TCR gene rearrangement studies confirmed the presence of J gamma and J beta 1 clonal rearrangements accounting for only a small subpopulation of the gamma delta T lymphocytes. These studies were repeated 5 months later and were unchanged. A bone marrow biopsy was negative for leukemia. Hence, the cause of the patient's gamma delta T lymphocytosis could not be determined despite evaluation for underlying malignancy, occult infection, or superantigen-driven stimulation. The patient ultimately died of progressive respiratory insufficiency. The state of current knowledge regarding gamma delta T lymphocytosis, decreased production of alpha beta T lymphocytes, and a low CD4/ CD8 ratio in association with CVID is discussed.","['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (enterotoxin F, Staphylococcal)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Meis1 encodes a novel homeobox protein belonging to the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) family of homeodomain-containing proteins. The homeodomain of Meis1 is the only known motif within the entire 390-amino-acid protein. Southern blot analyses using the Meis1 homeodomain as a probe revealed the existence family of Meis1-related genes (Mrgs) in several diverged species. In addition, the 3' untranslated region (UTR) Meis1 was remarkably conserved in evolution. To gain a further understanding of the role Meis1 plays in leukemia and development, as well as to identify conserved regions of the protein that might reveal function, we cloned and characterized Mrgs from the mouse and human genomes. We report the sequence of Mrg1 and MRG2 as well as their chromosomal locations in murine and human genomes. Both Mrgs share a high degree of sequence identity with the protein coding region of Meis1. We have also cloned the Xenopus laevis ortholog of (XMeis1). Sequence comparison of the murine and Xenopus clones reveals that Meis1 is highly conserved throughout its coding sequence as well as the 3' UTR.

Under identical experimental conditions, control HeLa cell clones stably transformed with the same plasmid, but lacking the env gene, were still able to fuse with C91PL cells. These observations suggest that a post-transcriptional step in HTLV-I env expression is impaired, probably leading to the establishment of superinfection interference.","['0 (Gene Products, env)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vectors to examine the site of one of these switches during intracellular reverse transcription. Consistent with original models for reverse transcription, but in contrast to previous experimental data, we observed that this first strand transfer nearly always occurred precisely at the 5' end of genomic RNA. This finding allowed us to use first strand transfer to study the classes of errors that reverse transcriptase can and/or does make when it switches templates at a defined position during viral DNA synthesis. We found that errors occurred at the site of first strand transfer approximately 1000-fold more frequently than reported average reverse transcriptase error rates for template-internal positions. We then analyzed replication products of specialized vectors that were designed to test possible origins for the switch-associated errors. Our results suggest that at least some errors arose via non-templated nucleotide addition followed by mismatch extension at the point of strand transfer. We discuss the significance of our findings as they relate to the possible contribution that template switch-associated errors may make to retroviral mutation rates.","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,PMC1169686,,,,

To extend these studies, we have isolated from Naja naja kaowthia (cobra) venom a cytotoxin free of detectable phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The amino acid composition, pI (10.2), and net charge of the cytotoxin compares well with membrane-active toxins isolated from venoms of other cobras. The cytotoxin, shown by a spin label method, associates with PLA2 in buffers at pH values between 7.0 and 5.0, but not at pH 4.0. It is suggested that cytotoxin and PLA2 (pI close to 4.8) associate electrostatically in the native venom. The effect of the cytotoxin on model phospholipid membranes was studied by EPR of spin probes in oriented lipid multilayers and 1H-NMR of sonicated liposomes. The cytotoxin did not significantly affect the packing of lipids in pure phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes and in PC membranes containing 10 mol% phosphatidic acid (PA) or cardiolipin (CL). However, the cytotoxin induced an increase in membrane permeability and formation of nonbilayer structures in PC membranes containing 40 mol% of PA or CL. The purified cytotoxin was cytocidal to Jurkat cells, but had little effect on normal human lymphocytes. However, both Jurkat cells and normal lymphocytes were killed equivalently when treated with 10(-9) m PLA2 and 10(-5) m cytotoxin in combination. From its effect on model membranes and Jurkat cells, it is suggested that purified cytotoxin preferentially targets and disrupts membranes that are rich in acidic phospholipids on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane.","['0 (Cobra Neurotoxin Proteins)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",['RR08124/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The identification of tumor-associated antigens and specific peptide epitopes (i.e., antigenic determinants) may be useful in the development of anticancer vaccines. The generation of a cytotoxic T-cell response to one peptide epitope (amino acids 146-154) of human prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been reported. PURPOSE: Our aim was to identify novel PSA peptides capable of eliciting specific cytotoxic T-cell responses. METHODS: Candidate peptides were identified on the basis of the following criteria: 1) they contained consensus amino acid motifs for binding to HLA-A2, which is the most common type of class I molecule; 2) they lacked strong homology with PSA-related kallikrein proteins; and 3) they were capable of stabilizing HLA-A2 class I molecules on the surface of human T2 (transport deletion mutant) cells, which are defective in antigen presentation. T-cell lines capable of killing (i.e., lysing) T2 target cells that had been pulsed with specific PSA peptides were generated from three different males (two disease-free individuals and one patient with prostate cancer) by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the peptides and interleukin 2. Specific cell lysis was monitored by the release of radioactivity from target cells that had been labeled with [111In]oxyquinoline. RESULTS: Two novel PSA peptides capable of eliciting cytotoxic T-cell responses were identified; these peptides were designated PSA-1 (amino acids 41-150) and PSA-3 (amino acids 154-163). Four different cytotoxic T-cell lines were generated in response to these peptides-three against PSA-3 and one against PSA-1. Specific lysis of peptide-pulsed T2 cells by the T-cell lines was blocked by the addition of a monoclonal antibody directed against class I molecules. The T-cell lines were also capable of lysing PSA-positive, HLA-A2-positive LNCaP cells (human prostate carcinoma cells). The specificity of LNCaP cell lysis was shown by the following: 1) the inability of added human K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) cells to inhibit it, 2) the ability of added anti-HLA-A2 antibodies to block it, and 3) the inability of the T-cell lines to induce substantial lysis of PSA-negative, HLA-A2-positive human cancer cells. IMPLICATIONS: Our studies form a rational basis for the use of PSA peptides or recombinant vectors encoding PSA in the development of anticancer vaccine immunotherapy protocols for patients with prostate cancer.","['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",,"['GENBANK/M13143', 'GENBANK/M18157', 'GENBANK/M25629', 'GENBANK/X14810']",,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Feb 19;89(4):272-5.

The percentages of CD34+ cells that could be isolated from the mononuclear fraction of bone marrow samples were determined. Fifteen of the 21 marrow samples had normal percentages of CD34+ cells isolated by immunomagnetic methods. All seven donors with CD4 counts > 100/mm3 had normal percentages of CD34+ cells; of 14 patients with low CD4 cell counts (< 100/mm3), 5 had reduced and 9 had normal percentages of CD34+ cells. Samples of the marrow were plated in a methylcellulose colony-forming unit (CFU) assay to determine the clonogenic capacity of the progenitor cells. Overall, the marrow samples from HIV-infected donors showed a 44% reduction in CFU derived from the mononuclear cell fraction and a 75% reduction in CFU derived from the isolated CD34+ cell fraction, when compared to marrow samples from uninfected donors. Isolated CD3+ cells were transduced with retroviral vectors containing various anti-HIV-1 genes to determine their susceptibility to gene transfer. Transduction of the clonogenic CD34+ cells by retroviral vectors did not differ among marrow samples from 13 HIV-1+ donors and 9 uninfected donors. Long-term bone marrow cultures established from the transduced CD34+ cells demonstrated equivalent survival of clonogenic progenitor cells from both HIV-1-infected and uninfected marrows. Toxicity from expression of the anti-HIV-1 genes was not observed; the percentages of clonogenic progenitor cells that survived in cultures transduced by vectors carrying anti-HIV-1 genes were similar to those transduced by the control LN vectors. Stromal cells cultured from marrow samples from HIV-1-infected donors showed similar growth kinetics, hematopoietic support function, and enhancement of retrovirus-mediated transduction of CD34+ cells as seen with stromal cells cultured from uninfected marrow donors. Semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed before and after ex vivo transduction to determine the frequency of HIV-1-containing cells in the CD34+ cell preparations. Although HIV-1+ cells were present at low levels in the mononuclear cell fractions of some of the marrow samples, the CD34+ cell preparation from only one marrow sample contained detectable HIV-1 positive cells (< 1 positive cell/100,000 by PCR) prior to transduction. None of the CD34+ cell preparations contained detectable HIV-1 after transduction.

The effect of PB on the efficiency of transduction of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMuLV)-derived vectors is strongly dependent on CS. At a fixed CS concentration, the efficiency of transduction shows a maximum as a function of PB concentration. Increasing the CS concentration shifted this maximum to higher PB concentrations, but the value of the maximum remained the same. Therefore, there were optimal combinations of PB and CS concentrations that maximized the efficiency of gene transfer: 4.4, 8.8, 13.2, and 22 micrograms/ml of PB for 1%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10% (vol/vol) CS, respectively. Moreover, the presence of PB affected significantly the kinetics of retroviral decay. The loss of retroviral activity did not follow simple exponential decay in the absence of PB during the decay period of the viral supernatant. The dynamics of viral inactivation showed an initial phase during which the transduction efficiency remained constant followed by exponential decay. However, in the presence of high PB concentrations (13.2 micrograms/ml) during the decay period of retroviral vectors, the initial delay was lost and the decay was exponential right from the outset. The present results suggest that in addition to virus-cell interactions that occur on the target cell surface, other physico-chemical processes may occur in solution that have profound effect on retroviral activity and therefore they are of particular importance for gene therapy.","['0 (Culture Media)', '4C905MSK4W (Hexadimethrine Bromide)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, the median age for patients with AML is estimated to be 62 years, which precludes allogeneic BMT for a significant number of patients with AML. For patients with relapsed AML who lack an HLA-identical donor or who are too old to undergo allogeneic BMT, autologous BMT should be considered since current standard salvage chemotherapy regimens do not produce durable remissions in the overwhelming majority of patients. The role of allogeneic and autologous BMT was initial postremission therapy is controversial.

The recently described erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 plays an important role in the regulation of the transcription of globin genes and recognizes a sequence containing an AP-1 site. NF-E2 is a complex of two bZip proteins, p45 and p18/Maf. In order to determine whether c-Jun can interact with NF-E2/AP-1 sites to regulate transcriptional activation from them, we have compared the activity of AP-1 and NF-E2 in transient transcriptional assays, in erythroid and nonerythroid cells in the presence of c-jun sense and antisense expression vectors. In non-erythroid cells, c-Jun activates and NF-E2p18 inhibits both AP-1 and NF-E2 activities, suggesting that NF-E2/AP-1 sites function as AP-1 binding sites in these cells. In contrast, NF-E2p18 is a positive regulator of NF-E2 activity in erythroid cells. c-Jun alone is also a positive regulator of NF-E2 activity in erythroid cells but in association with NF-E2p18 inhibits this activity. Moreover antisense c-jun increases endogenous NF-E2 activity in erythroid cells. These results suggest that c-Jun could act as a repressor of NF-E2 transcriptional activity by forming inactive c-Jun/NF-E2p18 heterocomplexes which interfer with the transcription of globin genes in Friend erythroleukemia cells.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Maf protein, mouse)', '0 (MafK Transcription Factor)', '0 (Mafk protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-maf)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,

LIF was measured in BALF by means of a specific and sensitive ELISA (detection limit 10 pg/ml) in BALF (lavage of 3 x 50 ml in the right middle lobe). LIF was not detected in the BALF of 13 healthy control patients and in only one (34 pg/ml) out of 25 patients at risk for ARDS (after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery) who underwent BAL 4 h after the end of the extracorporeal circulation. High and detectable levels were found in the unconcentrated BALF of 10 out of 12 patients with full-blown ARDS (212 +/- 116, mean +/- SEM, range 10-985 pg/ml). There was a good correlation between the level of LIF in the BALF and a number of markers of inflammation such as neutrophils/ml, albumin and protein levels. The biological role of LIF in these BALFs is not readily explained by its currently known actions and it is unknown whether LIF contributes to or is a response to local tissue damage.

Using topo IIalpha promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids, c-myb expression caused trans-activation of the topo IIalpha promoter a maximum of approximately 4.5-fold over basal levels in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Trans-activation was submaximal with higher levels of c-myb expression plasmid but a Myb protein lacking its negative regulatory domain resulted in approximately 19-fold trans-activation. Mutagenesis and 5'-deletion studies revealed that Myb trans-activation was mediated via a Myb-binding site at positions -16 to -11 and that this region governed the bulk of basal topo IIalpha promoter activity in human leukemia cells. Trans-activation of topo IIalpha by c-Myb was lymphoid- or myeloid-dependent. However, B-Myb, a more widely-expressed Myb family member, caused topo IIalpha trans-activation in both HL-60 cells and HeLa epithelial cervical carcinoma cells.

The 68-kDa protein was coimmunoprecipitated with various signaling proteins such as phospholipase C gamma1, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit, Grb2, SHP-1, Cbl, and Jak3, implying that the protein might function as an adapter. Purification and microsequencing of this protein revealed that it was the RNA-binding protein, Sam68 (Src associated in mitosis, 68 kDa). Sam68 was associated with the Src homology 2 and 3 domains of Fyn and also those of another Src family kinase, Lck. CD3 cross-linking induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Sam68 in uninfected T cells. These data suggest that Sam68 participates in the signal transduction pathway downstream of TCR-coupled Src family kinases Fyn and Lck in lymphocytes, that is not only in the mitotic pathway downstream of c-Src in fibroblasts.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown that the inhibiting effect of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) on the adhesion to glass is the same for both types of cells under study, whereas concanavalin A (Con-A) inhibits the erythrocyte adhesion to glass only but it is ineffective for adhesion of K562 cells. Plasmatic membranes of K562 cells are free from band 3 protein contrary to the erythrocyte ones. It is concluded that the inhibition of erythrocyte adhesion by lectins results from their binding to different components of cell membranes; sialic acid residues of glycophorin (WGA) or band 3 protein (Con-A). This conclusion is confirmed by the inhibiting effect of WGA towards attachment of cells K562 to glass and the absence of such an effect of Con-A towards the same cells which do not contain this protein. The most probable form of both cell type attachment to glass is the occurrence of so-called focal contacts. The latter can be easily observed in the case of K562 cells. The intact erythrocyte attachment to formvar occurs slower than to glass.

Transplants were performed by the following centers, from April 1983 to December 1991: H. Vall d'Hebron and H. Sant Pau from Barcelona, H. Ramon y Cajal and H. Nino Jesus from Madrid and H. Marques de Valdecilla from Santander. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 113 patients between the ages of two and 16 years with ALL in second remission at marrow transplant. Fifty-six underwent alloBMT and 57 ABMT. Both groups were homogeneous with respect to age, sex, immunophenotype, duration of first remission, risk at diagnosis, percentage of early and late relapses, percentage with marrow or extramedullary relapse prior to transplant, time interval from attainment of second remission to transplant, and conditioning regimens applied for marrow transplant, with predominance of chemoradiotherapy in both. RESULTS: Haematologic recovery was observed to be faster in alloBMT than in ABMT. A granulocyte count > 0.5 x 10(9)/l was reached in alloBMT patients in a median of 19 days and in ABMT patients in a median of 25 days (p < 0.001). Early procedure-related death after ABMT occurred only in one patient (1.75%) and was caused by hepatic veno-occlusive disease. In the alloBMT group, the incidence was 25%. GVHD and infection were the most common causes. Actuarial DFS for alloBMT was 38.8 +/- 6.7% at 8.5 years versus 29.2 +/- 6.5% at 4.5 years for ABMT, p = NS. No significant differences of actuarial DFS were found between alloBMT or ABMT in patients according to leukocyte count and risk at diagnosis, neither with first remission duration, nor with remission duration at transplant. A separate analysis of actuarial DFS for each group shows that in ABMT group DFS was significantly greater in patients who had presented a late relapse (> 30 months) 61.1 +/- 13.8%, than those who had presented an early relapse (< 30 months) 18.3 +/- 6.5% (p < 0.005). Probability of relapse was significantly greater in ABMT (70%) compared to alloBMT (46%) (p < 0.025). Transplant offers a better DFS in extramedullary relapses compared to isolated or combined bone marrow relapses: 71.4 +/- 17.1% with alloBMT and 38.1 +/- 14.7% with ABMT (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience we observed a better DFS with alloBMT compared with ABMT, overcoat in early relapses, but without significant difference. A higher relapse rate in ABMT group is partially compensated by more early deaths in alloBMT offers a few survival possibilities in patients with medullary relapses whose first remission lasted less than 30 months.",,,,Trasplante alogenico de medula osea versus autotrasplante en la leucemia aguda linfoblastica en segunda remision en 113 ninos.

New studies are now required to define new induction combinations and the place of these and other promising new drugs in the treatment. Standard attenuated postremission therapy is required after standard induction to maintain remission. However, new intensified postremission therapies have significantly improved outcome in de novo AML. This development has required re-examination of the value of intensive treatment. There is now clear clinical evidence that a dose-response effect is present for cytarabine in AML. The optimal placement of intensified treatment and marrow transplantation requires further study. In the future, it is likely that new treatment strategies will be defined by identifying new prognostic subgroups. To identify new successful induction treatments in AML, more precise measures of CR are required including an attempt to define cytogenetic CR and molecular CR wherever it can be applied.

With the dramatic advances in molecular biology that have occurred during the past two decades, these structural cytogenetic abnormalities have now provided invaluable clues as to the location of genes known or suspected of inducing leukemia. In most instances, leukemogenesis in AML results from gene fusion, when segments from two different genes are fused together to give rise to a chimeric structure consisting of the 5' end of one gene and the 3' end of another. Exceptions to this, however, do exist. In cases of AML that lack cytogenetic abnormalities, investigators are now also beginning to elucidate the genes involved in malignant transformation.

Two recent theories, both involving an unusual response to childhood infection, attempt to explain the 2- to 5-year age peak. The etiology of infant leukemia may be related to chromosomal damage sustained in utero, analogous to the damage in adults with treatment-related leukemia.

The single most important risk factor for infection is the duration of absolute neutropenia. Historically, most attention was directed towards gram negative aerobes, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but in recent years gram positive bacteria, generally considered to be less virulent, have become the most frequent isolates in most centers. A recent disturbing trend is the isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. A recent controversy has been whether to use empirical vancomycin; the Centers for Disease Control has issued a formal recommendation discouraging empirical vancomycin in the febrile neutropenic patient. Empirical monotherapy has replaced combination therapy in many institutions except where there has been an increase in resistant isolates. In patients who remain profoundly neutropenic, fungal infections represent a serious source of secondary infection, especially species of Candida and Aspergillus. Recently lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B have offered reduced nephrotoxicity. Less toxic antifungals, the azoles, which include fluconazole and itraconazole, offer an attractive alternative to amphotericin B. New patterns of invasive mycoses have emerged, as for example hepatosplenic candidiasis, presenting new problems in diagnosis and therapy.

GFs have been used after chemotherapy in 11 clinical studies, 8 on older age or otherwise high-risk AML. The GFs used were granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in 7, G-CSF in three and macrophage-CSF in one of the studies. Beneficial effects could be shown on the duration of neutropenia in 8 studies, frequency of infections or fever in 4 studies, mortality or survival in 2 studies and remission rate in 1 study. The benefits in remissions and survival were all found among high-risk patients. One study in younger patients found disadvantages in the remission rate and event-free survival, whereas there was no adverse effect of GF on therapy resistance, leukemic regrowth, or disease-free survival in the other studies. GF priming strategies are based on their stimulation of AML blasts in vitro, their modulation of cellular cytarabine (ARA-C) metabolism and enhancement of clonogenic cell kill by ARA-C. Protective effects of GF against clonogenic cell kill or apoptosis were also described. There are data from 10 clinical studies using GFs before or simultaneously with chemotherapy. One study showed significance, two others a tendency to longer disease-free survival, and two studies showed a trend toward more remissions. A disadvantage in the remission rate and survival was found in one study and prolonged thrombocytopenia in two studies. Nine of ten studies did not find evidence for an adverse effect of GF priming on the course of the disease. In most studies, GF priming was only administered in one or two chemotherapy courses. One study giving four to five courses found a reduction in relapses during the first 6 months. In conclusion, a supportive use of GF may have a place in high-risk, but not standard-risk AML. GF priming approaches may not have been adequately investigated and an extension of this strategy to more treatment courses now appears more promising. Based on the clinical data available, all administration of GF in AML should be regarded as investigational.","['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, patients and family members should be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typed soon after the diagnosis to expedite transplantation should induction therapy fail. Transplantation is superior to chemotherapy in patients with AML in second remission. The role of transplantation in ALL other than induction failure is somewhat different in children than in adults. Transplantation appears to be the treatment of choice in children with ALL in second remission regardless of the characteristics of the disease. Adults who relapse off-therapy after prolonged remission should probably be reinduced, whereas those with short remissions probably should go directly to transplant. Transplants from family members incompatible for one antigen result in survival rates similar to those observed with HLA-identical sibling transplants, but transplants from family donors mismatched for two or three antigens have been associated with a substantial increase in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other complications and such transplants should be reserved for patients with few other prospects for cure. Randomized trials are underway to compare peripheral blood stem cells mobilized with granulocyte colony stimulating factor to marrow for H LA-matched transplantation.

The basic and clinical investigation of these complex malignancies can be approached from four major vantage points: (I) dissection of the molecular structure of the induced genetic lesions and identification of the functional consequences of these changes, thereby providing clues to the pathogenesis of secondary AML and potentially serving as a basis for innovative therapeutic interventions; (2) identification and characterization of mechanisms of DNA damage and the orderly repair of such damage; (3) identification and application of accurate biomarkers of leukemogenesis for the purpose of risk prediction and quantification, potentially allowing recognition of patients especially susceptible to the leukemogenic effects of chemotherapy (for genetic or acquired reasons) and allowing their treatment for cancer to be modified based on this susceptibility; and (4) design and implementation of longitudinal clinical and genetic monitoring of high-risk populations (ie, individuals undergoing cytotoxic therapies for primary malignancies). In this article, we build on these themes, and attempt to integrate these seemingly disparate areas of research so that they can be more effectively used together to address the problem of secondary AML.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients diagnosed with ALL from January 1989 to October 1995 in a single center were studied. Two groups of patients were analyzed based on age. The main clinical, hematologic and biochemical parameters, morphologic subtype and immunologic phenotype and the results of the cytogenetic study were analyzed. Likewise, the attainment of complete remission (CR), its duration and overall survival (OS) were also studied. Comparison of the cited variables and the results of treatment among the two groups of patients was performed. RESULTS: Group I was made of 19 (11 males, 8 females) patients > or = 50 years of age (mean age 65 +/- 9 years). Group II included 22 patients (11 males and 11 females) with a mean age of 28 +/- 11 years. Significant differences were only observed between the two groups in regard to the proportion of peripheral blood blasts (p < 0.02), serum LDH values (p = 0.05) and the performance status at the time of diagnosis ( p < 0.00007). In the patients in group 1 cytogenetic alterations were more frequent (10/16 vs 4/20, p < 0.02), being mainly pseudodiploid. Complete remission was achieved in 7/16 patients in group I and in 17/22 in group II (p < 0.02). The median duration of CR was 34 and 18 months, respectively. The median OS was 7 months in group 1 and 15 months in group II with an estimated survival at 5 years of 0% in group I and 38% in group II (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia over the age of 50 years have a worse general status and more cytogenetic alterations (particularly structural) than younger adult patients, presenting a lower probability of achieving complete remission and a shorter survival.",,,,Leucemia aguda linfoblastica del adulto.

The relationships between cell cycle regulation and apoptosis triggering remain poorly understood. The gadd153 gene encodes the nuclear protein CHOP 10 that acts as a negative modulator of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein transcriptional factors and inhibits cell cycle progression. We have investigated the relationships between gadd153 gene expression and apoptosis induction in four human leukemic cell lines with different sensitivities to apoptosis induced by etoposide (VP-16), a topoisomerase II inhibitor. The gadd153 gene was constitutively expressed in the four studied cell lines. In U937 and HL-60 cells that were very sensitive to apoptosis induction by the drug, VP-16 induced a time- and dose-dependent increase of gadd153 gene mRNA expression. Using agarose gel electrophoresis and a quantitative filter elution assay, apoptotic DNA fragmentation was observed to begin when gadd153 gene expression increased. Equitoxic doses of VP-16 (as defined using a 96-h 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay) did not increase the gadd153 mRNA level in K562 and KCL22 cell lines that were more resistant to apoptosis induction by the drug. Nuclear run-on and mRNA stability experiments demonstrated that VP-16 treatment increased gadd153 gene transcription in the sensitive U937 cells. Cycloheximide did not prevent gadd153 expression increase. Both gadd153 mRNA level increase and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation were inhibited by N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethylketone, a serine threonine protease inhibitor, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, an inhibitor of calpain, N-acetylcysteine, an inhibitor of oxidative metabolism, and overexpression of Bcl-2.

A 100% transplantability was achieved in nonpreconditioned SCID mice using various BALL-1a doses between 2.5 x 10(4) and 6 x 10(6) cells. Hind-leg paralysis preceded the death of the mice. Utility of the developed tumor model for the therapeutic studies was investigated by i.v. administration of an anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody SN7 (IgG1) and its conjugate with deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgRA). The therapy was initiated 2, 4, or 6 days after tumor inoculation using 4 x 24 microg of SN7-dgRA or 4 x 20 microg of SN7; the total dose (96 microg) of SN7-dgRA corresponded to 14% of the LD50 dose. SN7-dgRA showed a strong antitumor efficacy in all groups of treated mice. All of the day-2 group mice (n = 7) and six (66.7%) of the day-4 group mice (n = 9) survived healthily for as long as followed (240 days), whereas four (57.1%) of the day-6 group mice (n = 7) survived healthily for as long as followed (200 days). Unconjugated SN7 showed a significant antitumor efficacy but was less effective than SN7-dgRA. A PCR-based assay specific for the clonogenic BALL-1a tumor was developed and applied to determine tumors in various organs of BALL-1a-bearing SCID mice. The assay was highly sensitive in screening for trace quantities of residual tumors in various organs of SCID mice, and it could detect 1 malignant cell/2.5 x 10(5) tissue cells. The PCR-based assay was shown to be much more powerful than the conventional histological analysis in detecting residual tumors. Furthermore, we could estimate quantities of the detected tumors by the PCR-based assay. It is remarkable to find that all examined organs of some of the SN7-dgRA-treated mice were tumor-free as determined by the clonotype-specific PCR-based assay. The present results show the usefulness of the newly developed SCID mouse model, SN7-dgRA, and the clonotype-specific PCR-based molecular assay for the study of therapy of human B-cell leukemia/lymphoma.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Using single-cell gel electrophoresis (""comet assay""), we have analyzed the induction and differential processing of DNA damage in human lymphocytes derived from healthy donors and from patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) after exposure to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in vitro. The extent of comet formation in lymphocytes after N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea exposure appears to depend predominantly on the processing of DNA repair intermediates, because strand breaks in plasmid DNA were not induced by ethylation before the addition of nuclear proteins. Although the initial level of a specific alkylation product (O6-ethylguanine) in nuclear DNA was uniform, different dose-response curves were obtained for the comet size in individual cell samples immediately after exposure, with small intercellular variation. The individual kinetics of DNA repair varied significantly between specimens derived from both healthy individuals and CLL patients; for the DNA repair half-time (t1/2), large difference was found. Pretreatment of cells with methoxyamine as a DNA repair modifier blocking the base excision repair pathway revealed a quite similar extent of base excision repair-independent DNA incision in almost all normal lymphocyte samples. In contrast, this portion varied relatively and absolutely to a great extent among individual samples of CLL lymphocytes, suggesting a loss of stringent control of DNA repair processes in these cells. The comet assay can thus be used to gain information about interindividual variation in the efficiency of different DNA repair processes in small samples of normal cells and their malignant counterparts.","['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Hydroxylamines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9TZH4WY30J (methoxyamine)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",,,,,,,,,,,

All cases of zygomycosis diagnosed in the Hospital 12 de Octubre in Madrid, Spain, from 1976 to 1994 were reviewed. METHODS: The underlying diseases of the patients, the factors favoring infection (alteration of the cutaneous barrier and administration of antimicrobians and corticosteroids) and the possible nosocomial origin of infection were analyzed. RESULTS: Over this period of time, 16 cases of zygomycosis were diagnosed with different clinical forms depending on the route of entry (rhino-orbital-cerebral, cutaneous or disseminated). The species isolated were Rhizopus oryzae, Rhizomucor pusillus, Absidia corymbifera and Rhizopus stolonifer. The species could not be determined in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of zygomycosis should be based on a combined histological and microbiological study which allows both, differentiation between colonization and infection and isolation of the implicated species.

The initial increase was followed by a transient decline and a larger rise due to an influx of external Ca2+. The first increase and part of the subsequent rise also developed in Ca(2+)-free medium, identifying their origin from intracellular stores. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration of U937 cells that remained after culture for 24 or 48 h with 5 or 10 microM MK886 was not reliably altered from the control values of 130 +/- 8.3 nM.

The increase in intracellular Ca2+ in response to MK886 in calcium-containing medium was confirmed with an ACAS laser spectrometer. U937 cytosol pH was measured with the fluorescent probe BCECF, but not persistent acute or chronic change was induced by MK886.

Among the most significant late effects of cancer therapy is the development of second malignant neoplasm (SMN). This study was performed to identify the factors associated with the development of second malignant neoplasms after treatment for soft tissue sarcomas in childhood. Retrospectively the charts of 20 children who developed second malignant neoplasms after treatment for primary childhood soft tissue sarcoma were reviewed. Presentation, age at diagnosis, tumor histology, extent of tumor, treatment, family histories (when available), and outcome were recorded. The mean age of the patients (10 boys, 10 girls) was 8.5 years of age (range, 1 to 20 years). Most primary tumors were rhabdomyosarcoma (14/20) and occurred in an extremity (10/20). Ninety percent of the patients (18/20) had a complete response to treatment of the primary cancer. Eleven out of 20 received combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The most common secondary malignancy was a bone sarcoma (6/20), followed by brain tumors (n = 3), leukemia (n = 2), and other sarcomas (n = 2). Four of the bone sarcomas developed in the field of radiation treatment. Median follow-up was 16 years (range, 1 to 26 years). The median time to development of a SMN was 11.4 years (range, 1.5 to 21 years). Survival after a second malignancy was only 30%. Two patients developed a third malignant neoplasm. The occurrence of a secondary malignancy represents a serious complication of childhood cancer. Certain tumors are related directly to treatment such as osteosarcoma within irradiated fields and secondary leukemias or lymphomas after certain chemotherapy regimens. Combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy may play an additive role in the development of second malignant neoplasms. Genetic factors may predispose affected patients to the development of both primary and secondary malignancies. Close surveillance of children previously treated for childhood cancers is warranted.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two M. fermentans strains isolated from urine deposits from AIDS patients, without the use of cell cultures, and six M. fermentans isolates from patients with acute respiratory infections differed markedly from the incognitus strain, in that they were sensitive to aminoglycosides (MIC range 0.25-25 mg/L).

These results suggest that, although the aminoglycoside-resistance in M. fermentans incognitus could have developed during the isolation process or through treatment of the AIDS patient with aminoglycosides, in view of the unusual manner in which the strain was isolated, its multiple aminoglycoside resistance and the fact that other M. fermentans strains isolated from AIDS patients, without the use of tissue culture cells, were aminoglycoside-sensitive, it is more likely that it was a tissue culture contaminant.","['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)']",,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the mechanisms whereby CVE augments the cell-mediated immunity, we examined the expression patterns of mRNA for cytokines in normal and MAIDS mice given CVE orally after L. monocytogenes infection. The expression levels of IL-1 alpha, IL-12, GM-CSF, MIP and TNF alpha genes were significantly augmented in the peritoneal adherent cells by oral administration of CVE for 2 weeks before Listeria infection. The expression levels of gamma IFN and IL-12 mRNA were significantly higher in the spleen after Listeria infection in CVE-treated mice than in normal mice, while the expression of IL-10 mRNA in the spleen was decreased by CVE administration. In MAIDS mice, oral administration of CVE also augmented the expression of gamma IFN and IL-12 mRNA in the spleen after Listeria infection, while it rather reduced the expression of IL-10 mRNA. These results suggest that CVE may preferentially augment THI responses against Listeria via activation of macrophages to produce IL-12 and enhance host defence against Listeria infection both in normal and MAIDS mice.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although expression of the CD5 antigen is also seen in small lymphocytic lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, MCL differs from SLL/ CLL in several ways. Whereas trisomy of chromosome 12 is the hallmark cytogenetic abnormality of SLL/CLL, the translocation (11;14) (q13q32) is the most frequent karyotypic abnormality in MCL. The histologic pattern of MCL is most frequently diffuse. However, this lymphoma can grow in a unique pattern called 'mantle zone MCL,' indicating that the malignant cells expand the mantle of the follicle and grow around a normal germinal center. If the germinal center is also replaced by the malignant cells, but the follicular architecture remains, the pattern appears nodular. The clinical presentation of MCL is usually only seen with advanced disease stage, particularly in patients with diffuse MCL. The bone marrow is the most frequently affected extranodal site, followed by the gastrointestinal tract. The histologic pattern of disease in the lymph nodes correlates with clinical outcome. Patients with diffuse MCL have poor response to frontline combination chemotherapy including doxorubicin, whereas patients with mantle zone MCL have excellent complete remission rates. The therapeutic response correlates in turn with worse survival outcome for patients with diffuse MCL compared to mantle zone MCL. The few patients with nodular MCL had clinical behavior similar to diffuse MCL. The chemotherapeutic response of diffuse and nodular MCL, however, is quite poor, and we would propose that new investigational approaches be considered in the front-line therapy of these disorders.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently developed a monoclonal antibody, MAD11, which reacts with the potent anti-tumour antibiotic doxorubicin and other anthracyclines. To protect directly pluripotent stem cells and cells of the haematopoietic microenvironment in the bone marrow against doxorubicin cytotoxicity, the monoclonal antibody MAD11 was injected into the tibial bone of mice before chemotherapeutic treatment. All mice pretreated intratibially with MAD11 and injected with 14 mg kg(-1) body weight of doxorubicin survived, whereas 41% of mice treated with doxorubicin alone died. At a higher dose of doxorubicin (18 mg kg(-1)), early mortality (first 6 days) was similar in the groups, but no deaths were observed thereafter in the intratibially MAD11-treated group, whereas most of the mice treated with doxorubicin alone died. Data obtained in mice injected with P388 leukaemia cells showed that the intratibial injection of MAD11 did not compromise the anti-tumoral activity of doxorubicin. Moreover, the administration of the anti-doxorubicin monoclonal antibody before chemotherapeutic treatment effectively reduced apoptosis induced by doxorubicin in the bone marrow cells.

Stimulation of this cell population has been shown to be easily accomplished by interferon (IFN) treatment.

Identification of the total MA population was carried out by a monoclonal antibody against CD68 (PG-M1) and for the characterization of its activated fraction, the lectin GSA-I was employed. In both therapeutic groups morphometric analysis revealed a conspicuous increase in PG-M1-positive MAs in sequential trephine biopsies. However, following IFN therapy the relative amount of the GSA-I fraction was maintained or even increased and accompanied by enhanced apoptosis. On the other hand, BU generated a significant reduction of this subpopulation and the number of apoptotic cells as well. This finding is probably related to the immunomodulatory activity of IFN associated with MA activation and secretion of biogenic mediators. These are thought to belong partly to the so-called tumor necrosis factor superfamily, which is known to stimulate programmed cell death (apoptosis).","['0 (Lectins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Normal p53 function is critical for the maintenance of genomic stability. The mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK(+/-)-3.7.2C cell line is widely used in genetic toxicology for mutagenesis and clastogenesis testing. A related line L5178Y-R, has previously been shown to react with antibodies specific for mutant as well as wild-type p53 protein and to exhibit delayed cell death after radiation. For this reason, as well as the mouse lymphoma assay's reputation for high sensitivity of detection for genotoxic agents but low specificity, we examined several clones of L5178Y cells for mutations in the conserved core domain (exons 5-8) of the p53 gene. Using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, we found evidence for the same mutation in exon 5 of p53 in L5178Y-R, L5178Y-S and L5178Y/TK(+/+)-3.7.2C cells. The mutation was identified by sequencing of exon 5 as a TGC (Cys) to CGC (Arg) transition in codon 170 (= codon 176 in humans). Sequencing showed approximately equivalent signals for the mutant and normal alleles for all 3 lines. The mutation in codon 170 is adjacent to a mutation hotspot of the human p53 gene (codon 175) and eliminates a critical zinc-coordinating cysteine residue such that the mutant protein is likely to be denatured and have a dominant negative effect on normal p53 function. Western blots showed approximately 100-fold higher levels of p53 protein in unirradiated L5178Y cells as compared to induced levels of p53 in normal mouse splenocytes 4 h after 5 Gy of gamma radiation. The high levels of p53 protein in L5178Y cells were not further inducible by radiation, whereas an 11-fold induction was seen in the irradiated splenocytes. These results indicate that p53 protein in L5178Y cells is dysfunctional and suggest that this line may therefore be abnormally susceptible to the induction of genetic alterations.",['0 (Codon)'],,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of the LIF stimulated BEAS 2B cells to calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M, 15 min) caused a further increase of [3H]AA release. To identify the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in this upregulation of AA release, further experiments were performed to determine the expression of cPLA2 in the BEAS 2B cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated that LIF increased cPLA2 protein expression. Ribonuclease protection assay showed that LIF induced an increase of cPLA2 mRNA levels following 3 h to 24 h treatment. Nuclear run-on experiments suggested that LIF upregulated cPLA2 gene expression through post-translational regulation.

These reports prompted us to begin a derivative, phase II trial of tiazofurin in CML-BC to determine if the promising findings reported by these investigators could be reproduced. In our ongoing trial patients receive tiazofurin by IV infusion (2200-4400 mg/m2 over 1 hr) once every 24-48 hrs for up to 10 days. Each of 3 patients, treated to date on this trial, experienced substantial hematologic responses with normalization of WBC counts and complete or partial clearance of blasts from the blood within 4-11 days of treatment. These responses were relatively brief, in that leukemic blasts reaccumulated in the marrow and blood of patients within 4 weeks following treatment, but were re-induced with subsequent courses of treatment. Of interest, the rates of blast cell reaccumulation appeared to increase progressively following sequential courses of treatment. Tiazofurin, which inhibits IMP-dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and blocks guanine ribonucleotide synthesis, has been shown to increase IMPDH mRNA expression in various cell lines in vitro, as an apparently compensatory response to guanylate deprivation. Studies of IMPDH mRNA expression in the leukemic blasts of CML-BC patients receiving tiazofurin treatment showed that this same phenomenon occurs in vivo. Since IMPDH activity is linked to the proliferative activity of neoplastic cells an amplification of IMPDH message expression induced by tiazofurin may lead to an increased sensitivity of the leukemic clone to cycle active agents.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",['R01 HL54072-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The primary goal of antileukemic therapy in these patients should be the identification of agents that are more selective and better targeted in their action. Tiazofurin is known to inhibit inosine 5'-phosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate limiting enzyme of de novo guanine ribonucleotide synthesis. The activity of this enzyme is markedly increased in leukemic cells. To prevent de novo GTP synthesis, it is also necessary to block the guanine-salvaging activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This was achieved by increasing the plasma levels of hypoxanthine through the administration of allopurinol. Twenty-seven patients with end stage leukemia or myeloid blast crisis of CGL were treated with tiazofurin. Assays of IMPDH activity and GTP concentrations in leukemic cells, as well as hypoxanthine levels in the serum, provided a method to monitor the impact of tiazofurin/allopurinol therapy and to adjust drug doses. In these poor prognosis patients seven attained a complete response (CR), 3 had a hematologic improvement and an antileukemic effect was seen in 4. An excellent correlation was observed between biochemical and clinical activity of tiazofurin/allopurinol, with biochemical responses preceding clinical results. However, clinical responses were usually short-lived with IMPDH activity starting to increase soon after discontinuation of therapy, but patients responding again after reinstitution. Tiazofurin therapy was generally well tolerated in patients with less than 15 days of treatment and no other major medical complications. Although an antiproliferative effect was observed in some patients, bone marrows remained cellular in most cases with a marked shift from blasts to granulocytes. Severe neutropenia was absent in the majority of cases and patients could be discharged in good clinical condition immediately after completion of therapy. Tiazofurin/allopurinol therapy provided a rational, biochemically targeted and biochemically monitored approach to the treatment of poor prognosis leukemia and should serve as a paradigm in enzyme pattern-targeted chemotherapy.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']","['CA55819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: The biochemical and clinical techniques were reported (1, 2). RESULTS: IMP DH activity increased in various animal and human tumors and was particularly high in leukemic blast cells. The increased activity was due to an elevation in the mRNA concentration of type II isozyme. Tiazofurin, a C-nucleoside, was converted in sensitive cells to the active metabolite, TAD, which tightly bound at the NADH site inhibited IMP DH activity. The inhibition led to decreased GTP concentration, down-regulation of ras and myc oncogenes and induced maturation of blast cells. New evidence shows that tiazofurin injection downregulated signal transduction activity due to a reduction of the activities of PI and PIP kinases leading to a decrease in the concentration of the second messenger, IP3. In patients; tiazofurin infusion and allopurinol administration led to reduction of IMP DH activity and GTP concentration. Allopurinol inhibited xanthine oxidase activity leading to a marked rise in hypoxanthine concentration which inhibited the increased guanine salvage pathway. In the clinic, the increase in serum hypoxanthine concentration is essential for the success of tiazofurin treatment. Tiazofurin showed additivity or synergism with ribavirin, retinoic acid, taxol, quercetin, gemcitabin, dipyridamole and brefeldin. Ribavirin which inhibits IMP DH at the IMP site has been shown to prolong the IMP depressing action of tiazofurin in rat bone marrow cells. CONCLUSION: Tiazofurin and allopurinol achieve reduction of GTP concentration in leukemic blast cells through inhibition of IMP DH and GPRT activities. As a result, induced maturation occurs with down-regulation of ras and myc oncogenes and probably reduced signal transduction capacity.

The radiologic diagnosis was chondrosarcoma in two cases. Microscopically, there were large, rounded deposits of amorphous eosinophilic material surrounded by numerous giant cells and a sparse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. The deposits proved to be composed of AL amyloid showing potassium permanganate resistant congophilia. Immunohistochemistry showed immunoglobulin IgG lambda, IgG kappa, and IgM lambda monoclonality of the plasma cell and (in one case) lymphoid infiltrate.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study of 33 subjects (17 boys) who underwent a BMT for acute leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 20; acute myelogenous leukemia, n = 13) at a single institution. All patients were prepubertal at the time of BMT (median age, 7.1 years (3.7 to 11.6 years)); at the time of their last examination the boys were a median of 14 years (10.4 to 17.1 years) of age and the girls were a median of 16.9 years (9.5 to 21.9 years) of age. RESULTS: Of 17 boys, 14 (82%) entered puberty spontaneously and 13 demonstrated age-appropriate plasma concentrations of testosterone. Two boys (aged 10.5 and 11 years) remain clinically and hormonally prepubertal, and one boy has overt Leydig cell failure requiring androgen replacement therapy. Thirty-six percent of pubertal boys have elevated plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone and 64% have raised levels of follicle-stimulating hormone. Boys with increased levels of luteinizing hormone were significantly younger at BMT (5.4 +/- 0.8 vs 7.8 +/- 0.8 years; p = 0.024). Of 16 girls, 9 (56%) had spontaneous puberty with onset of menarche at a median age of 13 years (9.5 to 15.8 years). Though six (67%) of these nine girls have had increased plasma concentrations of luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones, normalization has occurred in two during a period of 4 to 7 years. The remaining seven subjects required hormone replacement because of clinical and biochemical evidence of ovarian failure. One of these subjects has recovered ovarian function after 5 1/2 years. Female patients with ovarian failure were significantly older at BMT compared with female patients with spontaneous puberty/menarche (8.6 +/- 23 years vs 6.1 +/- 1.8; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that most prepubertal boys undergoing BMT with chemotherapy and hyperfractionated total body irradiation can expect to enter and progress normally through puberty. For prepubertal girls treated with these regimens, at least 50% retain adequate ovarian function to enter puberty and menstruate regularly.",,,,,,,"['J Pediatr. 1997 Feb;130(2):174-5.

The establishment of a simplified in vitro model, which mimics a main event of the type I reaction, should provide true benefit for manufactures, researchers, and clinicians. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to develop and evaluate a mediator release assay based on rat bosophil leukemia cells for the purpose of investigating allergenic extracts. METHODS: Rat basophil leukemia cells were passively sensitized with murine IgE raised against allergens and stimulated by serial dilutions of allergenic extracts in a dose-related manner. The allergen-specific degranulation was monitored by measuring the release of beta-hexosaminidase. RESULTS: The investigation of standardized commercial allergen products for in vivo diagnostics (birch pollen, cat dander, and bee venom) allowed a quantitative description of differences in biologic activity in accordance with the declared activity units. The Fel d 1 content was determined in 17 cat dander extracts and correlated well with the results of a two-site binding ELISA (r = 0.93, log/log). Extremely low allergen amounts in the range of 10 to 100 pg/ml could be easily detected. Moreover, the cross-reactivity pattern of patients allergic to birch pollen could be reproduced with extracts of hazel, alder, apple, and celery. CONCLUSION: The assay is suitable for supplementing quality control of allergenic extracts and for the determination of biologic activity of final allergen products. As a research tool, it allows the study of IgE cross-linking properties of modified and recombinant allergens at an early stage before they are tested in human beings.","['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Bee Venoms)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a one-tube RT-PCR method to efficiently amplify this region. The method comprises three procedures: purification of poly(A)+ RNA from a starting RNA solution by oligo(dT)30 covalently linked to latex particles, buffer exchange, and continuous RT and PCR in a single tube containing all reaction components. The key elements of this method are (i) first-strand cDNA synthesis with the Superscript II version of RNase H- Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 50 degrees C for 10 min by using the RNA-oligo(dT)30 hybrid on the latex particles as the template and primer, and (ii) PCR by Taq and Pwo DNA polymerases mixed together with a mixture of 12 phased oligo(dT)25 antisense primers. The detection threshold of the one-tube RT-PCR method was as little as 0.2 ng of the crude RNA used as the source of the template. Using this method, we obtained 3-kb products from 24 SRSV strains previously characterized into four genetic groups. These included 5 P1-A, 4 P1-B, 5 P2-A, and 10 P2-B strains. Because SRSVs have not yet been cultivated in vitro, this novel method should facilitate molecular characterization of SRSVs to provide a firm scientific foundation for improvements and refinements of SRSV diagnostics.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",,,,,,,PMC229629,,,,

The PKR sequentially undergoes autophosphorylation and activation on binding to dsRNA. Previous studies have shown that PKR may be an important factor in the regulation of viral and cellular protein synthesis. Recent studies suggest that PKR may function as a tumor suppressor gene. The role of PKR in various human leukemic cells was therefore investigated. PKR mRNA levels by reverse transcription-PCR, protein expression by Western blot and FACScan analysis, and activity by phosphorylation status were studied. The expression of a known inhibitor of PKR, p58, was also investigated at mRNA and protein levels. A total of 24 samples from normal mononuclear cells (MNCs), 26 samples of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 26 samples of acute myelogenous leukemia, 32 samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 5 samples of hairy cell leukemia was investigated. Mean mRNA levels were increased in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia and decreased in chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared to normal MNCs. The mRNA levels in hairy cell leukemia were similar to those of normal MNCs. PKR protein was detectable in normal MNCs and leukemic cell extracts, and on FACScan analysis, more than 70% of cells stained positive for PKR. PKR activity was detectable in all samples investigated and was enhanced 4-23-fold in the presence of the synthetic dsRNA, poly(I) x poly(C). Protein expression of a known PKR inhibitor, p58, was barely detectable in normal MNCs and leukemic cells, with high expression in the HeLa cell line.

Two genes mapping to 9p21, p15 and p16, encode inhibitors for cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. We recently found that in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), both the p15 and p16 genes are deleted at a high frequency, with p16 gene deletion occurring slightly more frequently than p15 gene deletion. We now show that in addition to deletion, the p15 gene is preferentially hypermethylated at a 5' CpG island, which has been shown previously to be associated with loss of transcription of this gene. The p15 gene was methylated in 38% (17 of 45) of T-ALL patients at diagnosis and in 22% (7 of 32) of patients at relapse. On the other hand, methylation of the p16 gene was a rare event, occurring in 4% (2 of 49) of patients at diagnosis and in none (0 of 30) at relapse. The overall rates of alteration occurring in at least one allele of the p15 gene is 84% at diagnosis and 88% at relapse. These rates are as high as, if not greater than, those for the p16 gene (80% at diagnosis and 74% at relapse). In fact, such alterations involve both alleles in the majority of samples: 76% for p15 and 67% for p16 at diagnosis. All together, more than one-half (56%) of T-ALL samples harbor alterations in both alleles of both p15 and p16. These results lend strong support for a role of both p15 and p16 as tumor suppressors in T-ALL.","['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']","['001129/PHS HHS/United States', 'R21 CA 70397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U0CA28439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Three different clones of M1 cells were used: S6, which lacks p53; Phe-132, which expresses mutant p53 constitutively; and LTR-13, which expresses mutant protein at 37 degrees C and wild-type p53 at 32 degrees C. As described previously, LTR-13 cells undergo rapid apoptosis upon induction of wild-type p53 at 32 degrees C. Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis showed that etoposide treatment (0.5 microg/ml) of all three cell lines at 37 degrees C is associated with a block in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, whereas the cells preferentially die out of the next S phase. Induction of wild-type p53 in LTR-13 cells is associated with a loss of cells in late S and G2-M phase, and the cells die out of the early S phase. Interestingly, the simultaneous induction of apoptosis by both pathways (wild-type p53 and etoposide) leads to suppression of the etoposide-induced G2 block. To determine the effect of p53 on the G2 to M transition, LTR-13 cells were incubated with etoposide for 24 h at 37 degrees C and then either maintained for an additional 12 h at 37 degrees C or shifted to 32 degrees C to activate wild-type p53. The expression of wild-type p53 resulted in an increase in mitosis-specific phosphorylation, as determined by the MPM-2 antibody as well as the formation of mitotic spindles. This was associated with an important augmentation of the cytotoxic effect of etoposide. In contrast, a similar temperature shift of Phe-132 cells, which express mutant p53, had no effect on either immunostaining with MPM-2 or the cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results indicate that wild-type p53 can override the etoposide-induced G2 block in at least some cell types. These data propose a new role for p53 in the cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents and may have important implications for gene therapy.","['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In these studies, cerebellar effects have been dose limiting. Previous studies identified 4-demethylpenclomedine (4-DM-PEN) as the major plasma metabolite in rodents and humans. 4-DM-PEN was demonstrated to be an antitumor-active metabolite of penclomedine in vivo when evaluated against the penclomedine-sensitive MX-1 human breast tumor xenograft implanted either s.c. or intracerebrally and is believed to be on the metabolic activation pathway of penclomedine. Because earlier studies revealed an absence of neurotoxic cerebellar effects for 4-DM-PEN in contrast to penclomedine in a rat model, this metabolite may be a candidate for an alternative to penclomedine in the clinic for treatment of breast cancer or brain tumors, if the cerebellar effects of penclomedine preclude its further clinical development. Because neither penclomedine nor 4-DM-PEN were very active in vitro, the metabolism of penclomedine was also investigated using rat liver microsomes in an attempt to identify the ultimate active form of the drug. Metabolites and putative metabolites were prepared by chemical synthesis for antitumor evaluation in vitro and in vivo. A reductive metabolite, alpha,alpha-didechloro-PEN, was observed to be much more cytotoxic than penclomedine or 4-DM-PEN in vitro, but evaluation of this and the other metabolites and putative metabolites in vivo against the MX-1 tumor failed to identify any active metabolite among the structures evaluated other than 4-DM-PEN. The limited activity of 4-DM-PEN in vitro indicates that it, like penclomedine, is also a prodrug, demonstrating a need for additional studies on the metabolic activation of penclomedine to identify the ultimate active form of the drug.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Picolines)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '66Q80IL7CW (penclomedine)', 'XUK71J2M0Q (4-demethylpenclomedine)']","['N01-CM-17560-01/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA34200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic options are limited for patients with secondary AML and the role of bone marrow transplantation is unclear. METHODS: The authors report the treatment outcome of a cohort of 17 children who developed epipodophyllotoxin-induced secondary AML after therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that included etoposide but no irradiation or alkylating agents. Thirteen patients (76%) had 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities that were not present at the initial diagnosis of ALL. RESULTS: Remission induction was attempted in 16 children, with 13 (81%) achieving a complete remission. After consolidation, 9 of these 13 patients received a bone marrow transplant (BMT): 2 with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide-purged autologous marrow, 4 from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling, 1 from a mismatched parental donor, and 2 from a matched unrelated donor. One additional child underwent allogeneic BMT without an attempt at reinduction. Of the 10 patients who received transplants, 2 were alive and well 27+ and 36+ months, respectively, after BMT. Of the 7 patients who did not receive a transplant, at last follow-up 1 had survived off therapy for 8 months for recurrent ALL whereas 6 died of AML. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the poor prognosis of secondary AML after epipodophyllotoxin treatment for childhood ALL. Although patients with secondary AML can achieve a remission, it is usually of brief duration. Allogeneic BMT may offer the possibility of long term remission in some of these patients. More information is needed to better define the risks and benefits of epipodophyllotoxin therapy for childhood ALL.",['L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)'],,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of cases have occurred in patients treated with high dose therapy and in children with nephrotic syndrome. Because of its rarity, oncologists and hematologists may not be aware of this potential complication. METHODS: Two elderly patients with a remote history of seizures had generalized tonic-clonic seizures 3 days after chlorambucil therapy was initiated. A MEDLINE search was performed of previously reported cases and additional cases were found in the bibliographies of retrieved articles. RESULTS: In addition to the 2 new cases presented here, there have been 28 reported cases of chlorambucil-induced seizures. Underlying diseases included nephrotic syndrome (n = 12 cases), solid tumors (n - 10 cases), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 3 cases), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1 case). Five cases were secondary to accidental overdose. Sixteen of 30 patients were younger than 18 years; 11 had nephrotic syndrome, 1 had choriocarcinoma, and 4 accidentally ingested the medication. Nine of 14 adults received high dose chlorambucil in Phase I-II studies or as part of a conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow transplantation for solid tumors, 3 were on intermittent pulse therapy, 1 was on daily low dose administration of chlorambucil, and 1 patient had an accidental poisoning. Two patients had recurrent seizures when they were rechallenged with chlorambucil. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high incidence of chlorambucil-induced seizures in children with nephrotic syndrome may be due to an increased sensitivity in childhood or altered pharmacokinetics. In adults without a seizure history, seizures were observed only in patients treated with high dose chlorambucil; however, in adults with a seizure history, lower doses as used in pulse therapy also caused seizures. In the latter group of patients, daily low dose chlorambucil or, more likely, an alternative drug may be the safest approach to therapy.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Failure of the integrin-containing vesicles to reach the plasma membrane effectively blocks development of all integrin-mediated responses and the formation of a functional oxidase complex. Several lines of evidence suggested that the underlying cause of this defect may be the loss of regulatory elements in the cytoskeleton, which mediate microtubule stability and organization. Diminished protein kinase C (PKC) beta 2 association with microtubules correlated with the loss of heat-soluble microtubule-associated PKC-binding proteins and the loss of TPA-inducible reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton in the resistant U937 variants. Treatment with the microtubule-disrupting drug, nocodazole, was sufficient to induce the modest increase in cd11b surface expression associated with the release of this preformed integrin. Furthermore, brief nocodazole treatment followed by TPA treatment completely restored susceptibility to phorbol ester-induced differentiation in the resistant cell lines. The combination of nocodazole and TPA treatment also restored NADPH oxidase activity in the TPA-resistant clones. Results from these studies suggest that TPA-induced microtubule reorganization is a prerequisite for integrin vesicle translocation in U937 cells and that vesicle translocation to the plasma membrane may be a prerequisite for the transcriptional activation of cd11b and cd11c integrin genes in the early stages of monocyte differentiation.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent analysis indicated no differences between wildtype (wt) and resistant U937 cells with respect to protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme expression, activation, or down-modulation. The subcellular localization of PKCs is identical in wt and resistant cells with the exception of PKC beta 2, which no longer colocalizes with microtubules in the TPA-resistant cell lines. In contrast to wt-U937 cells, the resistant cells do not express beta 2-integrin adhesion molecules, cd11b and cd11c, on the cell surface following TPA treatment but do express cd11b and cd11c in intracellular vesicles. TPA stimulates the translocation of these vesicles to the cell surface in wt U937 cells but not in the resistant cells.

In ALL, risk stratification is based on the presenting white cell count, sex, age and cytogenetics of the tumour cells. Even in acute myeloid leukaemia, the outcome with chemotherapy alone is now sufficient to limit elective allogeneic bone marrow transplantation to those who do not have cytogenetically favourable disease. In non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a dramatic improvement in overall survival from 50% to in excess of 80% has been achieved by an escalation in dose and dose intensity of chemotherapy. With this improvement, the prognostic influence of clinical staging has become less clear and recent efforts have concentrated on determining which groups of patients would be cured by less intensive treatment. As for ALL, there is concern about the potential late sequelae in these highly curable children.

The risk of Burkitt's lymphoma is highest in tropical Africa and Papua New Guinea; it is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection and intense immune stimulation by malaria. Other lymphomas are also relatively common in developing countries. Non-heritable retinoblastoma has a higher incidence among less affluent populations, suggesting an association with poor living conditions and maybe an infectious aetiology.

In vitro studies have shown that EBV can immortalise and transform cells by upregulation of the cellular proto-oncogene, B cell leukaemia-2 (bcl-2), via the viral latent membrane protein, LMP1. The purpose of this study was to determine whether bcl-2 expression is upregulated in the lungs of patients with LIP and whether EBV LMP1 has a role in this bcl-2 expression. METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis using alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded lung tissues from 13 patients with LIP using anti-LMP1 and anti-bcl-2 monoclonal antibodies. Lung tissues from nine patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and nine necropsy cases without pulmonary disease served as controls. LMP1 positivity was estimated as the number of LMP1 positive cells per unit area of lung tissue. Immunostaining for bcl-2 expression was assessed by a pictorial-based semiquantitative grading system. RESULTS: Positive immunostaining for LMP1 was localised to airway epithelial cells of lung tissue. Ten out of 13 (77%) patients with LIP were positive for LMP1 compared with three of nine cases (33%) in each control group. LMP1 positivity of LIP cases was significantly greater than that of non-LIP cases: LIP versus IPF (mean difference, 95% confidence interval (CI)) 2.39 (1.54 to 3.24); LIP versus necropsy controls 2.62 (1.77 to 3.47). bcl-2 immunostaining was localised to lymphocytes within the alveolar septa and lymphoid aggregates of patients with LIP. The cumulative score for bcl-2 immunostaining was significantly higher in the lungs of patients with LIP than in those of patients with IPF and necropsy controls: LIP versus IPF and LIP versus necropsy controls (mean difference, 95% CI) 7.55 (7.18 to 7.92). CONCLUSIONS: These immunohistochemical studies have shown the presence of EBV LMP1 protein in airway epithelial cells and overexpression of the cellular bcl-2 protein in lymphoid cells of lung tissue in patients with LIP. These geographically distinct staining patterns of immunostaining suggest that the involvement of EBV LMP1 in the upregulation of cellular bcl-2 is more complex in LIP than was thought from previous in vitro observations. The respective roles of EBV LMP1 and bcl-2 in the pathogenesis of LIP require further studies.","['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",,,,,,,PMC1758406,,,,

The clinical changes of the oral mucosa and functional modifications were scored daily, over 21 days with a 16 item scale, ranging from 0 to 3. A daily index of mucositis (DIM) was established by adding the scores obtained for the 16 items and a cumulative score of oral mucositis was obtained by the addition of the 21 DIM for assessing the severity of oral mucositis throughout its duration. The internal consistency measures (Chronbach alpha) were strong (range 0.80-0.97). A scale of equivalence, pre-established in comparison with pre-existing general mucositis rating scales, permitted a day by day simple classification in a 4-grade scale, to be obtained.

METHODS: This nested case control study identified all fatal cases of lymphohaematopoietic cancer among a previously studied cohort. Of the 29 cases, 14 had leukaemia, seven multiple myeloma, and eight non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A four to one matching ratio was used to select a stratified sample of controls from the same cohort, controlling for year of birth and time at risk. Industrial hygienists estimated workplace exposures for benzene and total hydrocarbons, without knowledge of case or control status, for combinations of job, location, and era represented in all work histories. Average daily benzene concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 6.2 parts per million (ppm) for all jobs. Company medical records were used to abstract information on other potential confounders such as cigarette smoking, although the data were incomplete. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with conditional logistic regression techniques for several exposure variables. RESULTS: Risks of leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma were not associated with increasing cumulative exposure to benzene or total hydrocarbons. For leukaemia, the logistic regression model predicted an OR of 1.002 (P < 0.77) for each ppm-y of exposure to benzene. Duration of exposure to benzene was more closely associated with risk of leukaemia than other exposure variables. It was not possible to completely control for other risk factors, although there was suggestive evidence that smoking and a family history of cancer may have played a part in the risk of leukaemia. CONCLUSION: This study did not show a relation between lymphohaematopoietic cancer and long term, low level exposures to benzene.

The contemporaneous exposure in vitro to both platinum compounds gave a significantly higher cell growth inhibition than that expected on the basis of dose-response curves for single agents in all tumour models tested. In vivo, the combinations of DDP plus DPR elicited significant enhancement over the activity of the drugs alone both in the ascitic and solid P388 models. The combined treatment of 10 mg/kg DDP and 14 mg/kg DPR yielded 62.5% tumour-free mice compared with 6.2% with 10 mg/kg DDP alone, the best single agent. It is noteworthy that the combined application of DDP and DPR was also very effective in the solid cisplatin-resistant L1210/DDP model, inducing a significant reduction in the volume of tumour. A therapeutic advantage was achieved with combination treatments that had no effect on platinum-mediated body weight loss and were generally well tolerated by the mice. At equitoxic concentrations of DPR and carboplatin, the treatment with DDP plus DPR proved to have a higher efficacy against this tumour model compared to that observed after the combined treatment with DDP and carboplatin. In summary, the combination of DDP and DPR showed a therapeutic advantage over single drug treatment and has demonstrated promise at the preclinical level in its ability to circumvent acquired resistance to DDP both in vitro and in vivo.","['14913-33-8 (transplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, they all share the transmembrane signalling protein gp130. In this paper the expression and function of this family of receptors in breast cancer cells was examined. RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that gp130 was expressed in 12/12 breast cell lines and the specific receptor alpha-chains for IL-6, LIF, IL-11 and CNTF were expressed in the majority of these cell lines. This was in contrast to other hemopoietin receptors. Examination of 50 clinical samples of malignant breast tissue by RT-PCR showed a similar pattern of expression of gp130 associated receptors. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with OSM resulted in changes in cellular morphology. Cellular proliferation was inhibited following exposure to OSM (3/4 cell lines), IL-11 (2/4 cell lines), and by IL-6 and LIF (1/4 cell lines). Cell surface binding of LIF and OSM was also documented. The expression of these receptors in 12/12 cell lines and greater than 95% of clinical samples suggests that these molecules may be important in regulating the growth of breast cells.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The structure of the receptor for this factor, OB-R, is considerably similar to those of gp130, the common signal transducing receptor component for the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Since the IL-6 family of cytokines signal through gp130 homodimer or gp130/LIFR heterodimer, we have examined in this study the possible involvement of gp130 and LIFR in leptin signaling through OB-R. Leptin stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of neither gp130 nor LIFR, while LIF stimulation does both. As examined by using two differently epitope-tagged OB-R molecules, the spontaneous homo-oligomerization of OB-R has been elucidated. Ba/F3 cells, which do not express gp130, are non-responsive to leptin and exhibit increased DNA synthesis in response to leptin after transfection of OB-R cDNA alone. OB-R appears to transduce the signal via its homo-oligomerization without interaction with gp130 or LIFR.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (leptin receptor, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, mycosis fungoides (MF) and its hematogenous variant Sezary Syndrome (SS), share similar clinical and pathological features to HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and speculation of a retroviral link to MF and SS, especially in areas non-endemic for ATL, has lead to an intensified search for HTLV- and HIV-like agents in these diseases. To further explore a potential role for human retroviruses in MF and SS, skin biopsy-derived or peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived DNA from 17 patients (MF, n = 7; erythrodermic MF (EMF), n = 5; SS, n = 5) from the North Eastern United States were screened using gene amplification by PCR and a liquid hybridization detection assay. Previously published primers and probes for HTLV-I (LTR, gag, pol, env, and pX), and our own primers and probes for HTLV-I (gag, pol, and env), HTLV-II (pol and env) and HIV-I (gag and pol) were employed. Serum antibodies to HTLV-I were negative in all but one EMF patient. The single HTLV-I seropositive patient carrying a diagnosis of EMF generated positive amplified signals for all of the eight HTLV-I regions tested. Ultimately, this individual evolved to exhibit clinical manifestations indistinguishable from ATL. The other 16 patients were negative for all 12 HTLV and HIV retroviral regions. Our findings suggest that none of the known prototypic human retroviruses are associated with seronegative MF and SS. The uniformly positive results for HTLV-I in the seropositive patient suggests that this patient initially presented with a smoldering form of ATL and illustrates the difficulty that sometimes may be encountered in the differential diagnosis of MF, SS, and ATL based solely on clinical and histopathological criteria.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of our article are to present the implications in clinical, rather than biostatistical terms, and to provide an extensive literature review of the subject of meta-analysis. We conclude that treatment assessments, resulting from meta-analysis of closed studies (retrospective) should be met with healthy skepticism.

Given the therapeutic progress achieved over the last few decades, any improvement in the outcome for the majority of children with ALL is difficult to assess with the usual size trials. Furthermore, the progress in genetics and molecular biology has now led to the identification of subgroups of children, typically with rare characteristics, for whom new treatments still await evaluation. For both these aspects of clinical research, there is an increasing need for international intergroup cooperation. After a discussion on the role of retrospective meta-analysis and randomized controlled trials in ALL research, we suggest that intergroup studies could be made more feasible, but still scientifically rigorous, by adopting a strategy of prospective meta-analysis. This strategy can be described as follows: i) different groups prospectively plan to ask the same randomized question within their protocols which may differ in other aspects, and to pool their data in order to evaluate treatment effect; ii) the management of the study can be de-centralized, by allowing each group to be responsible for conducting its own protocol. We would like to stimulate the debate on the methodological and practical aspects of research perspectives in ALL (and in pediatric oncology).",,,,,,,,,,,,

The pH dependence of methotrexate (MTX) influx by folate receptor beta in F2-MTX'A cells was characterized and compared with that of the reduced folate carrier in parental L1210 cells. MTX influx by folate receptor beta had a pH optimum of 6.5, whereas influx mediated by the reduced folate carrier showed a pH optimum of 7.5. Increased folate receptor beta-mediated MTX influx at pH 6.5 relative to pH 7.5 was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in binding affinity of the receptor for MTX without a change in the number of binding sites. At pH 6.2, approximately 24% of MTX influx in F2-MTX'A cells proceeded by another mechanism. This transport route became active at pH < 7.5, operated optimally at pH 6.0 to 6.5, and, unlike folate receptor beta-mediated MTX influx, was insensitive to the presence of low levels of folic acid (100 nM). MTX influx by the low pH system showed saturability, with a Ki of 5.3 microM and a Vmax of 1.53 nmol/g dry wt/min, was energy dependent, was inhibited by sulfobromophthalein with a Ki of 148 microM, and had similar relative affinities for folic acid, leucovorin, and 5 methyltetrahydrofolate. Influx of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was also mediated by this route.

Although photoaffinity labeling of hRFC protein revealed similar increases of 15- and 19-fold, respectively, only a 2-fold enhancement in methotrexate (Mtx) transport was observed. This suggests that only a small portion of the cDNA-encoded hRFC protein is actively engaged in membrane transport. Kinetic analysis of [3H]Mtx transport indicated that K43-6 cells exhibited a similar affinity (Kt) but an increased Vmax (1.7-fold) when compared with K562 cells. The restored transport was similar to that of wild-type cells in its capacity to be trans-stimulated by intracellular folates and in its sensitivity to competitive transport inhibitors (1843U89, bromosulfophthalein, folic acid, leucovorin, and ZD1694) and to irreversible inhibition by N-hydroxysuccinimide-methotrexate. Further, deglycosylated photoaffinity-labeled hRFC protein in both K562 and K43-6 cells migrated at approximately 65-70 kDa on SDS-gels, consistent with the molecular mass from the predicted amino acid sequence. These data further establish that the expression of hRFC, alone, is sufficient to confer transport properties typical of the ""classical"" hRFC.

To date, nine other MLL partner genes have been cloned, but their precise functions have yet to be determined. To characterize the functions of ELL further, we have cloned the murine homologue of ELL and have found that the gene is highly conserved at the nucleotide and amino acid level. The open reading frame of the murine homologue contains 602 aa, slightly smaller than the 621 aa in the human gene. With Northern blot analysis, a 3.4-kb transcript is detected in all tissues examined with greatest levels of expression in the liver. Unlike human ELL, only a single transcript can be detected with either murine coding sequence or 3' untranslated region probes. To examine the spatial and temporal pattern of expression in murine development, in situ hybridization studies were performed with sense and antisense riboprobes from the 3' untranslated region of murine Ell. Ell is expressed diffusely by embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5). In addition, high levels of expression can be detected in maternally derived decidual tissue. At E14.5, Ell is expressed diffusely throughout the embryo. However by E16.5, specific expression in the liver and gastrointestinal tract becomes prominent and remains so in both neonates and adults. To determine the subcellular localization of ELL, we developed a polyclonal antiserum to ELL that was used for immunofluorescence studies in COS-7, HeLa, NIH 3T3, and A7r5 cells. The ELL protein was localized to the nucleus but excluded from nucleoli in all cell lines examined.

The technique, genetic footprinting, uses a retroviral integrase to generate a comprehensive library of mutants, each of which bears a single insertion of a defined oligonucleotide at a random position in the gene of interest. This mutant library is selected for gene function en masse. DNA samples are isolated from the library both before and after selection, and the mutations represented in each sample are then analyzed. The analysis is designed so that a mutation at a particular location gives rise to an electrophoretic band of discrete mobility. For the whole library, this results in a ladder of bands, each band representing a specific mutation. Mutants in which the inserted sequence disrupts a feature that is required for the selected function, ipso facto, fail the selection. The corresponding bands are therefore absent from the ladder of bands obtained from the library after selection, giving rise to a footprint representing features of the gene that are essential for the selected function. Because the sequence of the inserted oligonucleotide is known, and its position can be inferred precisely from the electrophoretic mobility of the corresponding band, the precise location and sequence of mutations that disrupt gene function can be determined without isolating or sequencing individual mutants. This method should be generally applicable for saturation mutagenesis and high-resolution functional mapping of cloned DNA sequences.","['9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']","['R01 CA149719/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA09302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 AI27205/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC19786,,,,

We sought to determine whether treatment of cells with IFN-alpha activates the PI 3'-kinase serine kinase. 32P-labeling experiments and phosphoaminoacid analysis of immunoprecipitated IRS-1 protein demonstrated that, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, IFN-alpha induces its phosphorylation on serine residues. In vitro kinase assays on alphaIRS-1 immunoprecipitates also demonstrated IFN-alpha-dependent serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, suggesting that the protein associates with an IFN-alpha-regulated serine kinase. Furthermore, IFN-alpha-dependent phosphorylation of IRS-1 was detected in in vitro kinase assays on alpha p85 immunoprecipitates, and was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with the specific PI 3'-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, consistent with a regulatory role of the PI 3'-kinase serine kinase on the phosphorylation of the protein. Treatment of cells with wortmannin also inhibited the phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3'-kinase and the type I IFN-regulated activation of the Map kinase, but had no inhibitory effect on the IFN-alpha-induced activation of Tyk-2 and Jak-1 kinases nor on the activation of Stat-1, Stat-2, and Stat-3.

We demonstrate here that human T cells, upon activation, neo-express the melanoma metastasis-associated surface molecule MUC18/melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM). Expression of MUC18/MCAM (CD146) on T cells could be identified with two mAbs (541-10B2 and 541-2E5) obtained after immunization with HUT102 T cells and found to react with activated T cells. The specificity of our mAbs for MUC18/MCAM (CD146) was revealed by 1) definition of the appropriate molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa unreduced and 120 kDa reduced, 2) reactivity of mAbs with MUC18/MCAM (CD146) cDNA-transfected mouse L cells, 3) conclusive crosswise immunoblotting experiments with MUC18/MCAM (CD146)-specific mAbs, and 4) N-terminal amino acid sequencing of precipitated protein. In vitro activation by PHA caused neo-expression of MUC18/MCAM (CD146) on peripheral blood T cells within 1 day of stimulation, reaching a maximum on day 3. In vivo expression of MUC18/MCAM (CD146) was confirmed on CD3+ T cells infiltrating delayed-type hypersensitivity lesions of the skin, on synovial fluid T cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients, and on distinct T leukemia cells. MUC18/MCAM (CD146) cell surface expression on activated T cells is mirrored by the presence of specific mRNA. Leukocytes of healthy donors do not show significant MUC18/MCAM (CD146) expression.

Based on conceptual, methodological and practical criteria, the EORTC-QLQ C 30 questionnaire was used. In addition, patients' coping strategies were assessed by the FQCI. Patients' individual perception of their disease and therapy was evaluated by a semi-structured interview. Currently, 61 patients are enrolled in the protocol. For those patients having completed the course of inpatient treatment, individual assessment of Global Health Status and Subjective QL improves significantly. The content analysis of the interviews shows to what extent aspects of the inpatient setting influence patients' QL.

The present work provides a new method for the detection of intracellular RNA molecules using in situ hybridization on living cells. The first step consisted in designing nonperturbant conditions for cell permeabilization using streptolysin O. In a second step, intracellular hybridization specificity was evaluated by incorporating various types of fluorescently labeled nucleic acid probes (plasmids, oligonucleotides). Due to its high expression level, the 28S ribosomal RNA was retained as a model. Results showed that: (1) no significant cell death was observed after permeabilization; (2) on living cells, 28S RNA specific probes provided bright nucleoli and low cytoplasmic signal; (3) control probes did not lead to significant fluorescent staining; and (4) comparison of signals obtained on living and fixed cells showed a colocalization of observed fluorescence. These results indicate the feasibility of specific hybridization of labeled nucleic acid probes under living conditions, after a simple and efficient permeabilization step. This new detection method is of interest for investigating the dynamics of distribution of various gene products in living cells, under normal or pathological conditions.","['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 28S)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (streptolysin O)']",,,,,,,,,,,

It starts with the philosophy behind antisense DNA and the production of antisense RNA from genetic constructs and raises the various problems which are being addressed. These include uptake into cells, targeting the substrate sequence and cells, the stability of the antisense molecules and pharmokinetic considerations within animals. The review talks of the positive results attained in vitro and in vivo in animal and plant experiments but also addresses the problems many workers have faced in the field. It attempts to resolve these differences in terms of the need for further understanding of the mechanisms by which the positive results have been obtained. The novel use of catalytic ribozymes (RNA) in downregulating genes is also discussed in similar terms to antisense DNA and RNA. By taking a case study with a human leukaemia the review delves into the mysteries of how different results can be resolved by improving the design of ribozymes thereby increasing specificity and preventing aberrant reactions. It is concluded that despite a lack of understanding of how the biological effects have come about in vitro and in vivo the clinical and research developments should resolve the issue of antisense potential for rational drug development.","['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARIES: Case 1: An 81-year-old man with lymphoma being treated with chlorambucil developed jerking movements and stiffness that persisted for 3 days and intensified at night. The dosage of chlorambucil was decreased with a subsequent decrease in symptomatology. Resolution of the myoclonus occurred with discontinuation of the chlorambucil. Rechallenge evoked a return of tremors the next day that later became constant and again resolved on discontinuation of chlorambucil. Case 2: A 75-year-old woman with lymphoma being treated with chlorambucil developed jerking movements in her limbs, particularly in her arms and right hip. The symptoms were so severe they prevented the patient from leaving her house. All symptoms resolved within 2-3 days after the cycle was completed and did not return. She was diagnosed as having had chlorambucil-induced myoclonus. DATA SOURCES: Searches were performed on MEDLINE, CancerLit, and Science Citation Index Review to identify reports and articles discussing chlorambucil-induced neurotoxicity, particularly myoclonus. DISCUSSION: Chlorambucil-induced myoclonus has been described in overdose situations and in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in children. Three cases of reversible myoclonic activity associated with high-dose chlorambucil in adults have also been described. In each case, the myoclonus resolved following discontinuation of the drug. Only one other conclusive case of low-dose chlorambucil-induced myoclonus in an adult has been described. The two cases presented here are unique in that the myoclonus occurred in adults receiving low-dose chlorambucil who had no myoclonus before or after treatment with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: From the cases reviewed, it appears that chlorambucil may induce myoclonus in adults receiving therapeutic dosages of chlorambucil. The neurologic status of patients receiving chlorambucil should be followed closely during treatment. If myoclonus develops, drug-induced myoclonus should be considered, as well as discontinuation of the drug.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Since Vmw110-deficient viruses reactivate inefficiently in mouse latency models it has been suggested that Vmw110 plays a role in the balance between the latent and lytic states of the virus. The mechanisms by which Vmw110 achieves these functions are poorly understood. Vmw110 migrates to discrete nuclear structures (ND10) which contain the cellular PML protein, and in consequence PML and other constituent proteins are dispersed. In addition, Vmw110 binds to a cellular protein of approximately 135 kDa, and its interactions with the 135 kDa protein and ND10 contribute to its ability to stimulate gene expression and viral lytic growth. In this report we identify the 135 kDa protein as a novel member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family. The protease is distributed in the nucleus in a micropunctate pattern with a limited number of larger discrete foci, some of which co-localize with PML in ND10. At early times of virus infection, the presence of Vmw110 increases the proportion of ND10 which contain the ubiquitin-specific protease. These results identify a novel, transitory component of ND10 and implicate a previously uncharacterized ubiquitin-dependent pathway in the control of viral gene expression.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",,['GENBANK/Z72499'],,,,,PMC1169660,,,,['EMBO J. 1997 Apr 1;16(7):1519-30.

Co-expression of human GMR alpha-chain and wild-type human beta c in two murine leukaemic cell lines (M1 and WEHI-3B D+) conferred the ability to terminally differentiate into macrophages when stimulated with human GM-CSF. Analysis of cytoplasmic truncation mutants of beta c showed that residues to amino acid 783 (numbering from the first amino acid of the leader sequence) were sufficient for the GM-CSF-dependent induction of all aspects of differentiation in both cell types. However, shorter truncations selectively lost, in a cell-specific manner, first the capacity to induce macrophage migration in agar and then cell surface differentiation antigens and clonal suppression of proliferative potential. The data suggest that different aspects of the differentiated phenotype can be dissociated with the required signalling pathways originating from distinct regions of the receptor cytoplasmic domain and cooperating to produce a fully differentiated macrophage. The cooperativity of these pathways and limiting cell signalling intermediate pool sizes could explain the observed cell line differences and may have implications for normal haemopoiesis.","['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",['CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC1169649,,,,

Propagation of tumors induced by Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) in E mu-Pim1 or H2-K-myc transgenic mice by transplantation to syngeneic hosts permitted proviral tagging of 'progression' genes. Molecular cloning of common proviral insertion sites that were detected preferentially in transplanted tumors led to the identification of a novel gene, designated Frat1. The initial selection for integrations near Frat1 occurs in primary tumor cells that have already acquired proviruses in other common insertion sites, yielding primary lymphomas that contain only a minor fraction of tumor cells with an activated Frat1 allele. Transplantation of such primary lymphomas allows for a further expansion of tumor cell clones carrying a proviral insertion near Frat1, resulting in detectable Frat1 rearrangements in 17% of the transplanted E mu-Pim1 tumors and 30% of the transplanted H2-K-myc tumors, respectively. We have cloned and sequenced both the mouse Frat1 gene and its human counterpart. The proteins encoded by Frat1 and FRAT1 are highly homologous and their functions are thus far unknown. Tumor cell lines with high expression of Myc and Pim1 acquired an additional selective advantage in vivo upon infection with a Frat1-IRES-lacZ retrovirus, thus underscoring the role of Frat1 in tumor progression, and the ability of Frat1 to collaborate with Pim1 and Myc in lymphomagenesis.","['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",,"['GENBANK/U58974', 'GENBANK/U58975']",,,,,PMC1169648,,,,

High-dose irradiation enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production from Mphi treated with interferon-gamma and their cytotoxic activity. The enhancement of NO production by irradiation was attributed to high levels of expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, the participation of reactive oxygen intermediates in NO production was examined. Nitric oxide production was not enhanced by treatment with the membrane-oxidizing agent tert-butyl hydroperoxide or the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase superoxide (O2.-)-generating system. On the other hand, NO production was enhanced by treatment with a low dose of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can diffuse passively through the cell membrane and can be converted into hydroxyl radicals (HO.) that cause DNA breaks. In addition, treatment with low-dose actinomycin D, which induces DNA strand breaks, enhanced NO production, but hydroxyurea, which stops DNA replication without DNA strand breaks, had no such effect. These findings suggest that DNA strand breaks caused by hydroxyl radicals formed inside the cells by gamma-irradiation, or strand breaks caused directly by radiation, plays an important role in the enhancement of NO production, but peroxidation of cell membranes has little effect.","['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)']",,,,,,,,,,,

More particular are observations where chronological and histological features show an evident link between a tumorous process and sclerosis. OBSERVATION: This case concerns a man 69 years old who was treated for one year for partial subcutaneous sclerosis present on his legs, thighs, fore-arms, and on the upper part of the trunk. No signs were present of visceral involvement evoking a systemic scleroderma and histology showed an intrication of a deep sclerosis, fasciitis and a tumoral lymphoma process. Diagnosis of lymphocytic lymphoma was confirmed. Initiating a chemotherapy (CHOP) allowed for a reduction of the sclerosis which didn't respond to the only corticotherapy. DISCUSSION: This observation can be linked to the association of fasciitis and lymphoma identified by Naschitz et al, but is different by: 1) the clinical aspect which correspond more to deep morphea lesions; 2) the histological link between sclerosis and lymphoma. This last point suggest that it is the tumoral population which have induced the sclerosis process linked to the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. In adverse cases with longer delay between lymphoma and scleroderma this association may be fortuitous.","['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",,,"Lesions a type de morphees profondes, premieres manifestations d'un lymphome lymphocytique.",,,,,,,,

In this report, we studied the contribution of plasminogen activators to the invasive properties of 7 human T-cell lines in a model of transmigration through an extracellular matrix. The T-cell lines were found to express either urokinase (u-PA) and high levels of u-PA receptor or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and low levels of u-PA receptor. The rate of transmigration was consistently higher for u-PA-expressing cells than for t-PA-expressing cells. PA-inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) was detected in the conditioned medium of one cell line and PAI-2 was detected in cell extracts from 6 lines. The transmigration of 6 out of 7 cell lines was inhibited by trasylol, an inhibitor of plasmin, by an excess of exogenous PAI-1 or PAI-2, and by antibodies to the particular PA type expressed by the cells. Partial inhibition of transmigration by the amino-terminal fragment of u-PA implies that the u-PA receptor contributes to transmigration. Thus, the transmigration of T-leukemia cells through a barrier of extracellular matrix requires PA-dependent proteolysis, which can be provided either by u-PA or t-PA. Specific inhibition of the PA system could provide a means to inhibit tissue invasion by T lymphoblastic cells.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the occurrence of multiple primary cancers was used to indicate possible associations between smoking and the incidence of cancers other than those generally accepted as smoking-associated. All cancer cases in persons above the age of 30, registered at the population-based Cancer Registry of Norway (1953-1993), were used in the analysis. For each type of cancer, the observed occurrence of smoking-associated cancers in the patients was compared with the expected occurrence if the patients had the same risk as the general population. Similar comparisons were made for the occurrence of other cancers in patients with a smoking-associated cancer. The results were presented as standardized incidence ratio (SIR), the ratio of the observed and the expected numbers of cases. The results indicated that uterine cervical cancer may share some important risk factor(s) with the cancers generally accepted as smoking-associated. This is in accordance with the literature, where an association between smoking and uterine cervical cancer has been found consistently.

This antigen is encoded by P1A, a gene activated in several tumors but silent in normal tissues except for testis and placenta. Notwithstanding the expression of P1A in testis, we found that male mice mounted P815AB-specific CTL responses as efficiently as females. The responding males remained fertile and no autoimmune lesions were observed in their testes. By immunohistochemistry with a rabbit antiserum directed against the P1A protein, we identified spermatogonia as the testicular cells expressing P1A. The absence of MHC class-I molecules on spermatogonia could be one of the mechanisms of protection against testicular autoimmunity, as the antigenic peptide should not be displayed at the cell surface. Human genes MAGE, BAGE and GAGE, which also code for tumor antigens recognized by autologous CTL, are not expressed in normal tissues other than testis. The results obtained in mice with antigen P815AB suggest that immunization of human males with such antigens will not generate autoimmune side-effects. Although P1A is strongly expressed in placenta, we also found that gestation did not prevent generation of CTL responses against antigen P815AB, and that such CTL responses did not affect gestation outcome. We identified labyrinthine trophoblasts as the placental cells expressing P1A. Again, the absence of MHC class-I molecules on these cells provides a plausible explanation for placental protection, although other mechanisms may also play a role.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (tumor rejection antigen P815A, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Our data and a review of the literature suggest that post-orchidectomy radiotherapy with chemotherapy for relapse in stage I and IIA disease results in long-term cure rates approaching 100%. Treatment with chemotherapy either routinely or selectively or using a surveillance policy is unlikely to show any improvement in outcome and may be less cost-effective and/or produce increased morbidity and the risk of secondary leukaemia. For stage IIB disease (5-10 cm) the use of initial combination chemotherapy with or without subsequent radiotherapy did not appear to give better outcomes than initial radical radiotherapy alone, reserving chemotherapy or further radiotherapy for relapse. For bulkier stage IIB disease (> 10 cm), the use of initial chemotherapy plus consolidation radiotherapy appeared to be an appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Management protocols for seminoma of the testis at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney Department of Radiation Oncology currently are (i) stage I, IIA and IIB (5-10 cm): post-orchidectomy radiotherapy alone with chemotherapy or further radiotherapy for relapse; and (ii) stage IIB (> 10 cm) disease: initial chemotherapy post-orchidectomy followed by radiotherapy to sites of initial disease involvement.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,

Several investigations have suggested that one of the mechanisms through which estrogen prevents bone loss was a modulation on secretion or release of various cytokines that are known to influence bone remodeling, even if some recent data have challenged this hypothesis. However, in established osteoporosis, the possibility that enhanced cytokines activity may account for the progression of this disease remains unclear and controversial. We sought here to determine whether production of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF and LIF, after direct stimulation in whole blood, was different in healthy (n = 30) or osteoporotic postmenopausal women (n = 24) and whether lumbar bone density (1-BMD) correlated with the values of cytokine production observed in these conditions. A significant difference was observed between the osteoporotic and control subjects for IL-1 beta (p < 0.0001), IL-6 (p < 0.001) and TNF-alpha (p = 0.027) productions, the values being higher in the osteoporotic women. No significant differences between the groups were observed for IFN-gamma (p = 0.51), GM-CSF (p = 0.70) or LIF (p = 0.97). In the whole population, statistically significant negative correlations were observed between lumbar BMD and IL-1 beta (r = -0.46) (p < 0.0005), IL-6 (r = -0.50) (p < 0.0001) and TNF-alpha (r = -0.39) (p < 0.005) production while no such correlations were observed for IFN-gamma, GM-CSF or LIF. In conclusion, the study of cytokine production by immune cells cultured in autologous whole blood suggests that in women more than 10 years past the menopause and presenting a decrease in lumbar bone density corresponding to the new WHO definition of ""osteoporosis', production of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha is still increased compared to controls matched for age and ovarian function, while no differences are reported for IFN-gamma, GM-CSF or LIF production.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Toward elucidating its neural functions in vivo, we previously investigated the distribution of CDF/LIF binding sites with iodinated native CDF/LIF in embryonic to postnatal day 0 (P0) rats. In the present study, we have extended our examination to postnatal ages and find that specific CDF/LIF binding sites are present at defined developmental stages in additional brain regions not previously exhibiting binding by P0. High levels of binding are detected in all P7 sensory and autonomic ganglia examined, but only in restricted postnatal central nervous system structures. Cranial motor and mesencephalic trigeminal neurons maintain high levels throughout, while binding to spinal motor neurons, which decreases to low levels at P0, reappears by P14 and increases with age. Most other structures, which show detectable binding by P0, exhibit higher levels at postnatal ages, including the red, deep, ventral cochlear, trapezoid, superior olivary, vestibular, ventral tegmental, and ventral posterior thalamic nuclei as well as the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. High levels are also detected in several structures for the first time after P0, including the cerebellar cortex (molecular and Purkinje cell layers), lateral reticular nucleus of the medulla and reticular formation, as well as the reticulotegmental, medial geniculate, solitary (rostral, dorsomedial, and commissural regions), medial septal, lateral mammillary, and lateral habenular nuclei. These results not only identify regions of potential CDF/LIF-responsive neurons and glia throughout development but suggest new CDF/LIF roles in the nervous system.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,

It is, however, believed that emergence of resistant cells to chemotherapy cause minimal residual leukemia resulting in poor prognosis. Ubx has been administered in combination with these chemotherapeutic agents. We examined the combinatorial effect of Ubx with DNR, Ara-C, 6-MP and etoposide on K562 leukemic cell line and the chemotherapeutic agent resistant cells derived from K562 cell line. Ubx showed growth inhibitory effects on these cell lines. A synergistic effect was observed on growth inhibition and with colony formation of parent k562 cell line when DNR and Ubx were used in combination. A combination of Ubx with Ara-C or etoposide showed additional effects on parent cells and other resistant cell lines. The combined growth inhibitory effect of 6-MP and Ubx was stronger than the effect of 6-MP alone. These results show that Ubx has a direct growth inhibitory effect on leukemic cells and additional or synergistic effects are obtained on K562 leukemic cell line and on chemotherapeutic agent resistant cells derived from the K562 cell line when Ubx is used combination with the above chemotherapeutic agents.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, PMA activated phospholipase D (PLD) in these cells, and potentiated the effect of the inflammatory lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) on PLD activation. PAF also activated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and enhanced arachidonic acid (AA) release in P388D1 macrophages, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased the responsiveness of these cells to PAF. In contrast with PLD, PLA2 activation in P388D1 macrophages was found to take place independently of PKC. This was supported by the following evidence: (i) PMA neither induced AA release nor enhanced the PAF response; (ii) inclusion of PMA along with LPS during priming did not have any effect on PAF-stimulated AA release; (iii) down-regulation of PMA-activatable PKC isoforms by chronic treatment with the phorbol ester had no effect on the PAF response; and (iv) the PKC inhibitor staurosporine did not alter the PAF-induced AA release. The present study provides an example of cells in which the direct activation of PKC by phorbol esters does not lead to a primed and/or enhanced AA release. As a unique example in which PKC activation is neither necessary nor sufficient for AA release to occur, this now allows study of the separate and distinct roles for PLD and PLA2 in signal-transduction processes.

It was shown that, although CEM cells have a lower rate of cholesterol synthesis, they grow at a faster rate than MOLT4 cells.

To further characterize the polymerase involved in HTLV-1 transcription in vitro, runoff transcription assays were performed with a variety of extracts and RNA polymerase inhibitors. Under all in vitro reaction conditions tested, RNA polymerase II appeared to be the only polymerase capable of correct transcriptional initiation from the HTLV-1 promoter. Synthesis of the specific HTLV-1 RNA transcript showed sensitivities to the RNA polymerase inhibitors tagetitoxin and alpha-amanitin that are consistent with RNA polymerase II transcription. Together, these data indicate that in vitro, as in vivo, the HTLV-1 promoter directs transcription by RNA polymerase II.","['0 (Amanitins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Dicarboxylic Acids)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '87913-21-1 (tagetitoxin)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase III)']",['CA 55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC191377,,,,

It is thought that the homology in the repeat (R) regions located at the two ends of the viral RNA sequences facilitate minus-strand DNA transfer. In this report, the effects of diminished R-region homology on DNA synthesis and virus titer were examined. A retrovirus vector, PY31, was constructed to contain the 5' and 3' cis-acting elements from Moloney murine sarcoma virus and spleen necrosis virus. These two viruses are genetically distinct, and the two R regions contain little homology. In one round of replication, the PY31 titer was approximately 3,000-fold lower than that of a control vector with highly homologous R regions. The molecular characteristics of the junctions of minus-strand DNA transfer were analyzed in both unintegrated DNA and integrated proviruses. Short stretches of homology were found at the transfer junctions and were likely to be used to facilitate minus-strand DNA transfer. Both minus-strand strong-stop DNA and weak-stop DNA were observed to mediate strand transfer. The ability of PY31 to complete reverse transcription indicates that minus-strand DNA transfer can be used to join sequences from two different viruses to form recombinant viruses. These results suggest the provocative possibility that genetically distinct viruses can interact through this mechanism.","['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']","['CA58345/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC191361,,,,

Firstly, truncations of gp70 revealed that the minimal continuous receptor-binding region is amino acids 9 to 230, in broad agreement with other studies. Secondly, within this region there are two key basic amino acids, Arg-83 and Arg-95, that are essential for receptor binding and may interact with a negatively charged residue(s) or with the pi electrons of the aromatic ring on a hydrophobic residue(s) in the basic amino acid transporter protein that is the Mo-MLV ecotropic receptor.

By using Jurkat T cells stably transfected with constructs that expressed either the 3' end of the HTLV-1 genome (JK C11-pMTEX), the tax gene (JK52-Tax) or the rex gene (JK9-Rex), we found that the expression of p40tax (Tax) was sufficient to modulate p56lck protein expression. Similarly, we found that the expression of the mRNA which encoded p56lck was repressed in Jurkat T cells which expressed Tax. This downregulation was shown to be proportional to the amount of tax mRNA found in the transfected cells, as evidenced by experiments that used cells (JPX-9) stably transfected with a tax gene driven by a cadmium-inducible promoter. Furthermore, cadmium induction of Tax in JPX-9 cells transiently transfected with a construct containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under control of the lck distal promoter (lck DP-CAT) resulted in the downregulation of CAT gene expression. In contrast, cadmium induction of Tax in JPX-9 cells transiently transfected with a CAT construct driven by a lck DP with a deletion extending from position -259 to -253 (a sequence corresponding to a putative E-Box) did not modulate CAT gene expression, suggesting that the effect of Tax on p56lck is mediated through an E-Box binding protein.","['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,,,,,,PMC191281,,,,

We have extended those studies by identifying and sequencing a third fragment of HHV-8 DNA encoding a viral thymidylate synthetase (TS) gene. Use of this viral TS fragment as a probe led to the identification and mapping of a cluster of overlapping phage lambda clones from a BCBL tumor DNA genomic library that spanned 48 kb on the left-hand side of the HHV-8 genome between the equivalents of open reading frame 6 (ORF6) and ORF31 of herpesvirus saimiri (HVS). DNA sequencing of a 17-kb segment encompassing a gammaherpesvirus divergent locus (DL-B) between ORF11 and ORF17 revealed the presence of nine viral ORFs with predicted gene products related to cellular proteins. These include the complete TS gene and a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene, four novel cytokine genes (encoding viral interleukin-6, viral MIP-1A, viral MIP-1B, and BCK) that have not previously been found to be encoded by a virus, and a bcl-2 homolog. This region in HHV-8 also contains the T1.1 abundant lytic cycle nuclear RNA gene and encompasses two genes (or exons) encoding proteins with C4HC3 zinc finger domains of the PHD/leukemia-associated protein subtype. The latter are related to the spliced immediate-early IE1 protein of the gamma-2 class herpesvirus bovine herpesvirus type 4 and a similar motif found in HVS ORF12. Although genes for TS and DHFR enzymes are also encoded by HVS (ORF70 and ORF2), both occur at different genomic loci than in HHV-8, and the HHV-8 DHFR protein is much farther diverged from human DHFR than is the HVS version, implying that they were probably acquired as host cell cDNAs by independent evolutionary events. Transcripts from the IE1-A, IE1-B, DHFR, and MIP-1B genes were all detected by Northern blot hybridization analysis in a BCBL cell line at 12 h after induction with butyrate but were not present before induction, indicating that these are all primarily lytic cycle genes. We conclude that the DL-B locus of gammaherpesviruses displays considerably more variability that previously appreciated and that expression of many of these genes is likely to have important implications for HHV-8 biology and therapy.","['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']","['P30 CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA73585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA37314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/U67774', 'GENBANK/U67775', 'GENBANK/U74585', 'GENBANK/U83347', 'GENBANK/U83348', 'GENBANK/U83349', 'GENBANK/U83350', 'GENBANK/U83351', 'GENBANK/U85269']",,,,,PMC191280,,,,

Furthermore, Tax-dependent stimulation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and transcriptional activation is inhibited by p16INK4a.

In contrast to wild-type, MAIDS-resistant controls, B10.A mice homozygous for the beta2M mutation and B10.D2 mice homozygous for the perforin mutation were diagnosed as having MAIDS by 5 to 8 weeks after infection by the criteria of lymphoproliferation, impaired proliferative responses to mitogens, and changes in cell populations as judged by histopathology and flow cytometry. Unexpectedly, there was no progression of lymphoproliferation through 24 weeks, even though immune functions were severely compromised.

We developed an rAAV vector, AAV-tNGFR, carrying a truncated rat nerve growth factor receptor (tNGFR) cDNA as a cell surface reporter under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) long terminal repeat. An analogous MoMuLV-based retroviral vector (L-tNGFR) was used in parallel, and gene transfer and expression in human hematopoietic cells were assessed by flow cytometry and DNA analyses. Following gene transfer into K562 cells with AAV-tNGFR at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 13 infectious units (IU), 26 to 38% of cells expressed tNGFR on the surface early after transduction, but the proportion of tNGFR expressing cells steadily declined to 3.0 to 3.5% over 1 month of culture. At an MOI of 130 IU, nearly all cells expressed tNGFR immediately posttransduction, but the proportion of cells expressing tNGFR declined to 62% over 2 months of culture. The decline in the proportion of AAV-tNGFR-expressing cells was associated with ongoing losses of vector genomes. In contrast, K562 cells transduced with the retroviral vector L-tNGFR expressed tNGFR in a constant fraction. Integration analyses on clones showed that integration occurred at different sites. Integration frequencies were estimated at about 49% at an MOI of 130 and 2% at an MOI of 1.3. Transduction of primary human CD34+ progenitor cells by AAV-tNGFR was less efficient than with K562 cells and showed a declining percentage of cells expressing tNGFR over 2 weeks of culture. Thus, purified rAAV caused very high gene transfer and expression in human hematopoietic cells early after transduction, which steadily declined during cell passage in the absence of selection. Although the efficiency of integration was low, overall integration was markedly improved at a high MOI. While prolonged episomal persistence may be adequate for gene therapy of nondividing cells, a very high MOI or improvements in basic aspects of AAV-based vectors may be necessary to improve integration frequency in the rapidly dividing hematopoietic cell population.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",['DK 42694-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC191246,,,,

Members of this family interact with two structurally related classes of receptors (type I and type II), both containing a serine/threonine kinase domain. When expressed alone, the type II but not the type I activin receptor can bind activin. However, the presence of a type I receptor is required for signaling. For TGF-beta1, ligand binding to the type II receptor results in the recruitment and transphosphorylation of the type I receptor. Transient overexpression of the two types of activin receptor results in ligand-independent receptor heteromerization and activation. Nevertheless, activin addition to the transfected cells increased complex formation between the two receptors, suggesting a mechanism of action similar to that observed for the TGF-beta receptor. In the present study, we generated a stable cell line, overexpressing the two types of activin receptor upon induction, in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. We demonstrate here that activin specifically induces heteromer formation between the type I and type II receptors in a time-dependent manner. Using this stable line, we analyzed the effects of activin and inhibin on human erythroid differentiation. Our results indicate that activin signal transduction mediated through its type I and type II receptors results in an increase in the hemoglobin content of the cells and limits their proliferation. Finally, using cell lines that can be induced to overexpress ActRII and ActRIB or ActRIB only, we show that the inhibin antagonistic effects on activin-induced biological responses are mediated through a competition for the type II activin receptor but also require the presence of an inhibin-specific binding component.","['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '367-93-1 (Isopropyl Thiogalactoside)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type I)']",['HD-13527/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC231893,,,,

In Drosophila melanogaster, the dominant hop(Tum-l) mutation in the Hop Jak kinase causes leukemia-like and other developmental defects. Previous studies have suggested that the Hop(Tum-l) protein might be a hyperactive kinase. Here, we report on the new dominant mutation hop(T42), which causes abnormalities that are similar to but more extreme than those caused by hop(Tum-l). We determined that Hop(T42) contains a glutamic acid-to-lysine substitution at amino acid residue 695 (E695K). This residue occurs in the JH2 (kinase-like) domain and is conserved among all Jak family members. We determined that Hop(Tum-1) and Hop(T42) both hyperphosphorylated and hyperactivated D-Stat when overexpressed in Drosophila cells. Moreover, we found that the hop(T42) phenotype was partially rescued by a reduction of wild-type D-stat activity. Finally, generation of the corresponding E695K mutation in murine Jak2 resulted in increased autophosphorylation and increased activation of Stat5 in COS cells. These results demonstrate that the mutant Hop proteins do indeed have increased tyrosine kinase activity, that the mutations hyperactivate the Hop-D-Stat pathway, and that Drosophila is a relevant system for the functional dissection of mammalian Jak-Stat pathways. Finally, we propose a model for the role of the Hop-D-Stat pathway in Drosophila hematopoiesis.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Melanins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (hop protein, Drosophila)']","['CA73158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43889/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL48823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC231882,,,,

Associated with its inhibitor, I kappaB, NF-kappaB resides as an inactive form in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation by various agents, I kappaB is proteolyzed and NF-kappaB translocates to the nucleus, where it activates its target genes. The transduction pathways that lead to I kappaB inactivation remain poorly understood. In this study, we have characterized a cellular mutant, the 70/Z3-derived 1.3E2 murine pre-B cell line, that does not activate NF-kappaB in response to several stimuli. We demonstrate that upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide, Taxol, phorbol myristate acetate, interleukin-1, or double-stranded RNA, I kappaB alpha is not degraded, as a result of an absence of induced phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36. Neither a mutation in I kappaB alpha nor a mutation in p50 or relA, the two major subunits of NF-kappaB in this cell line, accounts for this phosphorylation defect. As well as culminating in the inducible phosphorylation of I kappaB alpha on serines 32 and 36, all the stimuli that are inactive on 1.3E2 cells exhibit a sensitivity to the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). In contrast, stimuli such as hyperosmotic shock or phosphatase inhibitors, which use PDTC-insensitive pathways, induce I kappaB alpha degradation in 1.3E2. Analysis of the redox status of 1.3E2 does not reveal any difference from wild-type 70Z/3. We also report that the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-derived Tax trans-activator induces NF-kappaB activity in 1.3E2, suggesting that this viral protein does not operate via the defective pathway. Finally, we show that two other I kappaB molecules, I kappaB beta and the recently identified I kappaB epsilon, are not degraded in the 1.3E2 cell line following stimulation. Our results demonstrate that 1.3E2 is a cellular transduction mutant exhibiting a defect in a step that is required by several different stimuli to activate NF-kappaB. In addition, this analysis suggests a common step in the signaling pathways that trigger I kappaB alpha, I kappaB beta, and I kappaB epsilon degradation.","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I kappa B beta protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",,,,,,,PMC231869,,,,

This fusion product binds to its DNA recognition site not only as a homodimer but also as a heterodimer with HLF and two other members of the PAR bZIP subfamily, thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF) and albumin promoter D-box binding protein (DBP). Thus, E2A-HLF could transform cells by direct regulation of downstream target genes, acting through homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes, or by sequestering normal PAR proteins into nonfunctional heterocomplexes (dominant-negative interference). To distinguish among these models, we constructed mutant E2A-HLF proteins in which the leucine zipper domain of HLF was extended by one helical turn or altered in critical charged amino acids, enabling the chimera to bind to DNA as a homodimer but not as a heterodimer with HLF or other PAR proteins. When introduced into NIH 3T3 cells in a zinc-inducible vector, each of these mutants induced anchorage-independent growth as efficiently as unaltered E2A-HLF, indicating that the chimeric oncoprotein can transform cells in its homodimeric form. Transformation also depended on an intact E2A activator region, providing further support for a gain-of-function contribution to oncogenesis rather than one based on a dominant-interfering or dominant-negative mechanism. Thus, the tumorigenic effects of E2A-HLF and its mutant forms in NIH 3T3 cells favor a straightforward model in which E2A-HLF homodimers bind directly to promoter/enhancer elements of downstream target genes and alter their patterns of expression in early B-cell progenitors.","['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dbp protein, mouse)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']","['P01 CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 59571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC231866,,,,

In the majority of cell lines studied, the regulation of ferritin expression was exerted mostly at the translational level. However, in differentiating erythroid cells, which must incorporate high levels of iron to sustain hemoglobin synthesis, and in macrophages, which are involved in iron storage, transcriptional regulation seemed to be a relevant mechanism. We show here that the minimum region of the ferritin H-gene promoter that is able to confer transcriptional regulation by heme in FLCs to a reporter gene is 77 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box. This cis element binds a protein complex referred to as HRF (heme-responsive factor), which is greatly enhanced both in heme-treated FLCs and during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. The CCAAT element present in reverse orientation in this promoter region of the ferritin H-chain gene is necessary for binding and for gene activity, since a single point mutation is able to abolish the binding of HRF and the transcriptional activity in transfected cells. By competition experiments and supershift assays, we identified the induced HRF as containing at least the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y. NF-Y is formed by three subunits, A, B, and C, all of which are necessary for DNA binding. Cotransfection with a transdominant negative mutant of the NF-YA subunit abolishes the transcriptional activation by heme, indicating that NF-Y plays an essential role in this activation.

No. 2663. Their antitumor activities were examined in three mouse tumor systems and one human tumor system. The three FR compounds prolonged the life of mice bearing murine ascitic tumor P388 leukemia (T/C values were 160%, 145% and 127% for FR901463, FR901464 and FR901465, respectively), and inhibited the growth of a human solid tumor, A549 lung adenocarcinoma, with different effective dose ranges. FR901464 exhibited most prominent effects on these tumor systems among the three FR compounds. FR901464 also inhibited the growth of murine solid tumors, Colon 38 carcinoma and Meth A fibrosarcoma. To address the involvement of transcriptional activation ability of the three FR compounds in the antitumor effect, we selected FR901464 as a candidate compound and investigated cell cycle transition, chromatin status and endogenous gene expression in FR901464-treated tumor cells having elevated transcriptional activity. FR901464 induced characteristic G1 and G2/M phase arrest in the cell cycle and internucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA with the same kinetics as activation of SV40 promoter-dependent cellular transcription in M-8 tumor cells. In contrast to the potent activation of the viral promoter, FR901464 suppressed the transcription of some inducible endogenous genes but not house keeping genes in M-8 cells. These results suggest that FR901464 may induce a dynamic change of chromatin structure, giving rise to strong antitumor activity, and therefore may represent a new type of drug for cancer chemotherapy.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (FR 901463)', '0 (FR 901464)', '0 (FR 901465)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Bleeding complications among leukemic patients have been related to an abnormal expression of TF by blast cells and/or to an abnormal fibrinolytic response. In this study the expression of TF and uPAR has been assessed in 18 acute non-lymphoblastic and 8 lymphoblastic leukemic blast cells using several methodological approaches. TF mRNA was evaluated by in situ hybridization and TF and uPAR antigen were evaluated immunologically in cell lysates and on the cell surface by flow cytometry. In addition, TF-procoagulant activity was measured in coagulation-based assays. The reliability of these methods was corroborated in six leukemic cell lines of different lineages and states of maturation. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was detected in two M3 leukemia patients whose blast cells expressed high amounts of TF. Hyperfibrinolysis was detected in one M1 and two M2 patients, whose blast cells displayed a high content of uPAR antigen, but no TF. Furthermore, M5 leukemia blast cells expressed both TF and uPAR, although no hemostatic defects or bleeding complications were detected in these patients. Taken together, although a limited number of patients was included in this study, these data suggest that in leukemia patients exhibiting bleeding, either TF or uPAR are expressed by their blast cells. However, the presence of these receptors does not necessarily imply the existence of a hemostatic disorder.","['0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to ameliorate her symptomatic cytopenias, she was treated with prednisone and subsequently methotrexate without success. In February 1993, she underwent splenectomy for symptomatic anemia. Splenectomy resulted in an increased hemoglobin concentration to normal levels, resolution of all laboratory evidence of hemolysis, and disappearance of thrombocytopenia.

A sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method is one approach to RCR detection. Only in the presence of RCR will the pol-env encoding sequences, necessary for viral replication and packaging, be amplified from proviral DNA in infected indicator cells. To avoid false-positive results in this assay it is crucial that indicator cell lines are free of endogenous retroviral sequences that could also be amplified with pol-env PCR primers. We screened candidate murine indicator cell lines and determined that while Mus dunni is free of detectable pol-env sequences, endogenous retroviral sequences do indeed exist in several cell lines and lead to false-positive results in the PCR assay for RCR. Furthermore, these endogenous retroviral sequences are expressed as RNA transcripts in NIH 3T3 and SC-1 cell lines, as determined by PCR amplification of cDNA but, nevertheless, do not give rise to replication-competent particles. We recognize the potential for murine cell lines to undergo spontaneous rearrangements of endogenous viral sequences in culture and give rise to recombinants containing newly acquired contiguous pol-env sequences. Indicator cell lines should thus be carefully selected and monitored on an ongoing basis when used in safety testing using PCR approaches for the detection of RCR.","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a gene located in this chromosomal region and implicated in leukemogenesis was identified. The gene, called ETV6 (previously known as TEL) is a new member of the ETS family, a group of genes thought to act as transcriptional activators. The gene spans 240 kb and consists of eight exons coding for a helix-loop-helix (HLH) and a DNA-binding domain. ETV6 was originally identified in a t(5;12)(q33;p13) occurring in a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Recent reports, however, show its involvement in a growing number of translocations associated with myeloid as well as lymphoid leukemias. At the molecular level fusions of ETV6 with PDGFRB (5q33), ABL (9q34), MNI(22q11) and AML1(21q22) have already been identified. Analysis of these chimeric proteins indicates that distinct domains of ETV6 can be involved in different fusion products, thus ETV6 can provide transcriptional and dimerization properties for partner genes, or the gene itself can act as an altered transcriptional factor. At least two clinico-pathological entities associated with ETV6 rearrangements have emerged as distinct disorders. The first one is a chronic myeloid malignancy characterized by t(5;12)(q33;p13), monocytosis and/or eosinophilia. The second entity is a type of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) hallmarked by t(12;21)(p13;q22), and is shown to be the most frequent but cytogenetically largely undetectable chromosomal anomaly in childhood ALL.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We also found that PML suppresses the clonogenicity and tumorigenicity of APL-derived NB4 cells, as well as the transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts by cooperative oncogenes and NIH/3T3 by neu. Overexpression of PML in human tumor cell lines induces a remarkable reduction in growth rate in vitro and in vivo. More recently, we have shown that PML is a phosphoprotein associated with the nuclear matrix and that its expression is cell cycle related. PML expression is altered during human oncogenesis, implying that PML may be an anti-oncogene involved not only in APL but also in other oncogenic events. Mutation analysis of the functional domains of PML demonstrated that its ability to form PML nuclear bodies or PODs (PML oncogenic domains) is essential for suppressing growth and transformation.

However, IFN-A may be associated with significant side effects that reduce enthusiasm for the use of this drug, produce difficulties in patient compliance, and limit the dose delivered to the patient, thus resulting in ineffective use of IFN-A. Experience with this drug has led to a refinement in techniques for initiation of therapy as well as interventions to deal with side effects.

While most marrow donors have been identified through the National Marrow Donor Program in cooperation with many international registries, the recent development of unrelated donor umbilical cord blood (UCB) banks has allowed us to also evaluate this stem cell source. Analysis of the first 211 URD BMT performed at the University of Minnesota shows an overall survival of 33%, with older recipient age and transplant from a donor with a major HLA-A or B mismatch independently associated with poorer survival. Analysis of engraftment of URD marrow shows increasing risk of delayed or incomplete engraftment with increasing HLA disparity between URD and recipient. GVHD is increased in recipients of URD marrow compared with recipients of related donor marrow. Malignant relapse, however, is less frequent in URD marrow recipients, perhaps due to an increased graft-versus-leukemia effect. Formal assessment shows quality of life in long term URD BMT survivors (beyond 2 years) is excellent, and not different from that seen in sibling marrow recipients. Data from patients receiving unrelated donor UCB transplantation at the University of Minnesota indicate that UCB is an acceptable alternate source of stem cells, at least for young recipients, and may be associated with a reduced incidence of GVHD. Ongoing studies at the University of Minnesota include examination of the applicability of unrelated UCB transplantation to adult recipients, and of the degree of HLA-incompatibility which can be tolerated in UCB transplantation.

When treatment is required the most commonly used therapy is the nitrogen mustard alkylating agent, chlorambucil (CLB), with or without prednisone. Although CLB has been used in the treatment of CLL for forty years the exact mechanism of action of this agent in CLL is still unclear. Studies in proliferating model tumor systems have demonstrated that CLB can bind to a variety of cellular structures such as membranes, RNA, proteins and DNA; however, DNA crosslinking appears to be most important for antitumor activity in these systems. In addition, a number of different mechanisms can contribute to CLB resistance in these tumor models including increased drug metabolism, DNA repair and CLB detoxification resulting from elevated levels of glutathione (GSH) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. However, unlike tumor models in vitro, CLL cells are generally not proliferating and studies in CLL cells have raised questions about the hypothesis that DNA crosslinking is the major mechanism of antitumor action for CLB in this disease. CLB induces apoptosis in CLL cells and this appears to correlate with the clinical effects of this agent. Thus, alkylation of cellular targets other than DNA, which can also induce apoptosis, may contribute to the activity of CLB. Alterations in genes such as p53, mdm-2, bcl-2 and bax which control entry into apoptosis may cause drug resistance. Loss of wild-type p53 by mutation or deletion occurs in 10 to 15% of CLL patients and appears to correlate strongly with poor clinical response to CLB. The induction of apoptosis by CLB is paralleled by an increase in P53 and Mdm-2 but this increase in not observed in patients with p53 mutations indicating that with high drug concentrations CLB can produce cell death through P53 independent pathways. The level of Mdm-2 mRNA in the CLL cells is not a useful predictor of drug sensitivity. In addition, although Bax and Bcl-2 are important regulators of apoptosis and the levels of these proteins are elevated in CLL cells compared with normal B cells, the levels of Bax and Bcl-2, or the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, are not important determinants of drug sensitivity in this leukemia. Finally, whereas CLB and nucleoside analogs may produce cell death in CLL by a P53 dependent pathway other agents, such as dexamethasone or vincristine, may act through P53-independent pathways.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Two energetic drug transport processes were investigated: the classical MDR/P170 and the P110/LRP56 proteins, and two physiological detoxifying activities such as the glutathione transferases (GST alpha, mu, pi) and the metallothioneins (Mts). The results demonstrate that these phenomena are independent but their synergic activity can increase their impact on the outcome.

Continuous treatment with ATRA, however, induces accelerated drug catabolism, with progressive decline in plasma drug concentrations potentially to below the levels required to maintain differentiation of leukemic cells. This process, which occurs rapidly and consistently has led to the hypothesis that the development of acquired clinical resistance to ATRA in APL has a pharmacologic basis. The rapid autoinduction of the hypercatabolic state precludes maintenance with continuous ATRA oral dosing, and is a limitation of better use of the drug both in APL and in other disorders in which it could be beneficial.

These data indicate that some multiple myelomas are generated not only by cell proliferation but also by cell immortalization. The mechanism by which myelomas are immortalized is still unclear, but Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, adult T cell leukemia derived factor (ADF), soluble Fas are all candidate factors for this mechanism. The possibility also exists that inducers of apoptosis, e.g. tumor necrosis factor(TNF), interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme(ICE), Bcl-xS, or Bax, do not have a lethal effect.

Thus LAP represents a specific and restrictive marker for the terminal maturation of the neutrophilic granulocyte. The study of the factors and the molecular mechanisms responsible for the expression of LAP in cells undergoing granulocytic maturation may shed light on this complex biological process. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) represents a unique biological model in which it is possible to investigate neutrophilic differentiation. APL blasts undergo rapid and irreversible maturation towards cells morphologically and biochemically resembling normal mature granulocytes upon in vivo and in vitro challenge with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). In this cellular context, we studied the endogenous factors involved in the expression of LAP. The phosphatase is not synthesized in undifferentiated APL blasts and it is expressed only upon treatment with combinations between ATRA and a second cyto-differentiating signal. The second signal may be given by G-CSF, cAMP analogs, IL-6 and to a lesser extent by IL-1 beta.

Several mechanisms of drug resistance are known with multidrug resistance (MDR) being the best characterized one. MDR can be due to enhanced expression of certain genes (MDR1, MRP or LRP), alterations in glutathione-S-transferase activity or GSH levels and to reduction of the amount or the activity of topoisomerase II. Here we review the current status of the clinical significance of the various mechanisms of MDR in leukemias and also discuss possibilities for the reversal of MDR. MDR1 gene expression has been seen in many leukemias, notably in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. Both MDR1 RNA and P-glycoprotein expression of the leukemic cells have been shown to correlate with poor clinical outcome in AML. However, preliminary results indicate that the MRP gene as well as the LRP gene can be expressed in AML. Thus, drug resistance in leukemias appears to be multifactorial. P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR can be reversed by several drugs. These resistance modifiers are currently evaluated with regard to their clinical efficacy. Despite some encouraging results, reversal of drug resistance and subsequent improvement in clinical outcome remains to be shown.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Among the known transcription factors, both GATA-1 and SCL play roles in the cellular differentiation of erythrocytic and megakaryocytic lineages, while GATA-2 is thought to maintain and promote the proliferation of early hematopoietic progenitors. In this review, the clinical implications of expression of the GATA family, SCL, and EVI1 gene in various types of human leukemia are discussed. De novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients may be subdivided into three categories depending on the expression pattern of transcription factors, i.e., GATA-1(+)SCL(+), GATA-1(+)SCL(-), and GATA-1(-)SCL(-). AML patients with both GATA-1 and SCL expression have a poor prognosis and have some characteristic clinical and hematologic features. The EVI1 gene may be expressed through at least two pathways in hematologic malignancies; one is related to chromosomal changes at 3q26, while the other is related to myelodysplasia regardless of chromosomal changes at 3q26 region.

Both these signal systems are operative during the period of cytopenia following intensive chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. In the present review, we discuss the influence of disease status, chemotherapy and complicating infections on serum levels of cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules in acute leukaemia patients. We have demonstrated increased serum levels of both cytokines and cytokine antagonists in acute leukaemia patients with complicating bacterial infections during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia. Serum levels of the selectin adhesion molecules were decreased during bacterial infections in leukopenic patients compared to healthy individuals.

After 7 days in culture, we studied the CLL cells exposed to the B-cell activators Staphylococcus aureus, IL-2 and/or to EBV for expression of the activation markers CD23, CD39 and the adhesion and costimulatory molecules CD54 and CD80, for DNA synthesis, for production of various cytokines and for capacity to stimulate autologous and allogeneic T-lymphocytes. Generally the frequency of cells expressing cytokines in the cytoplasm correlated with the activation status of the populations and with their capacity to stimulate T-cells. It is likely that the difference between the clones with regard to sensitivity to the viral infection, is determined by the maturation state of the CLL cells. It may therefore reflect the variation in the response within a normal B-cell population. The results obtained in the present and in our earlier experiments with EBV provide information concerning the events after primary EBV infection in vivo. The T-lymphocyte stimulatory capacity of the infected CLL cells may be considered as an in vitro correlate to the syndrome of infectious mononucleosis. The detection of cytokines in the infected B-CLL cells suggests that their production by the B-blasts contributes to the level of T-lymphocytosis induced by the primary infection.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,

These kinases and their regulators are frequently deregulated in human tumours. Enzymatic screening has recently led to the discovery of specific inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, such as butyrolactone I, flavopiridol and the purine olomoucine. Among a series of C2, N6, N9-substituted adenines tested on purified cdc2/cyclin B, 2-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine (roscovitine) displays high efficiency and high selectivity towards some cyclin-dependent kinases. The kinase specificity of roscovitine was investigated with 25 highly purified kinases (including protein kinase A, G and C isoforms, myosin light-chain kinase, casein kinase 2, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, c-src, v-abl). Most kinases are not significantly inhibited by roscovitine. cdc2/cyclin B, cdk2/cyclin A, cdk2/cyclin E and cdk5/p35 only are substantially inhibited (IC50 values of 0.65, 0.7, 0.7 and 0.2 microM, respectively). cdk4/cyclin D1 and cdk6/cyclin D2 are very poorly inhibited by roscovitine (IC50 > 100 microM). Extracellular regulated kinases erk1 and erk2 are inhibited with an IC50 of 34 microM and 14 microM, respectively. Roscovitine reversibly arrests starfish oocytes and sea urchin embryos in late prophase. Roscovitine inhibits in vitro M-phase-promoting factor activity and in vitro DNA synthesis in Xenopus egg extracts. It blocks progesterone-induced oocyte maturation of Xenopus oocytes and in vivo phosphorylation of the elongation factor eEF-1. Roscovitine inhibits the proliferation of mammalian cell lines with an average IC50 of 16 microM. In the presence of roscovitine L1210 cells arrest in G1 and accumulate in G2.

In contrast, less altered accumulation was seen in the P-glycoprotein(P-gp)-overexpressing cell lines. The decreased drug accumulation was reversed by the energy inhibitors sodium azide/2-deoxyglucose and by the vinca alkaloid, vincristine, but not by the chemotherapeutic agents, etoposide and adriamycin. Decreased accumulation was linked to active efflux of the hydrophilic free acid form of BCECF from the MRP-overexpressing cell lines, indicating that dye extrusion occurs after the dye ester has been converted to the free acid form in the cytoplasm. The finding suggests that MRP mediates removal of substrates from a cytoplasmic location. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, decreased the vincristine and etoposide resistance displayed by the MRP-expressing murine cell lines, but did not affect the accumulation of BCECF. Thus, while glutathione may be involved in MRP-mediated resistance to some chemotherapeutic agents, it is not necessary for effiux of substrates such as BCECF.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Acids)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', ""85138-49-4 (2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein)"", 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']","['CA59341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68800-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we show that CT-1 activates its receptor expressed at the surface of a human neural cell line by recruiting gp130 and gp190/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta, as shown by analyzing their tyrosine phosphorylation level. Neutralizing antibody directed against gp130 and reconstitution experiments performed in the COS-7 cell line demonstrate that gp130-gp190 heterocomplex formation is essential for CT-1 signaling. Analysis of the subsequent activation events revealed that CT-1 induces and utilizes Jak1-, Jak2-, and Tyk2-associated tyrosine kinases, which are in turn relayed by STAT-3 transcription factor. Cross-linking of iodinated CT-1 to the cell surface led to the identification of a third alpha component in addition to gp130 and gp190, with an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa. Removal of N-linked carbohydrates from the protein backbone of the alpha component resulted in a protein of 45 kDa. Our results provide evidence that the CT-1 receptor is composed of a tripartite complex, a situation similar to the high affinity receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Leukemic blasts were obtained from the peripheral blood of 11 patients diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). After incubation of the AML blasts in serum-free cultures, conditioned media were collected and examined by zymography. The 92-kDa gelatinase was detected in ten AML patients after 2 h and 24 h of incubation, and in five samples its activated form (83 kDa) was observed. 72-kDa gelatinase was detected in cell-conditioned media from four patients after 2 h and in media from ten patients after 24 h. Its activated forms (64-60 kDa) were observed in one of four samples after 2 h and in five of ten after 24 h. By contrast, normal peripheral mononuclear cells from healthy donors secreted only 92-kDa gelatinase after 24 h; the 72 kDa enzyme was not detectable. A specific inhibitor of metalloproteinases, 1,10-phenanthroline, significantly reduced the in vitro invasion of AML blasts in a Matrigel assay and completely inhibited gelatinolytic activity in zymography. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that primary, unstimulated peripheral-blood AML blasts secrete metalloproteinases, which may contribute to the in vitro degradation of reconstituted basement membrane.","['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin 1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) is a mammalian homolog of CED-3, a protein required for programmed cell death in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that a selective inhibitor of ICE/ced 3 family proteases, benzyloxycarbonyl Asp CH2OC(O) 2 6,-dichlorobenzene (Z-Asp-CH2-DCB). completely blocked the apoptotic cell death of human leukemia cells caused by etoposide, camptothecin, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl cytosine (Ara-C) and adriamycin. Moreover, in antitumor agent-treated U937 cells, an ICE-like (CPP32-like) protease was strongly activated. These results indicate that ICE/ ced 3 family proteases are involved in antitumor agent-induced apoptosis. Activation of ICE family proteases plays a key role in apoptosis. However, the subsequent mechanisms resulting in apoptosis are largely unknown. We identified actin as a substrate of ICE family proteases.

In most instances the regulation appears to rely on transcription factors traditionally not associated with cAMP-dependent gene expression. For the non-traditional factors it remains necessary to elucidate the coupling of increases in intracellular cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity to the function of these proteins. The bovine CYP17 gene, which encodes the steroid 17 alpha-hydroxylase, contains two discrete DNA elements within its promoter and upstream region (CRS1 and CRS2) that individually can confer cAMP responsiveness. The CRS1 element is a target for PKA signalling and for negative regulation via the protein kinase C signal transduction pathway. The homeodomain protein Pbx1 enhances CRS1-dependent transcription, but additional CRS1-binding proteins remain to be identified. Furthermore it is not known how PKA regulates the activity of Pbx1 or its possible binding partners. Closer to the promoter, the nuclear orphan receptors SF-1 and COUP-TF have overlapping binding sites in CRS2 and they bind in a mutually exclusive manner with very similar affinities; 8 and 10 nM, respectively. SF-1 stimulates whereas COUP-TF inhibits transcription from the bovine CYP17 promoter. Together, the data suggest that cAMP-dependent control of the amounts of the activator SF-1 vs. the repressor COUP-TF could influence CRS2-dependent transcription. In addition, PKA may influence the phosphorylation of SF-1, thus increasing its activity. In vitro, PKA will elicit phosphorylation of SF-1. However, although SF-1 can be immunoprecipitated from adrenocortical cells as a phosphroprotein, we have not been able to show cAMP-dependent increase in net phosphorylation in intact cells. More careful examination of individual phosphorylation sites in SF-1 may still reveal hormone- and cAMP-induced phosphorylation of SF-1.","['0 (COUP Transcription Factor I)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fushi Tarazu Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nr2f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Steroidogenic Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.14.14.19 (Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Confluent stromal layers were recharged with selected populations of normal HPC enriched for the CD34+CD38- cells (immature, uncommitted HPC) or the CD34+CD38+ cells (mature, committed HPC). The weekly output of clonable granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) was used as an indicator of the hematopoietic-supporting ability of the cultures. Stromal layers derived from 5/7 patients newly diagnosed with AML, showed significantly depressed ability to support the CD34+CD38- cells compared to stroma derived from normal donors. The supporting function of the AML-derived stroma for the more mature CD34+CD38+ cells was similar to that of the normal stroma (3/3 cases). Stromal layers derived from patients with chronic-phase CML showed normal or enhanced supporting function for the CD34+CD38- cells (5/6 cases), and likewise for the CD34+CD38+ cells (3/3 cases). This study revealed a selective defect in the ability of BM stroma from patients with AML to support the maturation of normal early uncommitted HPC, represented by the CD34+CD38- cells, whilst the ability to support the committed CD34+CD38+ cells was not affected. This suggests that the BM microenvironment may be implicated in the disease mechanism of AML. It does not, however, appear to be as clearly implicated in chronic-phase CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to assess by polymerase chain reaction the presence of residual leukaemic cells in the BM grafts before and after purging. The results were then correlated to clinical outcome. In 24/28 patients a PCR product was obtained by amplification of IgH and/or TcR junctional regions. BM before purging was available for analysis in 13 patients. We found that leukaemic cells could be detected in 8/13 (62%) of these grafts before purging . All these eight patients experienced a relapse, regardless of whether the purging procedure had been successful (defined as achievement of PCR-negativity) or not. In contrast, none of the five patients with PCR-negative grafts before purging relapsed (P = 0.0008). One patient died due to transplant-related toxicity. Of the remaining 23 patients, nine patients received a PCR-positive BM graft after purging. All these nine patients experienced a relapse as compared to 6/14 whose BM was PCR-negative after purging (P = 0.0072). Two of eight PCR-positive BM grafts could be purged to PCR-negativity.

All children treated by the Italian Paediatric Haematology Oncology Association for HR-ALL in first CR between 1986 and 1994 were eligible for the study. 30 children were given BMT at a median of 4 months from first CR, with preparative regimens including total-body irradiation (n = 25/30). 130 matched controls for BMT patients were identified among 397 HR-ALL CHEMO patients. Matching on main prognostic factors and duration of first CR was adopted to control the selection and time-to-transplant biases. The comparative analysis was based on the results of a stratified Cox model. The estimated hazard ratios of BMT versus CHEMO at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after CR were 1.38 (CI 0.59-3.24), 0.69 (CI 0.27-1.77) and 0.35 (CI 0.06-1.91), with an overall non-significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.34). With a median follow-up of 4 years, the disease-free survival was 58.5% (SE 9.3) in the BMT group and 47.7% (SE 4.8) in the CHEMO group, at 4 years from CR. Non-leukaemic death occurred in 4% of CHEMO and 10% of BMT patients. In the BMT group the estimated cumulative incidence of relapse at 1.5 years from CR was 31.5% (SE 8.8) and did not change thereafter, whereas in the CHEMO group the corresponding figure was 29.2% (SE 4.1) and the incidence continued to increase thereafter (48.2% (SE 4.8) at 4 years from CR). The results of this study suggest that, with respect to the CHEMO group, the higher risk of early failure in the BMT group is outweighed by the lower risk of relapse after 1 year.

The outcome of these patients was compared with that of 40 related BMT recipients receiving fresh donor bone marrow (historic control group).

There was the same incidence of acute and chronic GvHD in patients receiving either cryopreserved bone marrow or fresh bone marrow (acute GvHD > or = II 61% v 60% and chronic GvHD 56% v 52%, respectively). Chimaerism studies showed no difference between the patient groups. Furthermore, the two groups did not differ in day 100 survival (82% v 72%).

Statistical analyses were performed for factors thought to influence survival such as age, sex, white cell count, and number of courses of chemotherapy required to enter remission. These showed that the presence of additional chromosome abnormalities has an adverse effect on prognosis, independent of other prognostic indicators, reducing it to the level of patients with AML from less-favourable cytogenetic subgroups. These data indicate that additional therapeutic strategies may be required in patients with APL who demonstrate cytogenetic aberrations over and above the t(15;17) at presentation.

After induction of MEL cell differentiation by treatment with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), expression of the PU.1/Spi-1 gene decreased before induction of beta-globin gene expression. Overexpression of PU.1 by using a zinc-inducible expression plasmid in MEL cells resulted in unexpected growth inhibition of the transfectants. When PU.1-overexpressing transfectants were treated with DMSO, growth inhibition became much pronounced and apoptosis was induced. Expression of the beta-globin gene was not induced under this condition. Neither growth inhibition nor apoptosis was induced in MEL cells after expression of mutant PU.1 proteins with a deletion of the activation domain or the DNA-binding Ets domain irrespective of the presence of DMSO. Interestingly, beta-globin gene expression was not induced in the transfectants expressing the former mutant, whereas it was induced in those expressing the latter one in the presence of DMSO.

T-cell depletion reduces the incidence and severity of GVHD but eliminates, at least partially, the GVL effect. Reinfusion of donor T lymphocytes at relapse posttransplantation can induce a potent antitumor response, but GVHD still occurs in the majority of patients. Prior transduction of T lymphocytes with the suicide gene, the viral thymidine kinase (TK), permits specific cell kill on administration of ganciclovir (GCV). Therefore, infusion of TK-transduced T lymphocytes may induce GVL effect and allow for their subsequent selective elimination in case GVHD develops. To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of this promising approach, anti-CD3-stimulated primary human lymphocytes cultured in interleukin-2 were TK-transduced by a retroviral vector carrying both TK and neomycin-resistance genes. After selection in G418, more than 90% of the cells contained the TK gene as shown by a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, 1 to 5 days of GCV exposure, at clinically achievable concentrations of 20 to 50 micromol/L, induced > or = 90% killing of G418-selected cells without affecting nontransduced cells. Correlation of the extent of T-cell kill and the proportion of TK-gene-transduced cells is consistent with the absence of a bystander effect. Transduced cells were CD3+ and either CD8+ or CD4+ and retained functional properties of untransduced cells. In vivo administration of GCV prevented tumor development after subcutaneous injection of TK-transduced murine myeloma cells (MOPC-11), whereas such an effect was not observed on injection of untransduced cells into the opposite flank. Our studies provide critical information that (1) adequate numbers of TK-transduced lymphocytes can be selected efficiently with > or = 90% purity, (2) selected cells remain functional, (3) 24 hours of exposure to GCV at clinically achievable concentration effects > or = 90% killing of selected cells, and (4) GCV is effective in vivo in killing TK-transduced cells.

We found that the treatment of UT-7 cells with EPO resulted in a transient decrease of the EPOR mRNA level. This transient downregulation was also induced by stimulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), another stimulator of UT-7 cell growth. These results raised the possibility that EPOR gene expression is in part related to cell growth. Moreover, it was found that EPO-induced downregulation of EPOR mRNA level was preceded by a transient downregulation of GATA-1 mRNA. To examine the relationship between the expression of EPOR, GATA-1, and GATA-2 mRNA levels and the cell cycle, logarithmically growing UT-7 cells were centrifugically fractionated according to the cell-cycle phase. Both EPOR and GATA-1 mRNA levels, but not the GATA-2 mRNA level, concomitantly decreased at the G0/G1 phase and increased at the S and G2/M phases. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that in EPO-stimulated UT-7 cells, the dynamic changes in EPOR gene expression paralleled the GATA-1 DNA-binding activity to the oligonucleotide probe containing a GATA-binding site located at the promoter region of the EPOR gene. These findings suggest that the regulation of EPOR mRNA level is mainly associated with GATA-1 gene expression in UT-7 cells undergoing proliferation, and that these serial events are under the control of, or related to, the cell cycle.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We explore here the functional interdependence between these two cell types from the standpoint of de novo cytokine secretion. We determined that, over a 96-hour period, CD34+ bone marrow cells had no significant effect on osteoblast secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or transforming growth factor-beta1, but in some experiments minor increases in leukemia inhibitory factor levels were observed. However, when CD34+ bone marrow cells were cocultured in direct contact with osteoblasts, a 222% +/- 55% (range, 153% to 288%) augmentation in interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis was observed. The accumulation of IL-6 protein was most rapid during the initial 24-hour period, accounting for nearly 55% of the total IL-6 produced by osteoblasts in the absence of blood cells and 77% of the total in the presence of the CD34+ cells. Cell-to-cell contact does not appear to be required for this activity, as determined by coculturing the two cell types separated by porous micromembranes. The identity of the soluble activity produced by the CD34+ cells remains unknown, but is not likely due to IL-1beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, as determined with neutralizing antibodies. To our knowledge, these data represent the first demonstration that early hematopoietic cells induce the production of molecules required for the function of normal bone marrow microenvironments, in this case through the induction of hematopoietic cytokine (IL-6) secretion by osteoblasts.","['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",,,,,,,,,,,

VYS erythropoiesis is decreased or abrogated by targeted disruption of the hematopoietic transcription factors tal-1, rbtn2, GATA-1, and GATA-2. To better understand the potential roles of these genes, and to trace the initial temporal and spatial development of mammalian embryonic hematopoiesis, we examined their expression patterns, and that of betaH1-globin, in normal mouse conceptuses by means of in situ hybridization. Attention was focused on the 36-hour period from mid-primitive streak to early somite stages (E7.25 to E8.5), when the conceptus undergoes rapid morphologic changes with formation of the yolk sac and blood islands. Each of these genes was expressed in extraembryonic mesoderm, from which blood islands are derived. This VYS expression occurred in a defined temporal sequence: tal-1 and rbtn2 transcripts were detected earlier than the others, followed by GATA-2 and GATA-1, and then by betaH1-globin. Transcripts for all of these genes were present in VYS mesoderm cell masses at the neural plate stage (E7.5), indicating commitment of these cells to the erythroid lineage before the appearance of morphologically recognizable erythroblasts. By early somite stages (E8.5), GATA-2 mRNA expression is downregulated in VYS blood islands as terminal primitive erythroid differentiation proceeds. We conclude that primitive mammalian erythropoiesis arises during gastrulation through the ordered temporal expression of tal-1, rbtn2, GATA2, and GATA-1 in a subset of extraembryonic mesoderm cells. During the stages analyzed, tal-1 and rbtn2 expression was also present in posterior embryonic mesoderm, while GATA-1 and GATA-2 expression was evident in extraembryonic tissues of ectodermal origin.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",['R29HL45573/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Based on a two-sided logistic regression analysis, stratified for age (subdivided at 10 years), leukocyte count (subdivided at 50,000), and gender, the estimated odds of failing by 4 years in the germline TEL group is 5.4 times that of the rearranged TEL group, with 95% confidence from 1.9 to 15.6, two-sided P = .0009. Thus, the presence of a rearranged TEL gene is also associated with an improved survival among patients treated with antimetabolite-based therapy.

In this study, we generated DCs from peripheral blood cells of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). CML cells incubated concurrently with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-4, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in vitro developed morphologic and phenotypic characteristics of DCs. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed the presence of t(9;22) in the nuclei of these cells, indicating that they were leukemic in origin. These cells were potent stimulators of lymphocyte proliferation in specific in vitro assays for DC function. Autologous T cells stimulated with in vitro-generated, leukemic DCs displayed vigorous cytotoxic activity against CML cells but low reactivity to major histocompatability complex-matched normal bone marrow cells. Cytotoxic activity against CML targets was fourfold to sixfold higher using DC-stimulated autologous T cells than with autologous T cells expanded by culture with interleukin-2 alone. DC-stimulated T cells also inhibited growth of CML clonogenic precursors in colony-forming assays in vitro. These results suggest that cytokine-driven in vitro differentiation of CML cells results in generation of DCs with potent T-cell stimulatory function.

Here we report further characterization of Pbx1 binding site in CRS1 and role of Pbx1 in cAMP-dependent, CRS1-mediated transcription. By gel shift analysis utilizing nuclear extracts from Y1 cells, a high-affinity Pbx-binding sequence has been determined to be TTGAT(T/G)GA(T/C)A which represents the 5' portion of CRS1. An artificial Pbx-binding sequence (PRS), previously determined by random PCR analysis, is similar to the Pbx1-binding sequence in CRS1 and by both gel shift analysis and transfection studies shows characteristics very similar to CRS1. Upon overexpression, Pbx1 is found capable of enhancing CRS1-mediated transcription in both steroidogenic (Y1, JEG3) and nonsteroidogenic (HepG2 and S194) cells when coexpressed with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Thus even though Pbx1 has been found to be involved only in cAMP-dependent transcription of a gene involved in steroidogenesis (CYP17), Pbx1 is capable of participating in cAMP-dependent transcription of target genes without complex formation with steroidogenic tissue-specific nuclear factors.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.14.14.19 (Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase)']",['DK28350/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Nonlinear double-reciprocal plots of transport at substrate concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 500 micro;m indicated that multiple transport routes were operative. Sensitivity to naphthyl glucuronide separated [3H]DNP-SG transport into two low-affinity components which by computer analysis exhibited Km values of 330 and 1400 micro;m, respectively. At low substrate concentrations, two high-affinity routes were observed. The predominant activity (hMOAT3a) exhibited a Km of 0.18 micro;m (Vmax = 22 pmol/min/mg protein), whereas the second activity (MOAT3b) had a Km of 0.58 micro;m (Vmax = 16 pmol/min/mg protein). High-affinity transport of DNP-SG increased substantially (2.5-fold) in vesicles preincubated with genistein or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Kinetic analyses in vesicles pretreated with 50 micro;m genistein showed that increased transport resulted from the appearance of a new activity (hMOAT3c) with a Km of 0.85 micro;m and a substantially elevated Vmax (80 pmol/min/mg protein). At varying concentrations of genistein, a progression was observed that was consistent with the conversion of hMOAT3b to hMOAT3a and hMOAT3a to hMOAT3c. Phenylarsine oxide, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, produced an opposite progression. Specificity studies showed that hMOAT3a exhibited the highest affinity for various anionic conjugates, and had a notable binding preference for glutathione disulfide. The relative effectiveness of the various inhibitors was similar for hMOAT3a, hMOAT3b, and hMOAT3c, as well as for a corresponding mMOAT3 activity from L1210 mouse cells. The results show that human erythrocytes contain multiple ATP-dependent efflux systems for DNP-SG and that separation of these systems can be achieved on the basis of substrate Km value and inhibitor and activator specificity. High-affinity transport can proceed via three activities which appear to be subforms of a single system with differing levels of tyrosine phosphorylation. Multiple hMOAT3 subforms provide flexibility for extruding various anionic conjugates and may have evolved in erythrocytes to expedite the efflux of GS-SG.","['0 (Anion Transport Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucuronates)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '26289-39-4 (S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione)', '8X066L3N2U (naphthyl glucuronide)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione ATPase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Culture conditions currently in use have been developed from mouse ES cell culture and are not effective for maintaining the pICM. Optimizing culture conditions for the pICM is essential. We have developed a grading system to detect changes in the differentiation status of in vitro cultured pICM. Porcine ICMs (Day 7) were isolated by immunosurgery and cultured for 4 d in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-based medium (D medium) or DMEM/Ham's F-10 (1:1)-based medium (D/H medium) without human Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (hLIF, 1000 iu/ml). Colonies were photographed daily for morphological analysis, pICMs were categorized into one of two types based on their morphological profile: type A, nonepithelial or type B, epithelial-like. Eight investigators evaluated pICM differentiation using standardized differentiation profile. Each pICM series was graded on a scale of 1 (fully undifferentiated) to 5 (fully differentiated) for each time point. Differentiation was verified by alkaline phosphatase activity, cytokeratin staining, and scanning electron microscopy. Neither hLIF nor culture medium delayed differentiation of pICMs (P = 0.08 and P = 0.25, respectively). The grading system employed was an effective tool for detecting treatment effects on differentiation of the developing pICM. These results demonstrate that hLIF cannot significantly inhibit differentiation of the pICM, and is unlikely to assist in porcine ES cell isolation. Future experiments utilizing homologous cytokines may prove more beneficial.","['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",['R01 HL51587-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of lymphocyte autologous tumor killing or natural killer activity during the postoperative period remains obscure. In this article, the authors describe the importance of postoperative autologous tumor killing activity as a prognostic factor in patients with primary resected nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) after long term follow-up. METHODS: Forty-two patients who had resection of NSCLC, with primary culture of autologous tumor cells taken successfully, were studied. Cytotoxic activity against autologous, allogenic NSCLC and K562 leukemia cells was examined using peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained during the 2 weeks immediately following surgery. Factors related to prognosis were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The overall 5- and 10-year survival rates for the NSCLC patients were 40.5% and 27.5%, respectively. Statistical analysis of survival curves revealed a significant difference with regard to T classification (P = 0.025), N classification (P = 0.0015), stage (P = 0.028), and postoperative autologous tumor killing activity (P = 0.0008); there were no significant differences in relation to age, gender, histology, differentiation, visceral pleural invasion, resectability, surgical method, allogeneic tumor killing activity, or natural killer activity. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between disease recurrence and N classification (P = 0.0003), T classification (P = 0.023), stage (P = 0.001), and autologous tumor killing activity (P = 0.007), indicating independent prognostic significance. The phenotypes of the effector cells involved in autologous tumor killing activity were CD3(+), CD4(-), CD8(+), and CD11b(-).

Stat1 alpha protein levels are augmented by ATRA as a consequence of elevated amounts of the corresponding transcripts. The retinoid increases the levels of nuclear complexes that are capable of binding to interferon (IFN)-regulated consensus sequences and contain Stat1 and/or Stat2 proteins, and causes a rapid and long-lasting elevation in Stat1 alpha tyrosine phosphorylation. Transient transfection experiments show that ATRA enhances the transactivating properties of Stat1 alpha observed on an appropriate reporter gene, in the presence of the RAR alpha retinoic acid receptor, but not in the presence of the PML-RAR protein. Treatment of NB4 cells with ATRA is associated with a remarkable upregulation of the two IFN-responsive genes IFN-responsive factor 1 and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase, as well as with an augmentation in the levels of IFN alpha secretion. Our data show that ATRA is capable of modulating the amounts and the state of activation of some of the components of the IFN intracellular signaling pathways.

One possible mechanism of action might include the induction of apoptosis, and especially Fas-mediated cell killing may play an important role in the elimination of malignant cells. We investigated Fas receptor (Fas-R) expression and the consequences of Fas-R triggering in CML patients. Using two-color flow cytometry, we found a significantly higher number of Fas-R-expressing CD34+ cells in the bone marrow (BM) of CML patients compared with normal subjects. We have previously shown that IFN-gamma induces Fas-R expression on CD34+ cells; in this study, we investigated whether IFN-alpha induces Fas-R expression on CML progenitor cells. Dose-dependent induction of Fas-R expression was observed after IFN-alpha stimulation of CD34+ cells from CML BM. In methylcellulose culture, IFN-alpha alone at a therapeutic concentration showed only marginal antiproliferative effects on both normal and CML BM progenitors. In contrast, a Fas-R agonist, the anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody CH11, inhibited colony formation from normal progenitors, and the inhibition was even stronger on CML progenitors. When CML BM cells were cultured in the presence of IFN-alpha, Fas-R-mediated inhibition of colony growth was potentiated in a dose-dependent fashion, consistent with IFN-alpha induction of Fas-R expression. This functional effect did not require the presence of accessory cells, since similar results were obtained with purified CD34+ cells. In suspension cultures, we demonstrated that suppression of CML hematopoiesis by IFN-alpha and Fas-R agonist was exerted through Fas-R-mediated induction of apoptosis. Our findings suggest that the Fas-R/Fas-ligand system might be involved in the immunologic regulation of CML progenitor growth and that its effect can be amplified by IFN-alpha.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We detected defective proviral integration as a monoclonal band of various sizes with the pX but not with the gag-pol probe, or a monoclonal band of less than 9 kb with the pX probe, in 20 patients (29.4%). These were designated defective (D) type. With both probes, a single band greater than 9 kb was detected in 34 (50.0%), designated complete (C) type, and two or more bands greater than 9 kb, were designated multiple (M) type, in 14 (20.6%). Advanced age, a high LDH value, and hypercalcemia were more frequent in D type patients. The median survival time (MST) was 6.8, 24.4, and 33.3 months, for D, C, and M types, respectively (log rank P = .006). Among 52 sequentially examined patients, the HTLV-I integration patterns changed in 4 (7.5%). In three of these four, the rearrangements of the T-cell receptor (TCR)b gene concomitantly changed, suggesting the appearance of a new ATL clone. Another patient had the same rearrangement of the TCRb gene, indicating clonal evolution. The HTLV-I integration pattern changed at crisis from indolent to aggressive ATL in three patients. These findings suggested that the HTLV-I integration patterns have clinical implications in ATL pathophysiology. In contrast to the clonal evolution characteristic of the multistep carcinogenesis of most human malignancies, the frequent clonal change of ATL at crisis is a peculiar phenomenon, probably reflecting the emergence of multiple premalignant clones in viral leukemogenesis as suggested in Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphomagenesis in the immunocompromised host.","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,

A combination of interleukins (ILs) derived from activated T cells (IL-2) and monocytes (IL-12), or monocytes alone (IL-15 and IL-12), induces optimal production of IFN-gamma from natural killer (NK) cells. The mechanism by which human NK cells downregulate their production of IFN-gamma is unknown. Here we show that the same cytokines that induce human NK cell IFN-gamma production subsequently induce apoptosis of the NK cells. Fas, bcl-2, or bax do not appear to be involved in this process. The mechanism of cytokine-induced apoptosis of human NK cells appears to involve NK cell production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Neutralization of TNF-alpha or inhibition of TNF-alpha binding to the p80 TNF-alpha receptor partially inhibited apoptosis. Transforming growth factor-beta, which inhibits cytokine-induced NK cell production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, also decreased cytokine-induced NK cell apoptosis. Costimulation of a CD3-CD56+ NK leukemia cell line with IL-2 and IL-12 or IL-15 and IL-12 induced apoptosis in vitro, which increased when combined with a chemotherapeutic agent. In summary, costimulation of human NK cells via the IL-2 receptor and the IL-12 receptor induces significant IFN-gamma production, followed by NK cell apoptosis and a decline in IFN-gamma production. Hence, cytokines that activate this innate immune response may also serve to limit it via apoptosis. This novel observation may have implications for the regulation of the innate immune response during infection, the toxicity of combination cytokine therapy, and the treatment of NK cell leukemia.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",['CA-68458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a mucin-like molecule that is thought to be a primary ligand for P-selectin. The interaction of P-selectin with PSGL-1 results in leukocyte rolling and recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation and tissue injury. However, expression of PSGL-1 protein alone is insufficient for binding to P-selectin. Several posttranslational modifications of PSGL-1, including sialylation, sulfation, and fucosylation by alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase(s) (FucT), are required for functional interaction with P-selectin. Recently, several groups have reported that PSGL-1 might also serve as a ligand for E-selectin. Differential posttranslational modifications of PSGL-1 may determine whether it can interact with either P- or E-selectin or both. To determine whether PSGL-1 is essential for adhesion to P- or E-selectin, we have constructed and analyzed a panel of stably transfected K562 cells. K562 cells express FucT-IV but not FucT-VII or PSGL-1, and do not bind to either E- or P-selectin. K562 cells transfected with PSGL-1 cDNA also did not bind to either P- or E-selectin.

TPO (100 ng/mL) induced a sixfold to ninefold enhancement of adhesion of both primary megakaryocytic and HEL cells to plates coated with either fibrinogen or fibronectin and a parallel increase of immunoreactivity to the PAC1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-fibrinogen, both of which recognize an activated state of alpha IIb beta 3. The enhanced adhesion to fibrinogen or fibronectin was mediated by the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) recognition sequence of alpha IIb beta 3, as it was abolished by pretreatment of cells with saturating concentrations of RGDS peptide. A MoAb specific for the alpha IIb beta subunit of alpha IIb beta 3 also inhibited cell attachment to fibrinogen or fibronectin, while MoAb to anti-alpha v beta 3 or anti-alpha 5 integrins were completely ineffective, clearly indicating that alpha IIb beta 3 participates in this association. A role for PI 3 kinase (PI 3-K) in the TPO-mediated increase in alpha IIb beta 3 function in megakaryocytic cells was suggested by the ability of the PI 3-K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nmol/L) and antisense oligonucleotides directed against the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-K to completely block the TPO-induced increase in alpha IIb beta 3 integrin activity upon TPO stimulation. The modulation of adhesiveness to extracellular matrix proteins containing the RGD motif mediated by TPO likely plays a physiologic role in megakaryocytopoiesis, as pretreatment of CD34+ cells with RGDS or anti-alpha IIb MoAb significantly reduced the number of megakaryocytic colonies obtained in a fibrinclot semisolid assay.","['0 (Actins)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Three preparatory regimens, selected on the basis of prior therapy and pulmonary status, were employed. Twenty-six patients without a history of prior chest or pelvic irradiation were treated with fractionated total body irradiation, etoposide (VP) 60 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide (Cy) 100 mg/kg. Seventy-four patients received BCNU 15 mg/kg with identical doses of VP and Cy. A group of 19 patients with a limited diffusing capacity or history of pneumonitis received a novel high-dose regimen consisting of CCNU 15 mg/kg, VP 60 mg/kg and Cy 100 mg/kg. Twenty-nine patients (24%) had failed induction therapy and 35 (29%) had progressive HD within 1 year of initial chemotherapy. At 4 years actuarial survival was 52%, event-free survival was 48% and freedom from progression (FFP) was 62%. No significant differences were seen in survival data with the three preparatory regimens. Six patients died within 100 days of transplantation and 5 died at a later date of transplant-related complications. Secondary malignancies have developed in 6 patients, including myelodysplasia/leukemia in four patients and solid tumors in two patients. Regression analysis identified systemic symptoms at relapse, disseminated pulmonary or bone marrow disease at relapse and more than minimal disease at the time of transplantation as significant prognostic factors for overall and event-free survival and FFP. Patients with none of these factors enjoyed an 85% FFP at 4 years compared with 41% for patients with one or more unfavorable prognostic factors (P = .0001). Our results confirm the efficacy of high-dose therapy and autografting in recurrent or refractory HD. Although longer follow-up is necessary to address ultimate cure rates and toxicity, our data indicate that a desire to reduce late effects should drive future research efforts in favorable patients whereas new initiatives are needed for those with less favorable prognoses.",,['CA 49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The initial patients treated with AZQ and mitroxantrone experienced prolonged bone marrow suppression and, therefore, subsequent cohorts were treated with G-CSF, 5 micrograms/kg, beginning the day after completion of the third cycle of chemotherapy. There was a marked decrease in the duration of granulocytopenia less than 500/microL in two groups of patients receiving two different dose levels of AZQ and the same dose of mitoxantrone compared with patients not receiving the G-CSF.

This appeared to represent the cDNA for the red blood cell (RBC)-specific HK isozyme (HKR) described in our previous study (Murakami et al: Blood 75:770, 1990). Its nucleotide sequence was identical to HKI cDNA except for the 5' extreme end. It lacked the first 62 nucleotides of the HKI coding region: instead, it contained a unique sequence of 60 nucleotides at the beginning of the coding sequence as well as another unique sequence upstream of the putative translation initiation site. It lacked the porin-binding domain which facilitates binding to the mitochondria, thus explaining the exclusive cytoplasmic localization of HKR. It was the major cDNA derived from reticulocytes, consistent with the observation that HKR activity is predominant in reticulocytes. Northern blot analysis showed that it was expressed in the reticulocytes and in the K562 erythroleukemic cell line, but not in a lymphocytic cell line. In the extract of K562 cells, HKR activity co-eluted with the HKR of human RBCs on a MonoQ column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) chromatography, using a salt gradient elution. The separate genetic control of the RBC-specific HK isozyme explains the clinical reports of two types of HK deficiency, one in which the HK activity was reduced exclusively in the RBC (HKR defect) and another with general decrease of HK activity in several tissues (HKI defect).","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)']",['R01 HL48996-15/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Blood. 1998 Jan 1;91(1):363-4.

Other effects recently reported concern a different potential in terms of signaling in early B cells and derived cell lines or in more detailed disease models of human leukemia, namely B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. To complete the picture of the effects mediated by CD38 in the B cell compartment, we have studied the signals elicited by ligation of the human molecule in mature B cells from circulating pool and also from spleen of normal individuals. The information obtained completes the picture of CD38 and mature B cells, where we also studied the contribution of relevant cytokines involved in maintenance and differentiation of these normal cells, namely IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6.

This makes them less amenable to conventional early screening methods such as imaging and observation. Furthermore, the staging systems for lymphomas are not particularly useful prognostically, with the possible exception of Hodgkin's disease. However, as currently compared with solid tumors, the extensively detailed understanding of the acquired (somatic) genetic lesions in leukemias and lymphomas provide useful molecular biomarkers for early detection. Moreover, well described high risk groups have been identified. These include individuals who are immunosuppressed, for example, iatrogenically following organ transplantation or those with AIDS. Also at high risk are patients treated with certain chemotherapeutic agents who are at risk for the development of acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia. Accordingly, these clinical settings might prove to be good models for evaluating molecular cancer risk markers and the possible introduction of chemoprevention. Here, we outline the biological basis for the application of biomarkers for the early detection of hematological neoplasia. These concepts may provide the stage for the creation of chemoprevention studies in leukemia and lymphoma.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Pesticides have been intensively used on banana plantations, for example dibromochloropropane (DBCP). This study was planned to examine the quality of the cancer and civil registries and the feasibility of record linkages, and to explore cancer patterns among a highly exposed group. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out. Workers on the payrolls of banana companies, as reported to the Social Security System at any time between 1972 and 1979, were followed up in the cancer registry between 1981 and 1992: 29 565 men and 4892 women for 407 468 person-years. The observed cases of cancer were compared to the expected values, derived from the national incidence rates. RESULTS: We identified 368 cancer cases, 292 among men (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 67-84) and 76 among women (SIR = 116, 95% CI: 90-142). Among men increased SIR were observed for melanoma (SIR = 197, 95% CI: 94-362) and penile cancer (SIR = 149, 95% CI: 55-324); among women for cervix cancer (SIR = 182, 95% CI: 122-241) and leukaemia (SIR = 274, 95% CI: 86-639). Risk estimates for lung cancer were evaluated among male workers with the longest time of employment. CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up was difficult due to deficient identification variables in the cancer registry and to easier identification of the living compared to the decreased in the civil registry at the end of the observation period. The various systematic errors in this study are likely to produce an underestimation of the relative risk estimates. This study contributes to improvements of the registries and increases the potential for cancer epidemiology in Costa Rica and other developing countries.","['0 (Insecticides)', '96K0FD4803 (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane)', 'T75W9911L6 (Propane)']",,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if modulation of Na+,K+ ATPase activity alters degranulation in the 2H3 subline of rat basophilic leukaemia cells (RBL-2H3), a mucosal mast cell model bearing high-affinity Fc receptors for IgE. METHODS: Degranulation was measured by the release of both exogenous serotonin and endogenous histamine. Na+,K+ ATPase activity was assessed by ouabain-sensitive [86rubidium] uptake ([86Rb] uptake) and ex situ enzyme activity. RESULTS: Ouabain-sensitive [86Rb] uptake and degranulation increased in parallel and in a dose-response fashion with increasing Fc receptor cross-linking. Additionally, incubation with ouabain, a known inhibitor of Na+,K+ ATPase activity, decreased both anti-IgE and calcium ionophore-induced degranulation, but increased spontaneous degranulation, each in a dose-response manner. Moreover, the effect of ouabain on degranulation was reversed by rinsing and mimicked by other known inhibitors of Na+,K+ ATPase activity. Finally, in the absence of anti-IgE or calcium ionophore, stimulation of ouabain-sensitive [86Rb] uptake by the sodium (Na+) ionophore monensin was associated with a corresponding dose-response increase in ouabain-sensitive degranulation. These experiments demonstrate that ouabain-sensitive [86Rb] uptake increases following IgE receptor cross-linking in RBL-2H3, and that factors which modulate Na+,K+ ATPase activity in these cells may also regulate degranulation. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest an important role for Na+,K+ ATPase activation in the signal transduction pathway of stimulated RBL-2H3.","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Rubidium Radioisotopes)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the morbidity and mortality of patients surviving more than 5 years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter study. PATIENTS: 798 recipients of bone marrow transplants (477 adults, 321 children) from 43 European centers. Patients had received transplants before December 1985 and had survived at least 5 years. Patients had received allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow for leukemia, lymphoma, inborn diseases of the hematopoietic and immune systems, and severe aplastic anemia. MEASUREMENTS: Survival, clinical performance according to Karnofsky score (in increments of 10%), and social reintegration were assessed as outcomes. Patient age and sex, primary disease and status at transplantation, histocompatibility of the donor, conditioning regimen, type of prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were evaluated as variables. RESULTS: For the 55 5-year survivors, actuarial mortality was 8% at 10 years and 14% at 15 years. The leading causes of death were disease recurrence (21 patients), chronic graft-versus-host disease with complicating infections and lung disease (11 patients), secondary cancer (8 patients), and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (5 patients). When patients with recurrent disease were excluded, late death was associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (P < 0.001), occurrence of secondary cancer (P < 0.001), male sex of the patient (P = 0.05), and female sex of the donor (P = 0.002). Clinical performance was normal (Karnofsky score, 100%) or minimally reduced (Karnofsky score, 90%) in 93% of patients; 89% of patients resumed full-time work or school. Reduced performance status and incomplete resumption of social activity were associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease, recurrent leukemia, AIDS, secondary cancer, organ dysfunction, and neurologic or psychological problems. Other risk factors for incomplete resumption of social activity were female sex (P = 0.002) and older age at transplantation (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: More than 5 years after bone marrow transplantation, most patients were in good health (93%) and had returned to full-time work or school (89%). Recurrence of the primary disease, secondary cancer, and chronic graft-versus-host disease and its sequelae remain problems for some patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have studied histological preparations from decalcified and paraffin included bone biopsies and used a histomorphometric study through a mixed (interactive-automatic) image analysis, in order to quantify bone trabecular (BT/TV) and cellular volume (CV). Preparations were visualized via a 2.5 objective; a video camera was adapted and connected to a computer with analogical-digital converter incorporated. After the image was captured, a binarization was made by trabecular and medullary spaces segmentation; automatically, we calculated trabecular area (TA) and cellular area (CA). Expressions indicated above were used to calculate BV/TV and CV, expressed in percentage: BV/TV (%) = [TA/(TA + CA)] x 100, and CV (%) = [CA/(TA + CA)] x 100. RESULTS: 92 normal biopsies and 79 CLL biopsies were studied (Nodular 12, Diffuse 22, Interstitial 23, Mixed 22). BT/TV in normal subjects age over 45, was 18.40%; it was lower in CLL subjects, 17.25%. CV was 33.62% in normal cases and significantly higher in CLL with 42.95%. According to the infiltration patterns, Nodular pattern showed similar value to normal biopsies, versus Diffuse pattern with BT/TV of 16.19% and CV of 51.49%. Significantly, a high CV value was accompanied of a low B/TV value, in normal and CLL subjects. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed histomorphometrically trabecular volume as expression of bone mass in undecalcified biopsies. CLL infiltration tended to show a lower trabecular volume.

All the parameters listed above were correlated with the time to achieve the complete remission (CR), CR duration and the overall survival. Statistical tests as t-student and chi square test were used. Statistical analysis of the parameters considered revealed that the only value affecting the achievement of a CR was the age. The prognostic significance of immunophenotyping in ANLL has been a controversial issue, with a number of conflicting reports. In our study only the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was significantly associated with prognosis.

Patients were enrolled at three locations: the Dermatology Department of the Fann University Hospital Center (845 patients) from 1992 to 1995, the Dermatology Department of the Le Dantec University Hospital Center and the Oncology Department of the Principal Hospital (7 patients) in 1994 and 1995. The incidence of involvement of human retroviruses in neurologic complications seemed low (HTLV-1: 2%, HIV: 3%) and only 6 cases of tropical spastic paraparesis associated with specific anti-HTLV-1 antibodies were diagnosed in 3 men and 3 women with a mean age of 51 years. These cases which were identical to those previously described cases in the West Indies and Japan confirms the existence of this disease in Senegal. In addition 3 cases of isolated facial paralysis were observed in HIV positive patients. Combined HIV/HTLV-1 infection was observed in 3 cases and was not associated with special clinical findings. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) was detected in 4 patients including leukemia with proliferation of CD4 and CD25 in two cases and lymphoma in one case. In one case of ATL two proviruses were identified in circulating tumor cells. These are the first cases of ATL to be reported in Senegal. Molecular characterization of part of the envelope gene (gp 21) from patients with PST hospitalized in a neurology ward showed that the virus present in Senegal belonged to the universal HTLV-1 A type. This study indicates that two types of diseases are associated with HTLV-1 infection in Senegal. Further epidemiologic studies will be needed to evaluate the incidence of the virus and of the diseases associated with it. Prevention will depend partly on screening blood donors as has now been started at the Blood Transfusion Center of Dakar.",,,,Pathologies associees au virus HTLV-1 a Dakar (1992-1995).,,,,,,,,

In addition, analysis of IgH gene rearrangement by PCR was more specific for assessing B cell lineage.

The status of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy in the diagnosis and management of these lymphoblastic malignancies is controversial. We present our experience from the past 7 years using FNA in children from 10 months to 15 years (mean age 10.5 years) of age with lymphoblastic cancers; in addition, two adult patients with ALL are included. Superficial FNA was performed in 16 cases (one patient had two aspirations 16 months apart). Eight patients were diagnosed with LL, six with ALL, and the one patient with two separate aspirates had lymphoblastic transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Five patients presented with the superior mediastinal syndrome. Sites of FNA included lymph node (nine cases), parotid gland (one), and soft tissues of the neck (four), buttock (one), and forehead (one). There were no complications from FNA. Except for one case (case 8), the patients with ALL and CML were previously diagnosed and treated for their disease, and FNA was performed primarily for the detection of disease recurrence. Conversely, in all eight children with LL, FNA was performed as the initial procedure to establish a primary diagnosis in previously well individuals. All eight LL patients responded-some dramatically-to chemotherapy. Two patients with LL and one with lymphoid blast crisis arising in CML had subsequent surgical biopsies that confirmed the FNA diagnosis. Immunophenotyping performed from 15 of 16 aspirates confirmed the T cell derivation of all cases of LL and 4 of 6 of ALL. Two of the ALL cases had a pre-B cell phenotype. Sufficient cells were obtained by FNA for flow cytometric DNA analysis in 9 of 16 cases. All cases but one were diploid, and 6 of 9 showed a high (> 6%) S phase. Our experience suggests that, when combined with immunologic phenotyping, definitive initial pathologic diagnosis of LL and recurrent ALL is possible and preferable using only aspiration cytopathology. It should be considered as part of the initial evaluation and management whenever a mass lesion appears in a child with a suspected lymphoblastic neoplasm. It can preclude the need for a surgically procured piece of tissue in those with a mediastinal mass and the superior mediastinal syndrome.",,,,,,,,,,,,

There are currently two methodologies for performing the MLA: the original soft agar procedure and the newer microtitre procedure. While both procedures are considered acceptable, a limited amount of comparative information exists for the two methods. In this report the two methods were compared with regard to: (1) spontaneous and induced mutant frequencies; (2) cloning efficiencies; and (3) colony size distributions for mutants. In addition, small and large mutant colonies from microtitre wells were rechallenged for trifluorothymidine (TFT) resistance. In a majority of the cases, cloning efficiency values were higher for the microtitre as were the spontaneous and induced mutation frequency (MF) values. Nevertheless, when responses were compared according to mutation index (fold increase over background MF) the results from the two systems were often similar. More spontaneous small colonies were observed in the microtitre assay. While colony size distribution for induced mutant colonies was compound specific, generally, more small colonies were counted in microtitre. All mutant clones that were rechallenged with TFT demonstrated resistance. Aside from the differences mentioned above, both the microtitre and the soft agar procedures appear equally capable of identifying mutagenic agents.","['0 (Mutagens)', '9002-18-0 (Agar)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'RMW9V5RW38 (Trifluridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three cell lines with high P-gp expression (two colon cancer and one leukemia), and a control cell line with no P-gp expression were exposed to chemotherapeutic agents in the presence or absence of MA and drug sensitivity was determined using the MTT colorimetric assay. P-gp-170 expression was detected by flow cytometry using JSB-1 monoclonal antibody and the functionality of MDR expression was tested by rhodamine-123 uptake studies. In vitro drug accumulation studies were performed using [3H]-vincristine. The results were subjected to paired t-test analysis and 95% confidence intervals were determined in cytotoxicity tests. RESULTS: MA augmented the cytotoxicity of vincristine, but not doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, taxol, vinblastine or colchicine in the three P-gp-expressing cell lines, whereas verapamil augmented the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and vincristine. MA did not augment the cytotoxicity of vincristine in the P-gp-negative HUT-102 cell line. CONCLUSION: MA augmented vincristine cytotoxicity in P-gp-expressing cell lines. However, this phenomenon did not occur with the other classic MDR drugs. Therefore, the augmentation of vincristine cytotoxicity by MA can be explained either by involvement of a different mechanism that coexists with the mdr-1 phenotype or by the presence of a different affinity or binding site on the P-gp molecule for MA compared to that for the other classic MDR drugs and verapamil.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'TJ2M0FR8ES (Megestrol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

As outlined in Table I, we believe that absent stainable marrow iron does not necessarily indicate iron deficiency in these patients and that the serum ferritin and RBC mean corpuscular volume should be incorporated in this assessment. Normal values speak strongly against iron-deficient erythropoiesis. A search for the bcr/abl gene rearrangement should be included with the marrow karyotype to exclude CML. Finally, cytogenetic data and morphologic study of the marrow should be used to be certain that a MDS should not be considered. It may be that measurements of serum thrombopoietin levels may be useful in the future. Nonetheless, in principle, ET remains a diagnosis of exclusion as we have originally suggested. For therapy, HU remains an excellent choice for the older patient at risk for thrombosis. Nonetheless, no myelosuppressive therapy remains a perfectly viable option, particularly for the young patient and the older with low thrombotic risk. The roles of anagrelide and alpha interferon in this setting have not been fully defined. Experience with both has still been relatively short. It would be ideal if prospective, randomized trials could be mounted to address these questions. We conclude with confidence that return to older approaches such as 32P and AA in patients who fail on HU is to be discouraged. The use of anagrelide or interferon alfa seems to be a much more appropriate approach. We have not investigated the role of antithrombotic agents such as aspirin in ET. In PV, the combination of aspirin, 300 mg three times daily, and dipyridamole, 75 mg three times daily, failed to reduce the rate of thrombosis and was associated with an increased rate of hemorrhage. It is rational to suggest that lower doses of aspirin (ie, < 325 mg daily) might be associated with less hemorrhage and, perhaps, a beneficial effect on thrombosis. This remains to be shown.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Considerable progress in eradicating EBL has been achieved during recent years, as a result of systematic serological herd testing, and the slaughter of cattle infected with bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). The decrease in the numbers of EBL-affected cattle may be expressed by the reduction in the number of leukotic tumour cases recorded annually: from an average of 180 cases per 100,000 cows in the 1980s to four cases in 1994; and by the decrease in the average prevalence of BLV-infected animals in the cattle population, from 31.4% in 1989 to 0% in 1994.

In this report we investigate the effect of vesnarinone on the cytokine secretory products of mononuclear phagocytes. In a concentration-dependent manner, the drug inhibits the endotoxin(LPS)-stimulated release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and suppresses interleukin(IL)-6 release, but does not affect the release of IL-1 alpha, IL-10 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) by mouse peritoneal macrophages. Using competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses, we find that vesnarinone significantly reduces TNF(alpha), but not IL-10 mRNA. In addition to LPS, the drug inhibits TNF(alpha) release induced by several other stimuli. The inhibitory effect of the drug on the TNF(alpha) biosynthesis can be observed in differentiated human monocytes, in macrophage cell lines, and in synovial adherent cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients. Although the precise mode of action of vesnarinone in the signal transduction pathway leading to the selective inhibition of TNF(alpha) is not known, the drug might be useful in the treatment of diseases involving that cytokine.","['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5COW40EV8M (vesnarinone)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The HSP72 expression was measured by flowcytometric analysis using a monoclonal antibody (moAb) that specifically recognizes HSP72, the inducible form of the HSP70 group. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression, detected with moAb W5/32 was not affected by non-lethal heat exposure and a recovery period at 37 degrees C for 12 h: ES cells express MHC class I molecules on about 80% of the cells; K562 cells exhibited no MHC class I expression neither before nor after heat shock. Inhibition of RNA-(actinomycin D) of protein-synthesis (cycloheximide) prior to heat treatment completely inhibits the expression of HSP72 on the cell surface of both tumour cells, thus indicating that de novo protein synthesis is required for HSP72 cell surface expression. Since, apart from HSP72, protein synthesis in general is down-modulated by heat shock we speculate that HSP72 molecules that are expressed on the cell surface of tumour cells might be recruited from newly synthesized proteins. The heat-inducible HSP72 cell surface expression on tumour cells could be correlated with an increased sensitivity of leukemic and sarcoma cells to lysis mediated by NK effector cells. The results of cold target inhibition assays revealed that histologically different tumour cells (sarcoma and leukemic cells) that were exposed to non-lethal temperatures have to share a similar if not identical HSP72 immunogenic determinant.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Cell Res. 221,27-40, 1995) were detected also in several other cell lines induced to undergo apoptosis by different stimuli, such as MOLT-4 treated with staurosporine, K-562 incubated with actinomycin D, P-815 exposed to temperature causing heat shock, Jurkat cells treated with EGTA, U-937 growing in the presence of cycloheximide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and HeLa cells treated with etoposide. Using immunoelectron microscopy techniques, we demonstrate that, besides the already described nuclear matrix proteins p125 and p160, these granules contain other nucleoskeletal polypeptides such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a component of ribonucleoprotein particles, a 105-kDa constituent of nuclear spliceosomes, and the 240-kDa nuclear mitotic apparatus-associated protein referred to as NuMA. Moreover, we also found in the granules SAF-A/hn-RNP-U and SATB1 proteins, two polypeptides that have been reported to bind scaffold-associated regions DNA sequences in vitro, thus mediating the formation of looped DNA structures in vivo. Fibrillarin and coilin are not present in these granules or the PML protein. Thus, the granules seen during the apoptotic process apparently are different from coiled bodies or other types of nuclear bodies. Furthermore, these granules do not contain chromatin components such as histones and DNA. Last, Western blotting analysis revealed that nuclear matrix proteins present in the granules are not proteolytically degraded except for the NuMA polypeptide. We propose that these granules might represent aggregates of nuclear matrix proteins forming during the apoptotic process. Moreover, since the granules are present in several cell lines undergoing apoptosis, they could be considered a previously unrecognized morphological hallmark of the apoptotic process.","['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fibrillarin)', '136882-81-0 (p80-coilin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The former is definitely pathogenic while disease association with the latter is unclear. There are two subtypes of HTLV-II, A and B. Currently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on HTLV-I antigens are used to screen for the presence of HTLV-I and -II antibodies. Confirmation and subtyping are accomplished by Western blot (WB) or ELISAs based on HTLV-I whole viral antigens and/or HTLV-I and HTLV-IIA peptides. The sensitivity and specificity of these serologic assays were compared to those of HTLV-I and-II-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in tests on samples from Indians from South America in whom the HTLV-IIB subtype is endemic. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Sera from 246 Gran Chaco Indians were evaluated for HTLV antibodies with the use of four ELISAs (Retrotek HTLV-I; Cambridge Biotech rgp21 enhanced HTLV-I/II; Vironostika HTLV-I/II; and Select HTLV-I/II), and a WB assay. Peripheral blood leukocyte DNA from each Indian was analyzed for HTLV-I or HTLV-II pol DNA via PCR. Fifteen of the PCR-positive samples were further subtyped via cloning and sequencing and/or oligomer restriction. RESULTS: Ninety-seven samples (39%) were positive for HTLV-II by serologic and/or PCR assays. All 15 positive DNA samples that were further analyzed were of the HTLV-IIB subtype and were clustered as a highly conserved phylogenetic group. Comparative analyses indicate that the sensitivity and specificity of the various assays were: PCR, 97 and 100 percent; Retrotek, 70 and 91 percent; Cambridge Biotech, 74 and 96 percent; Vironostika, 73 and 99 percent; Select 72 and 98 percent; and WB, 70 and 100 percent. CONCLUSION: The sensitivities of the tested HTLV serologic assays were comparable. However, the specificity of the Retrotek ELISA was significantly lower than that of the others. When positive, the subtyping assays were very specific. However, PCR assays would seem preferable or to be a necessary adjunct for the sensitive detection of HTLV-IIB infection.",,['N01-HB-6702/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Microscopically, these tumors can mimic primary carcinoma of the breast, especially in limited material such as needle biopsy specimens. Forty-five hematopoietic breast neoplasms including 21 primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), 19 secondary NHLs, 1 undetermined NHL, 1 lesion secondary to Hodgkin's disease, and 3 granulocytic sarcomas were reviewed with regard to histologic subtype, morphologic features, and immunophenotype. The median age of patients at presentation was 67 years for those with primary NHLs and 61 years for those with secondary NHLs. The majority of lymphomas were intermediate or high grade. Diffuse large cell type was by far the most common histologic subtype. No lymphomas resembling lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue were identified in this series, suggesting that such lymphomas are rare in breast compared with other sites such as the gastrointestinal tract and lung. Four primary NHLs, 2 secondary NHLs, and 1 granulocytic sarcoma were initially misdiagnosed as carcinomas; three patients underwent radical mastectomy, and at least three other patients nearly received surgical treatment. One primary anaplastic large cell lymphoma of B-cell origin was identified that closely resembled poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma. ""Single file"" or targetoid patterns with extensive sclerosis mimicking invasive lobular carcinoma was common in lymphomas and was seen in one of the granulocytic sarcomas. In addition, two breast lymphomas, one of B-cell phenotype and the other of T-cell phenotype, showed frequent signet ring cells, which potentially could be confused with lobular carcinoma. Despite a number of recent articles on lymphomas of the breast, it appears that these tumors continue to be confused with carcinomas. Histologic features suggestive of lymphomatous involvement include absence of in situ carcinoma, frequent individual karyorrhectic cells, lymphoepithelial lesions, and cellular discohesiveness.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two patients had diffuse lymphadenopathy, and the third had marked lymphocytosis (white blood cell count 217,000/microL, with 90% circulating blasts). In all three patients, neoplastic cells had the appearance of lymphoblasts and were immunoreactive for T-cell markers by immunohistochemical or flow cytometric analysis or both.

The human rfp (ret finger protein) has a tripartite motif, consisting of two novel zinc fingers (the RING linger and the B box) and a coiled-coil domain, and belongs to the B box zinc finger protein family. Rfp becomes oncogenic when its tripartite motif is recombined with the tyrosine kinase domain from the c-ret proto-oncogene. To further understand the function of rfp during normal development and cellular differentiation, we cloned the mouse rfp cDNA and analyzed its pattern of expression and subcellular distribution. We found that the mouse rfp cDNA shared a 98.4% homology with the human sequence. The gene mapped to human chromosome 6 and mouse chromosome 13 indicating that it was linked to a several other genes encoding proteins that possess common domains. rfp transcripts and protein were ubiquitous in day 10.5-13.5 mouse embryos, however, they were restricted in adult mice, with the highest level of expression in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids of differentiating sperm. The rfp protein was detected within cell nuclei as nuclear bodies similar to the PODs (PML oncogenic domains) observed with another B box family member, PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein). These results suggest that rfp may function in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation during mouse embryogenesis and sperm differentiation.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TRIM27 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Trim27 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, mouse)']",['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['GENBANK/L46855'],,,,,,,,,

Another study had suggested that TDRF upregulated both TNF-alpha receptor (TNF-alpha R) and IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma R) mRNA synthesis, as well as increased TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma binding to their receptors. In the present study, we have further characterized the concentration-dependent macrophage activating potential of TDRF alone and in synergy with IFN-gamma or IFN-gamma and subactivating concentrations of IL-2. Higher concentrations of TDRF acted independently on inflammatory C3H FeJ mouse macrophage to induce expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and release of TNF-alpha, but failed to induce nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA expression and NO generation. At lower concentrations, TDRF synergized with either IFN-gamma alone or in combination with IL-2 to stimulate a dose-related increase in the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and secretion of TNF-alpha, as well as increased induction of NOS mRNA and cytotoxic NO generation by macrophage. MCA tumor targets which did not produce TDRF activity were killed by macrophage that had been activated by exogenously added L1210-derived TDRF in synergy with IFN-gamma or in combination with subactivating concentrations of IL-2, but not by TDRF alone. Taken together, our results indicate that TDRF acted independently in a dose-dependent fashion to induce macrophage synthesis and release of TNF-alpha, but in the absence of IFN-gamma or in combination with IL-2 failed to induce the NOS enzyme which was necessary for cytotoxic NO generation. Thus TDRF appears to be a sufficient second signal for IFN-gamma-primed macrophage or alternatively a sufficient third signal for IFN-gamma and IL-2 treated macrophage to culminate the activation process for NOS mRNA synthesis and NO-mediated tumor cytotoxicity.","['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, for AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice, there was a shift as the mice aged from 5 to 7 weeks to a requirement for CD4+ T cells for AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL generation. When CD4+ T-cell-depleted AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b responder mice were immunized at 5 weeks of age they were able to elicit a strong anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL response. However, if the CD4+ T-cell depletion was done at 6 weeks and then the mice were primed in vivo, their antiviral CTL responsiveness was markedly decreased. Following CD4+ T-cell depletion at 7 weeks the mice were totally incapable of generating anti-AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL. AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL isolated from AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice recognized the class I-restricted immunodominant epitope (KSPWFTTL) and three subdominant epitopes, previously identified as CTL epitopes for B6 mice. Analysis of IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 lymphokine profiles in supernates harvested from MLTC wells, and the results of supernate transfer experiments, suggested that the age-dependent shift to CD4+ T-cell dependence in AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice does not correlate with an obvious change in the in vitro lymphokine profiles. Experiments in which exogenous IL-2 was used to supplement in vitro cultures containing CD4+ T-cell-depleted 7-week responder mice suggested that the CD4+ T-cell requirement was at the in vivo priming stage of antiviral CTL generation. These data suggested a fundamental change in virus-specific CTL which correlates with slight aging in the AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mouse strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a shift in the requirement for CD4+ T lymphocytes for the generation of virus-specific CTL over such a short period of time. Moreover, it is of interest that this shift in CD4+ T-cell-dependence by antiviral CTL occurs just prior to the onset of CTL nonresponsiveness in the AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mouse strain.","['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)']","['AI077363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we describe Reptimed, a unique bone marrow-derived factor with inhibitory activity for myelopoiesis and in vitro growth of myeloid cell lines. Reptimed was partially purified from bone marrow supernatants using a combination of solid-phase extraction and size exclusion chromatography. Reptimed is < 1000 Da MW and is water soluble.

Our results show that for the detection of bcr/abl translocation in CML patients, FISH is more sensitive than conventional cytogenetics because it detects significantly higher proportions of cells carrying the translocation both in metaphase (P < .0002) and interphase nuclei (P < .003). Moreover, in the metaphases of the controls analyzed, no bcr/abl+ chromosome was detected that makes the colocalization of bcr and abl signals in the CML patients highly specific. Conversely, in control interphase nuclei, a small proportion of cells (ranging between 0% and 3%, mean value of 1.7% +/- 0.9%) displaying colocalization of both signals is usually detected.

Using the peptidic substrate H-Pro-Thr-Glu-Phe-Phe(NO2)-Arg-Leu-OH, which is specific for aspartyl proteases, proteases, proteolytic activity was detected in a number of tissues including muscle by using a crude extraction procedure for isolation of lysosomal enzymes. Biochemical characterization and increased muscle levels following either fasting or injection of endotoxin (ETX) suggest that the enzyme is likely cathepsin D. The wasting syndrome accompanying the tumor was measured by comparing the weight of the skinned hind limb in treated and control animals. DBA/2 mice inoculated intraperitoneally with L1210 cells developed multiple solid tumors in the peritoneum and ascites; maximal tumor burden was reached by 16 days. There was a significant reduction in hind limb weight (16 +/- 2%; mean +/- SE) and significant increase (31 +/- 8%) in muscle APA associated with the development of ascites and solid tumors. Plasma APA activity was substantially increased (240 +/- 33%), while liver and spleen APA were increased (10-20%) but not significantly. Chronic pepstatin administration, 30 mg.kg-1.day-1, for 7 days concurrent with the initiation of observable ascites and solid tumor formation (7 days post-inoculation), completely inhibited hind limb weight loss and alleviated the tumor-dependent increase of APA in both plasma and muscle without altering tumor development. Delaying the administration of pepstatin by 3 days resulted in less of an inhibition (33 +/- 13%) of hind limb weight loss. Thus, cathepsin D or a similar aspartyl protease appears to be of key importance in the wasting syndrome associated with cachexia.","['0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Pepstatins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '11076-29-2 (Streptomyces pepsin inhibitor)', '67924-63-4 (endotoxin, Escherichia coli)', 'EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)', 'V6Y2T27Q1U (pepstatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care institution. PATIENT(S): One hundred six cancer patients cryopreserving their semen specimens. INTERVENTION(S): Computer-assisted semen analysis was performed before and after cryopreservation on each patient specimen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The relationship of sperm motility and motion characteristics to type of cancer and patient's response to treatment. RESULT(S): Prefreeze and post-thaw semen quality did not differ between patients presenting with testicular cancer and Hodgkin's disease. Patients with leukemia or advanced soft tissue cancer had a higher prefreeze and post-thaw motility and higher total and motile sperm count than testicular and Hodgkin's disease patients. A prefreeze sperm motility of > or = 15% could predict a post-thaw motility of > 10%. CONCLUSION(S): Prefreeze or post-thaw semen quality in cancer patients is not affected (except the prefreeze motile sperm count within the testicular cancer patients) by the type of disease. Prefreeze motility can predict post-thaw motility. Cryopreservation of semen should be offered to cancer patients irrespective of the type of disease.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pathogenesis of leukemic transformation has been thought that it was resulted from cumulation of activation or mutation in oncogenes or onco-suppressor genes. As a matter of fact, many specific chromosomal abnormalities in leukemias have been thought to be due to production of chimeric fusion gene by translocation and activation in some kinds of oncogenes under specific regulatory genes after translocation. In addition to those, inactivation of onco-suppressor genes, such as RB gene or p53 gene, may be also related to leukemogenesis in some leukemias. Laboratory examinations using molecular technology are being necessary for clinical diagnosis and treatment in many hematological disorders. The examinations detecting rearrangement of major BCR or minor BCR in Ph1 positive leukemias, TCR in T cell malignancy, immunoglobulin in B cell malignancy, PML-RAR alpha fusion gene in APL have become routine for diagnosis of some leukemias. Moreover, these examinations are useful for judgement of treatment effects and evaluation of minimal residual diseases. In this paper, we also discuss the usefulness and importance of these technology especially in stem cell transplantation and cytokine therapy, and the future possibility in this technology for gene therapy.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The initial metabolism of exogenous adenosine (Ado) and deoxyadenosine (dAdo) has been compared in human erythrocytes and CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and the data obtained have been simulated using kinetic constants obtained in vitro for the enzymes involved. Cells were mixed with 3H-labelled Ado and dAdo, samples were taken at 3 sec intervals and progress curves for the 3H-labelled metabolites formed were determined by quantitative two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. Erythrocytes rapidly take up Ado and the predominant metabolite after 60 sec is hypoxanthine (Hyp), while for dAdo, deoxyinosine (dIno) predominates. By contrast, leukemia cells convert to Ado predominantly to AMP, while dAdo is converted first to Hyp and the to AMP. The presence of dCf had little effect upon Ado metabolism by induced accumulation of dAdo. Erythrocytes rapidly degrade Ado and dAdo to Hyp, although the phosphorolysis of dIno is relatively slow. Human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells convert most of the Ado or dAdo to AMP after 60 sec. For dAdo, the sequence of reactions would be dAdo-->dIno-->Hyp-->IMP-->sAMP-->AMP. dCf does not significantly affect the conversion of Ado-->AMP, but dCf blocks AMP accumulation from dAdo, consistent with the reaction sequence shown above. A computer model has been developed for the metabolism of Ado and dAdo, but some of the kinetic constants determined in vitro for this model do not pertain to intact cells.","['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)--a potent ODC inducer on antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of TGF-beta 1 in L1210 leukemic cells. Cells were incubated in 2% FCS/RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with TGF-beta 1 (2 ng/ml). TPA (100 ng/ml) or alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (5 mM). Cell proliferation, apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated using [methyl-3H] thymidine, electron microscopy, electrophoresis of DNA and trypan blue exclusion. Expression and activity of ODC were determined by RT-PCR and measurement of 14CO2 release from L-1-14C ornithine, respectively. TGF-beta 1 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death in L1210 leukemic cells. The above effects were associated with the inhibition of ODC expression and activity, measured 2 and 4 hr after TGF-beta 1 administration, respectively. The presence of DFMO, an irreversible inhibitor of ODC, led to apoptotic fragmentation of DNA, similar to that observed in TGF-beta 1-treated cultures. Administration of TPA simultaneously with TGF-beta 1 significantly reduced antiproliferative, apoptotic and necrotic effects of TGF-beta 1, and prevented its inhibitory action of ODC expression and activity. It is concluded that: down-regulation of ODC expression may be one of the early events associated with TGF-beta 1-evoked suppression of growth and apoptosis; ODC is involved in the mechanism of protective action of TPA on TGF-beta 1-related growth inhibition of L1210 leukemic cells.","['0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although discovered because it stimulates bone formation in adult mammals, BMP-4 has important roles as a signalling molecule in embryonic tissues, including the developing central and peripheral nervous system, musculature and skeleton.

Early activation events involve increased activity of Lyn and Syk kinases and their translocation into membrane domains containing aggregated Fc epsilonRI, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for these changes have remained largely unclear. To determine the role of Fc epsilonRI subunits in this process, we have analyzed Syk- and Lyn-associated proteins in activated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and their variants deficient in the expression of Fc epsilonRI beta or gamma subunits. Sepharose 4B gel chromatography of postnuclear supernatants from Nonidet-P40-solubilized antigen (Ag)- or pervanadate-activated RBL cells revealed extensive changes in the size of complexes formed by Lyn and Syk kinases and other cellular components. A fusion protein containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains of Lyn bound Syk from lysates of nonactivated RBL cells; an increased binding was observed when lysates from Ag- or pervanadate-activated cells were used. A similar amount of Syk was bound when lysates from pervanadate-activated variant cells deficient in the expression of Fc epsilonRI beta or gamma subunits were used, suggesting that Fc epsilonRI does not function as the only intermediate in the formation of the Syk-Lyn complexes. Further experiments have indicated that Syk-Lyn interactions occur in Ag-activated RBL cells under in vivo conditions and that these interactions could involve direct binding of the Lyn SH2 domain with phosphorylated tyrosine of Syk. The physical association of Lyn and Syk during mast-like cell activation supports the recently proposed functional cooperation of these two tyrosine kinases in Fc epsilonRI signaling.","['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We applied the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase method for IP using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against leukocyte-associated antigens, neuroectodermal antigens, and intermediate filament antigens. Four cases of neuroblastoma, two cases of Ewing sarcoma, and one case of rhabdomyosarcoma were diagnosed by IP but not by MC studies.

In the first randomized controlled study of the 811 protocol (1981-1983) a comparison of conventional daily 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate with a pulsed regimen of the two drugs was performed. The superiority of the pulsed regimen was shown. In the next 841 protocol (1984-1987) a comparison of two drugs and three drugs during induction therapy was conducted. The three-drug regimen resulted in a significantly higher event-free survival (EFS) rate. In the 874 protocol (1987-1990) two regimens with or without cranial irradiation were randomly compared, and there was no significant difference between the two regimens for the standard-risk group. To further improve the EFS rate a risk group-directed protocol 911 was conducted starting in January 1991. Life-table analysis of serial CCLSG protocols revealed that the outcome of overall ALL has gradually improved with an increase of the EFS rate; 41.4% +/- 3.6% at 14 years for the 811 protocol, 51.3% +/- 3.5% at 11 years for the 841 protocol, 56.7% +/- 3.1% at 8 years for the 874 protocol, and 78.2% +/- 3.1% at 4 years for the more recent 911 protocol.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes and retroviral vectors are approaches directed at the molecular mechanisms of cancer. Transfer of genes encoding cytokines and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) could also be used to elicit immunity against tumor cells. Gene marking strategies have been useful in elucidating the biology of disease relapse after autologous bone marrow transplantation. Suicide genes, such as the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene, have been used to modulate graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Although gene delivery remains a major challenge to gene therapy, some modifications have been implemented to overcome this issue. This review will summarize these gene therapy strategies aimed at increasing the survival of patients with leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The next most common lymphoid neoplasm to involve the spleen was chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma, found in 19.4% of cases, followed by follicular center cell lymphoma (13.0%), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma (9.3%), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (8.3%), mantle cell lymphoma (6.5%), and hairy cell leukemia (6.5%). The remaining 3.7% of cases included T-cell proliferations and one difficult-to-classify mixed cell lymphoma. More than 95% of the cases could be placed into one of three morphologic patterns of splenic involvement, i.e., 57.4% of spleens were involved by predominantly white pulp disease, 20.4% by predominantly nodular disease, without a predilection for white or red pulp, and 17.6% by predominantly red pulp disease.

However, a major issue that has not yet been solved is the definition of the degree of Pgp expression which is associated with a significant decrease of the sensitivity of the cells to chemotherapy. For this reason we studied the leukemic cells from 83 cases of acute leukemia. Leukemic cells were fixed in PLP and treated with saponine. Pgp expression was assayed by flow cytometry, using the anti Pgp monoclonal antibody MRK-16. Results were expressed both as the number of positive cells and by the intensity of the reaction as defined by the mean fluorescence index (MFI), i.e. the ratio between the mean fluorescence intensity of the MRK-16 incubated cells and of the IgG2a incubated cells. Thus, Pgp expression was compared with the results of two in vitro tests of cell sensitivity to anthracyclines, daunorubicin (DNR) cell retention and DNR cytotoxicity. We found that it was not the number of MRK-16 positive cells, but the degree of the reaction with MRK-16 (MFI) that significantly related to the anthracycline toxicity tests. Therefore, we propose that for clinical purposes a quick and cheap determination of Pgp-related MDR in leukemic cells may be obtained by measuring the MFI with MRK-16 in a standard flow cytometry assay and that the assay may indeed be sufficient to estimate Pgp expression as well as the influence of Pgp on cell sensitivity to anthracyclines.","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells from these six patients caused overt leukemia in SCID mice with extensive multiple organ involvement. Leukemic BCP from SCID mice xenografted with leukemic cells from two t(9;22) ALL patients expressed very high levels of both VLA-4 and VLA-5 regardless of the tissue of origin.

This form of treatment has often been referred to as donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) therapy. Our laboratory is using murine models of allogeneic BMT to address important unresolved issues regarding DLI therapy in an effort to make the treatment more effective.

Radiation biologists have related the rapid ""initiation' and early appearance of preleukaemic cells in these mice to unrepaired DNA damage inflicted by radiation. Following initiation, radiation-altered thymic differentiation fosters multi-step transformation changes in proto-oncogenes and suppressor gene expression in individual clones of non-invasive preleukaemia cells as they progress to malignancy. The malignant clones arising from small numbers of initiated preleukaemia thymocytes become fully transformed only after several more months to a year after irradiation in those strains of mice which develop T-cell lymphomas. When the RFM mouse was subjected to sublethal whole-body X-ray, only 50% of the mice developed TCL by 6 months, yet nearly all developed preleukaemia thymocytes. The T-cell-mediated immune response of the irradiated host has never been substantiated to contribute to malignant TCL development. Until recently, X-ray-induced TCL were not known to carry common tumour rejection antigens TATA. However, several studies have revealed that both preleukaemia cells and fully malignant TCL express an immunogenic, common oncofoetal glycoprotein, termed 44kD OFA. OFA-activated memory CD4 Tm and CD8 Ten. T-effector cells in irradiated mice expressing OFA. As most irradiated RFM mice exhibit preleukaemia thymocytes yet only half develop tumours, this finding implicates active host T-cell effector responses in X-ray-initiated tumorigenesis. Further, the recent discovery of OFA-specific CD8 Ts clones in irradiated mice, which inhibited cytotoxicity of CD8 clones to OFA or TSTA, may explain which mice develop T-cell lymphomas.",['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)'],['CA-39698/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Methods have been available for almost a decade to transduce murine HSC using high-titre retroviral vectors and stimulation of HSC proliferation with cytokines such as IL-3 and IL-6. Unfortunately, attempts to replicate the high efficiency of gene transfer using canine or simian gene transfer/bone marrow transplantation models have consistently shown that only a small fraction (0.1-1%) of reconstituting HSC are transduced using protocols similar to those which are successful in murine models. Initial clinical trials using retroviral-mediated gene transfer into human HSC also produced minimal transduction frequencies. The dicotomous results may reflect differences in the cell cycle kinetics of murine HSC versus those of larger mammals or the density of receptors for the retroviral vectors on the cells. Attempts to increase the fraction of HSC which are in active cell cycle, a prerequisite for retroviral-mediated transduction, have used either combinations of recombinant cytokines, culture on marrow stromal layers, or alternative sources for HSC, such as mobilized peripheral blood stem cells or umbilical cord blood. Other efforts have used retroviral vectors packaged with either the Gibbon Ape Leukemia virus envelope or the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus G protein. To date, none of these methods has produced a significantly increased frequency of long-term reconstituting HSC. Results using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors for HSC transduction have been conflicting, with the stable persistence of non-integrated virus particles making interpretation of results difficult using in vitro assays. Therefore, clinical trials may best be directed toward disorders that may benefit from a small fraction of genetically corrected HSC. These would include disorders where progeny of corrected HSC would be expected to have a selective survival advantage (e.g. SCID, WAS, HIV, chemoresistance) or where a small fraction of corrected cells can have a direct clinical benefit (e.g. CGD, MPS). Further basic research into HSC biology and gene delivery vectors must continue for wider application, such as haemoglobinopathies and some lysosomal storage diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This autoreactive repertoire secrete the so called natural autoantibodies characterized by their broad reactivity mainly directed against very well conserved public epitopes. They fulfill the definition of an autoantibody since they are self-reactive, but they are not self-specific. As yet, NAA directed against determinants of polymorphism have not been reported. Their germinal origin is suggested by their early appearance during ontogeny, their expression of cross-reactive idiotopes and structural studies of their sequence. As for the physiological role of the repertoire, we can assume that it may play a major role as a first barrier of defense. It is presently unknown whether these polyreactive B cells could constitute a pre-immune template which through an antigen driven process may be involved in the production of immune high affinity antibodies. This autoreactive B cell repertoire frequently undergoes malignant transformation, although there is controversy concerning the reasons accounting for this. It has been postulated that the continuous challenge of this autoreactive repertoire by self-antigens could create propitious conditions for malignant transformation to occur. However, it can be alternatively postulated, that overexpression of certain genes reflect what happens during ontogeny, since V genes expression is a developmentally regulated phenomenon and not all V genes are expressed during fetal life. Some of the genes that are recurrently expressed by these malignancies are also over-expressed in fetal repertoires and even in the adult normal B cell repertoire. We do not know whether it is the challenge by self-antigens or whether alternatively this over-expression simply reflects what happens with the fetal repertoire which could have selective advantages for malignization.","['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",,,,,,,,,,,

For the whole of Hong Kong, there was evidence of spatial clustering of ALL at ages 0-4 years (P = 0.09) and in the childhood peak (P<0.05). When these analyses were restricted to TPUs where extreme population mixing may have occurred, overall incidence was elevated and significant evidence of clustering was found for ALL (P<0.007) at these ages and for the common ALL in the childhood peak (P = 0.032). Replication of the analyses for subsets of leukaemia that were not dominated by the childhood peak of ALL found no evidence of clustering.

HDMP combined with cytotoxic agents (vincristine and L-asparaginase) resulted in an improved complete remission rate (94%) in 48 newly diagnosed children with ALL compared to 81% in 86 historical controls receiving standard dose steroid combined with the same treatment regimen. The bone marrow relapse rate was lower in patients who received HDMP (31%) than in controls (56%). Treatment was discontinued in 56% of 48 patients receiving HDMP and in 35% of 86 controls. The difference was significant (p < 0.05). The 5-yr continuous complete remission rate was significantly greater in patients received HDMP compared with the control patients (60% vs. 43%, p < 0.05). HDMP treatment was well tolerated without significant adverse effects. Moreover, during induction therapy the duration of leukopenia (< 2 x 10(9)/L) was shorter in patients receiving HDMP. We conclude that HDMP combined with other antileukemic agents increased the CR rate and prolonged the duration of remission in children with ALL who had increased risk factors. However, the optimal dosage of HDMP and its role in maintenance therapy should be determined in future, randomized studies.","['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The increase in CD8+ T cell expansions (up to 23-fold) during unmaintained remission and follow-up suggest that the clonal CD8+ cells may represent regulatory T cells controlling the growth of the tumour B cell clone.

Occasionally, this tightly controlled process acts on inappropriate places in the genome and results in deletions and translocations. Some of these illegitimate V(D)J recombinase-mediated events have been implicated in the genetic changes associated with several forms of leukemia and lymphoid malignancy. We have developed a sensitive, specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay to quantify such events in the peripheral blood cells of humans. This assay detects a V(D)J recombinase-mediated deletion in the hprt gene, which codes for a housekeeping enzyme and is not implicated in cancer development. Alterations in this gene serve as a surrogate indicator for these illegitimate events, which may be occurring throughout the genome. The assay involves a hemi-nested PCR with two sets of primers. Multiple replicates of genomic DNA (each representing 4 x 10(5) cells) are amplified with specific primers under conditions in which a single copy will give a detectable PCR product. Poisson statistics are then used to estimate the deletion mutant frequency. The frequency of cells with the hprt deletion among 20 healthy young adults ranged from <1.3 x 10(-7) to 4.1 x 10(-7) and was compared with the frequency of t(14;18) previously determined in these same individuals. No correlation was found between the frequencies of these two measures of genomic rearrangement. The DNA sequences at the deletion junctions were determined and provided evidence for multiple independent mutations in some individuals. This assay may serve as a biomarker for the level of illegitimate V(D)J recombination occurring in peripheral blood cells of humans.","['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",,['GENBANK/M26434'],,,,,,,,,

Myelosuppression was dose-limiting. The purpose of this phase I trial was to determine if granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) support allows the dosage of the combination of etoposide and carboplatin to be increased above the previously determined MTD. In this CALGB study of 44 evaluable patients with performance status 0-2, cohorts were treated with etoposide and carboplatin given intravenously on days 1-3 followed by GM-CSF (molgramostim) given subcutaneously on days 4-18. Four dose levels of bacteria-derived recombinant GM-CSF (5, 10, 20 microg/kg/day and 5 microg/kg every 12 h), three dose levels of etoposide (200, 250, and 300 mg/m2/day x 3), and two dose levels of carboplatin (125 and 150 mg/m2/day x 3) were evaluated. There was no chemotherapy dose escalation in individual patients. With 5 microg/kg/d GM-CSF, the first etoposide and carboplatin cycle of 300 and 150 mg/m2/day x 3, respectively, could be administered with acceptable toxicity. However, GM-CSF did not allow repeated administration of this dose-escalated regimen every 21 days, since delayed platelet and/or neutrophil recovery was dose limiting in later cycles. These results demonstrate that GM-CSF alone has limited capability to support the repeated administration of high doses of etoposide and carboplatin. CALGB currently is testing the ability of interleukin (IL)-6 given with GM-CSF to ameliorate the cumulative myelosuppression of this intense regimen.","['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']","['CA-04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, however, Z-Asp did not inhibit JNK1 activation in either VP-16- or CPT-treated U937 cells. The JNK1 antisense oligonucleotides diminished protein expression of JNK1 and inhibited drug-induced apoptosis of U937 cells, whereas sense control oligonucleotides did not. Consistent with this observation, the antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells did not respond to VP-16 or CPT with Z-Asp-sensitive proteases.

Forced expression of TAL1 together with RBTN1 or RBTN2, but not TAL1 alone, strongly induced artificial reporter genes in a TAL1/RBTN-negative T-ALL cell line, HPB-ALL. Such collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN was not, however, observed in non-T cell lines, suggesting further involvement of some T cell-specific cofactors. In this context, we carried out preliminary evaluation of a potential role of the T cell-specific GATA-binding protein, GATA3, in the transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN. We also showed that coexpression of TAL1 and RBTN1 in HPB-ALL strongly induced TALLA1, a highly specific T-ALL marker whose positivity correlated 100% with ectopic expression of TAL1 among various T-ALL cell lines. Collectively, ectopic TAL1 and RBTN1 or -2, together with some endogenous T cell-specific cofactors like GATA3, constitute a highly collaborative set of transcription factors whose aberrant activity in T cells may lead to leukemogenesis by modulating expression of downstream genes such as TALLA1.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have supposed that the delayed cell death may be associated with different types of hereditable lesions.","['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Platinum Compounds)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",,,Sravnenie zakonomernostei otdalennoi gibeli kletok posle vozdeistviia genotoksicheskikh agentov.,,,,,,,,

The program itself is based on a net of prognostic models providing prompt prognosis of bad outcome of the disease as well as their prevention or early treatment. Specific prevention of early death is conducted prior to and during the induction therapy. Prevention of resistance to cytostatic drugs is based on evaluation of the early effect of the first induction chemotherapy with three cytologic-mathematical parameters. Remission consolidation consists of two individualized courses. Older patients undergo maintenance therapy which differs in clonal and nonclonal remissions. Optimal time to perform bone marrow transplantation is determined by mathematical models based on clinical data. In patients with high risk of leukemic relapse, transplantation is performed in the first remission, while in others it is performed in eventual relapse. Parts of ANLL-NS-02 program are computerized and adapted for clinical utilization. This program has been used at our institution for 5 years and results have confirmed advantages of individualized therapy over standard protocols in treating acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia.",,,,Program ANLL-NS 02 za individualizovanu terapiju akutne nelimfoblastne leukemije.,,,,,,,,

The stress-activated protein (SAP) kinases stimulate the transactivation function of c-jun by amino terminal phosphorylation. The present work demonstrates that ara-C activates p54 SAP kinase. The finding that SAP kinase is also activated by alkylating agents (mitomycin C and cisplatinum) and the topoisomerase I inhibitor 9-amino-camptothecin supports DNA damage as an initial signal in this cascade. The results demonstrate that ara-C also induces binding of SAP kinase to the SH2/SH3-containing adapter protein Grb2. SAP kinase binds to the SH3 domains of Grb2, while interaction of the p85 alpha-subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex. The results also demonstrate that ara-C treatment is associated with inhibition of lipid and serine kinase activities of PI 3-kinase. The potential significance of the ara-C-induced interaction between SAP kinase and PI 3-kinase is further supported by the demonstration that Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, stimulates SAP kinase activity. The finding that Wortmannin treatment is also associated with internucleosomal DNA fragmentation may support a potential link between PI 3-kinase and regulation of both SAP kinase and programmed cell death.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Since the effect of the NO-releasing agents was augmented by a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, at least some of their effect appeared to be mediated by activation of cytosolic guanylate cyclase. The drugs did not globally block differentiation since hemin-induced differentiation was undisturbed. In HMBA-treated cells, the NO-releasing agents and cGMP analogues reduced beta-globin and delta-aminolevulinate synthetase mRNA expression and inhibited the late down-regulation of c-myb mRNA that is required for HMBA-induced differentiation of MEL cells; the regulation of c-myc mRNA was not changed by the drugs. Nuclear run-off analyses showed that the drugs inhibited the HMBA-induced changes in beta-globin and c-myb transcription rates, and transient transfection of a reporter gene construct demonstrated that the drugs inhibited HMBA-inducible enhancer function of the alpha-globin control region, which contains binding sites for the erythroid transcription factors NF-E2 and GATA-1. The NO-releasing agents and cGMP analogues largely prevented HMBA-induced increases in DNA binding of NF-E2, whereas DNA binding of GATA-1 and SP-1 was not affected.

To determine how the deletion interfered with the infective capacity of the virus, different steps of the viral cycle were studied using deleted viruses.

Details of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this leukemia are unclear at present. In other malignancies tumorigenesis has been shown to proceed via a multistep progression model with a causal relation between the accumulation of genetic abnormalities and more aggressive clinical behavior. The loss of chromosomal segments in malignant cells has proven useful in mapping regions of DNA that contain candidate tumor suppressor genes. The detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been greatly facilitated by the analysis of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers enabling the identification of submicroscopic losses. Utilizing immunomagnetic bead sorting to separate leukemic from normal cells we identified at least one allelic losses in 8/29 (28%) of analysed CLL cases with a PCR-based assay. On chromosomal arm 3p we have identified homozygous deletions in 3/29 cases at locus D3S1284 residing in the vicinity of the newly described FHIT gene. Several cases of CLL manifested LOH at a locus telomeric to the p15 and p16 tumor suppressor genes, all being early to intermediate stage disease. Our findings suggest that losses at these loci may contribute to the development and/or progression of CLL in at least a subset of cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,

TEL proteins are nuclear and display specific DNA binding activity toward classical ETS binding sites. In addition, we show that TEL mRNAs initiate translation at either of the two first inframe ATGs (codon 1 and 43) to encode 50 kDa and 57 kDa TEL proteins. In vivo, each of these primary translational products is modified by multiple phosphorylation events.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,['GENBANK/Y07915'],,,,,,,,,

In this study, we obtained HCV cDNA clones covering the whole viral genome by RT-nested PCR using RNA from HCV-infected cloned MT-2C cells, which support viral replication more efficiently, at 12 days after inoculation. A total of 41 distinct HCV cDNA clones covering almost the whole viral genome were also isolated from a cDNA library derived from the original inoculum. Molecular evolutional analyses comparing the sequences of the HCV clones obtained from both sources revealed that the HCV populations became homogeneous in more than half of the compared regions. This finding suggests that limited HCV populations are able to replicate in MT-2C cells. In addition, we isolated cDNA clones containing a 3' X-tail sequence, which was recently identified as a bona fide 3' terminus of the HCV genome, in the HCV-infected MT-2C cells and confirmed that the nucleotide sequence of the 3' X-tail was highly conserved, suggesting its implication in HCV replication. Finally, on the basis of the sequences of HCV cDNA clones obtained from HCV-infected MT-2C cells, we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of the HCV genome containing the 3' X-tail as a candidate for an infectious HCV molecular clone.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,['GENBANK/D85516'],,,,,,,,,

We have also shown a genetic selectivity of an anti-erbB-2 intracellular single-chain antibody (sFv) encoding adenovirus, Ad21, for the erbB-2-positive prostate carcinoma cell lines DU 145 and LNCaP. Delivery of Ad21 resulted in cytotoxicity to the DU 145 and LNCaP, but not PC-3, cell lines and reduced the clonogenic capacity of DU 145 cells cultured alone or mixed with various ratios of irradiated human bone marrow. Finally, quantitative, competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QC-RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that Ad21 could effectively reduce DU 145 and erbB-2-positive primary prostate tumor contamination in bone marrow cultures. Delivery of Ad21 had no effect on the ability of progenitor cells to form colonies. These results suggest that an anti-erbB-2 sFv-encoding adenoviral vector is efficacious for removal of erbB-2-positive prostate carcinoma cells from human bone marrow, and demonstrates a novel method for ex vivo genetic purge of malignant cells from bone marrow for autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) therapy.","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",['1RO1CA725332-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Assessment of the role of cigarette smoking in the etiology of childhood cancer has focused primarily on the effect of maternal smoking. Similar studies in relation to paternal smoking, however, have been inconclusive. Few studies have evaluated the effect of paternal smoking in the preconception period, and most of these could not disentangle the effects of paternal from maternal smoking. PURPOSE: We investigated the relationship of paternal smoking, particularly in the preconception period, with childhood cancer among offspring of the nonsmoking mothers. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, case-control study in Shanghai, People's Republic of China, where the prevalence of smoking is high among men but extremely low among women. The study included 642 childhood cancer case patients (<15 years of age) and their individually matched control subjects. Information concerning parental smoking, alcohol drinking, and other exposures of the index child was obtained by direct interview of both parents of the study subjects. Odds ratios (ORs), derived from conditional logistic regression models, were used to measure the association between paternal smoking and risk of childhood cancers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Paternal preconception smoking was related to a significantly elevated risk of childhood cancers, particularly acute leukemia and lymphoma. The risks rose with increasing pack-years of paternal preconception smoking for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (P for trend = .01), lymphoma (P for trend = .07), and total cancer (P for trend = .006). Compared with children whose fathers had never smoked cigarettes, children whose fathers smoked more than five pack-years prior to their conception had adjusted ORs of 3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-12.3) for ALL, 4.5 (95% CI = 1.2-16.8) for lymphoma, 2.7 (95% CI = 0.8-9.9) for brain tumors, and 1.7 (95% CI = 1.2-2.5) for all cancers combined. Statistically significant increased risks of cancer were restricted to children under the age of 5 years at diagnosis or those whose fathers had smoked during all of the 5 years prior to conception. IMPLICATIONS: Further studies are needed to confirm the association of paternal smoking with increased risk of cancer in offspring, to clarify the pattern of risks in relation to the timing of cigarette smoking, and to elucidate the biologic mechanism involved in predisposing the offspring to cancer. For example, it may be that paternal smoking induces prezygotic genetic damage that, in turn, acts as the predisposing factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As proteins often undergo glycosylation and alter their molecular nature, it is expected that the heterogeneity in kidney dysfunction can be explained at least partly by the differential affinity to the kidneys of BJP dependent on its glycosylation. Accordingly, we analyzed the structures of carbohydrates of urine BJP biochemically to correlate the structure with kidney function. BJP was obtained from 16 patients with myeloma, 2 patients with light chain amyloidosis, a patient with plasma cell leukemia, and a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. All BJP had five forms of oligosaccharides: three forms of biantennary oligosaccharides and two forms of triantennaries. The three biantennaries correspond to previously reported oligosaccharides on only lambda-type BJP, whereas the triantennaries are novel oligosaccharides found on BJP.

The recombinant DNA methyltransferase copurified with inhibitory RNA which was removed by treatment with ribonuclease A. Like its non-recombinant counterpart, the recombinant enzyme is activated by hemi-methylation. A direct steady-state kinetic comparison between the recombinant baculovirus-expressed enzyme with its MEL cell-derived counterpart is presented.","['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)']",['GM-46333/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Concentrations of up to 100 microM doxorubicin achieved similar cytotoxic effects in cultures of MOLT-4 cells, but acted via different mechanisms. Doxorubicin induced apoptosis (maximum effect at 1 microM), which was dependent on RNA synthesis and involved oxidative stress. Concentrations higher than 3 microM did not induce apoptosis, but significantly inhibited RNA synthesis. DNA strand breaks in MOLT-4 cells occurred in the presence of 1 to 5 microM doxorubicin to a similar extent, but showed a dose-dependence at higher concentrations. There was no GC/MS-detectable oxidation of DNA bases in apoptotic cells and only 1 out of 13 DNA base oxidation products, 8-hydroxyguanine, increased significantly in the presence of as much as 100 microM doxorubicin.

Thus, RTs must be able to accommodate both RNA and DNA in the primer strand. To test whether the natural primer confers some advantages to the priming process, we compared initiation of reverse transcription of avian and murine retroviral RNAs, using either their natural tRNA primer, tRNATrp and tRNAPro, respectively, or synthetic 18mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) and oligoribonucleotides (ORNs) complementary to their PBS. In both retroviral systems, the initial extension of ODNs was fast and processive. The initial extension of ORNs, tRNATrp and tRNAPro was much slower and distributive, giving rise to the transient accumulation of short pausing products. Synthesis of (-) strong-stop DNA was delayed when using ORNs and tRNAs, compared to ODNs. Even though ORNs and tRNAs were initially extended at the same rate, the short pausing products were more rapidly extended when using the tRNA primers. As a consequence, synthesis of (-) strong-stop DNA was much more efficient with tRNA primers, compared to ORNs. Taken together, these results suggest that the tRNA-primed synthesis of (-) strong-stop DNA is a two-step process, as already observed for HIV-1. The initiation mode corresponds to the initial non-processive nucleotide addition and extension of the short pausing products. It is more efficient with the natural primers than with ORNs. Initiation is followed by a more processive and unspecific elongation mode. Elongation is observed when the primer strand is DNA, i.e. when using the ODNs as primers or when the ORN and tRNA primers have been extended by a sufficient number (depending on the retroviral system) of deoxyribonucleotides.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Pro)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Trp)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,PMC146480,,,,

To map the site on CRP recognized by the CRP receptor (CRP-R), synthetic peptides corresponding to the surface region on each of the five identical subunits were tested as competitors vs. [125I]-CRP for cell binding. A peptide of residues 27-38 (TKPLKAFTVCLH) efficiently inhibited CRP binding when compared to other nonoverlapping peptides. This peptide was termed the cell-binding peptide (CB-Pep). The F(ab')2 of an IgG Ab to the CB-Pep specifically inhibited CRP binding upon reacting with the ligand. Competitive binding studies with synthetic peptides truncated from either the NH2- or COOH-terminus of the CB-Pep revealed that the minimum length recognized by the CRP-R consisted of residues 31-36: KAFTVC. Conservative substitutions of residues within the CB-Pep indicated that the four residues AFTV were critical for CRP-R binding. The CB-Pep also inhibited induced superoxide generation by HL-60 granulocytes. The minimum length required for the inhibition was also KAFTVC; however, only Phe-33 and Leu-37 were critical residues in this assay.

Chemotherapy appears to be least successful in the rare, low and very high mitotic index diseases, which often have an enormous tumour-burden. The suitability of chemotherapy in minimal residual leukaemia is also of some doubt. In these situations a 'conservative' treatment may be more appropriate. Because interferon-alpha has a distinct mechanism of action, and a broad-spectrum haematopoietic inhibitory activity, it is relatively nontoxic and noncancerogenic, and it may have a role in the treatment of malignant haematological disorders, either as a mono- or combination therapy. The exact indications and dosages for interferon in childhood malignancies are far from clear. Up to now, it has proved to be most efficacious in small tumour masses, providing a theoretical basis for application in minimal residual disease. Controlled clinical data, however, are not yet available. It remains to be determined whether or not interferon can be added to current chemotherapy protocols without a significant reduction of dose. Hopefully, a deeper understanding of the activities of interferon will allow us to plan better trials with combination treatments.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,PMC2398678,,,,

Adhesion is increased when fibroblast monolayers are exposed to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) alone and in combination with interferon-gamma (IFN) or interleukin-4 (IL-4). The combination of TNF and IFN caused enhanced AML cell adhesion to treated BMFs, from a mean of 25.0 +/- 4.1% to 36.3 +/- 5.4% (p = 0.0007). Enhanced binding was partially a result of upregulated vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression on BMFs. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was also upregulated, but did not appear to play a role in the increased binding to cytokine-stimulated BMFs. In contrast to observed adhesion to resting BMFs, AML cells binding to TNF/IFN-stimulated BMFs rely more heavily on the VLA-4 alpha chain (CD49d). In some cases, alpha4 integrin chain antibody was more effective than beta1 antibody in blocking binding, suggesting that a non-beta1 alpha4 integrin, possibly alpha4 beta7, on AML cells may act as a stromal ligand. The addition of alpha4 antibody to beta1 and beta2 antibodies significantly increased the inhibition of AML cells to stimulated BMFs. The myeloid cytokines granulocyte colony stimulating factor, granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor, interleukin-3 and stem cell factor enhanced the adhesion of AML blast cells to BMFs in some cases. The phorbol ester PMA, however, consistently upregulated AML cell-binding to BMFs, the increase being mediated entirely via beta1 and beta2 integrins without altering AML cell integrin expression. Binding of AML cells to marrow stroma can be enhanced by influences on leukemic cell or stroma. Enhanced binding under these conditions occurs via different pathways, illustrating the heterogeneity of mechanisms underlying leukemic cell retention within the bone marrow stroma.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (integrin beta7)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiographs and available scintigrams of 87 patients with osteosarcoma who received high-dose methotrexate were reviewed retrospectively for severe osteopenia, dense zones of provisional calcification, insufficiency fractures, and involvement of multiple bones. At least three of these radiographic abnormalities were required for the diagnosis of osteopathy. Patients with bone metastases were excluded. RESULTS: Eight patients (cumulative dose, 60-144 g/m2) exhibited adverse skeletal findings similar to those described in children with leukemia who received low-dose maintenance methotrexate. Images showed severe osteopenia (n = 8), dense zones of provisional calcification (n = 8), multiple bone involvement (n = 6), and insufficiency fractures (n = 6). Most commonly affected sites were the distal tibia (n = 7), distal radius and proximal humerus (n = 3), and calcaneus and public ramus (n = 2). The affected patients were significantly younger (mean age, 9.2 years; P < .001) than the 79 unaffected patients (mean age, 14.9 years).

IL-2-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and purified NK cells were exposed to anti-human (h)PRL antiserum, and residual LAK activity was measured on day 7 against the promyelocytic leukaemia cell line HL-60.

Up-modulation of a 32S-methionine-labelled 27,000 MW protein was detected in the lysates and supernatants of IL-2-stimulated PBMC immunoprecipitated with an anti-PRL antiserum. By contrast, the cytoplasmic PRL immunoreactivity observed in freshly isolated NK cells and in IL-2-stimulated, but not unstimulated, NK cell cultures was not associated with PRL gene activation, and can thus be referred to internalized PRL. Preferential re-uptake of externally derived PRL by IL-2-stimulated NK cells was also indicated by up-modulation of the PRL receptor.

Although LP-BM5 MuLV infection in C57BL/6 mice leads to a stage of immunodeficiency characterized by severe compromise of cell-mediated immunity, the mice with established MAIDS infected with LP-BM5 8 weeks previously, showed resistance to an intraperitoneal infection with Listeria monocytogenes. These MAIDS mice also showed resistance to a lethal dose of secondary listerial challenge, while the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to heat-killed Listeria (HKL.) was severely impaired in MAIDS mice. The resistance of MAIDS mice to listerial infection was mediated by CD4+ alpha beta T cells but neither by gamma delta T cells nor natural killer (NK) cells. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were produced by CD4+ T cells from Listeria-infected MAIDS mice in response to the in vitro stimulation with HKL, whereas IFN-gamma but not IL-10 were produced by those from Listeria-infected control mice.

In this study we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell repertoire in a population of CLL patients (n = 19) and age-matched controls (n = 22). The TCR repertoire analysis was performed using a multiplex PCR assay for CDR3 length, an approach that allows for the detection of underlying oligoclonality in complex T cell populations. We established that oligoclonality was substantially more frequent in both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations of CLL patients than in the age-matched controls (p < 0.001). Using three-color FACS analysis with a panel of TCRV segment-specific mAbs, we also established that oligoclonal expansions are predominantly found in the CD57+ subset of both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations.

An elevated frequency of CD4+CD57+ T cells was correlated with more advanced disease. Similarly, the most extreme oligoclonal expansions of CD4+CD57+ T cells occurred in CLL patients who had progressed beyond Rai stage 0.

On the basis of our combined Southern blot and PCR analyses, we also identified the prominent deltaRec-Jalpha58 rearrangement and three other preferential deltaRec rearrangements. The latter rearrangements concern deltaRec rearrangements to the Ddelta3, Jdelta1, and Jdelta3 gene segments. These deltaRec rearrangements do not delete the complete TCR-delta locus and are homologous to Vdelta-Jdelta rearrangements, because the majority of their junctional regions contain Ddelta gene segments. In contrast, the prominent deltaRec-psi(J)alpha and deltaRec-Jalpha58 rearrangements, representing approximately 68 and approximately 23% of all deltaRec rearrangements, respectively, are homologous to Valpha-Jalpha rearrangements, because Ddelta gene segments are absent in their junctional regions. Additional PCR analysis of Vdelta-psi(J)alpha and Vdelta-Jalpha58 coding and signal joints revealed also that these rearrangements resemble Valpha-Jalpha rearrangements, except for Vdelta2-psi(J)alpha and Vdelta2-Jalpha58 rearrangements, which resemble Vdelta-Jdelta rearrangements. Our data show that virtually all TCR-delta-deleting rearrangements are Valpha-like, and the high frequency of these rearrangements in the human thymus suggests that most thymocytes use these rearrangements to further differentiate into the TCR-alphabeta lineage. Based on the very low frequency of deltaRec and psi(J)alpha rearrangements in 4% of the T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (n = 151) and 6% of the T cell lines (n = 26), we hypothesize that rearranged TCR-delta-deleting elements exist for only an extremely short period during thymocyte differentiation, probably due to rapid subsequent Valpha-Jalpha rearrangements.","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report on the genomic organization of the human CD6 gene, its chromosomal localization, and the characterization of novel isoforms. Human CD6 is encoded by at least 13 exons. The amino terminal signal sequence, extracellular region, and transmembrane domain are encoded by seven exons, while the cytoplasmic domain of CD6 is encoded by six exons. Each of the three extracellular scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains is encoded by a separate exon. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies and screening of a chromosome-specific YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) library revealed that the gene encoding CD6 is located on chromosome 11 at 11q13 in close proximity to the gene encoding the related molecule CD5 and within 600 kb of CD20. Analysis of mRNA transcripts encoding CD6 isolated from mitogen-activated PBMC and from B cells obtained from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia revealed the presence of at least five different CD6 transcripts.

The mechanism underlying GC-induced apoptosis particularly in leukemia cells is, however, not well understood. Most forms of apoptosis seem to employ a common final effector pathway characterized by specific proteolytic events mediated by interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) and/or other ICE-like cysteine proteases. These events may result in the morphologic changes characteristic of apoptosis. To determine whether a similar proteolytic pathway is activated during GC-induced leukemia cell apoptosis, we investigated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a typical target of ICE-like proteases, during GC-induced apoptosis of the human acute T-cell leukemic cell line CEM-C7H2. Our studies showed proteolytic PARP cleavage suggestive of activation of ICE-like proteases that preceeded morphologic signs of apoptosis. We further established stably transfected CEM-C7H2 sublines expressing the cowpox virus protein CrmA that inhibits some, but not all, ICE-like proteases. GC-induced PARP cleavage and apoptosis were neither inhibited nor delayed in crmA-expressing cell lines. In contrast, crmA expression rendered the same lines resistant to Apo1/Fas-induced PARP cleavage and apoptosis. Thus, different proteases might be activated during the effector phases of GC-and Apo1/Fas-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells.","['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Transgene expression in brain was assessed using beta-galactosidase histochemistry and compared to the distribution of endogenous VIP expression. Transgene expression was observed in most central and peripheral nervous system sites in which endogenous VIP is expressed. We investigated whether the VIP-beta-galactosidase transgene was regulated in sympathetic neurons in experimental paradigms in which VIP regulation is dependent on the release of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). After dissociation in vitro and postganglionic axotomy in vivo there were parallel increases in endogenous VIP and transgene expression in superior cervical ganglia.

We explored possible reasons for this variability and found that the initial cell density of the experimental culture and the stage of growth of the cells used to inoculate experimental cultures were critical parameters for obtaining reproducible growth and differentiation responses of NB4 cells. Thus, the time to reach 50% differentiation in the presence of 1 microM RA and various initial concentrations of cells was 1.9 days with 2 x 10(6) cells/ml, 3.5 days with 2 x 10(5) cells/ml, and 4.7 days with 2 x 10(4) cells/ml. With an initial concentration of 2 x 10(5) cells/ml we saw time- and dose-dependent differentiation with RA concentrations >250 nM. However, in the presence of 25-250 nM RA, differentiation reached a maximum of about 20% on either Day 1 or Day 2 and then declined with time. The catabolism of RA appeared to be responsible for the decline in differentiation. In addition, large decreases in viability occurred after NB4 cultures, growing without or with RA, reached a density of only 1 x 10(6) cells/ml. The decreases in viability were greater at intermediate concentrations of RA with a nadir at about 100 nM. Loss of viability was associated with DNA fragmentation and changes in morphology typical of apoptosis and necrosis. The loss of viability occurring in control cultures necessitates caution when these cultures are used to seed experimental cultures.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The transcriptional initiation site was identified by RNase protection and primer extension assay.

A 38-bp poly(CA) sequence was located 992 bp upstream from the initiation site.

The contribution of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (G-Px) and glutathione were evaluated. Sensitivity to 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AMT), inhibitor of catalase, was higher in LY-R (hydrogen peroxide sensitive) than in LY-S (hydrogen peroxide resistant) cells. Accordingly, activity of catalase was twofold lower in LY-R than in LY-S cells. G-Px activity was about two times higher in LY-R than in LY-S cells. After induction with selenium it increased 15.6 times in LY-R cells and 50.3 times in LY-S cells. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content (and possibly other monobromobimane-reactive thiols) were determined fluorimetrically with monobromobimane and fluorescence found 54% higher in LY-S than in LY-R cells. Inhibition of catalase caused GSH decrease in LY-S cells; this decrease was abrogated by inducing G-Px by selenium treatment. On the contrary, in LY-R cells inhibition of catalase decreased GSH content only slightly and selenium treatment did not further change the GSH level. DNA damage (estimated by ""comet"" assay) was the same in hydrogen peroxide-treated cells in the presence or absence of AMT; however, after induction of G-Px by selenium, DNA damage was considerably lowered. This sparing effect of selenium was accompanied by decreased growth inhibition in selenium pretreated, hydrogen peroxide-treated cell cultures.","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radicals)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)', 'ZF80H5GXUF (Amitrole)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Inherited forms are classical but recent observations of acquired porokeratosis have been reported in immunocompromized patients (AIDS, immune disorders, immune suppressive drugs or organ transplantation). Two cases of DSP have been reported after allogeneic BMT in patients treated for chronic GVHD. Our case is the first one after autologous BMT, in a black man, on no immunosuppressive drug at the time of diagnosis of DSP. Hematopoietic and immune reconstitution was apparently complete. The cancer-prone character of porokeratosis could be favored by total body irradiation used in conditioning regimen.

A total of 40 patients were transplanted over 6 years. No procedure-related deaths and no permanent organ toxicities were seen. The use of BSC brought about a great reduction in the duration of hospital stay, septic complications and transfusion of blood components. For patients with lymphoma (n = 20) the probabilities of progression-free survival and of overall survival at 2 years are 48% (95% C.I. 28-68%) and 68% (95% C.I. 46-84%), respectively.

However, recent improvements in chemoradiotherapy schedules have reduced the benefits of BMT in terms of overall survival, particularly in children with a long first remission, and a more sensible approach would be to advocate UD BMT in early relapsing aggressive disease, prospectively compare UD BMT to chemotherapy in less aggressive disease, and not utilize UD BMT for low-risk disease.

In this study, we asked whether antisense RNA targeted against the same site would also be efficacious. BLV-infected bat lung cells were transfected with an antisense RNA-encoding plasmid under the control of sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter, and stable cell lines were selected. No inhibition of viral p24 expression was demonstrated in seven cell lines transfected with the antisense RNA targeted at the same site as the ribozyme or in three cell lines transfected with an antisense sequence targeted against the tax 5' initiation codon. Although in previous experiments antisense DNA oligonucleotides inhibited Tax expression in vitro, stably transfected plasmids encoding antisense RNA of the same sequence did not inhibit viral expression in BLV-infected cells in this study.

Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha gene (C/EBP alpha) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebp alpha -/- mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']","['CA59589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL56745/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056745/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA041456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC19554,,,,

These diverse activities have been exclusively attributed to the plasma membrane receptor-binding, 17-kDa C-terminal component (mature IL-1 alpha) that results from proteolytic processing of the 31- to 33-kDa precursor protein. No biologic function has been ascribed to the unusually large, 16-kDa N-terminal propiece formed as a result of proteolytic processing of IL-1 alpha. We report that the IL-1 alpha N-terminal propiece is concentrated by means of a nuclear localization sequence within the nuclei of both transfected and leukemic cell lines. Overexpression of this component in glomerular mesangial cells, a model perivascular myofibroblast cell type capable of IL-1 alpha synthesis and processing, results in malignant transformation to a spindle cell-type tumor. The functionally bipartite nature of the IL-1 alpha precursor represents a unique combination of the C-terminal, classical cytokine and an N-terminal nuclear oncoprotein.

Since CD95 ligand (CD95L) is expressed on interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated T cells, we investigated the involvement of CD95-CD95L pathway in T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against AML cells. Activated CD8+ T cells could efficiently kill a parental CD95-sensitive AML cell line, MML-1 and, to a lesser extent, a CD95-resistant clone, MML-1R. Neither MML-1 nor MML-1R cells were killed by activated CD4+ T cells. The blocking monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against CD95, ZB4, caused a significant inhibition of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against MML-1 cells but not against MML-1R cells. Interestingly, MML-1 cells underwent the classic nuclear morphologic changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis when cultured with activated T cells. Enumeration of apoptotic and necrotic nuclei showed that both apoptosis and necrosis were induced in MML-1 cells, whereas necrosis was exclusively observed in MML-1R cells. Apoptosis of MML-1 cells was completely blocked in the presence of ZB4 MoAb. Similarly, blocking by ZB4 MoAb significantly inhibited T-cell-mediated lysis of fresh AML cells in a CD95-sensitive group, but not in a CD95-refractory group. In addition CD8+ T cells expressed CD95L mRNA more abundantly than CD4+ T cells upon activation by IL-2. These findings suggest that T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against AML cells requires participation of CD95-CD95L pathway for cytotoxic signal transduction leading to target apoptosis.","['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We report a patient with a white blood cell count of 17.6 x 10(9)/l with 74% eosinophils, normal platelet count and haemoglobin.

Chromosome analysis of a bone marrow aspirate disclosed a trisomy 15 together with loss of the Y chromosome. Moreover, FISH analysis on May-Grunwald-Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears demonstrated trisomy 15 in the eosinophils. 3 months after initial diagnosis the patient went into blast crisis and died. The blast cells exhibited trisomy 15 and loss of the Y chromosome in a complex, aberrant karyotype.

Immunological abnormalities were monitored with respect to the surface phenotype identified by two-color staining for CD3 and IL-2 receptor beta-chain. All mice infected with the virus alone developed MAIDS and died by 14 wks after infection. The immunopathogenesis was estimated to be an abnormal expansion of intermediate CD3 cells (i.e., extrathymic T cells) as well as other types of lymphocytes. SNMC did not change the total mortality rate. However, some mice that began the treatment on day 0 or 4 wks after infection survived 3 wks longer. Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in such mice were suppressed. These mice showed normal phenotypic features and normal responses to Con A. These results suggest that SNMC is effective in some MAIDS mice in preventing the progression of disease. When lymphocytes isolated from the liver, spleen and lymph nodes of diseased mice were cultured in vitro, they showed a spontaneous proliferation. Interestingly, such proliferation was inhibited by addition of liver lymphocytes, but not splenic lymphocytes, obtained from normal or SNMC-treated mice. Since liver lymphocytes contains intermediate CD3 cells with autoreactivity, they may possibly suppress the progression of disease.","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '6FO62043WK (Glycyrrhizic Acid)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'P540XA09DR (Glycyrrhetinic Acid)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The endogenous production of cytokines by the JMML cells contributes to their growth and therapeutic resistance. Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and IL-13 inhibit cytokine production in monocytes. We have now studied whether these cytokines can inhibit JMML cell cytokine production, thereby potentially reducing the malignant cell load in this disorder. We found that IL-10, but not IL-4 or IL-13, dose dependently inhibited JMML cell production of the hemopoietic growth factors granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-1beta. Similarly, IL-10, but not IL-4 or IL-13, suppressed JMML colony formation and cell viability. This was not due to the absence of receptors because we could detect mRNAs for the IL-4 and the IL-13 receptor alpha subunits and the IL-2 common gamma subunit in JMML cells. Furthermore, the receptors were active since both IL-4 and IL-13 up-regulated surface expression of MHC class II and down-regulated CD14 antigens on JMML cells and monocytes. Unlike activated monocytes, the JMML cells did not produce IL-10. It is suggested that the loss of cytokine inhibitory effects of IL-4 and IL-13 could play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. On the other hand, the inhibition of cytokine production, growth, and viability of JMML cells by IL-10 suggests that this cytokine may have a therapeutic potential in JMML.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL13RA1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha1 Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-13)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,

An original dot-blot technique was developed to study the activation of complement by either bacteria or purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both O-specific and lipid A segments of LPS were found to play a role in the triggering of the oxidative response. Lipid A was responsible for bacterial C3-derived opsonization by inducing an antibody-independent activation of complement classical pathway, whereas O-specific polysaccharide chains (O-Ag) were involved in cellular activation. Inhibition experiments using anti-cell surface marker monoclonal antibodies showed the involvement of the alpha chain of CR3 (CD11b) in the oxidative response developed by differentiated U937 cells in response to S. typhimurium infection.

Bacterial or fungal pneumonia occurring during the initial period of neutropenia, and interstitial pneumonia (related to cytomegalovirus or of unknown origin) are the major respiratory complications of the first 100 days. Bacterial sinusitis and pulmonary infections, and obstructive airways disease related to bronchiolitis are the main late-onset respiratory disorders. No single risk factor can predict the development of these complications, which result from a sequence of events including infections, pulmonary injuries related to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and inappropriate immunological reaction after transplantation. Antimicrobial prevention has been shown to reduce the mortality of these complications, but they still result in both important morbidity and mortality.

We investigated whether there is a relation between the outcome of treatment and submicroscopic evidence of residual disease. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of patients during a first clinical remission using a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay capable of detecting 1 viable leukemia cell among 200,000 normal marrow mononuclear cells and a clonogenic blast-colony assay. Bone marrow specimens from 24 children were sequentially evaluated during a five-year period, and the results were compared with the clinical outcome. RESULTS: Seven patients relapsed and 17 remained in remission 2 to 35 months after the completion of treatment. The levels of residual leukemia-cell DNA in the two groups were significantly different (P<0.001; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference in the mean log-transformed ratio of leukemia-cell DNA to normal bone marrow-cell DNA, 0.38 to 1.28). Autoregression analyses identified trends for individual patients that were associated with relapse. Despite continued remission in 17 patients, evidence of residual leukemia was detected by PCR in 15 and by both PCR and blast-colony assays in 7. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular signs of residual leukemia can persist up to 35 months after the cessation of chemotherapy in children with ALL in remission. This suggests that eradication of all leukemia cells may not be a prerequisite for cure.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']","['CA01546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1997 Jan 30;336(5):367-9.

At first, the effect of the drugs on PKC activity of intact and activated lymphocytes was studied in vivo. In 48 hours after intraperitoneal injection of mice with therapeutic doses of the drugs, PKC activity of intact lymphocytes was differentially affected. Cisplatin did not practically alter the enzyme activity, whereas cycloplatam inhibited the PKC activity by 37% versus control. In lymphocytes activated by mouse P-388 leukemia cells in vivo, the drugs caused almost complete suppression of PKC activity and Ca(2+)-dependent binding of the enzyme to the membranes. The drugs were effective in intact cells. After incubation of intact lymphocytes in vitro for 24 hours with cisplatin or cycloplatam (10(-5)M), PKC activity was increased 1.62- and 1.35-fold, respectively, versus control. Ca(2+)-dependent binding of the enzyme to the membranes was also increased 1.61- and 1.36-fold by cisplatin and cycloplatam, respectively.

Furthermore, cycloplatam, unlike cisplatin, reduced the PKC binding to cellular membranes by 31%. The mechanisms of the drugs effects on PKC activity are suggested.

Compared to serological tests the PCR was definitely found to be a more sensitive method, yielding the highest number of positive results (10% more compared to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, (ELISA), and 17.7% more compared to agar-gel immunodiffusion, (AGID)). In testing cattle from herds with BLV incidence under 5%, out of 52 provirus positive cattle only 43 were correctly identified by ELISA. When compared to AGID only 37 of the 52 PCR positive animals were correctly identified. Of 18 cattle imported from the Slovak Republic and kept in a quarantine stable, four were found to be BLV provirus positive by PCR, while serological tests indicated one animal positive and three negative. Therefore, it is impossible to prevent the spread of the infection from one country to another by serological testing only. Moreover, it is feasible to identify animals with changing antibody titres correctly by PCR. Using PCR we were also able to distinguish BLV infected from uninfected calves that were serologically positive due to colostral antibodies. Higher sensitivity of BLV provirus detection by PCR was achieved using env gene rather than tax gene specific primers. Negative results by PCR in cases of positive serological reactions are still possible, as shown in case of one adult animal. These findings indicate that PCR is a highly sensitive method and might be successfully used and economically advantageous for different practical applications in detection of BLV infection in naturally infected cattle.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,

(2) There exists severe air pollution throughout the island. (3) Industry is the major source of pollution. (4) No demarcation exists between plants and residential quarters. (5) There is a high concentration of pollutants indoors/outdoors. The influence of air pollution spreads over all aspects of physical health, primarily on the respiratory tract, causing lung cancer and exaggerating cardiovascular diseases. A few Taiwanese studies are reviewed below which deserve more elaboration. (1) Use PM10 for indexing health effect. The annual average value of PM10 in Taiwan has been around 70 micrograms/m3 in 1994. Dr. Schwarz indicated that no safety margin could be derived; for each additional 10 micrograms/ m3 of PM10, the death number could be increased by 1% on the basis of Western studies. (2) Research with reference to lung cancer cases in the Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital. Living within 3 km of industrial district counted for 9% of cases and caused a 6-fold increase in the risk of disease for people living more than 20 years in the case control study for lung cancer. (3) Death due to cancer of inhabitants close to petroleum and petrochemical industries. For youths and children below 20 years, cancers related to brain tumors were 2-4 fold of what was expected deaths. Analysis of another petrochemical complex in Chienchen, Kaohsiung, revealed the inhabitants within 1 km showed a higher standardized mortality ratio for cancers of the lung, kidney, urinary bladder, and leukemia than was to be expected. (4) Lower lung function and higher incidence of respiratory diseases among residents near a coal-fired power plant (within 3 Km) compared to residents who lived further away from the plant (3-11 Km). (5) Lead contamination around a kindergarten near a battery recycling plant. There was increased lead absorption among children of the exposed kindergarten and its this was associated with the extent of air and soil pollution in the surrounding area. In considering above limited epidemiologic evidence, the following recommendations are presented: (1) to conduct investigation promptly for the correlation of air pollution to disease morbidity and death of inhabitants of Taiwan. (2) to reevaluate ambient air quality standards on the basis of Taiwanese health studies. (3) to assess the analytical data of past records on the concentrations of air pollutants. (4) collection of surcharge fee for air pollution. (5) Regulation for compensation of pollution victims among industry. (6) development of environmental health related industries. (7) Participation of various parties who are concerned the environmental health. One thing is certain, everyong would be able to breath air which, as far as possible, is clean.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A role for LIF in embryonic development is suggested by: i) its ability to stimulate the proliferation of embryonic stem (ES) cells in vitro, while maintaining their totipotency and ii) by both its maternal and embryonic expression at the time of blastocyst implantation. Functional studies of LIF and its receptor during mouse embryogenesis have been performed using the techniques of targeted gene replacement and transgene expression in ES cells to produce transgenic mice bearing either loss- or gain-of-function mutations for LIF activity. Whereas, the phenotype observed in the LIF gain-of-function mutant mice supports a role for LIF in early embryogenesis, the loss-of-function phenotypes point to more specialized functions for LIF in development and further reveal the redundant feature of the LIF cytokine/receptor family.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), agents resistant to deamination by ADA, have been utilized in the past decade. All of these drugs act as competitors for deoxyadenosine triphosphate at the A sites of the elongating DNA strand, terminating DNA synthesis. However, their remarkable efficacy in indolent lymphoid malignancies is not well explained by this mechanism of action. The induction of apoptosis and resultant cytotoxicity may be important in their activity. As a single agent, fludarabine has been associated with overall remission rates as high as 55% in previously treated patients and 79% in previously untreated patients. With this agent, a dosage regimen of 25-30 mg/m2 daily over 5 days seems to be the most effective to date. Fludarabine has shown more favorable remission rates than the traditional salvage regimens incorporating anthracyclines and alkylating agents. Regimens combining fludarabine with mitoxantrone and with doxorubicin have shown minimal therapeutic advantage in CLL, while combination with cyclophosphamide appears promising. Remission rates with deoxycoformycin have been lower than with fludarabine, but studies have been small in patient numbers. The agent 2-CdA, first successful in hairy-cell leukemia, has shown overall response rates in chronic lymphocytic leukemia similar to those seen with fludarabine. Whether or not cross-resistance occurs among the purine analogs has not been fully determined, but occasional patients with disease refractory to fludarabine have responded to 2-CdA. Cumulative myelosuppression and immunosuppression may be experienced however. In the B-cell neoplastic entity, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, fludarabine therapy in patients previously treated with alkylating agents and/or steroids produced a 36% response rate. Only two previously untreated patients received fludarabine, and both responded. A similar response rate of 40% was seen when 2-CdA was administered to previously treated patients. This response rate increased to 85% in a study of 26 previously untreated patients, making this one of the most effective drugs yet investigated in this condition.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor/human thioredoxin (ADF) is induced by oxidative stresses and has protective activity against oxidative cellular injury. To evaluate the possible involvement of ADF in the tissue-protective effect of PGE1, we analyzed ADF expression immunohistochemically using a rat transient retinal ischemia model. Rats were treated orally with 300 micrograms/kg/day OP-1206 alpha-cyclodextrin clathrate (OP-1206), a stable PGE1 analogue, for 14 days after photodynamic retinal vascular thrombosis by rose Bengal. Rats without any OP-1206 treatment were used as controls. In the OP-1206-treated rats, minimal retinal atrophy due to ischemia/reperfusion was observed histologically up to 14 days, whereas in the non-treated rats the inner layer of the retina became markedly atrophic. In parallel with the histological change, after 14 days following thrombosis ADF immunoreactivity was preserved on retinal pigment epithelial cells in the OP-1206-treated rats, whereas it was diminished in the non-treated rats.

However, at present, the mechanisms through which 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 expresses its biological activities are still not completely understood. Our previous in vitro study in a perfused rat kidney indicated for the first time that 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 and 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 are metabolized differently. 1alpha,25(OH)2-24-oxo-16-ene-D3, an intermediary metabolite of 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 formed through the C-24 oxidation pathway, accumulated significantly in the perfusate when compared to 1alpha,25(OH)2-24-oxo-D3, the corresponding intermediary metabolite of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. In a subsequent in vivo study, we also reported that 1alpha,25(OH)2-24-oxo-16-ene-D3 exerted immunosuppressive activity equal to its parent, without causing significant hypercalcemia. In order to establish further the critical role of 1alpha,25(OH)2-24-oxo-16-ene-D3, in generating some of the key biological activities ascribed to its parent, we performed the present in vitro study using a human myeloid leukemic cell line (RWLeu-4) as a model. Comparative target tissue metabolism studies indicated that 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 and 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 are metabolized differently in RWLeu-4 cells, and the differences were similar to the ones we previously observed in the rat kidney. The significant finding was the accumulation of 1alpha,25(OH)2-24-oxo-16-ene-D3 in RWLeu-4 cells because of its resistance to further metabolism. Biological activity studies indicated that both 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 and its 24-oxo metabolite produced growth inhibition and promoted differentiation of RWLeu-4 cells to the same extent, and these activities were several fold higher than those exerted by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. In addition, the genomic action of each vitamin D compound was assessed in a rat osteosarcoma cell line (ROS 17/2.8) by measuring its ability to transactivate a gene construct containing the vitamin D response element of the osteocalcin gene linked to the growth hormone reporter gene. In these studies, both 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 and its 24-oxo metabolite exerted similar but potent transactivation activity which was several fold greater than that exerted by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 itself. In summary, our results indicate that the production and slow clearance of the bioactive intermediary metabolite, 1alpha,25(OH)2-24-oxo-16-ene-D3, in RWLeu-4 cells contributes significantly to the final expression of the enhanced biological activities ascribed to its parent analog, 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3.","['0 (1,25-dihydroxy-24-oxo-16-ene-vitamin D3)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '124409-58-1 (1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-vitamin D3)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",['DK-39138/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we demonstrated that the human pre-osteoclastic cell line FLG 29.1 bears functional estrogen receptors. In this study we examined FLG 29.1 cells for the presence of cell surface binding sites for 17betaE2, and whether 17betaE2 could elicit cell signalling. Using a cell-impermeant and fluorescent estrogen conjugate, 17beta-estradiol-6-carboxymethyloxime-bovine serum albumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate, we demonstrated the presence of specific plasma membrane binding sites for 17betaE2.

In addition, both cAMP and cGMP were significantly increased by 17betaE2 with a dose-dependent response. Finally, a rapid increase of intracellular calcium ion concentration [Ca2+] was also induced by 1 nM 17betaE2, as measured in single cells using an image analysis system.

To gain insight into the mechanisms of BLV-induced lymphocytosis, we tested B cell survival capacity and cycling activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from lymphocytotic, asymptomatic and control sheep. Interestingly, B cells from lymphocytotic sheep presented a lower level of spontaneous apoptosis (29%) in ex vivo cultures compared to that obtained with infected asymptomatic (42%) and control (57%/o) sheep PBMCs. Virus capsid (CA) synthesis was mainly found among surviving B cells and the percentage of CA-producing B cells correlated with the extent of B cell survival, indicating that BLV replication in B lymphocytes may promote protection from cell death. B cell survival was not linked with increases in expression of Bcl-2 mRNA or membrane leukosialin (CD43), although both are documented to be involved in some aspects of the B cell life-span. Finally, cell cycle analyses in freshly isolated PBMCs from lymphocytotic sheep revealed a slightly increased proportion of B cells in S phase compared to controls. Altogether, these data suggest that both BLV-induced B cell proliferation and extended survival are involved in the lymphocytotic stage encountered in BLV infection in sheep.","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,

A frequent event in the generation of these malignant cells is deregulation of the hematopoietic-specific transcription factor PU.1 (Spi-1) by retroviral insertion of the spleen-focus-forming virus component of Friend virus. During chemically induced reinitiation of MEL cell terminal differentiation, expression of PU.1 is rapidly down-regulated, suggesting that PU.1 might interfere with processes required for terminal differentiation of erythroid precursors. To investigate the role of PU.1 in erythroid differentiation we transfected MEL cells with a PU.1 cDNA controlled by the eucaryotic translation elongation factor EF1 alpha promoter. Deregulated expression of PU.1 blocked chemically induced differentiation and terminal cell division. Deregulated expression of two other protooncogenes, c-myc and c-myb, also has been shown to block MEL differentiation. We present evidence that PU.1 inhibits terminal differentiation at an earlier step than c-Myc and c-Myb. Thus reinitiation of MEL cell terminal differentiation appears to be controlled by an ordered program of turning off several protooncogenes.

A transcriptionally activated version of Pbx1, E2a-Pbx1, is an oncoprotein in human pre-B cell leukemia that strongly suppresses differentiation and retains its ability to heterodimerize with Hox proteins. Because monomeric Hox proteins bind very similar DNA motifs, it is unclear how they activate diverse developmental programs. Here we demonstrate that heterodimers containing different Hox proteins and a common Pbx1 or E2a-Pbx1 partner bind different DNA motifs. Structural models suggest that the specificity of the Hox protein is altered by a conformation change involving residues in the N-terminal arm of the Hox homeodomain. Mutational analysis also supported the hypothesis that unique sequences in the N-terminal arm of the Hox homeodomain are at least partially responsible for mediating this specificity. In vivo, Hox proteins directed E2a-Pbx1-mediated transactivation with moderate specificity to cognate Hox-Pbx motifs. Thus, the development specificity of individual Hox proteins may be mediated, in part, by differential targeting of cellular genes by Pbx1-Hox complexes. Likewise, through its function as a common heterodimer partner, oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1 may be able to interfere with multiple programs of development that are induced by the sequential or simultaneous expression of Hox proteins during hematopoiesis.","['0 (C-8 protein, Rhynchosciara americana)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (HOXB8 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Salivary Proteins and Peptides)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']","['2 PO1 CA50528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We observed that in these leukemias, the steady state level of the protein truncated at the COOH terminus was remarkably higher than that of the protein truncated at the NH2-terminus or full length wild-type protein. To examine the rate of proteolysis of different forms of Myb in a uniform cellular background, the proteins were constitutively expressed in the myeloblast cell line M1, using the retrovirus vector LXSN. In pulse chase experiments, using metabolically 35S-labeled proteins, it was determined that COOH-terminal truncation of c-Myb by 248 aa (CT-c-Myb) substantially increases protein stability, resulting in a t1/2 of about 140 min, as compared to 50 min for full length c-Myb (FL-c-Myb). In an investigation of the mechanism involved in the in vivo degradation of this short lived transcription factor, inhibitors of the lysosomal (chloroquine), proteasomal (ALLM, ALLN, lactacystin) and calpains (EGTA, E-64d, BAPTA/AM) pathways were utilized. Results of this experiment identified the 26S proteasome as a major pathway responsible for rapid breakdown of the protein in hematopoietic cells. Further experiments carried out in vitro demonstrated that c-Myb can be ubiquitinated, suggesting that this process may be involved in the targeting of wild-type c-Myb to degradation by the 26S proteasome. In addition, it was demonstrated that CT-c-Myb was less efficiently ubiquitinated than wild-type protein indicating that defects in modification account for its escape from rapid turnover. We speculate that the increased half-life of c-Myb resulting from truncation could contribute to its transforming potential.","['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)']",,,,,,,,,,,

AFX consists of two exons and encodes for a protein of 501 amino acids. We found that normal B- and T-cells contain similar levels of AFX mRNA and that both the MLL/AFX as well as the AFX/MLL fusion transcripts are present in the cell line and the ANLL sample with a t(X;11)(q13;q23). The single intron of the AFX gene consists of 3706 nucleotides. It contains five simple sequence repeats with lengths of at least 12 bps, a chi-like octamer sequence (GCA/TGGA/TGG) and several immunoglobulin heptamer-like sequences (GATAGTG) that are distributed throughout the entire AFX intron sequence. In the KARPAS 45 cell line the breakpoints occur at nucleotides 2913/2914 of the AFX intron and at nucleotides 4900/4901 of the breakpoint cluster region of the MLL gene. The AFX protein belongs to the forkhead protein family. It is highly homologous to the human FKHR protein, the gene of which is disrupted by the t(2;13)(q35;q14), a chromosome rearrangement characteristic of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas. It is noteworthy that the t(X;11)(q13;q23) in the KARPAS 45 cell line and in one acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) disrupts the forkhead domain of the AFX protein exactly at the same amino acids as does the t(2;13)(q35;q14) in case of the FKHR protein. In addition, the 5'-part of the AFX protein contains a conserved hexapeptide motif (QIYEWM) that is homologous to the functionally important conserved hexapeptide QIYPWM upstream of the homeobox domain in Hox proteins. This motif mediates the co-operative DNA binding of Pbx family members and Hox proteins and, therefore, plays an important role in physiologic and oncogenic processes. In acute leukemias with a t(X;11)(q13;q23), this hexapeptide motif is separated from the remaining forkhead domain within the AFX protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of AFX differs significantly from the partial AFX protein sequence published previously (Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer, 1994, 11, 79-84). This discrepancy can be explained by the occurrence of two sequencing errors in the earlier work at nucleotide number 783 and 844 (loss of a cytosine residue or guanosine residue, respectively) that lead to two reading frame shifts.","['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXO4 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,"['GENBANK/T54418', 'GENBANK/T54462', 'GENBANK/X93996']",,,,,,,,,

Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been shown to be the cause of this neoplasm. Recently, however, the HTLV-1 genome has been found in some patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), which suggests a causal relation of HTLV-1 to CTCL. Thus, the relation between the HTLV-1 genome and CTCL, as well as the difference between ATLL and CTCL, have come into question. METHODS: The authors examined two patients with CTCL whose serum anti-HTLV-1 antibodies were constantly positive. The Southern blot technique, inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with four sets of primers for gag, pol, env, and pX regions of HTLV-1 were used to clarify the distinctions between ATLL and CTCL. RESULTS: Clinically, one patient presented with multiple subcutaneous nodules with involvements of the internal organ, and the other patient was typical for mycosis fungoides. No integration of HTLV-1 DNA was detected by IPCR or the Southern blot technique in either patient. PCRs with the four sets of primers were all found to be positive for HTLV-1 except one. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that ATLL should be differentiated from CTCL in view of the responsibility of HTLV-1 for promoting or maintaining CTCL.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)']",,['GENBANK/J02029'],,,,,,,,,

Further analysis of the phenotype revealed a broad cross-resistance to vinca alkaloids, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, aphidicolin and UV light. Low-level expression of mdr1 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as well as a modest impairment of cellular drug accumulation and partial reversion of resistance to DOX and VP-16 by cyclosporine, confirmed a moderate role of P-gp in conferring drug resistance in P388/SPR cells. Consistent changes in neither topo II expression or activity nor glutathione metabolism could be detected. Induction of apoptosis was significantly reduced in P388/SPR cells, as indicated by minimal DNA fragmentation. Analysis of oncogenes regulating apoptotic cell death revealed a marked decrease of bcl-2 in combination with a moderate reduction of bax protein, but a striking overexpression of the long form of the bcl-X protein.

Release studies indicate that these drug-loaded carriers are highly stable and even after dissipation of the residual pH gradient retain more than 85% of encapsulated mitoxantrone following dialysis at 37 degrees C for 5 days. In murine studies we have compared the plasma clearance and biodistribution of both mitoxantrone and liposomal lipid following intravenous administration of free drug or mitoxantrone encapsulated in either conventional or sterically stabilized liposomes. In contrast to the rapid blood clearance observed for free mitoxantrone, both liposomal systems provided extended circulation lifetimes, with over 90% of the drug present 1 h after administration and 15-30% remaining at 24 h. In agreement with previous reports, longer plasma half-lives were observed for sterically stabilized liposomes than for conventional systems. In addition, a strong correlation between drug and carrier biodistribution was seen, with uptake occurring mainly in the liver and spleen and paralleling plasma clearance. This would suggest that tissue disposition reflects that of drug-loaded liposomes rather than the individual components. Liposomal encapsulation also significantly reduced mitoxantrone toxicity, allowing administration of higher, more efficacious drug doses. In a murine L1210 tumour model, for example, no long-term survivors were seen in animal groups treated with free drug, whereas at the maximum therapeutic dose of liposomal mitoxantrone survival rates of 40% were observed.","['0 (Liposomes)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,PMC2063281,,,,

GLUT proteins, GLUT1 and GLUT3, were constitutively coexpressed in the parental cell line and also in the VCR-selected cell lines. Increased expression of the GLUT1 isoform was noted both in the PC-V40 (a non-P-glycoprotein, mrp-overexpressing subline) and in the more resistant PC-V160 (overexpressing mrp and mdr3) cell lines. Overexpression of GLUT3 was detected only in the PC-V160 subline. An increased rate of facilitative glucose transport (Vmax) and level of plasma membrane GLUT protein expression paralleled increased VCR resistance, active VCR efflux and decreased VCR steady-state accumulation in these cell lines. Glucose transport inhibitors (GTIs), cytochalasin B (CB) and phloretin blocked the active efflux and decreased steady-state accumulation of VCR in the PC-V40 subline. GTIs did not significantly affect VCR accumulation in the parental or PC-V160 cells. A comparison of protein sequences among GLUT1, GLUT3 and MRP revealed a putative cytochalasin B binding site in MRP, which displayed 44% sequence similarity/12% identity with that previously identified in GLUT1 and GLUT3; these regions also exhibited a similar hydropathy plot pattern. The findings suggested that CB bound to MRP and directly or indirectly lowered VCR efflux and/or CB bound to one or both GLUT proteins, which acted to lower the VCR efflux mediated by MRP.

Dysimmune and degenerative aetiologies have been postulated, but viral infections have not been associated with the disease. Two HIV-I (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) infected men and one woman infected with HTLV-1 (human T cell leukaemia virus type 1) developed progressive proximal muscle weakness unrelated to antiretroviral therapy. Their muscle biopsies were studied by light and electron microscopy, by immunocytochemistry to determine the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and identify the type of infiltrating cells and T cell receptor (TCR) subunits, and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and single or double immunocytochemistry to search for retrovirally infected endomysial cells. The clinical features were consistent with sporadic IBM. The muscle biopsies showed primary endomysial inflammation, red-rimmed vacuoles, amyloid deposits, eosinophilic inclusions, and small round fibres in groups, all diagnostic of IBM. The muscle fibres expressed MHC class-1 antigens and were invaded primarily by CD8+ T-lymphocytes preferentially bearing TCR V beta 5.1 and V beta 13 chains. The HIV-1 or HTLV-1 antigens were detected only on endomysial macrophages on or around muscle fibres, but not within the muscle fibres. We conclude that IBM occurs in HIV-1 and HTLV-1 infected individuals and has a clinical, histological and immunological pattern identical to sporadic IBM in the non-retrovirally infected patients. Retroviruses do not directly infect the muscle, but persistent retroviral infections may provide superantigenic stimulation and trigger an endomysial inflammatory response identical to that occurring in sporadic IBM.","['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis is based on plasmocytosis exceeding 2,000/mm3 and any evidence of clonal plasma cell proliferation. There are two forms of PCL: the primary form occurring in patients without preceding multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and the secondary form arising as a late manifestation in patients with multiple myeloma. Aim of the study was to describe our series of PCL and to report the main clinical and laboratory findings from the largest series in the literature. METHODS: Review of all cases of PCL observed from 1976 to 1994 in our Medical Divisions. Med-line research of the largest (more than 5 cases reports) series of PCL from 1969 to 1994. RESULTS: Eleven cases of PCL were identified. We diagnosed 6 cases with primary PCL out of a total of 512 patients with monoclonal gammopathy (incidence, 1.2%), 4 cases of secondary PCL as terminal phase out of 220 patients with multiple myeloma (incidence, 1.8%), and 1 case of secondary PCL as evolution of monoclonal gammopathy of undertermined significance out of 226 cases (incidence, 0.4%). From our and literature review, that identified 203 cases of primary PCL and 157 cases of secondary PCL, the clinical and the laboratory features did not significantly differ between primary and secondary forms of PCL, whereas significant differences exist between the two forms regarding response to therapy and median survival. In our series, the mean survival was 14 months for primary PCL and 6.8 months for secondary PCL. Two of the 6 patients with primary PCL obtained a complete remission, with a duration of 28 and 23 months, respectively; only 1 patient with secondary PCL had a response to chemotherapy, with a remission of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Our observation and literature data indicate that PCL, both primary and secondary, is a very poor prognosis disease, that the response rate is higher with combination chemotherapy than single agents, and that primary PCL has a relatively better survival, since secondary plasma PCL usually shows resistance to any type of chemotherapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine allows an increased accumulation of Ara-CTP in leukemic cells and inhibits DNA repair mechanisms; therefore its association with Ara-C and mitoxantrone results in a synergistic effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 1993 to February 1996, fludarabine-containing regimens (FLAG and FLANG) were employed as induction therapy in 51 high-risk AML patients. Diagnosis of AML in 22 patients was preceded by a myelodysplastic syndrome lasting more than six months; 8 of the 29 de novo AML cases (28%) were refractory to previous chemotherapy, 9 (31%) were treated for early relapse, 12 (41%) presented poor prognostic factors at diagnosis. The median age was 64 (range 33-76) years and the FAB subtypes were the following: M0 3, M1 5, M2 28, M4 7, M5 8. Forty-eight per cent of patients showed poor prognosis chromosomal abnormalities. FLAG (24 patients) consisted of both fludarabine 30 mg/sqm over 30 minutes followed 4 hours later by Ara-C 2 g/sqm over 4 hours (for 5 days) and G-CSF 300 micrograms/day administered 12 hours before fludarabine, for a total of 5 doses. FLANG (27 patients) had a shorter duration (3 days), reduced Ara-C dosage (1 g/sqm) and administration of mitoxantrone (10 mg/sqm) at the end of Ara-C infusion. RESULTS: Recovery of both neutrophils (PMN > 0.5 x 10(9)/L) and platelets (Plt > 20 x 10(9)/L) required a median of 16 days from the end of therapy. Overall, 30 patients (59%) achieved CR, 6 (11%) PR and 10 (20%) were refractory; 5 (10%) experienced early death (cerebral hemorrhage or infection). The length of complete response ranged from 2 to 26 months with a median follow-up of 8 months. De novo and secondary AML registered 62 and 54% CR rates, respectively. Eight out of 10 patients refractory to conventional schemes achieved CR (80%) but only 3 out of 10 treated for relapse obtained CR (30%). CONCLUSIONS: FLAG and FLANG showed similar activity and toxicity while proving to be highly effective and relatively well-tolerated treatments for high-risk de novo AML. Secondary leukemias seemed to be responsive as well, but the presence of an unfavorable karyotype alteration lowered the response rate.","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'FLAG protocol', 'FLANG protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although rare at the time of primary HIV infection, it is frequently found throughout the asymptomatic phase and is predictive of progressive immunodeficiency. However, the precise immune defect which results in outgrowth of commensal Candida albicans in HIV infection has not been identified. Mice infected with the Du5H(G6T2) mixture of mouse leukemia viruses develop a syndrome, designated murine AIDS (MAIDS), that has many of the immune abnormalities found in HIV infection. Retrovirus-infected C57BL/6 mice were examined for their ability to resist the development of oral candidiasis from the carrier state established after a self-limiting acute infection and to clear a subsequent secondary inoculum of oral C. albicans. Most of the mice orally colonized with C. albicans and then inoculated with the retrovirus mixture maintained a low-level oral carriage of C. albicans, while 30% of coinfected mice developed recurring 2- to 3-week episodes of acute Candida proliferation, separated by transient recoveries to the carrier state. The frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were, respectively, unchanged and significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in both cervical lymph nodes and spleens of coinfected mice compared to the corresponding frequencies in C. albicans-carrying, virus-free, age-matched control animals. Secretion of gamma interferon by concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated spleen cells from Candida-carrying, retrovirus-infected mice was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) compared to that of C. albicans-carrying, retrovirus-free mice, in accordance with known abnormalities associated with MAIDS. However, production of this cytokine by ConA-stimulated or unstimulated cervical lymph node cells from coinfected mice was enhanced compared to that of virus-free animals colonized with C. albicans. Acquired resistance to reinfection with C. albicans was maintained in retrovirus-infected mice and was associated with a mucosal recruitment of CD8+ cells not observed in control mice. These results suggest that alterations in mucosal immunity which occur in MAIDS differ substantially from defects observed at other sites and that surrogate epithelial defense mechanisms may function locally to limit Candida proliferation.",['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],,,,,,,PMC176111,,,,

We show here by co-immunoprecipitation and GST chromatography analyses that TEL and TEL-derived fusion proteins form homotypic oligomers in vitro and in vivo. Deletion mutagenesis identifies the TEL oligomerization domain as a 65 amino acid region which is conserved in a subset of the ETS proteins including ETS-1, ETS-2, FLI-1, ERG-2 and GABP alpha in vertebrates and PNTP2, YAN and ELG in Drosophila. TEL-induced oligomerization is shown to be essential for the constitutive activation of the protein kinase activity and mitogenic properties of TEL-platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR beta), a fusion oncoprotein characteristic of the leukemic cells of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia harboring a t(5;12) chromosomal translocation. Swapping experiments in which the TEL oligomerization domain was exchanged by the homologous domains of representative vertebrate ETS proteins including ETS-1, ERG-2 and GABP alpha show that oligomerization is a specific property of the TEL amino-terminal conserved domain. These results indicate that the amino-terminal domain conserved in a subset of the ETS proteins has evolved to generate a specialized protein-protein interaction interface which is likely to be an important determinant of their specificity as transcriptional regulators.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",,['GENBANK/L19541'],,,,,PMC1169615,,,,

The frequency of YU-311 positivity was significantly increased in relapsed cases. Only five cases were positive for YU-311 at diagnosis and 24 cases at relapse. Unexpectedly, only eight cases of relapsed leukemia/lymphoma expressed YU-311 and P-glycoprotein simultaneously.

The compounds are known to inhibit phospholipid biosynthesis. This paper examines the effect of the alkyl-lysophospholipid, edelfosine, on the rate-limiting enzyme, CTP:cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase, in de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis in sensitive and resistant leukemic cell lines. Enzyme activity was measured by the incorporation of 14C-phosphocholine into CDP-choline by lysates of HL60 and K562; cells demonstrated inhibition of incorporation of 14C-phosphocholine in HL60 cell lysates but no inhibition in K562 lysates. Partial purification of cytidylyltransferase by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting demonstrated similarity between the enzyme isolated from each cell line. Cloning and sequencing of cytidylyltransferase cDNA of HL60 cells was accomplished using a probe encoding the entire protein sequence of the K562 cytidylyltransferase gene. A substitution at nucleotide 751 from A in the HL60 cell cDNA clone to G in the K562 cDNA clone resulted in a change in amino acid number 251 from lysine (positively charged) in the HL60 enzyme to glutamic acid (negatively charged) in the K562 enzyme. This negative charge in the lipid-binding domain of the K562 enzyme may result in a weaker binding of edelfosine and the observed decrease in activity, as evidenced by resistance to edelfosine by K562 cells.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.15 (Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase)']",['CA29850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

BALB/c mice undergoing syngeneic BMT after total-body irradiation received 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg cyclosporine or dextrose intraperitoneally for 30 days post-transplant, followed by 5 x 10(3) BCL1 murine leukemia cells 1 or 3 weeks after stopping cyclosporine.

No clinical or histological evidence of GVHD was seen, and leukemia-free and overall survival was similar with cyclosporine and dextrose. We conclude that under the experimental conditions used, it is not possible to induce syngeneic GVHD with cyclosporine in BALB/c or SJL/J mice.

KF-19AraC, KF-19ADR and KF-19VCR were established as sublines resistant to cytosine arabinoside (AraC), adriamycin (ADR) and vincristine (VCR), respectively. Efflux of the corresponding drugs was documented in each cell line. Expression of the MDR1 gene and the P-glycoprotein was found only in KF-19ADR, which showed a cross resistance to anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids; this resistance was reversed by verapamil or cyclosporin A. KF-19VCR lacking MDR1 gene and P-glycoprotein expression showed only resistance to vinca alkaloids, which was partially reversed by verapamil and cyclosporin A. Unexpectedly, KF-19ADR and KF-19VCR displayed cross resistance to AraC, despite lack of alterations of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and deaminase (dA) activities. KF-19AraC showed an efflux of AraC as well as a decreased level of dCK, but not of dA. In addition, KF-19AraC showed cross resistance to VCR in the efflux assay.

Using the culture methods described by Nara and McCulloch and making a distinction between self-renewing and post-deterministic mitoses, we analyzed the effects of stem cell factor (SCF), a growth factor acting on early hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells. First, we demonstrated that SCF, used in combination with other HGFs included in fetal calf serum (FCS) and/or in 5637 cell line supernatant (5637-CM), stimulated both colony formation and self-renewal of blast progenitors from 10 patients, unlike SCF alone. We tested the effects of SCF on the recruitment of cells in the S-phase by using a bromodeoxyuridine/DNA (BrdUrd/DNA) staining method in flow cytometry (FCM). We showed that SCF stimulated proliferation of AML cells significantly in 9/18 patients with AML. Second, we tested the influence of SCF on the sensitivity to Ara-C of self-renewing leukemic cells from 18 patients with AML. We showed that SCF was efficient in increasing the toxicity of Ara-C on the self-renewing blast progenitors, especially with high concentrations of Ara-C. However, a large patient-to-patient heterogeneity was found and the activity of SCF was not correlated with its effect on the cell cycle. These data indicate that SCF can enhance sensitivity to Ara-C of some leukemic cells with self-renewing capacity.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Suspensions)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",,,,,,,,,,,

DBA44 positivity cannot distinguish HCL from SLVL, which is the disease that may create major diagnostic problems.

The transforming abnormality which affects an early progenitor hemopoietic stem cell is poorly defined so far but confers a growth advantage on this cell eventually leading to monoclonal hemopoiesis at least affecting the non-lymphoid bone marrow cells. Several cytokines confound the picture by exerting dual effects of stimulating the proliferation of immature cells while inducing the apoptosis in their maturing progeny thereby producing the clinical syndrome of cytopenias despite cellular marrows. Since a number of these offending cytokines share the same common lipid intracellular signalling pathway, interfering with the generation of specific phospholipid second messengers should hypothetically result in a dual effect as well.

This association is maximal at a time corresponding to cell commitment. At longer times, immunostainable cells are progressively reduced and become almost completely undetectable along with the appearance of hemoglobin molecules. Binding to MEL cells does not affect the native molecular structure of HMG1 protein. The type of functional correlation between HMG1 protein and MEL cell differentiation is suggested by the observation that if an anti-HMG1 protein antibody is added at the same time of the inducer almost complete inhibition of cell differentiation is observed, whereas if the antibody is added within the time period in which cells undergo through irreversible commitment, inhibition progressively disappears. A correlation between MEL cell commitment and the biological effect of HMG1 protein can thus be consistently suggested.","['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,

HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia.

We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters.

Within a nationwide cohort we identified 1,546 women with NHL and 198 women with CLL, all 15 years or older, born 1925-1972. Five age-matched controls were selected for each case patient. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios after mutual adjustment for number of births and age at first birth. We found a weak, negative association between parity and risk of NHL (p for trend 0.11) and a transient, 10-40% decrease in risk within 5-14 years after the last birth among women with various parity status. The risk of CLL decreased more markedly, and orderly with increasing parity, but the trend was not significant (p = 0.18). Small numbers of cases with CLL prevented more detailed analyses of temporal relationships. Age at first birth appeared unrelated to the risk of both NHL and CLL.

Molecular analysis of individual colonies is often performed to monitor purging efficacy in CML. We harvested individual colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies. One half was analyzed with I-FISH, for the presence of bcr-abl fusion gene. The other half was analyzed with RT-PCR for the presence of the bcr-abl mRNA. We wanted to address the following questions: (1) is the bcr-abl gene always expressed in CFU-GM colonies and (2) which technique has to be preferred to analyze individual CFU-GM colonies? In total, 133 colonies, derived from six CML patients, could be analyzed both with I-FISH and RT-PCR. We found a positive correlation in 89% of the cases: 118 colonies showed the same results with both techniques. However, 15 of the 106 I-FISH-positive colonies were negative in the RT-PCR. Serial analysis of the cDNA derived from 22 colonies showed in each round of amplification 21-29% RT-PCR-negative but I-FISH-positive colonies. However, all I-FISH-positive colonies showed at least one positive RT-PCR, either in the first, second or third round of amplification. These results indicate that the bcr-abl gene is probably always transcriptionally active in CFU-GM colonies. Reliable analysis with RT-PCR is possible but likely to generate false negative results. We conclude that: (1) I-FISH offers a reliable alternative to RT-PCR for analyzing individual hematopoietic colonies and (2) results obtained with RT-PCR should only be interpreted with caution.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve patients relapsed, three died in first CR and two were alive in first CR. Two of five, two of four, and five of nine patients who were allografted (in first or second CR), autografted and received consolidation CT, respectively, achieved negative two-round PCR in the bone marrow (BM): three died in CR, three remained in CR with negative two-step PCR in the BM and three relapsed after 22 to 28 months.

In the four autografted cases, PCR was positive at the time of bone marrow harvest. The two patients who received a purged transplant achieved negative PCR and prolonged CR, whereas the two patients who received an unpurged transplant remained PCR positive and relapsed.

We describe a new human myeloma cell line (MM5.1) that can be maintained in the presence of bone marrow-derived stromal cell layers, and not only when cultured with exogeneous IL-6. This cell line expresses the same immunoglobulin kappa light chain RNA sequence as the patient's original tumor cells, has a plasma cell morphology and expresses plasma cell antigens (cytoplasmic kappa light chain, CD38, BB4). Without the presence of stromal factors, MM5.1 cells become apoptotic. A low proliferative effect was observed in the presence of oncostatin M (OSM) but other cytokines (IL-10, IL-11, stem cell factor (SCF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)) had no effect at all. We observed that MM5.1 cells also grow when physically separated from stromal cell layers by a 0.45 microm microporous membrane or when cultured in conditioned medium from stromal marrow cells. Unexpectedly, the growth in stromal supernatants was markedly inhibited by an anti-IL-6 antiserum and an anti-IL-6 receptor transducer chain (gp130) mAb in a dose-dependent manner. This implies that MM5.1 cells are IL-6 responsive only when exposed to one or more additional soluble factor(s) derived from bone marrow stroma. Coculturing MM5.1 cells with IL-6 and cytokines that were described to increase the IL-6 responsiveness of myeloma cells (G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL-3) had no effect on the growth or survival. A strong proliferative effect was observed when MM5.1 cells were cultured with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sgp80). However no sgp80 could be detected in stromal supernatants using a sensitive immunoassay. This indicates that sustained proliferation of the MM5.1 cell line depends on a combination of IL6 and at least one, thus far unidentified, stroma-derived factor. After more than 1 year in continuous culture, we could obtain a variant of the line (MM5.2) that shows an improved growth rate and grows stroma independently. Molecular analysis revealed clonal identity with the early passage form and Epstein-Barr virus antigen expression was negative. The two variants of this cell line offer a useful model to identify molecular mechanisms involved in clonal evolution towards stroma-independent growth of myeloma cells.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloma Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 is essential for enhancer activity of the globin locus control regions. NF-E2 functions as a heterocomplex consisting of a 45-kDa subunit (NF-E2p45) and a 18-kDa subunit (NF-E2p18). The larger subunit NF-E2p45 is tissue-restricted and is believed to play a role in globin gene expression in F-MEL cells. The expression of the smaller subunit NF-E2p18, which is a Maf family member (MafK), is cell type- and developmental stage-specific. We have investigated the possible role of NF-E2p18 in Friend erythroid differentiation by stably transfecting either sense and antisense p18 constructs into differentiation-sensitive 745A and partially defective-differentiation TFP10 cell lines. Overexpression of NF-E2p18 induced expression of globin transcripts in both cell lines and increased their sensitivity to erythroid differentiation when exposed to DMSO. Conversely, inhibition of p18 expression by antisense transcripts resulted in the inhibition of DMSO-induced differentiation in both cell lines. These results indicate that NF-E2p18 is necessary for globin expression in F-MEL cells and that it is the predominant gene of the Maf family involved in DMSO-induced erythroid differentiation. Moreover F-MEL clones overexpressing NF-E2p18 showed an increase in specific NF-E2 DNA-binding activity whereas this activity was decreased in clones expressing antisense p18. Finally, studies using transient transfection assays showed that p18 activated NF-E2 site-dependent transcription in F-MEL cells. These data suggest that NF-E2p18 can participate in DMSO-induced erythroid differentiation of F-MEL cells by enhancing NF-E2 activity.","['0 (MafK Transcription Factor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,

HHV8 sequences were detected in only three patients. The first two were homosexual males, HIV-infected since 1985 who suffered from a BCBL initially characterized in one case by a pleural lymphomatous effusion and a peritoneal one in the other case. A high level of HHV8 copies was detected in the tumoral cells of these two BCBL. In contrast, in the third positive patient who had an AIDS-associated immunoblastic lymphoma, the HHV8 sequences level was quite low. In the two BCBL patients, the HHV8-infected clonal B cells had a large immunoblastic feature with an indeterminate phenotype and were also infected by Epstein-Barr virus. In one BCBL case, a semiquantitative PCR analysis revealed that the HHV8 sequences were much more abundant in the effusion tumor cells than in the cutaneous Kaposi's biopsy while no HHV8 sequence was detectable in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. This study reports HHV8-associated BCBL in European AIDS patients and confirms that HHV8 is present at a high copy number in the tumoral B cells of this malignancy. Furthermore, HHV8 does not seem to play a pathogenic role in any of the other T or B malignant lymphoid neoplasias studied so far. This study also stresses the necessity for quantification studies in interpretation of a positive PCR analysis for HHV8 sequences, especially in patients at risk for HIV infection or Kaposi's sarcoma.","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The potential effect of bFGF on bcl-2 mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting. Stimulation with bFGF led to a time-dependent accumulation of bcl-2 specific mRNA in all three cell lines. Maximal levels of bcl-2 mRNA expression were detected after 8 h in JVM-2, and after 18 h in JVM-13 and I83CLL. Intracellular bcl-2 protein was also found to be increased upon bFGF stimulation in both EBV- and non-EBV-transformed cells. In addition, exposure of cells from three patients with B-CLL to bFGF showed an upregulation of bcl-2 protein after 4-8 h. Our data demonstrate that bFGF upregulates the expression of bcl-2 in these cells, suggesting that this increase in bcl-2 expression may play a role in the delay of fludarabine-induced apoptosis.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In the present studies, we examined whether these mechanisms can co-exist in human AML HL-60 cells. We also determined how these mechanisms would affect the accumulation and cytotoxicity of a PGP substrate, such as Taxol (paclitaxel). For this, immunoblot analyses were performed to determine the expression of PGP, MRP, Myc, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bax on either the multidrug-resistant HL-60 sublines created under the selection pressure of doxorubicin (HL-60/AR), paclitaxel (HL-60/TAX1000) or vincristine (HL-60/VCR), or sublines created by transfection and overexpression of the bcl-2 (HL-60/Bcl-2) or bcl-xL gene (HL-60/Bcl-xL). As compared to the control HL-60, HL-60/AR cells possess high MRP while HL-60/TAX1000 and HL-60/VCR cells express high levels of the mdr-1 encoded PGP. In addition, these multidrug-resistant cells possess 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher Bcl-2, while their Bax and Myc levels are similar to those in the control HL-60 cells. HL-60/TAX1000 and HL-60/VCR cells also express three- and 2.5-fold higher Bcl-xL levels. PGP, but not MRP, overexpression significantly impaired paclitaxel accumulation and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, as well as reduced its cytotoxic effects as determined by the MTT assay. In contrast, enforced and much higher expression of Bcl-2 in HL-60/Bcl-2 (five-fold) or Bcl-xL in HL-60/Bcl-xL cells (10-fold) significantly reduced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and the loss of cell viability, without affecting its intracellular accumulation. These results confirm the possibility of co-expression of multiple mechanisms of multidrug resistance in human leukemic cells which had been selected by exposure to a single drug. The results also indicate that MRP overexpression does not confer resistance against paclitaxel. In addition, these findings suggest that, for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, enforced overexpression to high levels is necessary to induce paclitaxel resistance in HL-60 cells.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']","['CA56613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In addition, IL-2 immunoreactive molecules could be revealed in the cytoplasm of the cells. Finally, IL-2 fixed on the cell membrane could be detected by indirect immunofluorescence.

The regulatory effects of TGF-beta on hematopoietic tissues is poorly understood. Hence, we investigated the effect of TGF-beta on hematopoietic progenitor cells in p53-deficient mice to determine whether an inhibitory signal from TGF-beta is linked to p53 in hematopoietic regulation. We found that the proliferation of megakaryocyte-progenitors (CFU-Mk) in our wild-type mice was markedly inhibited by TGF-beta. Contrary to an earlier report, an erythroid and a granulocyte-macrophage progenitor, stimulated by IL-3, were not significantly inhibited, whereas TGF-beta also completely inhibited the growth of high-proliferative potential progenitor cells (HPP-CFC) in the marrow of mice with 5-fluorouracil (5FU), as reported. It is interesting that in the p53-deficient mice, the inhibitory action of TGF-beta on the HPP-CFC was incompletely abolished. The response curve we obtained for graded doses of TGF-beta suggests that there is, at least, a subpopulation of HPP-CFC which is less sensitive to the regulation by TGF-beta. In contrast to HPP-CFC, the CFU-Mk, which TGF-beta inhibited only in wild-type mice not treated with 5FU, remained inhibited in the p53-deficient strain. Thus, HPP-CFC might be regulated by TGF-beta through their signal pathways which are linked to p53.","['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the size of the deletions in this region is variable and that the commonly deleted region spans at least 400 kb; it includes the p16 gene but excludes the IFN gene cluster and the p15 gene.

Two classes of retinoids receptors, the RARs and RXRs, respectively, can mediate these effects. RXR forms heterodimers with a variety of nuclear receptors, including RAR and the VD receptor. We have previously found that VD treatment increases RXR alpha levels in myelomonocytic leukemia cells. By immunoanalysis, we observed in the present work that the RAR alpha protein is expressed in proliferating U937, HL-60 and THP-1 human leukemia cells and that VD treatment induces alterations of its electrophoretic pattern, although with large differences between cell lines. In the three cell lines, 9-cis RA, an agonist of both RARs and RXRs, cooperated with VD more efficiently than all-trans RA and RAR-specific synthetic ligands, thus suggesting an involvement of both RAR and RXR pathways in cell differentiation. Using U937 cells as a model, we delineated the relative contributions of RAR and RXR by assessing the effects of receptor-selective synthetic retinoids. The synergy between VD and all-trans RA or RAR-specific agonists (TTNPB and Ro 40-6055) was abrogated by a RAR alpha-specific antagonist (Ro 41-5253), confirming an involvement of RAR alpha. However, the cooperation between VD and 9-cis RA, although reduced, was not suppressed by the antagonist, suggesting also an involvement of the RXR pathway. The role of RXR as a ligand-activated receptor was confirmed using RXR-specific agonists (CD2608 and LGD1069), which also proved able to cooperate with VD. Finally, while each synthetic agonist alone was significantly less potent than 9-cis RA, combinations of the RAR and RXR selective agonists TTNPB and LGD1069 appeared to be as effective as the pan agonist 9-cis-RA. These results confirm that various retinoids can cooperate with VD and demonstrate that, at a whole cell level, optimal effects require the activation of both RAR and RXR receptors.","['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (CD 2608)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '102121-60-8 (Am 580)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '144092-31-9 (Ro 41-5253)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '71441-28-6', '(4-(2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl)benzoic', 'acid)', 'A61RXM4375 (Bexarotene)']",,,,,,,,,,,

To further define potential roles for EVI-1 in leukemia pathogenesis, we studied its regulation in acute promyelocytic leukemias (APL).

When NB4 cells were exposed to ATRA and transferred to cultures with N,N'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (HMBA), differentiation occurred but EVI-1 RNA was not detected, indicating that EVI-1 expression was not required for terminal, NB4 differentiation. ATRA-resistant NB4 cells were obtained by continuous culture in gradually increasing concentrations of ATRA. These cells did not express markers of differentiation but continued to express EVI-1 for several weeks even after ATRA withdrawal. To assess whether expression of the APL PML-RAR alpha fusion gene alone was sufficient for ATRA induction of EVI-1, the PML-RAR alpha gene cDNA was expressed in U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells. ATRA treatment of PML-RAR alpha-transfected or control U937 cells did not induce EVI-1 expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the EVI-1 gene is consistently expressed in APL cells either constitutively or after ATRA treatment. ATRA represents the first biologically active agent shown to specifically regulate EVI-1 expression in blood cells. In contrast to previous studies in AML and MDS, the pattern of EVI-1 expression suggests it may facilitate rather than inhibit myeloid differentiation during ATRA treatment. However, effects of EVI-1 expression are likely to be complex, and expression in ATRA-resistant APL cells may indicate multiple roles for this gene.","['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Among 49 cases with <30% marrow blasts (consistent with FAB criteria and common diagnostic practice for MDS), eight had karyotypes associated with de novo AML (four with t(8;21)(q22;q22) and one each with inv(16)(p13q22), t(11;17)(q23;q21), t(9;11)(p22;q13), and i(1)(ql0)). We termed these cases AML with a low blast count (AML-LBC) and compared their clinical and morphologic features with those of the remaining 41 cases. AML-LBC cases had little or no hematopoietic dysplasia. MDS cases consisted of refractory anemia (RA, n=6), RA with ring sideroblasts (n=2), RA with excess blasts (RAEB, n=4), RAEB in transformation (n=14), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=15). Most had moderate/severe or multilineage hematopoietic dysplasia, with significantly higher dysplasia scores than AML-LBC cases (P=0.007). Only 30% of patients with MDS achieved complete remission (CR) after two cycles of AML-directed therapy, compared with 88% of patients with AML-LBC (P=0.0001); MDS patients tended to experience prolonged severe cytopenias with chemotherapy. The 4-year survival for MDS patients was 23% +/- 7% (s.e.), vs 50% +/- 18% (s.e.) for AML-LBC (P=0.048). AML-LBC patients frequently had chloromas; none were seen in MDS patients. We conclude that the 30% blast threshold is ineffective for separation of AML and MDS in pediatric patients, and that genetic data should be included in this decision process. AML-LBC, defined by <30% blasts in bone marrow and cyto- (or molecular) genetic abnormalities associated with de novo AML, and characterized by absent or mild marrow dysplasia, is biologically and clinically distinct from MDS and should be treated as de novo AML. Outcome in pediatric MDS remains poor, and new treatment strategies are needed for these patients.",,['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The lymphoid nature of the transformation was confirmed by immunophenotyping and/or Southern blot hybridization with a J(H) probe. Clonal rearrangements were detected in 85% of cases and two or more rearrangements were visible in 64% of informative cases. The pattern of V(H) gene family utilization revealed an apparent reduction in V(H)4 family gene usage but otherwise reflected the known proportion of each gene family in the germline repertoire. In six cases the third complementary determining regions (CDR3) of the predominant blast crisis clone/s were sequenced revealing minimal evidence of somatic mutation. No clonal changes were detected in the chronic phase leukemia cells collected more than 6 months before the onset of L-BT in three of these patients. Of the other three patients studied in chronic phase from 1 to 6 months before L-BT, two showed clonal rearrangements which differed in size from those present at L-BT. In one patient a V(H)3 to V(H)5-D(H)-J(H) substitution had occurred at least 3 months prior to L-BT. In the other patient, however, the sequence of the rearrangement present 5 months prior to L-BT was unrelated to the rearrangements at the time of L-BT indicating a pattern of clonal succession. We conclude that: (1) IgH gene rearrangements are detectable in the majority of patients with L-BT using PCR and the lymphoid lineage of blastic CML is most readily confirmed using consensus primers to the framework 3 region; (2) somatic mutation is uncommon; and (3) B lymphoid clones distinct from those identified later may be detected before overt lymphoid BT. The identification of such 'abortive' clones is evidence for clonal instability before the onset of transformation and might have prognostic value.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Since 5-Aza-CdR is an S phase specific agent and has a short plasma half-life, its antileukemic activity is dose schedule-dependent. Leukemia patients who are candidates for 5-Aza-CdR therapy following relapse after therapy with cytosine arabinoside are at greater risk for the problem of drug resistance since these cytosine nucleoside analogues are metabolized by the same enzymes. Due to its unique mechanism of action of demethylating DNA, 5-Aza-CdR has the potential to activate tumor (growth) suppressor and differentiation genes that have been accidentally silenced by DNA methylation in leukemic cells. All these factors should be taken into account in the design of the optimal dose schedule of this analogue. The optimal dose schedule of 5-Aza-CdR should be based on the kinetic parameters of deoxycytidine kinase, its pharmacokinetics, its effects on DNA methylation and the cell cycle parameters of the leukemic cells and the normal hematopoietic stem cells. Since granulocytopenia is the major toxic effect produced by 5-Aza-CdR, the use of hematopoietic growth factors to shorten the duration of leukopenia should be investigated. Another approach which we are investigating is to use the methods of gene therapy to insert the cytidine deaminase gene into normal hematopoietic progenitor cells so as to make them drug resistant to 5-Aza-CdR. The use of other agents that can induce the differentiation of leukemic cells in combination with 5-Aza-CdR may have the potential to increase the clinical effectiveness of this analogue for the therapy of leukemia.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Among children, common ALL accounted for 74% of cases and pro-B all was more common in children of less than one year (14%). B ALL was observed in 2% of children. Ten percent of children, mostly males, had T-cell ALL. The third part of these children had high leukocyte counts and a mediastinal mass. Children from Mapuche origin, compared with Caucasian children had a lower proportion of common ALL (36 and 74% respectively) and a higher proportions of T-cell ALL (41 and 10% respectively). Among adults common ALL was the most common phenotype (72%) followed by T-cell ALL (15%), pro-B ALL (11%) and B-cell ALL (2%). There was a lower incidence of children with common ALL with positive cytoplasmic immunoglobulin compared to North American or European studies (2 and 15-33% respectively) and a higher proportion of adults with common ALL compared with pro-B cell ALL, in contrast to European studies that show a higher proportion of patients with pro-B cell ALL. No other immunophenotypic, clinical or laboratory differences were observed with ALL from developed countries. It is concluded that the immunophenotyping of ALL allows a more precise diagnosis of this disease.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,Inmunofenotipo. caracteristicas clinicas y laboratorio de la leucemia linfoblastica aguda en chile.

Intron F of mouse Tk1 contains two (CA)n microsatellite sequences separated by 107 bp of non-repetitive sequence. We tested this region for heteromorphism in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells. A PCR primer pair designated Agl1 yielded products of 396 and 194 bp from L5178Y tk+/- genomic DNA. The 194-bp product resulted from a secondary binding site between the two (CA)n repeats for the forward Ag11 primer and was not produced from tk-/- mutants that had lost the functional Tk1b allele. Agl2 primers produced two PCR products of 523 and approximately 440 bp and Agl3 primers produced products of 579 and approximately 500 bp. In both these cases, the difference in product size was approximately equal, indicating that Intron F is approximately 80 bp shorter in the non-functional Tk1a allele than in Tk1b. This heteromorphism forms the basis for an assay for allele loss by means of PCR. Agl1 and Agl3 primers yielded additional products of 91 and 274 bp, respectively, consistent with sizes expected from the mouse Tk1 pseudogenes (Tk1-ps). Our conclusions drawn from an analysis of 122 mutants for Tk1b loss using Agl2 primers agreed with previous analysis of the NcoI heteromorphism. Thus, a simple PCR-based analysis can identify Tk1b loss in the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells.","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Both enhancer repeats and mutations within the LTR have been implicated in FeLV related disease. In order to investigate the relationship between nucleotide sequence of the FeLV LTR and disease, tissues from 33 cats with different types of degenerative and proliferative FeLV-related disease were studied. An FeLV LTR region containing the putative transcriptional enhancer unit was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from FeLV-infected tissues. Phylogenetic analysis of FeLV 3'unique (U3) sequences revealed only one meaningful grouping which contained 4 of the 5 antigen-negative lymphosarcomas (LSAs). No sequence duplications were found in any of the 33 FeLV U3 regions. Point mutations relative to the corresponding region of FeLV-A/Glasgow, were identified at 102 positions; 68 of these were accounted for by mutations at 5 locations. Only 1 point mutation was found within the leukemia virus b-simian virus 40-like core (LVb-CORE) site. However, the nuclear factor 1 (NF1) site contained 11 mutations, and the FeLV-specific (FLV-1) site contained 26 mutations. Most of the remaining mutations were upstream of the LVB site between glucocorticoid response element (GRE) and FLV-1. The 10 LSAs, particularly the 5 antigen-negative LSAs, deviated least from the corresponding sequence for FeLV-A/Glasgow. Conclusions were that the spectrum of neoplastic and non-neoplastic FeLV-related diseases investigated in this study, developed in the presence of FeLVs containing the single enhancer unit. The significance of the point mutations is unknown, however, those occurring with high frequency and within nuclear protein binding should be first to be investigated in functional studies.","['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine laboratory parameters characteristic of disease progression which would allow a better description of the asymptomatic phase and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the two infections. Therefore, experimentally infected cats (FIV and/or FeLV positive) and control animals were observed over a period of 6.5 years under identical conditions. Blood samples were analyzed for the following: complete hematology, clinical chemistry, serum protein electrophoresis, and determination of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte subsets. The following hematological and clinical chemistry parameters were markedly changed in the FIV-infected animals from month 9 onwards: glucose, serum protein, gamma globulins, sodium, urea, phosphorus, lipase, cholesterol, and triglyceride. In FeLV infection, the markedly changed parameters were mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, and urea. In contrast to reports of field studies, neither FIV-positive nor FeLV-positive animals developed persistent leukopenia, lymphopenia, or neutropenia. A significant decrease was found in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in FIV-positive and FIV-FeLV-positive animals mainly due to loss of CD4+ lymphocytes. In FeLV-positive cats, both CD4+ and, to a lesser degree, CD8+ lymphocytes were decreased in long-term infection. The changes in FIV infection may reflect subclinical kidney dysfunction, changes in energy and lipid metabolism, and transient activation of the humoral immune response as described for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The changes in FeLV infection may also reflect subclinical kidney dysfunction and, in addition, changes in erythrocyte and immune function of the animals. No severe clinical signs were observed in the FIV-positive cats, while FeLV had a severe influence on the life expectancy of persistently positive cats. In conclusion, several parameters of clinical chemistry and hematology were changed in FIV and FeLV infection. Monitoring of these parameters may prove useful for the evaluation of candidate FIV vaccines and antiretroviral drugs in cats. The many parallels between laboratory parameters in FIV and HIV infection further support the importance of FIV as a model for HIV.",,,,,,,,PMC170472,,,,

Fibronectin has been shown to enhance nerve regeneration when added in combination with various growth factors including LIF. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of LIF plus fibronectin on the regeneration of transected nerve and functional recovery of reinnervated skeletal muscle, in one experimental model of peripheral nerve repair, at two recovery times. The rat sciatic nerve was cut at mid-thigh level and a silicone cuff containing either saline (control), LIF, or LIF plus fibronectin (L+F) was used to bridge the proximal and distal nerve stumps leaving a 1 cm gap between them. Rats were then explored at 6 or 12 weeks following the initial surgery. Regenerating nerves were assessed by measuring the diameter of myelinated axons, conduction velocity, and number of myelinated fibers. Muscle reinnervation was assessed by measuring muscle mass, force of contraction, and histologically for changes in muscle fiber type (type I and type II). In this report we demonstrate that at 6 weeks there were significant increases in 1) nerve conduction velocity, 2) myelinated axon diameter, and 3) number of myelinated axons over that of control (saline-treated) animals. Both LIF groups demonstrated a shift in type II muscle fiber area compared to saline-treated controls, with the L+F group having a significant increase in muscle mass. At 12 weeks there was an improved recovery over and above that demonstrated at 6 weeks. Muscle mass was 65% and 42% greater than control for LIF and L+F, respectively. Force of contraction, conduction velocity, myelinated fiber number, and diameter were also significantly greater for both LIF- and L+F-treated rats than saline-treated rats. These results demonstrate that LIF significantly improves the regeneration of damaged peripheral nerves and the preservation of muscle viability, resulting in greatly enhanced recovery of skeletal muscle function.","['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The first studies were based on crude exposure assessments, estimated through job titles, with no or only limited control confounding factors. The results were often inconsistent, indicating no effects in about 50% of the studies, while the other half showed only small to moderate effects. Concern has been raised that crude exposure-assessment methods might have diluted the effect estimates, and that improvement of the methods used for exposure assessment would result in more consistent associations. The present review emphasises the latest studies with considerably improved exposure assessments, as well as the control of confounding factors. Results from studies where exposure was assessed through measurements of the magnetic fields at the workplace are still inconsistent. These studies provide some support for the hypothesis of an association between magnetic field exposure and adult leukaemia, especially for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but inconsistencies between and within studies weaken the evidence. The lack of consistency regarding the type of leukaemia associated with magnetic field exposure might be explained by differences between the study designs or the populations studied, but based on the existing evidence, no firm conclusions can be drawn.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo treatment of mice with recombinant murine LIF induces thrombocytosis and increases the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in spleen and bone marrow (BM). In this study, we applied LIF to expand HPCs in vivo prior to syngeneic BM transplantation. BALB/c donor mice were treated with recombinant human LIF at a dose of 2.5 microg/day s.c. for seven days. This resulted in a 1.6-fold increment in platelet counts from 941 to 1,470 x 10(9)/l (mean, n = 20). Mean spleen weight increased from 120 mg to 160 mg (n = 5). The total numbers of HPCs in the spleen as well as in the BM, as assessed in a CFU-GM (colony forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage) assay, were significantly higher in LIF-treated donors than in saline-treated controls (30.1 +/- 14.5 versus 7.4 +/- 5.3 x 10(3) per spleen; mean +/- SD, n = 22,p < 0.001 and 74.4 +/- 17.1 versus 55.3 +/- 16.1 x 10(3) per femur, p < 0.001). Recipient mice were lethally (8.5 Gy) irradiated and transplanted with 3 x 10(5) BM cells derived from LIF- or saline-treated donors. Hematopoietic reconstitution was monitored by tail bleeding at three-day intervals. Platelet and WBC nadir counts in control animals were reached at day 9 (31 +/- 25 x 10(9)/l for platelets and 0.40 +/- 0.10 x 10(9)/l for WBC; mean +/- SD, n = 29 per treatment group); in animals transplanted with LIF-treated BM cells, these counts were 44 +/- 25 x 10(9)/l for platelets, p < 0.05 and 0.60 +/- 0.38 x 10(9)/l for WBC, p < 0.01. In addition, platelet reconstitution was faster in recipients of LIF-treated BM cells (226 +/- 118 versus 126 +/- 62 x 10(9)/l at day 12 and 633 +/- 174 versus 434 +/- 180 x 10(9)/l at day 15, p < 0.001). Similarly, the reconstitution of WBC was also significantly enhanced. The radioprotection rate of lethally irradiated recipients with increasing cell doses of BM cells derived from LIF-treated donors was higher at all cell doses tested then of control animals, but did not reach statistical significance. These results show that in vivo treatment with LIF expands the number of committed progenitor cells and BM repopulating cells that accelerate short-term hematopoietic reconstitution without increasing radioprotection. Our data do not support a major role for LIF as a single factor inducing expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in vivo.","['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although scarce under steady-state conditions, CD34+ progenitor cells can be effectively mobilized into the peripheral blood (PB) in the vast majority of normal donors with a brief (3-4 days) course of recombinant human (rHu)G-CSF. Those cytokine-peripheralized progenitor cells and, among them, pluripotent stem cells, are collected by apheresis in sufficient amounts to achieve complete and permanent alloengraftment after myeloablative treatment in patients with primarily malignant hematologic disorders. The short-term tolerability profile of PBSC mobilization and apheresis in normal donors appears to be acceptable, although continued monitoring is necessary to ensure long-term safety. When compared with BM progenitor cells, mobilized PBSCs seem to exhibit a more primitive phenotype and a different clonogenic potential. The impact of factors affecting the efficiency of PBSC mobilization, such as rHuG-CSF dose, duration of cytokine treatment, and, to a lesser extent, donor age is now being recognized. Potential ways to optimize and possibly ""engineer"" PBSC collection, such as the use of cytokine/chemokine combinations (e.g., thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, etc.) and monoclonal antibodies directed against integrin receptors on CD34+ progenitor cells, are now being explored as well. In the clinical setting, engraftment after PBSC allografting is rapid and probably faster than after BM allografting. PBSC allografting seems to be associated with an incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) comparable to the ones observed after BM allografting, although the incidence of chronic GVHD after allogeneic PBSC transplantation is still controversial. The infusion of a larger number of lymphoid cells appears to translate into a more rapid immunologic recovery and may lead to an enhanced graft-versus-leukemia effect. The collection of large numbers of mobilized PBSCs should provide ample opportunities for graft engineering and gene therapy. PBSCs may eventually replace, at least in part, BM as the preferred source of stem cells for both auto- and allotransplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After achieving second CR, bone marrow transplantation (either allogeneic or autologous) represents the treatment of choice for eligible patients, with the aim of prolonging remission duration and improving disease-free survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty AML patients in first hematological relapse were treated with MEC regimen, consisting of a 6-day induction cycle [mitoxantrone 6 mg/m2/day, cytarabine (Ara-C) 1 g/m2/day and VP-16 80 mg/m2/day] followed by a 4-day cycle with the same drugs for patients achieving complete remission (CR); allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were planned as post-consolidation treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (68%) achieved second CR, 3 (6%) died during induction and 13 were refractory. CR rate was significantly higher in patients with a first CR lasting > 6 months (82% vs. 41%, P < 0.001). Out of the 34 patients in CR after the 4-day cycle, 18 (53%) were not eligible to transplant and did not receive any further therapy and 16 (47%) received autologous (15 cases) or allogeneic (1 case) BMT at a median time of 2 months from second CR. Twenty-two patients relapsed after a median time of 6 months (range 1-31), 1 patient died from transplant-related toxicity and 11 are in continuous CR [7 out of 16 (44%) in the transplanted and 4 out of 11 (36%) in the non-transplanted group]. Overall survival and event-free survival for the 50 patients were 29% and 19% at 70 months, respectively. The disease-free survival for the 34 patients who obtained second CR is 29% projected at 69 months [41% at 69 months for 16 transplanted patients versus 18% at 49 months for the remaining 18 patients (P = 0.007)]. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that MEC followed by high-dose post-consolidation treatment is a promising approach in relapsed AML; however, alternative strategies are to be investigated for the relevant fraction of patients that, even achieving second CR, are not eligible for BMT.","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'MAV protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Area within a 35 km radius of La Hague, Normandy, France. SUBJECTS: Twenty seven cases of leukaemia diagnosed during the period 1978-93 in people aged under 25 years and 192 controls matched for sex, age, place of birth, and residence at time of diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antenatal and postnatal exposure to x rays and viral infections, occupational exposure of parents (particularly ionising radiation), living conditions, lifestyle of parents and children. RESULTS: Increased trends were found for use of local beaches by mothers and children (P < or = 0.01); relative risks 2.87 (95% confidence intervals 1.05 to 8.72) and 4.49 (1.52 to 15.23) when categories were aggregated in two levels (more or less than once a month). Consumption of local fish and shellfish also showed an increased trend (P 0.01); relative risk 2.66 (0.91 to 9.51) when categories were grouped in two levels (more or less than once a week). A relative risk of 1.18 a year (1.03 to 1.42) was observed for length of residence in a granite-built house or in a granitic area. No association was shown with occupational radiation exposure in parents.

The analysis of 475 tumors in 91 families with p53 germline mutations reported since 1990 shows that breast carcinomas are most frequent (24.0%), followed by bone sarcomas (12.6%), brain tumors (12.0%), and soft tissue sarcomas (11.6%). The sporadic counterparts of these tumors also carry a high incidence of p53 mutations, suggesting that in these tissues p53 mutations are capable of initiating the process of malignant transformation. Hematological neoplasms (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma) and adrenocortical carcinomas occurred at a frequency of 4.2 and 3.6%, respectively. One-half of the families fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. There were marked organ-specific differences in the mean age at which carriers of p53 germline mutations present with neoplastic disease: 5 years for adrenocortical carcinomas, 16 years for sarcomas, 25 years for brain tumors, 37 years for breast cancer, and almost 50 years for lung cancer. Analysis of the mutational spectrum showed a predominance of G:C-->A:T transitions at CpG sites, suggesting an endogenous formation, eg, by deamination of 5-methylcytosine, rather than a causation by environmental mutagenic carcinogens. The location of mutations within the p53 gene was found to be similar to that of somatic mutations in sporadic tumors. There is no evidence of an organ or target cell specificity of p53 germline mutations; the occasional familial clustering of certain tumor types is more likely to reflect the genetic background of the respective kindred or the additional influence of environmental and nongenetic host factors.",,,,,,,,PMC1858532,,,,

To address these potential associations, a study has been conducted to determine if 60-Hz magnetic fields can alter the clinical progression of leukemia. In the large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia model, spleen cells from aged leukemic rats were transplanted into young, male Fischer 344 rats, producing leukemia in a relatively short period. A total of 72 animals were randomly assigned to four treatment groups (18/group) as follows: (1) 10 G; (2) sham exposed (null energized field) (approximately 20 mG); (3) ambient controls (<1 mG); and (4) positive controls (5 Gy whole body irradiation from Cobalt-60, 4 days before initiation of exposure). At the initiation of exposure or sham-exposure, all rats were injected (i.p.) with 2.2x10(7) fresh, viable, LGL leukemia cells. The magnetic fields were activated for 20 h per day, 7 days per week; all exposure conditions were superimposed over the natural ambient magnetic field. Eighteen rats from each treatment were bled at weeks 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 to monitor, in the same set of animals, the clinical progression of the LGL disease and survival of the animals. Peripheral blood hematological changes were monitored to evaluate the progression of the leukemia. In general, no significant or consistent differences were detected between the magnetic field exposed and the ambient field control groups, although some inconsistent and random differences were occasionally observed. These data indicate that the 10 G magnetic fields did not significantly alter the clinical progression of LGL leukemia in Fischer 344 rats.",['0 (Hemoglobins)'],,,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced DNA repair as well as enhanced replicative bypass of DNA adducts have been suggested to play a role in the development of resistance to cisplatin. However, the relative contribution of these mechanisms is unknown. Second generation platinum compounds containing the 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (dach) carrier ligand have been of particular interest in the studies of resistance mechanisms since they have been effective in treatment of cells resistant to cisplatin. We have investigated the formation and repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICL) in the mouse leukemia cell line L1210/0 and its carrier ligand specific resistant derivatives L1210/DDP and L1210/DACH after treatment with ethylenediamine (en)-Pt and diaminocyclohexane (dach)-Pt compounds. ICL in the overall genome were examined using a modification of the alkaline elution assay. A Southern blot technique was employed for the study of ICL in specific regions of the genome. In the overall genome we found decreased formation of ICL with either -en or -dach carrier ligands in the two resistant cell lines without carrier ligand specificity. Some carrier ligand specificity of ICL formation was observed in the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene, but it did not correlate with the carrier ligand specificity of resistance. At the level of the overall genome there was no difference in repair of ICL between the sensitive and the two resistant cell lines. When measured in the DHFR gene, however, there was enhanced repair of ICL in the two resistant cell lines compared with the sensitive cell line. The enhanced repair at the level of the gene did not display any carrier ligand specificity.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Ligands)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'C82TX76BHH (1,2-cyclohexanediamine)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",['CA 34082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

NF-1 gene is mapped to chromosome 17. Central or bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis (NF-2) has a gene mapped to chromosome 22. Hereditary and sporadic NF-1 are recognized. The most typical manifestation of NF-1-skin neurofibroma--has has a characteristic plexiform structure. Spectrum of tumors (schwannomas, gliomas, Wilms' tumors) produced by transplacental treatment with strong environmental mutagens-carcinogens-ethylnitroso- and methylnitrosourea (ENU and MNU, respectively) resembles on the whole that observed in human sporadic NF-1. Location of neurofibromas depends on the species: skin and subcutaneous tissue in humans, cattle and hamsters, trigeminal nerve, spinal roots in rats. Rat schwannomas differ from human neurofibromas by malignant structure, frequently with cystic component, but if induced by ENU treatment at day 15 of the pregnancy they resemble human plexiform neurofibromas with intraneural and extraneural growth of tumor cells. There were attempts to reproduce a transgenerational transmission of ENU carcinogenic effect, i.e. hereditary form of NF-1. In the experiments of this type the offsprings of rats prenatally treated with ENU remained untreated. The incidence of PNS, CNS and Wilms' tumors in these untreated offsprings in some experiments was significantly higher than in controls thus confirming the possibility, in principle, of hereditary NF-1 modelling. Only 10% of tumors developing in such untreated descendants of ENU treated parents contained a specific mutation of neu oncogene compared to 90-100% in tumors arising following direct treatment with ENU. The mechanisms of the transgenerational carcinogenesis are discussed. Lesions imitating NF-1 and in part NF-2 in transgenic mice with an HTLV-1-tax gene as well as in p-53 knockout mice are mentioned.",,,,Bolezn' fon Reklinkgkhauzena: eksperimental'nye modeli i sravnitel'nye aspekty.,,,,,,,,

Energy loss and nutritional problems were most troublesome during the treatment phase, signifying many other physical problems. Patients with acute leukaemia had more problems, and thought the care was worse than did patients with highly malignant lymphoma. Serious physical problems correlated with low satisfaction with practical help received, indicating that the nurses failed to meet the needs of those suffering the most. Reduced psychological and sexual energy persisted in remission, showed no correlation with the extent of physical problems during the treatment phase, but correlated with co-existing problems and sensitivity to infections, with a great need for intimate help and counselling and with a low sense of coherence. Family relationships were said to have improved, while work and finances were negatively affected. The results indicate that nursing care should actively focus on physical problems, especially on energy loss and nutritional problems. The overwhelming fatigue hinders patients in taking physical care of themselves, and may be overlooked by the nurse since their motor capability seems intact. The long-term effect of the illness means a reduced psychological and sexual energy and a high degree of existential problems and sensitivity to infections, which indicates the importance of follow-up care, and perhaps especially of counselling for the long-term reactions and disturbance of equilibrium.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The appearance of morphologically atypical lymphocytes in low-grade malignant lymphoma (NHL) or CLL is easily overlooked, and is generally not regarded as a diagnostic criterion. We report 12 cases of CLL/NHL who were detected only by morphological screening of routine peripheral blood smears (83,400 blood smears). The diagnosis of CLL/NHL was not suggested by the patients' history, physical or other laboratory findings, and had not been contemplated by the physician in charge. Monoclonality of peripheral lymphocytes was confirmed by immunophenotyping and Southern blotting. The lymphoma was classified histologically according to the International Working Formulation (bone marrow biopsy). A monoclonal lymphatic population was not found by immunophenotyping in the blood of 11 patients whose lymphocytes were morphologically classified as activated-abnormal. However, 3 patients suspected to have NHL/CLL on morphological screening of blood smears had to be classified as benign after immunophenotyping.

We present two cases of splenic rupture which occurred in a man with a secondary high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

We find a male-to-female ratio of 3:1, with considerable differences for the specific diseases encountered. Pathologic rupture of the spleen has happened almost exclusively in adults and the ruptured spleens are generally moderately to severely enlarged. It seems that, apart from splenic infiltration by a hematologic disease, splenic infarcts and coagulation disorders (which have previously been advanced as the most important pathophysiologic factors leading to rupture), male sex, adulthood, severe splenomegaly, and cytoreductive chemotherapy may increase the risk for pathologic splenic rupture.

Because a sufficient supply of iron is a prerequisite for erythroid proliferation and hemoglobin synthesis, we have investigated whether Epo can regulate cellular iron metabolism. We present here a novel biologic function of Epo, namely as a potential modulator of cellular iron homeostasis. We show that, in human (K562) and murine erythroleukemic cells (MEL), Epo enhances the binding affinity of iron-regulatory protein (IRP)-1, the central regulator of cellular iron metabolism, to specific RNA stem-loop structures, known as iron-responsive elements (IREs). Activation of IRP-1 by Epo is associated with a marked increase in transferrin receptor (trf-rec) mRNA levels in K562 and MEL, enhanced cell surface expression of trf-recs, and increased uptake of iron into cells. These findings are in agreement with the well-established mechanism whereby high-affinity binding of IRPs to IREs stabilizes trf-rec mRNA by protecting it from degradation by a specific RNase. The effects of Epo on IRE-binding of IRPs were not observed in human myelomonocytic cells (THP-1), which indicates that this response to Epo is not a general mechanism observed in all cells but is likely to be erythroid-specific. Our results provide evidence for a direct functional connection between Epo biology and iron metabolism by which Epo increases iron uptake into erythroid progenitor cells via posttranscriptional induction of trf-rec expression. Our data suggest that sequential administration of Epo and iron might improve the response to Epo therapy in some anemias.","['0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Iron-Sulfur Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 4.2.1.3 (Iron Regulatory Protein 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Mcl-1 was previously found to be similar to Bcl-2 in causing a delay in apoptotic cell death in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The work described here was aimed at determining whether Mcl-1 could also exert such an effect in hematopoietic cells, because endogenous Mcl-1 expression is prominent in the hematopoietic system. A further aim was to assess the effects of Mcl-1 in cells exposed to a variety of cytotoxic stimuli, because Bcl-2 is known to have a broad spectrum of activity. To approach these aims, FDC-P1 murine myeloid progenitor cells were transfected with vectors driving either constitutive or inducible expression of Mcl-1. The introduced Mcl-1 gene was found to cause a prolongation of viability under various conditions that cause apoptotic cell death, including exposure to cytotoxic agents (the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide, calcium ionophore, or UV irradiation) and the withdrawal of required growth factors. In addition, Mcl-1 was found to interact with Bax, a member of the Bcl-2 family that promotes cell death as a homodimer but that can heterodimerize with Bcl-2 to promote cell viability. Although Mcl-1 prolonged cell viability, it did not prevent eventual cell death upon continuous exposure to a cytotoxic agent. Prolongation of viability was maximal when expression of Mcl-1 was induced before the application of the apoptotic stimulus, although some increase occurred if Mcl-1 was induced shortly thereafter and before overt apoptosis. Taken as a whole, these findings provide further parallels between Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, showing that Mcl-1 can interact with Bax in hematopoietic FDC-P1 cells and can prolong cell viability under a variety of cytotoxic conditions.","['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']","['R01 CA057359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

CD34 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) were more frequently expressed in AML-M0 (96% and 68% of the cases, respectively) than in the other FAB subsets (P < .001 for both). By contrast, GP-170 and CD7 were less frequently expressed in AML-M0 than in FAB classes such as M1, M4, and M5 (P = .02 and .003, respectively). A total of 80% of AML-M0 cases carried lymphoid markers (including TdT), and 48% showed a coordinate positivity for two or more of them. CD2, CD5, CD10, and CD19 were expressed in a similar fashion among the different FAB groups, whereas CD4 expression was significantly more frequent in AML-M0, AML-M4, and AML-M5 (P = .014). AML-M0 was characterized by a more frequent occurrence of complex karyotypes. In addition, approximately 20% of cases had TdT positivity, complex karyotypes, and anomalies of chromosome 5 and/or 7, a pattern not observed in the other FAB subsets. Finally, 80% of anomalies of chromosome 5 and/or 7 in AML-M0 were comprised within complex karyotypes, whereas only 13% of the remaining FAB cases carried this feature.

All tumor cell lines screened constitutively expressed IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-4R genes. However, only LSA and PE-3T cells expressed IL-2 and IL-4 genes constitutively, whereas EL-4 and P815 tumor cells expressed only IL-4 but not IL-2. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against IL-2, IL-4, or a combination of these, as well as MoAbs against IL-2R significantly inhibited the proliferation of LSA but not that of other tumor cell lines ex vivo. To exclude the possibility that, in other tumor cell lines, the autocrine growth factor may interact with its receptor within the cell, the ability of antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to inhibit the growth of the tumor cells was tested. The antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specific for IL-2, IL-4, IL-2R beta, or IL-2R gamma chains, added in culture, could markedly inhibit the growth of LSA but not that of the other tumor cell lines screened. Inasmuch as IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma subunits also serve as a component of the receptors for IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15, the above data suggested that such cytokine redundancy was not responsible for autonomous growth of the other tumor cell lines. Addition of exogenous IL-2 or IL-4 to the tumor cell cultures caused significant enhancement in the proliferation of PE-3T cells, whereas other cell lines were either not significantly affected or slightly inhibited from growing. Interestingly, the LSA tumor growth in nude mice was significantly inhibited after treatment of these mice with a combination of MoAbs against IL-2 and IL-4. Together, our studies show for the first time that IL-2 and IL-4 may serve as autocrine growth factors in the autonomous proliferation of tumor cells, particularly those that are retrovirally induced. Second, some tumor cell lines, despite expressing certain cytokines and their receptors constitutively, may not depend exclusively on such factors for autocrine growth.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,

A balanced t(15;17) (q22;q21) reciprocal chromosomal translocation is found in approximately 90% of APML patients; this translocation fuses the PML gene on chromosome 15 to the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) gene on chromosome 17, creating two novel fusion genes, PML-RAR alpha and RAR alpha-PML. The PML-RAR alpha fusion gene product, which is expressed in virtually all patients with t(15;17), is thought to play a direct role in the pathogenesis of APML. To determine whether PML-RAR alpha is sufficient to cause APML in an animal model, we used the promyelocyte-specific targeting sequences of the human cathepsin G (hCG) gene to direct the expression of a PML-RAR alpha cDNA to the early myeloid cells of transgenic mice. Mice expressing the hCG-PML-RAR alpha transgene were found to have altered myeloid development that was characterized by increased percentages of immature and mature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. In addition, approximately 30% of transgene-expressing mice eventually developed acute myeloid leukemia after a long latent period. The splenic promyelocytes of mice with both the nonleukemic and leukemic phenotypes responded to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment, which caused apoptosis of myeloid precursors. Although low-level expression of the hCG-PML-RAR alpha transgene is not sufficient to directly cause acute myeloid leukemia in mice, its expression alters myeloid development, resulting in an accumulation of myeloid precursors that may be susceptible to cooperative transforming events.","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, mouse)']",['CA49712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

After informed consent, testicular biopsies were performed 14 times in 12 patients at the end of treatment. The testicular morphology in all cases had sustained a degree of damage. The tubular fertility index (TFI), calculated as the percentage of seminiferous tubules containing identifiable spermatogonia, was from 0 to 42.8% (mean 33.4%) below the normal value. Infiltration of leukemic cells was the most significant factor contributing to the decrease in TFI. There were no differences in the TFI among the TCCSG protocols. Formation of sperm was recognized in six cases, whose ages were 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 and 19 years. In two children, testicular biopsy was performed twice. In the second biopsy, TFI was elevated and sperm formation with the maturation of Leydig cells was observed. A number of other pathological changes were observed: modification of spermatogonia, Sertoli cells and inclusion bodies in spermatogonia, abnormal maturation of Leydig cells, evidence of interstitial fibrosis and thickening of the basement membrane. These results suggest that recent strong chemotherapy for the treatment of ALL might cause severe but not fatal damage to children's testicular tissue.

The nested case-cohort study was conducted to investigate dose-response and time-related factors in further detail. Data collection was based on several subsequent record linkages of nationwide registers. The subjects were followed for cancer in 1974-1990, providing over 2.5 million person-years. The outcome measures included standardized incidence ratios, incidence rate ratios, and odds ratios for several exposure indices. The total number of leukemia cases was 203. Magnetic fields were not associated with the overall occurrence of leukemia among adults. The risk estimates were adjusted for age, gender, and municipality; the other covariates had no effect on the risk estimates. However, an almost fivefold increase with statistical significance was observed for the risk of chronic lymphatic leukemia in relation to earlier, or long-lasting, exposure to magnetic fields of > or = 0.1 microT. This finding was based on very small numbers. No risk increases were observed for other types of leukemia. While the possibility of an increase in risk at higher magnetic field levels, or in relation to earlier exposures, cannot be excluded on the basis of this study, the results suggest that typical magnetic fields of high-voltage power lines are not an important cause of leukemia in adults.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Specimen RNA was reverse-transcribed and co-amplified with a competitive template containing a gag sequence specific for BM5d that can be discriminated from that corresponding to wild-type cDNA by the presence of a unique restriction site, Bg/II. PCR products were quantified by means of densitometric analysis after ethidium bromide staining of gels.

All patients were followed for up to 204 months or until death. Histopathologically, the infiltrates showed a patchy perivascular (35%), diffuse (31.5%), nodular (31.5%) or bandlike (1.9%) pattern. In 28% of the cases, an admixture of reactive cells within the infiltrate including eosinophils, histiocytes, neutrophils and plasma cells was observed. Cytomorphologically, small B-lymphocytes with condensed chromatin predominated in most infiltrates. However, some biopsies showed a small but significant number of medium- or large-sized neoplastic cells of the B-lymphocyte lineage with variable cytomorphological features. In a multivariate analysis, several histologic parameters within the infiltrates were found to show a significant association with long survival, namely, an infiltrate of moderate density, a nodular pattern, involvement of the lower dermis only, and presence of predominantly small B-lymphocytes (more than 95%) with condensed chromatin. Histologic variables that independently correlated with relatively short survival included an infiltrate of severe intensity, a diffuse pattern, epidermal changes (especially acanthosis and ulceration), medium-sized and large B-lymphocyte (more than 5%), and reactive cells within the infiltrate (neutrophils, eosinophils, and plasma cells). Overall analysis of our results showed two histologic patterns with a significant prognostic impact (p < 0.01; z = 5.4). Pattern I (33 biopsies) correlated with relatively long survival (2-year survival rate; 97%) and consisted of infiltrates showing predominantly small B-lymphocytes (more than 95%) without reactive cells or epidermal changes. Pattern II (21 biopsies) indicated short survival (2-year survival rate; 49%) and included all the rest of the biopsies i.e., infiltrates with medium- and large-sized B-lymphocytes (more than 5%), admixture of reactive cells, and epidermal changes.

Methods for sensitive quantification are, however, complicated and time-consuming. Detection by PCR of monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements is simple and can be used in routine laboratories but is non-quantitative and of lower but uncertain sensitivity. The aim of this study was to determine the value of detection of monoclonality in identification of different levels of MRD. We looked for monoclonality in 64 bone marrow aspirates which had been obtained from 31 patients with B lineage ALL at various times during induction therapy and for which levels of MRD had been determined by limiting dilution analysis using patient-specific PCR primers. Detection of monoclonality identified levels of MRD of > or =10(-3) during induction with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 93%. The positive and negative predictive values were 0.86 and 0.88, respectively. The sensitivity of detection of a monoclonal IgH rearrangement was greater than that for the TCRgamma locus during induction as an IgH rearrangement was detected more often than a TCRgamma rearrangement in patients who had both IgH and TCRgamma rearrangement at diagnosis. Detection of monoclonality is therefore a simple and quick test applicable to the majority of patients with ALL and it may be useful in identifying high-risk patients at the end of induction and in identifying relapsing patients later during therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate the effect of soluble stromal factors, we developed short-term serum-low liquid cultures in which the effect of stroma-conditioned media (SCM) from the murine FBMD-1, and human L87/4 and L88/5 cell lines was studied on the maintenance and expansion of various human HSC subsets in CD34-positive selected mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from autologous transplants of lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients. The human cobblestone area forming cell (CAFC) assay was employed to determine the frequencies of both the CAFC weeks 2 to 4 as tentative indicators of progenitor and transiently repopulating HSC, and the more primitive CAFC weeks 6 to 8 as indicators of long-term repopulating HSC. In 7-day liquid cultures containing interleukin-3 (IL-3), stem cell factor (SCF) and IL-6, we recovered 3.0-fold more colony-forming cells (CFC) and 1.7- to 1.9-fold more CAFC weeks 2 and 4. The absolute number of primitive CAFC weeks 6 and 8 were only maintained (1.1- to 1.4-fold) in these liquid cultures. This modest expansion was significantly improved by the addition of SCM from the FBMD-1, L87/4 or L88/5 cell lines. Output CFC numbers were 6.8-, 5.8- and 9.9-fold higher, respectively, than the input values, while absolute CAFC week 2 to 4 numbers were 4.5-, 10.2- and 10.2-fold expanded, respectively. The addition of SCM also improved expansion of the more primitive CAFC week 6 to 8 stem cell subsets by 2.2-, 4.5- and 4.9-fold, respectively. The addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), IL-1beta, IL-11 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha to cultures containing IL-3, SCF and IL-6 could not explain the SCM effect and in all these combinations SCM addition further increased the recovery of HSC subsets. Similarly, addition of anti-cytokine antibodies (ie alpha-G-CSF, alpha-GM-CSF, alpha-IL-11, alpha-leukemia inhibitory factor) to liquid cultures containing IL-3, SCF, IL-6 and SCM could not neutralize the SCM effect. These data indicate that SCM significantly enhances expansion of primitive HSC and progenitor cells from CD34-selected PBSC in 7-day cultures and in synergistic combination with multiple cytokines at optimal concentrations. As a result, SCM is a useful component of short-term liquid culture procedures for clinical expansion or manipulation of primitive HSC.","['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the standard form (CD44st), a large family of variant isoforms (CD44v) is generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. Certain CD44v (v5 and V6) are upregulated in the course of neoplastic progression and reflect the metastatic potential of tumor cells. CD44 v6 is expressed in high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells and is released in the serum, thus providing a soluble marker that reflects tumor burden, disease progression and treatment response. Here we show that serum CD44st is elevated in approximately half of B-CLL patients. In contrast, CD44v5 and v6 are detected at normal levels in the large majority of the cases. CD44st serum levels correlate significantly with the number of circulating leukemic B cells and with the levels of another soluble B-CLL marker, beta2-microglobulin. Immunoprecipitation analyses of B-CLL sera allow detection of several high molecular weight bands and of a 78 kDa band that represents a soluble form of CD44st and is 4 kDa lower than a similar band (82 kDa) detected in B-CLL cell lysates. Elevated serum CD44st associates with a number of unfavorable prognostic factors such as high peripheral blood lymphocytosis, splenomegaly, advanced disease stage and therapy requirement. A follow-up study indicates that serum levels of CD44st are related to disease status, thus reinforcing our veiw that this molecule may represent a reliable tumor marker in B-CLL.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Using the cobblestone area forming cell (CAFC) assay and LTC, we have examined the frequencies of stem cell subsets, their ability for long-term progenitor cell production and the relative frequencies of malignant and normal progenitor cells before and after a 5-6 week culture period. Cells were obtained from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples of patients in chronic phase CML. CD34-enriched cells were sorted by FACS on the basis of CD34 and CD38 expression and overlaid on confluent stromal layers of murine FBMD-1 cells. The presence of the bcr/abl chimeric gene was detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using differently labelled bcr and abl-specific probes. In the CD34pos/CD38pos subset of CML-PB, representing 64-95% of CD34pos cells, CAFC frequencies at week 1 (wk-1) were much higher than those of CAFC wk-5 (1.10(4)/10(5) cells vs 1.10(3)/10(5)). In contrast, in the CD34pos/CD38neg subset, representing 2-3% of CD34pos cells, the frequency of CAFC wk-1 was only 1.10(2)/10(5) cells, but a high CAFC frequency (10(3)-10(4)/10(5)) was detected after 5 weeks of culture. CAFC frequencies in the CD34pos subset obtained from CML-BM were 10- to 100-fold lower than those from CML-PB, but displayed a similar distribution over CD38pos, CD38dim and CD38neg cells. Analysis of the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) and Ph- cells by FISH on freshly sorted cells revealed that normal cells were not enriched in any CD34pos/CD38 subset. In addition, Ph- as well as Ph+ cells were maintained with similar efficiency throughout 5 week LTC.

We present the results of a search among 20 additional cases of congenital neutropenia (CN) and SCN for the presence of mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of G-CSF-R. This series includes patients with familial and nonfamilial forms of CN and SCN. Mutations in the G-CSF-R gene were found in two new SCN cases. These mutations were nonsense mutations, located in the same cytoplasmic region of G-CSF-R as those found earlier, resulting in the truncation of the C-terminus. Both of these patients developed AML. None of the other patients showed clinical symptoms or cytogenetic features indicative of AML or progression to leukemia. The analysis in this extended series of patients thus has revealed five SCN cases with G-CSF-R mutations, four of whom developed AML. These results add support to the notion that mutations in the G-CSF-R gene, affecting the maturation signaling function of the receptor, define a distinct subgroup of SCN with increased susceptibilty to AML.","['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We postulated that the oncogenic effect of RBTN-2 in T cells is likely mediated by binding protein(s) with T cell-specific expression. By screening a T cell cDNA library, we identified a novel ets transcription factor that binds RBTN-2. This protein was named elf-2 because its DNA-binding domain is virtually identical to that of ets family member elf-1. Northern analyses showed similar levels of two elf-2 transcripts (3.5 kb and 3.8 kb) in all tissues except thymus. Thymocytes expressed four- to 10-fold greater amounts of the 3.5 kb transcript than other tissues. Sequence analyses of cDNA clones indicated that these transcripts encode proteins differing only at their amino termini, and likely represent alternatively spliced isoforms. These isoforms (elf-2a and elf-2b) contain identical RBTN-2 binding regions and DNA-binding domains. Elf-2b lacks a putative transactivation domain. The expression patterns suggest that RBTN-2 normally interacts equally with elf-2a and elf-2b. In contrast, when RBTN-2 is inappropriately expressed in T cells, RBTN-2 would interact predominantly with elf-2b; this interaction may lead to T cell proliferation.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Elf2 protein, mouse)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,

How the antiproliferative activity of cAMP is exerted in p210 BCR-ABL transformed myeloid cells was the subject of this investigation. It was hypothesized that cyclin dependent kinase 4, cdk4, might be a critical target enzyme to affect the related events of c-myc transcription and progression through G1 phase of the cell cycle within cells transformed by p210 BCR-ABL, and further, that cdk4 might be downregulated by cAMP to inhibit proliferation. In order to investigate the regulatory role of cdk4, synchronized cells were studied. In p210 BCR-ABL transformed cells transiting early G1 phase, treatment with a cAMP analogue led to inhibition of cyclin D1 synthesis, and marked reduction of cdk4 kinase activity. Within cells in which cdk4 was inhibited by cAMP, there was augmented interaction of E2F1 with the retinoblastoma protein, pRb in a nuclear matrix-associated cell fraction. As a result of E2F1 sequestration, raised intracellular cAMP was found to inhibit c-myc transcription in p210 BCR-ABL transformed myeloid cells synchronously transiting the early G1 phase of the cell cycle. A target of this transcriptional suppression exerted by cAMP was the E2F site of the c-myc P2 promoter. On the other hand, cyclin D1 content was not reduced by cAMP in these cells when it was applied at a later cell cycle stage at the interface between G1 and S. Corresponding to lack of cyclin D1 inhibition in these later G1-to-S phase cells, cdk4 activity was only modestly suppressed, and c-myc mRNA expression was also inhibited to a lesser degree. These studies show that Rb interaction with E2F1 is regulated by cdk4 and cyclin D1 within p210 BCR-ABL transformed leukemia cells in early G1 phase of the cell cycle. In this context, both cyclin D1 and cdk4 are subject to the level of intracellular cAMP. This interaction between Rb and E2F1, which is subject to the level of cAMP, is critical to transcriptional control of c-myc. Further, pRb regulation of E2F activity affects cellular potential for G1-S phase transition in p210 BCR-ABL transformed myeloid cells, in part, via its effect on c-myc transcription.","['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '177592-87-9 (4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl-8-bromo-cAMP)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a new B-NHL cell line (Granta 519), with concurrent abnormalities of the cyclin D1, pl6CDKN2 and pl5CDKN2B genes. An independent clinical case of mantle cell NHL (Mc-NHL) with concomitant overexpression of cyclin D1, and deletion of the p16CDKN2 gene was also identified, suggesting that this combination of oncogenic aberration is a pathophysiologic contribution to a subset of NHL cases. More in-depth functional studies of this concept were facilitated by the availability of the cell line Granta 519 which was derived from a case of high-grade NHL and has a mature B cell immunophenotype. Cytogenetic analysis identified translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) and complex rearrangements involving chromosomes 9p22, 13p21, 17pl1, and 18q21. Molecular analysis identified overexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA and biallelic deletion of the p16CDKN2 and p15CDKN2B genes. To elucidate the effect of these genetic abnormalities on the G1 control of Granta 519 cells, the level and function of the major components of the cyclinD/retinoblastoma (RB) pathway were investigated. Cyclin D1 was dominant among the D-type cyclins, formed abundant complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) Cdk4 rather than Cdk6, and the immunoprecipitated cyclin D1/Cdk4 holoenzyme was active as a pRB kinase. Electroporation of wild-type pl6CDKN2 arrested the Granta 519 cells in G1, consistent with the p16CDKN2 loss as a biologically relevant event during multistep evolution of the tumor, and with the expression of functional pRB. Direct cooperation of these distinct abnormalities to cell-cycle, deregulation in NHL cells was suggested by G1 acceleration upon inducible overexpression of cyclin D1 in a control breast cancer cell line lacking p16CDKN2, an effect which could be prevented by ectopic expression of p16CDKN2. Taken together, these data suggest that concurrent overexpression of cyclin D1 and functional elimination of p16CDKN2 and p15CDKN2B may characterize certain cases of mantle cell NHL, and that cooperation of the abnormalities is likely to provide a growth advantage of the tumour cells through more efficient inactivation of the RB tumor suppressor. Further clinicopathologic studies of this possibility are warranted.","['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,

G1-CKIs might play an important role not only as tumor suppressor genes but also in cellular differentiation. We examined constitutive and differentiation-induced expression and regulation of the four members of the G1-CKI family p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p18INK4C and p19INK4D in acute myeloid leukemia as well as their expression in normal granulocytes and monocytes. p18INK4C and p19INK4D mRNA were expressed constitutively at high levels in seven myeloid cell lines and 16 AML patient samples, whereas expression of p15INK4B mRNA was very low and only detectable by nested RT-PCR analysis. During phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation of leukemic HL-60 cells expression of particular G1-CKIs was disparately regulated. This process was associated with growth arrest of the majority of the cells (> or = 80%) in G1/G0, and in parallel p15INK4B were upregulated whereas p18INK4C and p19INK4D expression was downregulated. In contrast, granulocytic differentiation induced by DMSO was accompanied by an increase of p18INK4C and p19INK4D expression only. PMA treatment of blast cells from two AML patients confirmed these cell line results. Disparate regulation of p15INK4B and p18INK4C mRNA was dependent on intermediary protein synthesis and occurred at the post-transcriptional level as shown by nuclear run-on analysis and mRNA half-life studies. In normal granulocytes and monocytes low constitutive p15INK4B and p18INK4C mRNA expression was detectable by RT-PCR only, but p19INK4D transcripts were noted by Northern blotting in both cell types. Disparate expression of G1-specific cell cycle inhibitors indicates complex and divergent roles of particular CKIs during normal and leukemic myeloid hematopoiesis.","['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2C protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2D protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p19)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,

This discordance suggests that a CsA-sensitive drug efflux mechanism distinct from P-gp is expressed in many clinical samples. In the present study using the ATP depleting agents cyanide, azide, or dinitrophenol to inhibit energy dependent transport processes, we observed even larger increases in daunorubicin accumulation than were seen with CsA. Similar patterns were seen in a wide range of P-gp negative human cancer cell lines. Also the observed cyanide effect did not correlate with the expression of mRNA for multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), the only other member of the ABC family of membrane transporters that is known to be capable of effluxing daunorubicin. Thse results suggest that daunorubicin accumulation in many cases of AML is modulated by one or more novel energy-dependent processes that are distinct from P-gp or MRP.

Between May 1986 and May 1989, 15 patients with histologically confirmed hairy cell leukemia resistant to IFN-alpha received DCF 4 mg/m2 every 2 weeks with 12 cycles planned. All 15 patients were evaluable for response and have been followed for a median of 88 months (range, 72 to 106 months) from the start of therapy. Fourteen patients responded to DCF, all attaining complete remission (CR) (response rate 93%; 95% confidence interval, 69% to 100%). Seven patients have developed recurrent disease after 45 to 74 months. Using the method of Kaplan and Meier, the median remission duration is 74 months and, at 8 years, 46% (95% confidence interval, 33% to 59%) of patients are projected to be in ongoing CR. The seven relapsing patients have responded to treatment with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) and all 15 patients remain alive. After DCF, nadir CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts were significantly lower than prior to therapy (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.05, respectively), but returned to baseline levels during follow-up. Median times to attainment of the lower limit of the normal range of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were 54 and 36 months, respectively. Those patients who had previously undergone splenectomy (n=7) had higher baseline CD4+ (P= 0.073) and CD8+ (P= 0.043) lymphocyte counts and more rapid recovery of both CD4+ (P= 0.027) and CD8+ lymphocyte counts (P = 0.016) than non-splenectomized patients. One elderly patient (age, 78 years) was diagnosed with subsequent malignancy. No late opportunistic infections were observed. Resistance to IFN-alpha does not impair subsequent responsiveness of patients with hairy cell leukemia to treatment with DCF. Responses are durable and without evidence of long-term sequelae. CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte subsets recover slowly without clinical manifestations of immunodeficiency. Splenectomized patients appear to have higher baseline lymphocyte counts and more rapid lymphocyte recovery following treatment with DCF.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 174 patients with de novo AML in the age group 17-65 years were included. The patients have now been followed till death or for at least 7 years, and an evaluation of the long-term survival and the risk of developing secondary neoplasms has been made. The overall survival rate 5-years after diagnosis was 23%, and after 10 years 19%. No difference was found between the two treatment regimens in overall survival or disease-free survival (DFS). For the subgroup of 99 patients who achieved complete remission after one or two induction courses, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 35% and 31% respectively, with the highest survival rates in the age group 17-39 years (57% at 5 years) as compared with 27% in patients aged 40-60 years (P= 0.007). Seven secondary neoplasms were diagnosed simultaneously with or after the diagnosis of AML indicating a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 3.41, (95% CI: 1.60-7.26). In three cases the secondary neoplasms were diagnosed simultaneously with the AML diagnosis and were for that reason completely unrelated to the chemotherapy administered for AML, as the psammomatous meningeoma diagnosed after only 8 months. The remaining three neoplasms which developed subsequently did not significantly exceed the expected number, with a SIR = 1.46 (0.47-4.57). Thus, no increased risk of solid tumors causally related to the intensive chemotherapy for de novo AML was observed. However, a generally increased risk of solid tumors in patients diagnosed simultaneously with the AML diagnosis seems likely. Over 20% of the patients were alive and in complete remission 5 years after the AML diagnosis, and they have a high probability of surviving the next 5-year period.","['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment options of low-dose Ara-C and haematopoietic growth factors are disappointing in regard to response rate or response duration. We tested the treatment with a 72-h continuous infusion of low-dose 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) in a group of 29 elderly patients with high-risk MDS. In 15 patients (54%) we observed a response. Eight complete responses were reached, even among patients with bad prognostic cytogenetic findings. The actuarial median survival from the start of the therapy was 46 weeks. The only (and major) toxicity was myelosuppression, leading to a prolonged cytopenic period and thus leading to five toxic deaths (17%) in this high-risk patient group. We conclude that DAC is an effective drug in the treatment of MDS patients and that it probably works via its cytotoxic activity. Myelotoxicity is its major adverse effect.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Observations of their lymphocyte-restricted occurrence and a molecular analysis of some translocation breakpoints have suggested that some of these rearrangements are generated by V(D)J recombinase activity. However, a direct correlation between this activity and the generation of such rearrangements has never been established. In addition, because these aberrant rearrangements are usually detected only after a tumor has been formed, the frequency with which the recombinase machinery generates translocations has never been assessed directly. To approach these issues, immunoglobulin light-chain gene rearrangements were induced in pre-B cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of Abelson murine leukemia virus and PCR was used to identify interlocus recombinants. Vlambda Jkappa and Vkappa Jlambda rearrangements as well as signal joints resulting from the recombination of Vlambda and Jkappa coding elements were recovered and were found to be similar in structure to conventional intrachromosomal joints. Because these products were detected only when the cells were undergoing active intralocus rearrangement, they provide direct evidence that translocations can be generated by the V(D)J recombinase machinery. Dilution analyses revealed that interlocus rearrangements occur about 1,000 times less frequently than conventional intralocus rearrangements. Considering the large numbers of lymphocytes generated throughout life, aberrant rearrangements generated by the V(D)J recombinase may be relatively common.","['0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",['AI 35721/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC231815,,,,
