Monoclonal B cell expansions were initially recognized in peripheral blood of otherwise healthy subjects (thus defined monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, MBL) and in most cases share the immunophenotypic profile of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The clinical relevance of this phenomenon is different according to B-cell count: high-count MBL is considered a preneoplastic condition and progresses to CLL requiring treatment at a rate of 1-2% per year, while low-count MBL, though persisting over time, has not shown a clinical correlation with frank leukemia so far. MBL other than CLL-like represent a minority of cases and are ill-defined entities for which clinical and biological information is still scanty. In situ follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are characterized by the localization of atypical lymphoid cells, carrying t(14;18)(q32;q21) or t(11;14)(q13;q32), only in the germinal centers and mantle zones respectively, where their normal counterparts are localized. The localization of these cells indicates that germinal centers or mantle zones provide appropriate microenvironments for cells carrying these oncogenic alterations to survive or proliferate. The progression of these lesions to overt lymphomas occurs rarely and may require the accumulation of additional genetic events. Individuals with these lymphoid proliferations should be managed with caution.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The notion of cancer stem cell gained prominence, several molecules and signalling pathways becoming relevant for diagnosis and treatment. Whether a substantial fraction or only a tiny minority of cells in a tumor can initiate and perpetuate cancer, is still debated. The paradigm of cancer-initiating stem cells has initially been developed with respect to blood cancers where chronic conditions such as myeloproliferative neoplasms are due to mutations acquired in a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC), which maintains the normal hierarchy to neoplastic haematopoiesis. In contrast, acute leukaemia transformation of such blood neoplasms appears to derive not only from HSCs but also from committed progenitors that cannot differentiate. This review will focus on putative novel therapy targets represented by markers described to define cancer stem/initiating cells in malignant gliomas, which have been called 'leukaemia of the brain', given their rapid migration and evolution. Parallels are drawn with other cancers, especially haematopoietic, given the similar rampant proliferation and treatment resistance of glioblastoma multiforme and secondary acute leukaemias. Genes associated with the malignant conditions and especially expressed in glioma cancer stem cells are intensively searched. Although many such molecules might only coincidentally be expressed in cancer-initiating cells, some may function in the oncogenic process, and those would be the prime candidates for diagnostic and targeted therapy. For the latter, combination therapies are likely to be envisaged, given the robust and plastic signalling networks supporting malignant proliferation.","['(c) 2013 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether TNF-alpha can induce apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-positive AML cells and to elucidate the influence of TRAF2. Stable lentiviral mediated down-regulation of TRAF2 resulted in a decrease of phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein AKT and its downstream target GSK-3beta. Induction of apoptosis and impaired proliferation after TNF-alpha exposure were observed.

This study was purposed to investigate the molecular and cytogenetic kinetics and its clinical significance in treatment of APL with ATRA plus arsenic-based induction. The molecular and cytogenetic kinetics was assessed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 32 newly diagnosed APL patients. The results showed that the median PML-RARalpha transcript levels (PML-RARalpha/ABL) were very significantly up-regulated at 14 days of induction therapy compared with that of pre-treatment (40.10% vs 57.74%, P < 0.01), and then decreased at 28 days of induction therapy and at the end of consolidation therapy (6.97% and 0%), respectively. The total of 65.62% and 31.25% patients showed up-regulation of PML-RARalpha transcript at 14 and 28 days after induction, as compared with pretreatment. The PML-RARalpha copies per APL cell before treatment, and at 14 and 28 days after induction were calculated as 0.9, 2.2, 1.4 by the formula of PML-RARA/ABL(%)x2/APL cells (%). With the median follow-up time of 22 months, 32 patients were still in continuous clinical remission and no molecular relapse occurred.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were respectively used to examine the expression of mdr1 mRNA and Pgp in AML cell lines to validate the results of microarray. Western blot was performed to investigate the expression of Pgp, 14-3-3zeta, and anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, MCL-1 proteins. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the subcellular location of 14-3-3zeta protein in HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Transduction with siRNA was used to silence 14-3-3zeta in AML cell lines. Cell count method and flow cytometry of cell cycle were used to analyze the changes of growth of AML cells. The results found that mdr1 mRNA and Pgp did not expressed in HL-60 cells, but significantly overexpressed in HL-60/VCR cells. Except 14-3-3sigma, the expression of other subtypes of 14-3-3 was higher in HL-60/VCR cells than that in HL-60 cells, especially 14-3-3zeta. The higher expression of 14-3-3zeta, BCL-2, MCL-1 protein was observed in HL-60/VCR cells than that in HL-60 cells. These results were same results from gene chip. It was also noticed that 14-3-3zeta was located in the cytoplasma and nuclei of AML cell lines, especially over-expressed in HL-60/VCR cells. Furthermore, suppression of 14-3-3zeta by RNA interference resulted in inhibition of the proliferation of AML cells with decreased protein expression of BCL-2 and MCL-1, especially in HL-60/VCR cells. It is concluded that 14-3-3zeta plays an important role in proliferation of AML cells and associates with BCL-2 and MCL-1 expression. These results suggested that development of therapy targeting 14-3-3zeta may provide novel, effective strategies for refractory and relapsed AML.",,"['Liang, Rong', 'Chen, Xie-Qun', 'Wang, Zhe', 'Xiong, Hua', 'Bai, Qing-Xian', 'Gao, Guang-Xun', 'Dong, Bao-Xia', 'Zhu, Hua-Feng']","['Liang R', 'Chen XQ', 'Wang Z', 'Xiong H', 'Bai QX', 'Gao GX', 'Dong BX', 'Zhu HF']","[""Department of Hematology, Basic Medical Institute, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shaanxi Province, China (E- mail: rongliang1017@gmail.com).""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/*metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",,,2013/09/04 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/09/04 06:00'],"['2013/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2013)04-0866-06 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Aug;21(4):866-71. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2013.04.011.,4,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed significant serum metabonomic differences between AML patients and healthy controls and between AML patients with favorable and intermediate cytogenetic risks. Such differences were highlighted by systems differentiations in multiple metabolic pathways including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, biosynthesis of proteins and lipoproteins, and metabolism of fatty acids and cell membrane components, especially choline and its phosphorylated derivatives.

However, economic considerations have created the need for minimal consensus panels that can yield maximum information at reasonable costs. AIMS: To collect, analyse and correlate the morphologic, immunophenotypic, and the cytogenetic data from the cases of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, which were diagnosed at an Indian speciality cancer centre. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The morphology was recorded after staining the samples with the Leishman or the MGG stains. The lineage assignment was done by using three colour flow cytometry with a primary panel of antibodies. For the cytogenetic studies, the short term culture of the sample cells were arrested by using colcemid and they were G-banded by using trypsin and Giemsa stain. FISH studies were conducted by using a CLL-specific diagnostic kit. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A total of 66 cases were evaluated, which had a median age of 64.5 years and a sex ratio of 2.3:1. Of these 66 cases, 40 cases were of CLL and 9 cases were of atypical CLL. 17 cases were classified as CLPD and these included 13 cases of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, two cases of Hairy Cell Leukaemia, one case of Follicular Lymphoma and one case of Prolymphocytic Leukaemia. In immunophenotyping, the lack of expression of CD22 had the highest correlation with a definitive diagnosis of CLL. Cytogenetics demonstrated a classical follicular lymphoma abnormality, t (14; 18) (q32; q21), in one case. A basic minimal panel is sufficient for the routine diagnosis of CLL. However, the stratification of CLPD requires the use of more extensive panels.",,"['Okaly, Geeta V Patil', 'Nargund, Ashwini R', 'E, Venkataswamy', 'Jayanna, Prashanth K', 'Juvva, Chandra Rao', 'Prabhudesai, Shilpa']","['Okaly GV', 'Nargund AR', 'E V', 'Jayanna PK', 'Juvva CR', 'Prabhudesai S']","['Consultant Pathologist, Triesta Rerearch & Development , Bangalore, Karnataka, India .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130701,India,J Clin Diagn Res,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,101488993,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)', 'Chronic Lymphoproliferative Disorders (CLPD)', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Tertiary Cancer Centre']",2013/09/03 06:00,2013/09/03 06:01,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7860/JCDR/2013/5088.3130 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Diagn Res. 2013 Jul;7(7):1366-71. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5088.3130.

This function reflects their ability to directly interact with activated PTKs and to target them as well as their associated signaling components for ubiquitination. Given the critical roles of PTK signaling in driving oncogenesis, recent studies in animal models and genetic analyses in human cancer have firmly established that Cbl proteins function as tumor suppressors. Missense mutations or small in-frame deletions within the regions of Cbl protein that are essential for its E3 activity have been identified in nearly 5% of leukemia patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders. Based on evidence from cell culture studies, in vivo models and clinical data, we discuss the potential signaling mechanisms of mutant Cbl-driven oncogenesis.

METHODS: Relevant case-control studies were enrolled in the meta-analysis. We applied Rev Man 4.2 software to pool raw data and test studies' heterogeneity and to calculate the incorporated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: Our data showed that the OR for the Gln allele of the Arg399Gln polymorphism, compared with the Arg allele, was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.16-1.57; P<0.0001) for childhood ALL patients. Similarly, the homozygous genotype Gln/Gln and heterozygous genotype Arg/Gln both significantly increased the risk of childhood ALL compared with the wild genotype Arg/Arg (OR =1.58; 95% CI, 1.13-2.21; P=0.008; OR =1.51; 95% CI, 1.21-1.87; P=0.0002). The dominant model of Arg399Gln was associated with childhood ALL risk (OR =1.54; 95% CI, 1.25-1.89; P<0.0001). The ethnic subgroup analysis demonstrated that the Gln allele in all five ethnic groups was prone to be a risk factor for childhood ALL just with different degrees of correlation while Arg194Trp SNP showed a protective or risk factor or irrelevant thing in different races.

METHODS: The clinical and follow-up data of 93 AL patients (median age, 30 years) undergoing allogeneic HSCT in Xiangya Hospital over the past 12 years were collected, and the potential factors affecting the efficacy and prognosis of allogeneic HSCT patients were determined. RESULTS: Hematopoietic reconstitution was achieved in 90 patients. At the last follow-up, the incidences of severe acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) and extensive chronic GvHD (cGvHD) were 14.0% and 20.0%, the 3-year cumulative incidence of transplantation related mortality (TRM) and relapse rate were 16.8%+/-6.1% and 21.3%+/-6.7%, and the estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients were 64.6%+/-5.4% and 56.5%+/-5.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis indicated that age older than 40 years, HLA mismatch, and severe lung infection within the first 100 days after transplantation were risk factors for severe aGvHD, age older than 40 years, HLA mismatch, severe lung infection within the first 100 days after transplantation, and severe aGvHD were risk factors for TRM, high-risk AL and lack of cGvHD were risk factors for relapse (all P<0.05). Survival estimation showed that HLA mismatch, severe lung infection occurring within the first 100 days post-transplantation, high-risk AL severe aGvHD and lack of cGvHD were risk factors associated with poor prognosis (all P<0.05).

In physiology IL-15 trans-presentation by accessory cells leads to pleiotropic activities, including activation of immune cells, such as NK cells. NK cells are largely involved in Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by therapeutic mAbs, such as rituximab, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, in CLL, Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity is relatively impaired by the low E:T ratio (NK/B leukemic cells). Thus, any strategy leading to an increase in NK cell number and activation status can offer new strategies for CLL treatment. To this end, we evaluated the effect of rhIL-15 on autologous NK cell stimulation in CLL samples. We show that rhIL-15 induces NK cell activation and proliferation, leading to improved B leukemic cell depletion. This phenomenon is significantly increased in the presence of anti-CD20 mAbs. In addition, the greater effect of obinutuzumab versus rituximab suggests a cooperative role between rhIL-15 signaling and CD16 signaling in the induction of NK cell proliferation. Moreover, rhIL-15-induced proliferation of autologous NK cells is strictly dependent on their interaction with B leukemic cells, identified in this study as new accessory cells for rhIL-15 trans-presentation. Thus, rhIL-15 is able to promote NK cell-based activity in Ab immunotherapy of CLL.",,"['Laprevotte, Emilie', 'Voisin, Gregory', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Klein, Christian', 'Daugrois, Camille', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Fournie, Jean-Jacques', 'Quillet-Mary, Anne']","['Laprevotte E', 'Voisin G', 'Ysebaert L', 'Klein C', 'Daugrois C', 'Laurent G', 'Fournie JJ', 'Quillet-Mary A']","[""INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1037, Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, BP3028 Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite Purpan, F-31300 Toulouse, France;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130830,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-15/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Rituximab']",,,2013/09/03 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1300187 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1300187 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Oct 1;191(7):3634-40. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1300187.

Although survival rates have improved, patients with certain biologic subtypes still have suboptimal outcomes. Current chemotherapeutic regimens are associated with short- and long-term toxicities and novel, less toxic therapeutic strategies are needed. Mer receptor tyrosine kinase is ectopically expressed in ALL patient samples and cell lines. Inhibition of Mer expression reduces prosurvival signaling, increases chemosensitivity, and delays development of leukemia in vivo, suggesting that Mer tyrosine kinase inhibitors are excellent candidates for targeted therapies. Brain and spinal tumors are the second most common malignancies in childhood. Multiple chemotherapy approaches and radiotherapies have been attempted, yet overall survival remains dismal. Mer is also abnormally expressed in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT), providing a rationale for targeting Mer as a therapeutic strategy. We have previously described UNC569, the first small-molecule Mer inhibitor. This article describes the biochemical and biologic effects of UNC569 in ALL and AT/RT. UNC569 inhibited Mer activation and downstream signaling through ERK1/2 and AKT, determined by Western blot analysis. Treatment with UNC569 reduced proliferation/survival in liquid culture, decreased colony formation in methylcellulose/soft agar, and increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapies. MYC transgenic zebrafish with T-ALL were treated with UNC569 (4 mumol/L for two weeks). Fluorescence was quantified as indicator of the distribution of lymphoblasts, which express Mer and enhanced GFP. UNC569 induced more than 50% reduction in tumor burden compared with vehicle- and mock-treated fish.

According to the current classification PAH can be associated with exposure to certain drugs or toxins, particularly to appetite suppressant intake drugs, such as aminorex, fenfluramine derivatives and benfluorex. These drugs have been confirmed to be risk factors for PAH and were withdrawn from the market. The supposed mechanism is an increase in serotonin levels, which was demonstrated to act as a growth factor for the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Amphetamines, phentermine and mazindol were less frequently used, but are considered possible risk factors, for PAH. Dasatinib, dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia was associated with cases of severe PAH, potentially in part reversible after dasatinib withdrawal. Recently, several studies have raised the issue of potential endothelial dysfunction that could be induced by interferon, and a few cases of PAH have been reported with interferon therapy.

A phosphoproteomics approach to the analysis of a hematopoietic progenitor cell line treated with CXCL12 and the Rac 1 and 2 inhibitor NSC23766 has been employed to objectively discover novel mechanisms for regulation of stem cells in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. The proteomic data sets identified new aspects of CXCL12-mediated signaling and novel features of stem cell regulation. We also identified a novel phosphorylation event in hematopoietic progenitor cells that correlated with motile response and governed by the chemotactic factor CXCL12. The novel phosphorylation site on PTPRC/CD45; a protein tyrosine phosphatase, was validated by raising an antibody to the site and also using a mass spectrometry absolute quantification strategy. Site directed mutagenesis and inhibitor studies demonstrated that this single phosphorylation site governs hematopoietic progenitor cell and lymphoid cell motility, lies downstream from Rac proteins and potentiates Src signaling.

Previously, we reported oncogenic interactions between homeobox (Hox) genes and E2A-PBX1 in murine T cell leukemia. A proviral insertional mutagenesis screen with our E2A-PBX1 B cell leukemia mouse model identified Hoxa genes as potential collaborators to E2A-PBX1. Here we studied whether Hoxa9 could enhance E2A-PBX1 leukemogenesis. RESULTS: We show that Hoxa9 confers a proliferative advantage to E2A-PBX1 B cells. Transplantation experiments with E2A-PBX1 transgenic B cells overexpressing Hoxa9 isolated from bone marrow chimeras showed that Hoxa9 accelerates the generation of E2A-PBX1 B cell leukemia, but Hoxa9 is unable to transform B cells alone. Quantitative-reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated a strong repression of B cell specific genes in these E2A-PBX1/Hoxa9 leukemias in addition to Flt3 activation, indicating inhibition of B cell differentiation in combination with enhanced proliferation. Overexpression of Hoxa9 in established E2A-PBX1 mouse leukemic B cells resulted in a growth advantage in vitro, which was also characterized by an enhanced expression of Flt3. CONCLUSIONS: we show for the first time that Hoxa9 collaborates with E2A-PBX1 in the oncogenic transformation of B cells in a mouse model that involves Flt3 signaling, which is potentially relevant to human disease.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hassawi, Mona', 'Shestakova, Elena A', 'Fournier, Marilaine', 'Lebert-Ghali, Charles-Etienne', 'Vaisson, Gratianne', 'Frison, Heloise', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Vidal, Ramon', 'Thompson, Alexander', 'Bijl, Janet J']","['Hassawi M', 'Shestakova EA', 'Fournier M', 'Lebert-Ghali CE', 'Vaisson G', 'Frison H', 'Sinnett D', 'Vidal R', 'Thompson A', 'Bijl JJ']","['Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont Research Center, Montreal, QC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131007,United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Hox genes', 'oncogenes', 'transcription factors', 'transgenic mouse model']",2013/09/03 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2013/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dvdy.24056 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2014 Jan;243(1):145-58. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.24056.

In the present study, we examined the action of tipifarnib in human acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines and clinical samples. In contrast to the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway-mediated Bim upregulation that is responsible for tipifarnib-induced killing of malignant lymphoid cells, inhibition of Rheb-induced mTOR signaling followed by dose-dependent upregulation of Bax and Puma occurred in acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines undergoing tipifarnib-induced apoptosis. Similar Bax and Puma upregulation occurred in serial bone marrow samples harvested from a subset of acute myelogenous leukemia patients during tipifarnib treatment. Expression of FTI-resistant Rheb M184L, like knockdown of Bax or Puma, diminished tipifarnib-induced killing. Further analysis demonstrated that increased Bax and Puma levels reflect protein stabilization rather than increased gene expression. In U937 cells selected for tipifarnib resistance, neither inhibition of signaling downstream of Rheb nor Bax and Puma stabilization occurred. Collectively, these results not only identify a pathway downstream from Rheb that contributes to tipifarnib cytotoxicity in human acute myelogenous leukemia cells, but also demonstrate that FTI-induced killing of lymphoid versus myeloid cells reflects distinct biochemical mechanisms downstream of different farnesylated substrates.

The impact of these mutations on outcome of myelodysplastic syndrome and their progression to secondary acute myeloid leukemia remains unclear. Mutation status of TET2, IDH1 and IDH2 was investigated in a cohort of 46 paired myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia samples and 122 non-paired cases with de novo myelodysplastic syndrome, to clarify their roles in the evolution of myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia. Among the 168 de novo myelodysplastic syndrome patients, the frequency of TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations was 18.5%, 4.2% and 6.0%, respectively. TET2/IDH mutations had no impact on survivals, while TET2 mutations were significantly associated with rapid progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Seventeen of the 46 paired myelodysplastic syndrome/secondary acute myeloid leukemia samples harbored TET2/IDH mutations; none acquired these mutations in acute myeloid leukemia phase. Progression to acute myeloid leukemia was accompanied by evolution of a novel clone or expansion of a minor pre-existing subclone of one or more distinct mutations in 12 of the 17 cases with TET2/IDH mutations.

In multivariable analysis mPV diagnosis was an independent predictor of poor survival along with age >65 years and leukocyte count >10 x 10(9) /L. Our data suggest that mPV is a heterogeneous myeloproliferative neoplasia and not necessarily an early/ pre-polycythemic form of classical PV that at onset in a small fraction of patients clinically may mimic essential thrombocythemia. On the other hand, the majority mPV may have a longer prodrome of undiagnosed PV or a disease biology akin to primary myelofibrosis-post PV myelofibrosis that could explain the worsening of outcome in comparison to overt/classical manifestations.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Barbui, Tiziano', 'Thiele, Jurgen', 'Gisslinger, Heinz', 'Finazzi, Guido', 'Carobbio, Alessandra', 'Rumi, Elisa', 'Luigia Randi, Maria', 'Bertozzi, Irene', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Pieri, Lisa', 'Carrai, Valentina', 'Gisslinger, Bettina', 'Mullauer, Leonhard', 'Ruggeri, Marco', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Barbui T', 'Thiele J', 'Gisslinger H', 'Finazzi G', 'Carobbio A', 'Rumi E', 'Luigia Randi M', 'Bertozzi I', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Pieri L', 'Carrai V', 'Gisslinger B', 'Mullauer L', 'Ruggeri M', 'Rambaldi A', 'Tefferi A']","['Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130919,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythrocyte Indices', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombosis/etiology']",,,2013/09/03 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2013/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23585 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Jan;89(1):52-4. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23585.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided the first unambiguous evidence for common inherited susceptibility to BCP-ALL, identifying susceptibility loci at 7p12.2, 9p21.3, 10q21.2, and 14q11.2. To identify additional BCP-ALL susceptibility loci, we conducted a GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with a published GWAS totaling 1658 cases and 4723 controls, with validation in 1449 cases and 1488 controls. Combined analysis identified novel loci mapping to 10p12.2 (rs10828317, odds ratio [OR] = 1.23; P = 2.30 x 10(-9)) and 10p14 marked by rs3824662 (OR = 1.31; P = 8.62 x 10(-12)). The single nucleotide polymorphism rs10828317 is responsible for the N215S polymorphism in exon 7 of PIP4K2A, and rs3824662 localizes to intron 3 of the transcription factor and putative tumor suppressor gene GATA3. The rs10828317 association was shown to be specifically associated with hyperdiploid ALL, whereas the rs3824662-associated risk was confined to nonhyperdiploid non-TEL-AML1 + ALL. The risk allele of rs3824662 was correlated with older age at diagnosis (P < .001) and significantly worse event-free survivorship (P < .0001).

Here we report biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterization of the interaction between DOT1L and MLL fusion proteins, AF9/ENL. The AF9/ENL-binding site in human DOT1L was mapped, and the interaction site was identified to a 10-amino acid region (DOT1L865-874). This region is highly conserved in DOT1L from a variety of species. Alanine scanning mutagenesis analysis shows that four conserved hydrophobic residues from the identified binding motif are essential for the interactions with AF9/ENL. Binding studies demonstrate that the entire intact C-terminal domain of AF9/ENL is required for optimal interaction with DOT1L. Functional studies show that the mapped AF9/ENL interacting site is essential for immortalization by MLL-AF9, indicating that DOT1L interaction with MLL-AF9 and its recruitment are required for transformation by MLL-AF9.

This locus encodes a pair of critical proapoptotic microRNAs, miR-15a/16-1. Decreased levels of miR-15a/16-1 are critical for the increased survival exhibited by CLL cells. Similarly, in a de novo murine model of CLL, the NZB strain, germline-encoded regulation of the syntenic region resulted in decreased miR-15a/16-1. In this paper, we have identified additional molecular mechanisms regulating miR-15a/16-1 levels and have shown that the transcription factor BSAP (B-cell-specific activator protein) directly interacts with Dleu2, the host gene containing the miR-15a/16-1 loci, and by negative regulation of the Dleu2 promoter, results in repression of miR-15a/16-1 expression. CLL patient B-cell expression levels of BSAP were increased compared with control sources of B cells. With the use of small interfering RNA-mediated repression, the levels of BSAP were decreased in vitro in the NZB-derived malignant B-1 cell line, LNC, and in ex vivo CLL patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). BSAP knockdown led to an increase in the expression of miR-15a/16-1 and an increase in apoptosis, and a cell cycle arrest in both the cell line and patient PBMCs. Moreover, using Dleu2 promoter analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we have shown that BSAP directly interacts with the Dleu2 promoter.

Here, cytofluorimetric analysis revealed higher proportions of bone marrow (BM) CAFs in patients with active MM (both at diagnosis and relapse) compared with patients in remission or those with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or deficiency anemia (controls). CAFs from MM patients produced increased levels of transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-6, stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha, insulin-like growth factor-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 and displayed an activated and heterogeneous phenotype, which supported their origin from resident fibroblasts, endothelial cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells via the endothelial-mesenchymal transition as well as mesenchymal stem cells via the mesenchymal transition, as both of these processes are induced by MM cells and CAFs. Active MM CAFs fostered chemotaxis, adhesion, proliferation and apoptosis resistance in MM cells through cytokine signals and cell-to-cell contact, which were inhibited by blocking CXCR4, several integrins and fibronectin. MM cells also induced the CAFs proliferation. In syngeneic 5T33MM and xenograft mouse models, MM cells induced the expansion of CAFs, which, in turn, promoted MM initiation and progression as well as angiogenesis. In BM biopsies from patients and mice, nests of CAFs were found in close contact with MM cells, suggesting a supportive niche.

This functional study of OSM enabled us to develop a two-dimensional small-molecule screen that shifts hBMSC differentiation from adipocyte to osteoblast. Several structurally related compounds (isoxazoles) inhibited the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, whereas they promoted alkaline phosphatase activity and extracellular matrix calcification. Isoxazoles also reduced the expression of adipogenic transcription factor PPARgamma and increased the levels of osteogenic transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix. They also induced the expression of the Wnt/beta-catenin downstream gene and TOPflash reporter; however, the dephosphorylated beta-catenin-active form was not significantly increased. Interestingly, the slight modification of the active compound led to a complete reversion of the dual differentiation activities. In summary, we have identified isoxazoles with anti-adipogenic and pro-osteogenic activities that provide a potential new tool for exploring the lineage commitment of mesenchymal stem cells and a possible lead for therapeutic intervention in osteopenia and osteoporosis.","['(c) 2013 International Society of Differentiation.

In florid relapse, however, the efficacy of DLI is limited with substantial risk of severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Here, we develop a novel risk-adapted strategy characterized by pre-emptive DLI initiated at the time of mixed chimerism, a small starting dose based on donor source, dose-escalation guided by real-time chimerism monitoring and withholding of DLI immediately in patients achieving full donor chimerism. A total of 178 DLIs were given to 38 patients with mixed chimerism; thereafter, 33 patients (86.8%) had donor chimerism successfully increased, including 30 (78.9%) who had chimerism fully converted back to 100% donor. Cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower (P=0.00004) and overall survival higher (P=0.0003) in patients with chimerism fully corrected as compared with those of patients whose chimerism remained mixed.

MC and its major constituent, thymol, inhibit the cell proliferation in different types of cancer cell lines like HL-60, MCF-7, PC-3, A-549 and MDAMB-231. MC was found to be more cytotoxic than thymol in HL-60 cells with an IC50 value of 22 mug/ml versus 45 mug/ml for thymol. Both MC and thymol induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells, which is evident by Hoechst staining, cell cycle analysis and immuno-expression of Bcl-xL, caspase-3,-8,-9 and PARP-1 cleavage. Both induce apoptosis by extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways that were confirmed by enhanced expression of death receptors (TNF-R1, Fas), caspase-9, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and regression of Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Interestingly, both MC and thymol inhibit the downstream and upstream signaling of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

E804, a potent derivative of indirubin inhibits the activation of Stat3 and Stat5 in chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) cells. However, physicochemical properties and permeation rate of the compound relevant to the drug formulation have never been reported. Therefore, the ionization constant (pK(a)), lipophilicity (logD/P), aqueous and organic solubility of E804 and its permeation across Caco-2 cells were investigated. Both high throughput and traditional determinations were used in this study. The Caco-2 cell permeation assay was carried out in Poloxamer 188/HBSS++ solution in order to maintain the solubility of drug. The potential P-gp (P-glycoprotein) interaction for E804 was determined through Calcein-AM uptake assay. The results showed that E804 did not have a detectable pK(a) in the range of pH 2-11. Log D (distribution coefficient) and Log P (partition coefficient) were determined to be 3.54 +/- 0.03. Aqueous solubility test revealed that E804 is practically insoluble in water. Among organic solvents E804 showed the highest solubility in DMSO. The P(app A-->B) and P(app B-->A) across Caco-2 cell monolayer were 2.0 +/- 0.25 x 10(-6)cm/s and 1.14 +/- 0.12 x 10(-6)cm/s respectively, and the calculated efflux ratio (ER) was 0.57. Calcein-AM uptake assay showed that E804 was not a strong substrate for P-gp. The results indicate that solubility is the major rate limiting step for the drug permeation. The high membrane permeability makes E804 promising for the oral delivery. Therefore, further investigation on solubility of E804 in lipid vehicles is needed to determine an appropriate formulation for the drug.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To dissect the mechanism of action of this complex, we decided to identify new proteins interacting with MOZ. We found that the scaffold protein Symplekin that supports the assembly of polyadenylation machinery was identified by mass spectrometry. Symplekin interacts and co-localizes with both MOZ and MLL in immature hematopoietic cells. Its inhibition leads to a decrease of the HOXA9 protein level but not of Hoxa9 mRNA and to an over-recruitment of MOZ and MLL onto the HOXA9 promoter.

We found higher expression of CD85j compared to HV and the positive correlation between expression of HLA-G and CD85j. All the CLL cells expressed TLR-9, and the level of expression positively correlated with expression of HLA-G and CD85j. Patients with higher expression of intracellular expression of TLR-9 have significantly longer treatment-free survival than patients with low expression of TLR-9 (57 months vs. 8 months, respectively). Summarizing in CLL we characterized activatory and inhibitory components of immune system that might be connected functionally. Analysis of TLR-9 expression might have additional prognostic value for CLL patients.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The various cell surface receptors trigger very diverse signal transduction pathways including activation of heterotrimeric and monomeric G-proteins, receptor-induced and store-operated Ca(2+) signals, protein and lipid kinases, adapter proteins and cytoskeletal rearrangement.

However, most drugs rapidly lose their efficacy as a result of resistance development. We explored the potential of combinational siRNA silencing to prevent growth of drug-resistant breast cancer cells independent of chemotherapy. Resistance was induced in two breast cancer lines by chronic exposure to doxorubicin. Microarray analysis of apoptosis-related proteins showed Bcl2, survivin, NF B, and Mcl1 to be prominently up-regulated in drug-resistant cells. Human siRNA libraries against apoptosis-related proteins and kinases were screened using lipid-substituted polymers as non-viral carrier, and siRNAs were selected to diminish cell growth without affecting growth of skin fibroblasts. Surprisingly, the selected siRNAs led to similar responses in wild-type and drug-resistant cells, despite their phenotypic differences. Promising kinase siRNAs were co-delivered with anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 siRNA and Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase (RPS6KA5) was found the most promising candidate for simultaneous silencing with Mcl-1. In both MDA435 wild type (WT) and MDA435 resistant (R) xenografts in nude mice, double silencing of Mcl-1/RPS6KA5 also led to improved inhibition of tumor growth in the absence of chemotherapy. We conclude that combinational silencing of well-selected targets could be a feasible therapeutic strategy in the absence of drug therapy and could provide a new avenue for therapy of drug-resistant breast cancers.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, two commonly used genomic repeats of Toxoplasma gondii, RE (GenBank accession number AF146527) and B1, were compared to each other in nested-PCR assay. Five hundred and thirty-five blood samples from children with leukemia were tested for the presence of T. gondii antibodies using enzyme immunoassays. One hundred and ten DNA samples of these patients (50 IgM+, IgG+, 10 IgM-, IgG+, and 50 IgM-, IgG-) were analyzed by nested-PCR. The specificity of two nested PCR assays was determined using the DNA samples of other parasites and human chromosomal DNA. As a result, 82% (41/50) and 68% (34/50) of the IgM+, IgG+ samples were positive on duplicate RE and B1-nested PCR analyses, respectively. None of the 10 IgM-, IgG+ seropositive samples was detected positive after testing RE and B1-nested PCR assays in duplicate. One (2%) of the 50 seronegative samples was positive by duplicate RE-nested PCR but none of them were positive by duplicate B1-nested PCR. The detection limit of the RE-nested PCR assay was 640 fg of T. gondii DNA whereas this rate for B1-nested PCR was 5.12 pg of the DNA template. No cross-reactivity with the DNA of other parasites and human chromosomal DNA was found. The results indicate that an RE-based nested PCR assay is more sensitive than B1 genomic target, of those tested, for detection of T. gondii.

S1P responses are mediated by five G protein coupled receptors of which three types (S1P1R-S1P3R) have been described to be of importance in vascular endothelial cells (EC). Whereas the S1P1R regulates endothelial barrier function by coupling to Galphai and the monomeric GTPase Rac1, the signaling pathways involved in the S1P-induced regulation of angiogenesis are ill defined. We therefore studied the sprouting of human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) in vitro and analyzed the activation of the RhoGTPases RhoA and RhoC. Physiological relevant concentrations of S1P (100-300nM) induce a moderate activation of RhoA and RhoC. Inhibition or siRNA-mediated depletion of the S1P2R preferentially decreased the activation of RhoC. Both manipulations caused an increase of sprouting in a spheroid based in vitro sprouting assay. Interestingly, a similar increase in sprouting was detected after effective siRNA-mediated knockdown of RhoC. In contrast, the depletion of RhoA had no influence on sprouting. Furthermore, suppression of the activity of G proteins of the Galpha12/13 subfamily by adenoviral overexpression of the regulator of G protein signaling domain of LSC as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Rho specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor leukemia associated RhoGEF (LARG) inhibited the S1P-induced activation of RhoC and concomitantly increased sprouting of HUVEC with similar efficacy. We conclude that the angiogenic sprouting of EC is suppressed via the S1P2R subtype. Thus, the increase in basal sprouting can be attributed to blocking of the inhibitory action of autocrine S1P stimulating the S1P2R. This inhibitory pathway involves the activation of RhoC via Galpha12/13 and LARG, while the simultaneously occurring activation of RhoA is apparently dispensable here.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Del Galdo, Sabrina', 'Vettel, Christiane', 'Heringdorf, Dagmar Meyer Zu', 'Wieland, Thomas']","['Del Galdo S', 'Vettel C', 'Heringdorf DM', 'Wieland T']","['Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Mannheim Medical Faculty, Heidelberg University, Maybachstrasse 14, 68169 Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130830,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysophospholipids/*metabolism', '*Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'rhoC GTP-Binding Protein']",['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'Leukemia associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor', 'RhoC', 'RhoGTPases', 'S1P(2) receptor', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate']",2013/09/03 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(13)00252-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.08.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2013 Dec;25(12):2478-84. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.08.017.

So far, TERT has been reported to be over-expressed in more than 90% of cancers, thereby playing a critical role in sustained proliferation and survival potentials of various cancer cells. Over the past decade, a comprehensive network of transcription factors has been shown to be involved in the regulation of TERT. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has suggested that TERT could modulate the expression of numerous genes involved in diverse group of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and cellular signaling. Therefore, it indicates that TERT is both an effector and a regulator in carcinoma. However, the mechanisms of the interaction between TERT and its target genes are still not fully understood. Thus, it is necessary to consolidate and summarize recent developments of the cross-talk between TERT and related genes in cancer cells or other cells with cancer cell characteristics, and elucidate these relevant mechanisms. In this review, we focus on various signaling pathways and genes that participate in the feedback regulation of TERT and the underlying feedback loop mechanism of TERT, further providing new insights into non-telomeric functions of telomerase and potentially to be used as a novel therapeutic target for cancer.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Wu, Xiao-Qin', 'Huang, Cheng', 'He, Xu', 'Tian, Yuan-Yao', 'Zhou, De-Xi', 'He, Yong', 'Liu, Xin-Hua', 'Li, Jun']","['Wu XQ', 'Huang C', 'He X', 'Tian YY', 'Zhou DX', 'He Y', 'Liu XH', 'Li J']","['School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Meishan Road, Hefei, 230032, China; Institute for Liver Diseases of Anhui Medical University (AMU), China; Key Laboratory of Antiinflammatory and Immune Medicine, Anhui Medical University, Ministry of Education, Hefei, 230032, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130829,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Telomerase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['APC', 'ATL', 'BRG1', 'Brahma-related gene 1', 'C-terminal extension', 'COX-2', 'CSCs', 'CTE', 'Cancer', 'DAT', 'ECM', 'EMT', 'ES', 'FAK', 'Feedback loop', 'Frz', 'GSK3beta', 'HIF1-alpha', 'IKK', 'IL-6', 'IkappaBalpha', 'Jab1', 'Klf', 'Kruppel-like factor 4', 'LPS', 'LRP5/6', 'MMP-9', 'Non-telomeric function', 'PI3K', 'PTEN', 'PtdIns3 kinase', 'RNA interference', 'RNAi', 'RNP', 'RT', 'RTKs', 'SCLC', 'SMARCA4', 'SWI/SNF-related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin,', 'subfamily A, member 4', 'T-cell factor-lymphoid enhancer-binding factor', 'TEN', 'TERT', 'TERT RNA-binding', 'TGF-beta', 'TNF-alpha', 'TR', 'TRAP', 'TRB', 'TRF', 'Tcf-Lef', 'Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)', 'VEGF', 'adenomatous polyposis coli', 'adult T-cell leukemia', 'bHLHZip', 'basic helix-loop helix-leucine-zipper', 'c-Jun activation domain-binding protein-1', 'cancer stem cells', 'cyclooxygenase-2', 'dissociates activities of telomerase', 'embryonic stem', 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'extracellular matrix', 'focal adhesion kinase', 'frizzled', 'glycogen synthase kinase 3beta', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha', 'inhibitor of NF-kappaB', 'inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase', 'interleukin-6', 'lipopolysaccharide', 'low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6', 'matrix metalloproteinase-9', 'pRb', 'phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10', 'phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein', 'receptor tyrosine kinases', 'reverse transcriptase', 'ribonucleoprotein', 'small cell lung cancer', 'telomerase RNA', 'telomerase essential N-terminal', 'telomerase reverse transcriptase', 'telomeric repeat amplification protocol', 'terminal restriction fragment', 'transforming growth factor-beta', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha', 'vascular endothelial growth factor']",2013/09/03 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2013/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(13)00244-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.08.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2013 Dec;25(12):2462-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.08.009.

Oncogenic activation of ERK1/2 is essential for both the initial phase of cellular proliferation as well as subsequent premature senescence, but little is known about the specific contribution of ERK1 versus 2 to OIS. Here we show that depletion of ERK2 but not ERK1 by shRNA knockdown in MEFs leads to continuous proliferation bypassing senescence even in the presence of oncogenic HRAS(V12). Upon depletion of ERK2, induction of both p19(Arf) and p16(Ink4a) was significantly compromised after oncogenic HRAS(V12) expression, attenuating activation of the key tumor suppressors p53 and pRb. Here we demonstrate that ERK2 but not ERK1 indirectly regulates p19(Arf) and p16(Ink4a) both at the transcriptional and translational level. Oncogenic Ras expression after ERK2 knockdown downregulates Fra-1 and c-Jun, components of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) heterodimer essential for transactivation of p19(Arf). Similarly we show a significant decrease in the activation of p38 MAPK and ETS family members which are involved in the induction of p16(Ink4a). The role of ERK2 in translational regulation is observed by the lack of tuberin (TSC2) and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) phosphorylation, components of the mTOR pathway, which enhances p19(Arf) mRNA translation during oncogenic Ras-induced senescence. These observations suggest that ERK2 but not ERK1 contributes to upregulation of p19(Arf) and p16(Ink4a) in a transcription- and translation-dependent manner during oncogenic Ras-induced senescence. Taken together, our data indicate that ERK2 is the key ERK isoform mediating the senescence signaling pathway downstream of oncogenic Ras.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Shin, Jimin', 'Yang, Jiwon', 'Lee, Jang Choon', 'Baek, Kwan-Hyuck']","['Shin J', 'Yang J', 'Lee JC', 'Baek KH']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Gyeonggi 440-746, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130830,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['AP-1', 'Dmp1', 'EMT', 'ERK', 'ERK2', 'GFP', 'MEF', 'MEK', 'NS', 'OIS', 'Oncogenic Ras', 'PI3K', 'PML', 'SA-beta-Gal', 'Senescence', 'TSC2', 'activator protein-1', 'cyclin d-interacting Myb-like protein 1', 'epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation', 'extracellular signal-regulated kinase', 'green fluorescence protein', 'mTOR', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase', 'mouse embryonic fibroblast', 'non-silencing', 'oncogene-induced senescence', 'p16(Ink4a)', 'p19(Arf)', 'p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1', 'p70S6K1', 'pRb', 'phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase', 'phosphorylated histone H2AX', 'promyelocytic leukemia', 'retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein', 'senescence associated beta-galactosidase', 'shRNA', 'short hairpin RNA', 'tuberous sclerosis 2 or tuberin', 'gamma-H2AX']",2013/09/03 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2013/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(13)00249-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2013 Dec;25(12):2540-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.08.014.

We here show that 4.1R exon 16 splicing is altered in response to specific signals. The switch from erythroblastic isoform lacking exon 16 to mature erythrocytic isoform containing this exon is tightly regulated during late erythroid differentiation, and blocage of this splicing switch in erythroleukemia cells is seen as a consequence of the deregulation of important regulatory pathways. We support that combined inhibition of PI3K and activation of p38 signaling pathways impinge on erythroid 4.1R pre-mRNA alternative splicing switch, and on cell differentiation as witnessed by hemoglobin production. By contrast, MEK/ERK signaling appeared not to affect neither cell hemoglobin production nor erythroid 4.1R pre-mRNA splicing. We also found that the signal-induced alternative splicing is not typically distinctive of EPO-non-responsive cells, but operates in EPO-responsive cells as well. Pre-mRNA splicing is a major regulatory mechanism at the crossroad between transcription and translation. We here provide evidence that inhibition of PI3K activates the splicing switch in a promoter-dependent manner, whereas p38 activation induces this event in a promoter-independent fashion. Our data further support that constitutive activation of EPO-R by the viral protein gp55 and the short form of the tyrosine kinase receptor Stk, transduces PI3K proliferation signal, but not MAPK p38 differentiation signal. Concurrently, this work lend credence to the concept that DMSO triggers transient activation of p38 signaling and irreversible inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, hence uncovering an old conundrum regarding the mechanism by which DMSO induces erythroleukemia cell differentiation.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Breig, Osman', 'Theoleyre-Schaal, Orianne', 'Baklouti, Faouzi']","['Breig O', 'Theoleyre-Schaal O', 'Baklouti F']","['mRNA Metabolism in Normal and Pathological Cells, CNRS UMR 5534, Universite Lyon 1, 69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130830,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Exons', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA Precursors/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['BFU-E', 'DMSO', 'EPO', 'EPO-R', 'ERK', 'Erythroid differentiation', 'Erythroleukemia', 'JAK2', 'Janus kinase-2', 'MAPK', 'MAPK p38', 'MEK', 'MEL', 'MTT', 'PI3K', 'SFFV', 'SR protein', 'STAT5', 'Signaling', 'burst forming unit-erythroid', 'dimethylsulfoxide', 'erythropoietin', 'erythropoietin receptor', 'extracellular signal-regulated kinase', 'mRNA splicing', 'methotrexate', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase', 'mouse erythroleukemia', 'phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase', 'serine-arginine-rich protein', 'signal transducers and activators of transcription factor-5', 'spleen focus forming virus']",2013/09/03 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2013/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(13)00246-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2013 Dec;25(12):2453-61. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.08.011.

To date, BH3 mimetics that abrogate anti-apoptotic activity have largely been directed at Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL. One observed mechanism of resistance to these inhibitors is increased Mcl-1 levels in cells exposed to such therapeutics. For this reason, and because Mcl-1 is important in the onset of lymphoid, myeloid, and other cancers, it has become a target of great interest. However, small molecule inhibitors displaying potency and selectivity for Mcl-1 are lacking. Identifying such compounds has been challenging due to difficulties in translating the target selectivity observed at the biochemical level to the cellular level. Herein we report the results of an HTS strategy coupled with directed hit optimization. Compounds identified have selective Mcl-1 inhibitory activity with greater than 100-fold reduced affinity for Bcl-xL. The selectivity of these compounds at the cellular level was validated using BH3 profiling, a novel personalized diagnostic approach. This assay provides an important functional biomarker that allows for the characterization of cells based upon their dependencies on various anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. We demonstrate that cells dependent on Mcl-1 or Bcl-2/Bcl-xL for survival are commensurately responsive to compounds that genuinely target those proteins. The identification of compound 9 with uniquely validated and selective Mcl-1 inhibitory activity provides a valuable tool to those studying the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and highlights an important approach in the development of a first-in-class cancer therapeutic.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A 44-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) treated with prednisone presented with fever and generalized malaise with rapid progression to agitation and confusion. Infection was suspected, but never confirmed on extensive premortem workup. Brain autopsy in both patients revealed severe necrotizing toxoplasmosis virtually confined to periventricular regions.

This therapy involves the transduction of autologous T cells with a viral vector and the subsequent cell expansion. We describe a new, simplified method to produce anti-CD19-CAR T cells. METHODS: T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 paramagnetic beads. After 2 days, the T cells were added to culture bags pre-treated with RetroNectin and loaded with the retroviral anti-CD19 CAR vector. The cells, beads and vector were incubated for 24 h, and a second transduction was then performed. No spinoculation was used. Cells were then expanded for an additional 9 days. RESULTS: The method was validated through the use of two PBMC products from a patient with B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and one PBMC product from a healthy subject. The two PBMC products from the patient with B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia contained 11.4% and 12.9% T cells. The manufacturing process led to final products highly enriched in T cells with a mean CD3+ cell content of 98%, a mean expansion of 10.6-fold and a mean transduction efficiency of 68%. Similar results were obtained from the PBMCs of the first four patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simplified, semi-closed system for the initial selection, activation, transduction and expansion of T cells with the use of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads and bags to produce autologous anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells to support an ongoing clinical trial.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

This report describes the development and characterization of a new class of nucleoside analog that displays anticancer effects against both hematological and adherent cancer cell lines. These new analogs lack canonical hydrogen-bonding groups yet are effective nucleotide substrates for several high-fidelity DNA polymerases. Permutations in the position of the non-hydrogen-bonding functional group greatly influence the kinetic behavior of these nucleosides. One particular analog designated 4-nitroindolyl-2'-deoxynucleoside triphosphate (4-NITP) is unique as it is incorporated opposite C and T with high catalytic efficiencies. In addition, this analog functions as a nonobligate chain terminator of DNA synthesis, since it is poorly elongated. Consistent with this mechanism, the corresponding nucleoside, 4-nitroindolyl-2'-deoxynucleoside (4-NIdR), produces antiproliferative effects against leukemia cells. 4-NIdR also produces cytostatic and cytotoxic effects against several adherent cancer cell lines, especially those that are deficient in mismatch repair and p53. Cell death in this case appears to occur via mitotic catastrophe, a specialized form of apoptosis. Mass spectroscopy experiments performed on nucleic acid isolated from cells treated with 4-NIdR validate that the non-natural nucleoside is stably incorporated into DNA. Xenograft mouse studies demonstrate that administration of 4-NIdR delays tumor growth without producing adverse side effects such as anemia and thrombocytopenia. Collectively, the results of in vitro, cell-based, and animal studies provide evidence for the development of a novel nucleoside analog that shows enhanced effectiveness against solid tumors.",,"['Golden, Jackelyn', 'Motea, Edward', 'Zhang, Xuemei', 'Choi, Jung-Suk', 'Feng, Ye', 'Xu, Yan', 'Lee, Irene', 'Berdis, Anthony J']","['Golden J', 'Motea E', 'Zhang X', 'Choi JS', 'Feng Y', 'Xu Y', 'Lee I', 'Berdis AJ']","['Departments of Pharmacology and double daggerChemistry, Case Western Reserve University , 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130916,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Nucleosides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,2013/09/03 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2013/09/03 06:00'],"['2013/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb400350h [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2013 Nov 15;8(11):2452-65. doi: 10.1021/cb400350h.

STUDY DESIGN: The study population was a consecutive cohort of children diagnosed with cancer and a PAC implanted at diagnosis. Children were evaluated for the presence of PAC-related thrombosis by magnetic resonance venography and the presence of congenital prothrombotic risk factors and PTS. RESULTS: A total of 114 children (median age, 6.04 years) were included. Of these children, 48 (42%) were treated for solid tumors and 66 (58%) were treated for hematopoietic tumors, including 38 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At the time of magnetic resonance venography, 42 children (37%) had the PAC still in place, and 72 (63%) had the PAC removed. Overall, PACs were in place for a total of 324.92 PAC-years. PAC-related thrombosis was detected in 45 children (39.5%) with a current or previous PAC. Of these, 21 (47%) had a solid tumor, 14 (31%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 10 (22%) had another hematopoietic tumor. Younger age at diagnosis, female sex, duration of PAC use, and left-side PAC placement were independently associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, whereas asparaginase therapy and the presence of inherited prothrombotic risk factors were not. Mild PTS (ie, presence of prominent collateral vessels in the skin) was present in 5.6% of the children. CONCLUSION: PAC-related thrombosis is common in pediatric oncology patients. In some children, thrombotic complications can lead to the development of PTS.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Mosby, Inc.

Many studies have focused on the role of HGs in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but very little has been done to understand their effects on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through immunophenotyping, HGs were quantified in 471 BM samples from 292 postchemotherapy AML cases. These samples were analysed to determine whether there is any relationship between HGs percentages and French-American-British (FAB) subtypes or risk stratification of AML. RESULTS: HGs were identified in 57.75% of 471 patient samples (271) with a mean percentage of 3.87 +/- 0.25%. No significant differences were found amongst different FAB subtypes of AML (P > 0.05). However, significant differences (P < 0.05) in HG numbers were noted between AML patients experiencing haematological complete remission (HCR) and those who have relapsed. HGs were identified in 59.9% of samples under HCR with a mean per cent of 3.98 +/- 0.31%, and 36.7% of individuals who have relapsed have detectable HGs with a mean per cent of 1.75 +/- 0.47. In addition, HGs in patients groups with low risk or intermediate risk were elevated when compared with high-risk groups (P < 0.05), whilst no significant difference was found between low-risk patients and intermediate-risk patients (P > 0.05).

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also called human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), is the cause of virtually all cases of MCD occurring in patients with HIV infection. MCD lesions characteristically contain HHV-8-infected polyclonal IgMlambda plasmablasts. A high frequency of HHV-8-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been reported in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We now report on three patients who presented with severe symptoms of MCD, extreme splenomegaly, and rapid expansion of B-cell lymphocytosis (44-81%) attributable to circulating HHV-8 positive plasmablasts. RESULTS: The circulating plasmablastic cells shared the phenotype (IgMlambda, CD19+, CD20- CD138-) of HHV-8-infected cells from MCD lesions, mimicking the leukemic phase of large B-cell lymphoma occurring in HHV-8-related MCD. These patients displayed a very high HHV-8 viral load in blood (>7 logs HHV-8 DNA copies/ml) and high levels of serum vIL-6, the viral homolog of human interleukin 6. Serum IL-6 and IL-10 were also abnormally elevated. HHV-8-infected cells were demonstrated by immunoglobulin gene rearrangement analysis, to be polyclonal and likely represent an expansion of HHV-8-infected cells similar to those found in MCD lesions. CONCLUSION: Thus, the spectrum of HHV-8-related plasmablastic lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with HIV infection is expanded to include HHV-8+ polyclonal IgMlambda B-cell lymphocytosis. At onset, this lymphoproliferative disorder may mimic plasmablastic leukemia/lymphoma. Recognizing this unusual complication may have important implications in treatment decision avoiding unnecessary toxicity to the patients.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

RESULTS: The results demonstrated a significant increase of serum p53 and EGFR in patients with AML (p<0.0001) compared to the control group. Also, the results showed a significant increase of both markers in patients with ALL (p<0.05, p<0.0001 respectively). Sensitivities and specificities for these variables were 52% and 100% for p53, and 73.9%, 95.8% for EGFR. Serum p53 and EGFR could successfully differentiate between M4 and other AML subtypes, while these variables failed to discriminate among ALL subtypes. A positive significant correlation was noted between p53 and EGFR. Negative significant correlations were observed between these variables and both of hemoglobin (Hg) content and RBC count.

However, in practice, deciding on the optimal timing for transplantation is difficult in the case of low/intermediate-1-risk MDS patients under hematologic complete remission with HMA. There is also a remaining question on the role of debulking treatment with the frontline use of HMA in intermediate-2/high-risk MDS patients who are eligible for transplantation. Therefore, our recommendations on the optimal timing of allogeneic transplantation are as follows: for low/intermediate-1-risk MDS patients, start HMA and continue it in responders, then transplantation needs to be performed at the time of a decreasing platelet count before overt relapse or progression to acute myelogenous leukemia. For intermediate-2/high-risk MDS patients, HMA may be indicated as a frontline treatment in all cases, regardless of transplant eligibility, considering its positive role of debulking and lack of negative impact on transplant outcomes.

The aim of the paper is the safety and efficiency, retrospective analysis of liposomal cytarabine used profilactically in patients with rare aggressive lymphomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the analysis we included 19 patients with aggressive lymphomas: LBL (lymphoblastic lymphoma), BL (Burkitt lymphoma) and PTCL (peripheral T- cell lymphoma) from three PLRG (Polish Lymphoma Research Group) centers, who received liposomal cytarabine as primary prevention of central nervous system involvement. All the included patients had a high risk of CNS due to histological subtype (10 patients with LBL, 4 patients with BL), the specific location of the disease (N=3) or the presence of at least 2 risk factors for CNS involvement (elevated LDH, IPI 3-5 or involvement of at least 2 extranodal sites, N = 16). In this group, 18 patients were subjected to prophylaxis during the 1-st line therapy and one after relapse. None of the patients had symptoms of central nervous system involvement at the time of diagnosis. The median age was 43 years (the range of 20-60 years). In this group there were 14 males (73.68%) and 5 females (26.32%). The patients were treated with liposomal cytarabine every 2 to 4 weeks during the systemic chemotherapy. The median number of cytarabine doses was 2 (the range of 1-5). RESULTS: Liposomal cytarabine was well-tolerated. 63.1% of patients had transient side effects (nausea, vomiting, fever, dizziness) in grade 1-2, 5.2% of patients experienced a more severe headache (grade 3). During the average follow-up of 18 months, 50% of patients died and 27.7% of systemic recurrences were noted. Only one patient had a relapse in the CSN con comitant with a systemic recurrence.

A soluble homotrimeric counterpart (sFasL) also exists which is very weakly active, and needs oligomerization beyond its trimeric state to induce apoptosis. We recently generated a soluble FasL chimera by fusing the immunoglobulin-like domain of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor gp190 to the extracellular region of human FasL, which enabled spontaneous dodecameric homotypic polymerization of FasL. This polymeric soluble human FasL (pFasL) displayed anti-tumoral activity in vitro and in vivo without systemic cytotoxicity in mouse. In the present work, we focused on the improvement of pFasL, with two complementary objectives. First, we developed more complex pFasL-based chimeras that contained a cell-targeting module. Secondly, we attempted to improve the production and/or the specific activity of pFasL and of the cell-targeting chimeras. We designed two chimeras by fusing to pFasL the extracellular portions of the HLA-A2 molecule or of a human gamma-delta TCR, and analyzed the consequences of co-expressing these molecules or pFasL together with sFasL on their heterotopic cell production. This strategy significantly enhanced the production of pFasL and of the two chimeras, as well as the cytotoxic activity of the two chimeras but not of pFasL.

We conducted association mapping across an approximately 4 megabase region of the xMHC using a validated panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in childhood BCP-ALL cases (n=567) enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS) compared with population controls (n=892). Logistic regression analyses of 1,145 SNPs, adjusted for age, sex, and Hispanic ethnicity indicated potential associations between several SNPs and childhood BCP-ALL.

METHODS: Macrophages were obtained after differentiation of THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line. Macrophages were exposed for 24 h to 33 nM (10(-5)%) benzalkonium chloride (BAK), 10 nM dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 5 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as controls. The expression of CD11b, CD11c, CD33 and CD54 was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry (FCM). Phagocytosis function was analyzed using carboxylate-modified fluorescent microspheres and quantified by FCM. Migration was evaluated in cocultures with conjunctival epithelial cells. Cytokine production was detected and quantified in culture supernatants using a human cytokine array. RESULTS: Stimulation of THP-1-derived macrophages with a low concentration of BAK increased CD11b and CD11c expression and decreased CD33. Macrophages exposed to BAK, LPS and TNF-alpha had increased phagocytosis. In contrast to LPS, BAK and TNF-alpha increased macrophage migration. Cytokines in supernatants of macrophages exposed to BAK revealed an increased release of CCL1, CCL4/MIP-1beta, TNF-alpha, soluble CD54/ICAM-1 and IL-1beta. CONCLUSION: In vitro, BAK has a direct stimulating effect on macrophages, increasing phagocytosis, cytokine release, migration and expression of CD11b and CD11c. Long-term exposure to low concentrations of BAK should be considered as a stimulating factor responsible for inflammation through macrophage activation.",,"['Michee, Sylvain', 'Brignole-Baudouin, Francoise', 'Riancho, Luisa', 'Rostene, William', 'Baudouin, Christophe', 'Labbe, Antoine']","['Michee S', 'Brignole-Baudouin F', 'Riancho L', 'Rostene W', 'Baudouin C', 'Labbe A']","['INSERM, U968, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130819,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Benzalkonium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phagocytosis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,,2013/08/31 06:00,2014/06/16 06:00,['2013/08/31 06:00'],"['2013/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0072459 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-07656 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 19;8(8):e72459. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0072459. eCollection 2013.,8,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Benzalkonium Compounds)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",PMC3747170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of the elevated levels of these pathways is associated with clinical benefits. However, molecular mechanisms by which endocrine-related pathways and VEGF signalling cooperatively promote breast cancer progression remain poorly understood. In the present study, we show that the A-type cyclin, cyclin A1, known for its important role in the initiation of leukemia and prostate cancer metastasis, is highly expressed in primary breast cancer specimens and metastatic lesions, in contrasting to its barely detectable expression in normal human breast tissues. There is a statistically significant correlation between cyclin A1 and VEGF expression in breast cancer specimens from two patient cohorts (p<0.01). Induction of cyclin A1 overexpression in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 results in an enhanced invasiveness and a concomitant increase in VEGF expression.

Genes amplified on double minute chromosomes include oncogenes and multi-drug resistant genes. These genes encode proteins which contribute to cancer formation, cancer progression, and development of resistance to drugs used in cancer treatment. Elimination of double minute chromosomes, and therefore genes amplified on them, is an effective way to decrease the malignancy of cancer cells. We investigated the effectiveness of a cancer drug, gemcitabine, on the loss of double minute chromosomes from the ovarian cancer cell line UACC-1598. Gemcitabine is able to decrease the number of double minute chromosomes in cells at a 7500X lower concentration than the commonly used cancer drug hydroxyurea. Amplified genes present on the double minute chromosomes are decreased at the DNA level upon gemcitabine treatment. Gemcitabine, even at a low nanomolar concentration, is able to cause DNA damage. The selective incorporation of double minutes chromatin and gamma-H2AX signals into micronuclei provides a strong link between DNA damage and the loss of double minute chromosomes from gemcitabine treated cells. Cells treated with gemcitabine also showed decreased cell growth, colony formation, and invasion.

However, the high incidence of vector-mediated T cell leukemia, caused by vector insertion near or within cancer-related genes has been a serious problem. In this study, we established a gene therapy model of mouse SCID-X1 using a modified foamy virus (FV) vector expressing human gammac. Analysis of vector integration in a human T cell line demonstrated that the FV vector integration sites were significantly less likely to be located within or near transcriptional start sites than RV vector integration sites. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, bone marrow cells from gammac-knockout (gammac-KO) mice were infected with the FV vector and transplanted into gammac-KO mice.

Sumoylation also plays an important role in the replication of many viruses. Previously, we showed that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a SUMO-ligase, K-bZIP, which catalyzes sumoylation of host and viral proteins. We report here that this virus also encodes a gene that functions as a SUMO-targeting ubiquitin-ligase (STUbL) which preferentially targets sumoylated proteins for degradation. K-Rta, the major transcriptional factor which turns on the entire lytic cycle, was recently found to have ubiquitin ligase activity toward a selected set of substrates. We show in this study that K-Rta contains multiple SIMs (SUMO interacting motif) and binds SUMOs with higher affinity toward SUMO-multimers. Like RNF4, the prototypic cellular STUbL, K-Rta degrades SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-2/3 modified proteins, including promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and K-bZIP. PML-NBs (nuclear bodies) or ND-10 are storage warehouses for sumoylated proteins, which negatively regulate herpesvirus infection, as part of the intrinsic immune response. Herpesviruses have evolved different ways to degrade or disperse PML bodies, and KSHV utilizes K-Rta to inhibit PML-NBs formation. This process depends on K-Rta's ability to bind SUMO, as a K-Rta SIM mutant does not effectively degrade PML. Mutations in the K-Rta Ring finger-like domain or SIM significantly inhibited K-Rta transactivation activity in reporter assays and in the course of viral reactivation. Finally, KSHV with a mutation in the Ring finger-like domain or SIM of K-Rta replicates poorly in culture, indicating that reducing SUMO-conjugates in host cells is important for viral replication. To our knowledge, this is the first virus which encodes both a SUMO ligase and a SUMO-targeting ubiquitin ligase that together may generate unique gene regulatory programs.",,"['Izumiya, Yoshihiro', 'Kobayashi, Keisuke', 'Kim, Kevin Y', 'Pochampalli, Mamata', 'Izumiya, Chie', 'Shevchenko, Bogdan', 'Wang, Don-Hong', 'Huerta, Steve B', 'Martinez, Anthony', 'Campbell, Mel', 'Kung, Hsing-Jien']","['Izumiya Y', 'Kobayashi K', 'Kim KY', 'Pochampalli M', 'Izumiya C', 'Shevchenko B', 'Wang DH', 'Huerta SB', 'Martinez A', 'Campbell M', 'Kung HJ']","['Department of Dermatology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, United States of America. yizumiya@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130822,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Herpesviridae Infections/enzymology/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteolysis', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",,,2013/08/31 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/08/31 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1003506 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-12-01048 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(8):e1003506. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003506.

To determine potential functional promiscuity of similar DNA binding domains, we replaced the MLL CXXC domain in the context of the leukemogenic MLL-AF9 fusion with CXXC domains from DNMT1, CGBP (CFP1), and MBD1, or with a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) from MBD1. MLL(DNMT1 CXXC)-AF9 shows robust in vitro colony forming activity and in vivo leukemogenesis, similar to MLL-AF9. However, colony forming ability and leukemogenicity are abrogated in MLL-AF9 containing either the CGBP or MBD1 CXXC domains or the MBD1 MBD domain. Direct comparison of in vitro DNA binding affinity of the isolated CXXC or MBD domains demonstrated that MLL, DNMT1, and CGBP CXXC domains could each bind to unmethylated DNA but with differing affinity. In contrast, the isolated MBD1 CXXC and MBD1 MBD domains were unable to bind to the same DNA. However, all substituted domains still allowed targeting of the MLL fusions to the functionally important Hoxa9 locus in primary bone marrow progenitor cells. In addition to DNA binding activity, it was critical that specific CpG residues in the Hoxa9 locus were protected from methylation for leukemia development. This ultimately prevented histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) of the locus and enabled Hoxa9 expression. These were properties shared by MLL and DNMT1 CXXC domains but not by CGBP CXXC or the other swapped fusions tested.

In the subgroup analysis by clinical types, increased risk was observed in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) subgroup (Gln/Gln versus Arg/Arg: OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.09-1.93; recessive model: OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.00-1.69), but not in acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or chronic myeloid leukemia subgroups, respectively. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism might be a low-penetrant risk factor for leukemia, particularly among Asians.

Antagonists of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) can induce apoptosis in various cancer cells in a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-dependent manner and are in preclinical development. Smac-mimetics promote degradation of cIAP1 and cIAP2, which results in TNFR-mediated apoptosis via formation of a ripoptosome complex, comprising RIPK1, Fas-associated protein with death domain, FLICE-like inhibitory protein and caspase-8. CD40 stimulation of CLL cells in vitro is used as a model to mimic the LN microenvironment and results in NF-kappaB activation and TNFalpha production. In this study, we investigated the response of CLL cells to smac-mimetics in the context of CD40 stimulation. We found that treatment with smac-mimetics results in cIAP1 and cIAP2 degradation, yet although TNFalpha is produced, this did not induce apoptosis. Despite the presence of all components, the ripoptosome complex did not form upon smac-mimetic treatment in CLL cells. Thus, CLL cells seem to possess aberrant upstream NF-kappaB regulation that prevents ripoptosome formation upon IAP degradation.

However, the MSLN regulatory network is still unclear. Here, we investigated the regulation of a panel of tumorigenic factors and explored the potential of MSLN-regulated miR-198 treatment in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression and functional regulation of the tumorigenic factors MSLN, NF-kappaB, and the homeobox transcription factors (TF) POU2F2 (OCT-2), Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox factor 1 (PBX-1), valosin-containing protein (VCP), and miR-198 were studied in pancreatic cancer cell lines, patient tumor samples, and xenograft pancreatic cancer mouse models. RESULTS: We found that miR-198 is downregulated in pancreatic cancer and is involved in an intricate reciprocal regulatory loop with MSLN, which represses miR-198 through NF-kappaB-mediated OCT-2 induction. Furthermore, miR-198 repression leads to overexpression of PBX-1 and VCP. The dysregulated PBX-1/VCP axis leads to increased tumorigenicity. Reconstitution of miR-198 in pancreatic cancer cells results in reduced tumor growth, metastasis, and increased survival through direct targeting MSLN, PBX-1, and VCP. Most interestingly, reduced levels of miR-198 in human tissue samples are associated with upregulation of these tumorigenic factors (MSLN, OCT-2, PBX-1, VCP) and predict poor survival. Reduced miR-198 expression links this tumor network signature and prognosticates poor patient outcome. High miR-198 disrupts the network and predicts better prognosis and increased survival. CONCLUSIONS: miR-198 acts as a central tumor suppressor and modulates the molecular makeup of a critical interactome in pancreatic cancer, indicating a potential prognostic marker signature and the therapeutic potential of attacking this tumorigenic network through a central vantage point.",,"['Marin-Muller, Christian', 'Li, Dali', 'Bharadwaj, Uddalak', 'Li, Min', 'Chen, Changyi', 'Hodges, Sally E', 'Fisher, William E', 'Mo, Qianxing', 'Hung, Mien-Chie', 'Yao, Qizhi']","['Marin-Muller C', 'Li D', 'Bharadwaj U', 'Li M', 'Chen C', 'Hodges SE', 'Fisher WE', 'Mo Q', 'Hung MC', 'Yao Q']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Molecular Surgeon Research Center, Michael E.

Traditional therapies such as anthracyclines and radiation have been recognized for years to have cardiovascular complications. Less expected were the cardiovascular effects of targeted cancer therapies, which were initially thought to be specific to cancer cells and would spare any adverse effects on the heart. Cancers are typically driven by mutations, translocations, or overexpression of protein kinases. The majority of these mutated kinases are tyrosine kinases, though serine/threonine kinases also play key roles in some malignancies. Several agents were developed to target these kinases, but many more are in development. Major successes have been largely restricted to agents targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (mutated or overexpressed in breast cancer), BCR-ABL (chronic myelogenous leukemia and some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and c-Kit (gastrointestinal stromal tumor). Other agents targeting more complex malignancies, such as advanced solid tumors, have had successes, but have not extended life to the degree seen with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Years before the first targeted therapy, Judah Folkman correctly proposed that to address solid tumors one had to target the inherent neoangiogenesis. Unfortunately, emerging evidence confirms that angiogenesis inhibitors cause cardiac complications, including hypertension, thrombosis, and heart failure. And therein lies the catch-22. Nevertheless, cardio-oncology has the potential to be transformative as the human cardiomyopathies that arise from targeted therapies can provide insights into the normal function of the heart.",,"['Ky, Bonnie', 'Vejpongsa, Pimprapa', 'Yeh, Edward T H', 'Force, Thomas', 'Moslehi, Javid J']","['Ky B', 'Vejpongsa P', 'Yeh ET', 'Force T', 'Moslehi JJ']","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced', 'Cardiotoxins/toxicity', 'Humans']",['NOTNLM'],"['HER2-targeted therapies', 'angiogenesis inhibitors', 'anthracyclines', 'cancer', 'cardio-oncology', 'cardiomyopathy', 'chemotherapies']",2013/08/31 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/08/31 06:00'],"['2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['CIRCRESAHA.113.300218 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300218 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2013 Aug 30;113(6):754-64. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300218.,6,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Cardiotoxins)']",PMC4046703,,"['K23 HL095661/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL091799/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL061688/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL114124/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS518689'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examine how medical innovations have influenced trends in cause-specific mortality at the national level. METHODS: Based on literature reviews, we selected six innovations with proven effectiveness against cervical cancer, Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, testicular cancer, and leukaemia. With data on the timing of innovations and cause-specific mortality (1970-2005) from seven European countries we identified associations between innovations and favourable changes in mortality. RESULTS: For none of the five specific cancers, sufficient evidence for an association between introduction of innovations and a positive change in mortality could be found. The highest association was found between the introduction of Tamoxifen and breast cancer mortality.

Early diagnosis of these complications will reduce mortality and morbidity. In this study we aimed to review the neurological complications of childhood non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty four children with NHL between 2006 and 2012 were investigated retrospectively and 14 cases with neurological complications were identified. RESULTS: The most common symptom was alteration of the consciousness (10 patients, 71.4 %) followed by convulsion (5 patients, 35.7 %), and hallucination (4 patients, 28.5 %); headache, eye pain, neurogenic bladder, speech disability and facial paralysis, and hemiplegia, were less common and each of them was seen in 1 (7.1 %) of the patients. The neurological complications were mostly seen in children with precursor T lymphoblastic lymphoma followed by anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The complications were secondary to medications (Eight patients) infection (two patients); CNS relapse (two patients); or CNS involvement of the primary disease (two patients). Chemotherapy-related neurologic complications were secondary to intrathecal methotrexate, L-asparaginase, vincristine, and ifosfamide CONCLUSION: Advanced disease and PTLL subtype can be suggested as predictors of neurological complication. The survival rates of neurological complications are fairly good unless it is secondary to involvement of the primary disease. In patients with drug-induced neurological complications, the treatment can be safely re-administered after controlling the neurological complications. Therefore, clinicians managing children with NHL must be informative about neurological complications.",,"['Kose, Dogan', 'Paksoy, Yahya', 'Koksal, Yavuz', 'Unal, Ekrem']","['Kose D', 'Paksoy Y', 'Koksal Y', 'Unal E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey, drdogankose@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130830,Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Male', 'Nervous System Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey']",,,2013/08/31 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/08/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00381-013-2267-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2014 Apr;30(4):639-45. doi: 10.1007/s00381-013-2267-5.

Despite their clinical activity in many patients with CML, the BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors (BCR-ABL-KIs) imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib provide only transient leukemia reduction in patients with Ph+ ALL. While host-derived growth factors in the leukemia microenvironment have been invoked to explain this drug resistance, their relative contribution remains uncertain. Using genetically defined murine Ph+ ALL cells, we identified interleukin 7 (IL-7) as the dominant host factor that attenuates response to BCR-ABL-KIs. To identify potential combination drugs that could overcome this IL-7-dependent BCR-ABL-KI-resistant phenotype, we screened a small-molecule library including Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. Among the validated hits, the well-tolerated antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) displayed potent activity in vitro and modest in vivo monotherapy activity against engineered murine BCR-ABL-KI-resistant Ph+ ALL. Strikingly, cotreatment with DHA and dasatinib in vivo strongly reduced primary leukemia burden and improved long-term survival in a murine model that faithfully captures the BCR-ABL-KI-resistant phenotype of human Ph+ ALL. This cotreatment protocol durably cured 90% of treated animals, suggesting that this cell-based screening approach efficiently identified drugs that could be rapidly moved to human clinical testing.",,"['Singh, Harpreet', 'Shelat, Anang A', 'Singh, Amandeep', 'Boulos, Nidal', 'Williams, Richard T', 'Guy, R Kiplin']","['Singh H', 'Shelat AA', 'Singh A', 'Boulos N', 'Williams RT', 'Guy RK']","[""1Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130829,United States,J Biomol Screen,Journal of biomolecular screening,9612112,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Drug Discovery/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer and cancer drugs', 'cell-based assays', 'kinases', 'phenotypic drug discovery']",2013/08/31 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2013/08/31 06:00'],"['2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1087057113501081 [pii]', '10.1177/1087057113501081 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomol Screen. 2014 Jan;19(1):158-67. doi: 10.1177/1087057113501081.

Although HSC cycle status has long been the subject of scrutiny, virtually all marrow stem cell research has been based on studies of highly purified HSCs. Here we explored the cell cycle status of marrow stem cells in un-separated whole bone marrow (WBM). We show that a large number of long-term multi-lineage engraftable stem cells within WBM are in S/G2/M phase. Using bromodeoxyuridine, we show rapid transit through the cell cycle of a previously defined relatively dormant purified stem cell, the long-term HSC (LT-HSC; Lineage(-)/c-kit(+)/Sca-1(+)/Flk-2(-)). Actively cycling marrow stem cells have continually changing phenotype with cell cycle transit, likely rendering them difficult to purify to homogeneity. Indeed, as WBM contains actively cycling stem cells, and highly purified stem cells engraft predominantly while quiescent, it follows that the population of cycling marrow stem cells within WBM are lost during purification. Our studies indicate that both the discarded lineage-positive and lineage-negative marrow cells in a stem cell separation contain cycling stem cells. We propose that future work should encompass this larger population of cycling stem cells that is poorly represented in current studies solely focused on purified stem cell populations.",,"['Goldberg, L R', 'Dooner, M S', 'Johnson, K W', 'Papa, E F', 'Pereira, M G', 'Del Tatto, M', 'Adler, D M', 'Aliotta, J M', 'Quesenberry, P J']","['Goldberg LR', 'Dooner MS', 'Johnson KW', 'Papa EF', 'Pereira MG', 'Del Tatto M', 'Adler DM', 'Aliotta JM', 'Quesenberry PJ']","['Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130830,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', '*Cell Cycle', '*Cell Lineage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",,,2013/08/31 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/08/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013252 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.252 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Apr;28(4):813-22. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.252.

Clinically newly occurring hemorrhagic diathesis combined with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) time is diagnostically indicative and can be confirmed by a positive plasma exchange test. For thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) the diagnosis of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia together with thrombocytopenia should lead to the detection of fragmentocytes in peripheral blood smears. Hairy cell leukemia is a rare subgroup of chronic B-cell neoplasia with the clinical signs of pancytopenia and splenomegaly which characteristically stain positive for CD103. The gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has nothing in common with classical soft tissue sarcoma based on the activating mutation of the KIT or PDGFRA gene (positivity for CD117). In all of these disorders the correct diagnosis has a major influence on patient outcome. For the case of acquired inhibitors of coagulation immunosuppressive therapy and substitution of coagulation factors (e.g. recombinant factor VIIa) or for TTP-HUS the immediate start of plasma exchange are mandatory. For hairy cell leukemia a very effective treatment exists with purine analogs (e.g. cladribine) and for metastatic inoperable GIST with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. imatinib).,,"['Lindner, L H', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Lindner LH', 'Hiddemann W']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munchen, Deutschland, lars.lindner@med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Internist (Berl),Der Internist,0264620,IM,"['Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Rare Diseases']",,,2013/08/31 06:00,2014/05/23 06:00,['2013/08/31 06:00'],"['2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00108-013-3291-y [doi]'],ppublish,Internist (Berl). 2013 Oct;54(10):1197-204. doi: 10.1007/s00108-013-3291-y.,10,,,,,,,,,,Hamatoonkologische Krankheitsbilder.,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants in the Air Pollution and Childhood Cancers Study who were 5 years of age or younger and diagnosed with cancer between 1988 and 2008 were had their records linked to California birth certificates, and controls were selected from birth certificates. Land use regression-based estimates of exposures to nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides were assigned based on birthplace residence and temporally adjusted using routine monitoring station data to evaluate air pollution exposures during specific pregnancy periods. Logistic regression models were adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, educational level, parity, insurance type, and Census-based socioeconomic status, as well as child's sex and birth year. The odds of acute lymphoblastic leukemia increased by 9%, 23%, and 8% for each 25-ppb increase in average nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxide levels, respectively, over the entire pregnancy. Second- and third-trimester exposures increased the odds of bilateral retinoblastoma. No associations were found for annual average exposures without temporal components or for any other cancer type.

Both HOXA9 and MEIS1 are required for MLL-fusion gene-induced leukemogenesis. Co-expression of HOXA9 and MEIS1 induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) similar to that seen in mice in which MLL-fusion genes are over-expressed. p27(kip1) (p27 hereafter), a negative regulator of the cell cycle, has also been defined as an MLL target, the expression of which is up-regulated in MLL leukemic cells (LCs). To investigate whether p27 plays a role in the pathogenesis of MLL-leukemia, we examined the effects of p27 deletion (p27(-/-)) on MLL-AF9 (MA9)-induced murine AML development. HOXA9/MEIS1 (H/M)-induced, p27 wild-type (p27(+/+)) and p27(-/-) AML were studied in parallel as controls. We found that LCs from both MA9-AML and H/M-AML can be separated into three fractions, a CD117(-)CD11b(hi) differentiated fraction as well as CD117(+)CD11b(hi) and CD117(+)CD11b(lo), two less differentiated fractions. The CD117(+)CD11b(lo) fraction, comprising only 1-3% of total LCs, expresses higher levels of early hematopoietic progenitor markers but lower levels of mature myeloid cell markers compared to other populations of LCs. p27 is expressed and is required for maintaining the quiescent and drug-resistant states of the CD117(+)CD11b(lo) fraction of MA9-LCs but not of H/M-LCs. p27 deletion significantly compromises the leukemogenic capacity of CD117(+)CD11b(lo) MA9-LCs by reducing the frequency of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) but does not do so in H/M-LCs. In addition, we found that p27 is highly expressed and required for cell cycle arrest in the CD117(-)CD11b(hi) fraction in both types of LCs. Furthermore, we found that c-Myc expression is required for maintaining LCs in an undifferentiated state independently of proliferation. We concluded that p27 represses the proliferation of LCs, which is specifically required for maintaining the quiescent and drug-resistant states of a small subset of MA9-LSCs in collaboration with the differentiation blockage function of c-Myc.",['Published by Elsevier B.V.'],"['Zhang, Jun', 'Seet, Christopher S', 'Sun, Clare', 'Li, Jing', 'You, Dewen', 'Volk, Andrew', 'Breslin, Peter', 'Li, Xingyu', 'Wei, Wei', 'Qian, Zhijian', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J', 'Zhang, Zhou', 'Zhang, Jiwang']","['Zhang J', 'Seet CS', 'Sun C', 'Li J', 'You D', 'Volk A', 'Breslin P', 'Li X', 'Wei W', 'Qian Z', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Biology, College of Life and Environment Science, Shanghai Normal University, 100 Guilin Road, Shanghai 200234, PR China; Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center and Department of Pathology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130820,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia stem cell', 'MLL-leukemia', 'Quiescence', 'p27(kip1)']",2013/08/31 06:00,2014/06/24 06:00,['2013/08/31 06:00'],"['2013/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1574-7891(13)00111-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molonc.2013.07.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2013 Dec;7(6):1069-82. doi: 10.1016/j.molonc.2013.07.011.

WEHI-3 cells were intraperitoneally injected into normal BALB/c mice to establish leukemic BALB/c mice, which were then oral-treated with or without EGCG at 5, 20 and 40 mg/kg for two weeks. The results indicated that EGCG did not change the weight of the animals, nor the liver or spleen when compared to vehicle (olive oil) -treated groups. Furthermore, EGCG increased the percentage of cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) (T-cell), cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) (B-cell) and Macrophage-3 antigen (Mac-3) (macrophage) but reduced the percentage of CD11b (monocyte) cell surface markers in EGCG-treated groups as compared with the untreated leukemia group. EGCG promoted the phagocytosis of macrophages from 5 mg/kg treatment and promoted natural killer cell activity at 40 mg/kg, increased T-cell proliferation at 40 mg/kg but promoted B-cell proliferation at all three doses.

In this report, we have tested CSF-deficient mouse fibroblasts transduced with Dll1 for their ability to support T-cell differentiation. The data provided here demonstrate that CSF-deficient fibroblasts expressing DLL1 can support T-cell development. Indeed, co-cultures with these fibroblasts produced more T-cell progenitors compared with OP9-DL1 cultures. Addition of myeloid cytokines to OP9-DL1 co-cultures significantly inhibited T-cell development while CSF-deficient DLL1(+) fibroblasts retained partial T-cell differentiation. Taken together, these data imply that their lack of myeloid cytokines allows DLL1(+) fibroblasts to more efficiently generate T-cells.

Furthermore, patients with low-risk cytogenetic abnormalities showed significantly lower levels compared to patients with high-risk abnormalities, and high RINF/CXXC5/ mRNA levels were associated with decreased overall survival for patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. This association with prognosis was seen both when investigating (i) an unselected patient population as well as for patients with (ii) normal cytogenetic and (iii) core-binding factor AML.

Pim kinase substrates are involved in transcription, protein translation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. SGI-1776 is a potent Pim kinase inhibitor that has proven to be cytotoxic to leukemia and lymphoma cells. Based on this background, we hypothesized that SGI-1776 treatment would result in myeloma cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To test this, myeloma cell lines and primary CD138(+) cells from myeloma patients were treated with SGI-1776 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and effect on cell death and proliferation, induction of autophagy, and changes in cell cycle profile were measured. RESULTS: SGI-1776 treatment resulted in limited apoptosis in cell lines (mean 30%) and CD138(+) cells (< 10%) assessed using Annexin-V/propidium iodide. Limited effect was observed in cell cycle profile or growth in cell lines. However, DNA synthesis was decreased by 70% at 3 muM (all time points) in U266 though this was not observed in MM.1S. In accordance, immunoblot analyses revealed no change in transcription (c-Myc and H3), or apoptotic (Bad) proteins that are substrates of Pim kinases. In contrast, autophagy, assessed using acridine orange staining, was induced with SGI-1776 treatment in both cell lines (U266, 25%-70%; MM.1S, 8%-52%) and CD138(+) cells (19%-21%). Immunoblot analyses of the autophagy LC3b marker and translation initiation proteins (phospho-p70S6K and 4E-BP1) corroborated autophagy induction. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that SGI-1776 treatment in myeloma cell lines and CD138(+) myeloma cells elicits its deleterious effects through inhibition of translation and induction of autophagy.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Economic evaluation of health care is becoming increasingly important. We report clinical and laboratory data collected from 397 consecutive adult patients (173 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 30 Hodgkin lymphoma, 160 multiple myeloma, 7 autoimmune diseases, and 28 acute leukemia) who underwent their first autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). We considered primary endpoints evaluating health economic efficacy (eg, antibiotic administration, transfusion of blood components, and time in hospital), secondary endpoints evaluating toxicity (in accordance with Common Toxicity Criteria), and tertiary endpoints evaluating safety (ie, the risk of regimen-related death or disease progression within the first year after PBSCT). A time-dependent grading of efficacy is proposed with day 21 for multiple myeloma and day 25 for the other disease categories (depending on the length of the conditioning regimen) as the acceptable maximum time in hospital, which together with antibiotics, antifungal, or transfusion therapy delineates four groups: favorable (</=7 days on antibiotics and no transfusions; </=21 [25] days in hospital), intermediate (from 7 to 10 days on antibiotics and <3 transfusions, </=21 to 25 days in hospital or >/=7 days on antibiotics and no transfusions; from 21 to 30 days [25 to 34] in hospital), unfavorable (>7 days on antibiotics, >3 but <6 transfusions; >30/34 days in hospital after transplantation), and very unfavorable (>10 days on antibiotics, >6 transfusions; >30 to 34 days in hospital). The multivariate analysis showed that (1) PBSC harvests of >/=4 x 10(6)/kg CD34 + cells in 1 apheresis procedure were associated with a favorable outcome in all patient categories except acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P = .001), (2) >/=5 x 10(6)/kg CD34 + cells infused predicted better transplantation outcome in all patient categories (P < .0001) except acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, (3) 1 or 2 aphereses (P = .001) predicted good outcome, (4) toxicity increased with higher graft volume reinfused (>500 mL) (P = .002), and (5) patients with a central venous catheter during both collection and infusion of PBSC had a more favorable outcome post-PBSCT than peripheral access (P = .007). The type of mobilization regimen did not affect the outcome of auto-PBSCT. The present study identified predictive variables, which may be useful in future individual pretransplantation probability evaluations with the goal to improve supportive care.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of pneumonia in patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 801 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) who underwent induction chemotherapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pneumonia was present at induction start in 85 patients (11%). Of the 716 remaining patients, 148 (21%) developed pneumonia. The incidence rate of pneumonia was higher in MDS and AML than in ALL (0.013 vs. 0.008 vs. 0.003 pneumonias per day, respectively; P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, age greater than or equal to 60 years, AML, low platelet count, low albumin level, neutropenia, and neutrophil count greater than 7,300 were risk factors. The case fatality rate of pneumonia was 17% (40 of 233). Competing risk analysis demonstrated that in the absence of pneumonia, death was rare: 28-day mortality was 6.2% for all patients but only 1.26% in those without pneumonia. Compared with patients without pneumonia, patients with pneumonia had more intensive care unit days, longer hospital stays, and 49% higher costs (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia after induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia continues to be common, and it is the most important determinant of early mortality after induction chemotherapy. Given the high incidence, morbidity, mortality, and cost of pneumonia, interventions aimed at prevention are warranted in patients with acute leukemia.",,"['Garcia, Javier Barreda', 'Lei, Xiudong', 'Wierda, William', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Dickey, Burton F', 'Evans, Scott E', 'Ost, David E']","['Garcia JB', 'Lei X', 'Wierda W', 'Cortes JE', 'Dickey BF', 'Evans SE', 'Ost DE']",['1 Department of Pulmonary Medicine.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Ann Am Thorac Soc,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,101600811,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoalbuminemia', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia', 'Opportunistic Infections/*complications/mortality', 'Pneumonia/*complications/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytopenia']",,,2013/08/31 06:00,2014/06/15 06:00,['2013/08/31 06:00'],"['2013/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1513/AnnalsATS.201304-097OC [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2013 Oct;10(5):432-40. doi: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201304-097OC.,5,,PMC3960911,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL117976/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2013 Oct;10(5):493-5.

However, these studies lack tritium-specific dose data and have small numbers of cases. The purpose of our study was to determine whether tritium emitted from a nuclear-generating station during routine operation is associated with risk of cancer in Pickering, Ontario. METHODS: A retrospective cohort was formed through linkage of Pickering and north Oshawa residents (1985) to incident cancer cases (1985-2005). We examined all sites combined, leukemia, lung, thyroid and childhood cancers (6-19 years) for males and females as well as female breast cancer. Tritium estimates were based on an atmospheric dispersion model, incorporating characteristics of annual tritium emissions and meteorology. Tritium concentration estimates were assigned to each cohort member based on exact location of residence. Person-years analysis was used to determine whether observed cancer cases were higher than expected. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine whether tritium was associated with radiation-sensitive cancers in Pickering. RESULTS: Person-years analysis showed female childhood cancer cases to be significantly higher than expected (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-3.38). The issue of multiple comparisons is the most likely explanation for this finding. Cox models revealed that female lung cancer was significantly higher in Pickering versus north Oshawa (HR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.23-4.46) and that tritium was not associated with increased risk. The improved methodology used in this study adds to our understanding of cancer risks associated with low-dose tritium exposure.

Herpesviruses from all subfamilies encode proteins that counteract PML NB-mediated antiviral defenses by multiple mechanisms. However, because of the species specificity of herpesviruses, only a limited number of in vivo studies have been undertaken to investigate the effect of PML or PML NBs on herpesvirus infection. To address this central issue in herpesvirus biology, we studied the course of infection in wild-type and PML(-)/(-) mice using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encodes a tegument protein that induces PML degradation. While acute infection in PML(-)/(-) mice progressed similarly to that in wild-type mice, the lytic reactivation frequency was higher in peritoneal exudate cells, due to both an increase of MHV68 genome-positive cells and greater reactivation efficiency. We also detected a higher frequency of persistent infection in PML(-)/(-) peritoneal cells. These findings suggest that the PML protein can repress the establishment or maintenance of gammaherpesvirus latency in vivo. Further use of the PML(-)/(-) mouse model should aid in dissecting the molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of PML in gammaherpesvirus latency and may yield clues for how PML modulates herpesvirus latency in general.",,"['Sewatanon, Jaturong', 'Liu, Hao', 'Ling, Paul D']","['Sewatanon J', 'Liu H', 'Ling PD']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130828,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gammaherpesvirinae/pathogenicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesviridae Infections/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Peritoneum/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology', '*Virus Latency', '*Virus Replication']",,,2013/08/30 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/08/30 06:00'],"['2013/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01696-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01696-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Nov;87(22):12151-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01696-13.

We previously reported that a fine rheostatic balance between the anti- and pro-apoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 family proteins controls hepatocyte apoptosis in the healthy liver. The Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins set this rheostatic balance toward apoptosis upon activation in the diseased liver. However, their involvement in healthy Bcl-2 rheostasis remains unknown. In the present study, we focused on two BH3-only proteins, Bim and Bid, and we clarified the Bcl-2 network that governs hepatocyte life and death in the healthy liver. We generated hepatocyte-specific Bcl-xL- or Mcl-1-knock-out mice, with or without disrupting Bim and/or Bid, and we examined hepatocyte apoptosis under physiological conditions. We also examined the effect of both Bid and Bim disruption on the hepatocyte apoptosis caused by the inhibition of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis in Bcl-xL- or Mcl-1-knock-out mice was significantly ameliorated by Bim deletion. The disruption of both Bim and Bid completely prevented hepatocyte apoptosis in Bcl-xL-knock-out mice and weakened massive hepatocyte apoptosis via the additional in vivo knockdown of mcl-1 in these mice. Finally, the hepatocyte apoptosis caused by ABT-737, which is a Bcl-xL/Bcl-2/Bcl-w inhibitor, was completely prevented in Bim/Bid double knock-out mice. The BH3-only proteins Bim and Bid are functionally active but are restrained by the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins under physiological conditions.

As there is currently limited information on the reference interval (RI) and repeatability of the test in the cat compared with the dog, the purpose of the study was to establish the RI of buccal mucosa bleeding time (BMBT) in healthy cats and to investigate the intra-observer repeatability of the test. Fifty-six cats were prospectively enrolled in the study. The animals were deemed to be healthy based on history, physical examination, complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and negative serological testing for feline leukaemia and immunodeficiency viruses. All cats were sedated with ketamine, dexmedetomidine and morphine, and the BMBT was sequentially measured in the left and right exposed buccal mucosa following a standardised incision made by a commercially available, disposable, bleeding time device. The mean BMBT was 58.6 s and the RIs ranged from 34 to 105 s (Bootstrap estimation). The intra-observer repeatability was up to 87 s (Bland-Altman plot). The results of this study imply that the combination of ketamine, dexmedetomidine and morphine is a safe and useful sedative protocol allowing for the reliable measurement of BMBT in the cat.

Rat cardiac myoblasts (H9C2 cells) were exposed to nanomolar concentrations of HNG and to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cells treated with HNG in the presence of H2O2 demonstrated reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), preserved mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP levels and mitochondrial structure. HNG induced activation of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) within 5 min and decreased the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione within 30 min. siRNA knockdown of both Abl and Arg, but neither alone, abolished the HNG-mediated reduction of ROS in myoblasts exposed to H2O2.

The transformation of FL to B-lymphoblastic leukemia generally includes the dysregulation of MYC gene expression, typically through IGH rearrangement. Such cases of ""double-hit"" leukemia/lymphoma with both BCL2 and MYC translocations warrant further study as they are often not identified early, are associated with a poor prognosis, and are incompletely understood in molecular terms. Here we describe a patient with a diagnosis of FL that transformed to B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Detailed cytogenetic characterization of the transformed specimen using karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization, microarray and gene rearrangement analyses revealed a complex karyotype comprised principally of whole chromosome or whole arm copy number gains or losses. Smaller, single-gene copy number alterations identified by microarray were limited in number, but included amplification of a truncated EP300 gene and alterations in NEIL1 and GPHN.

The role of HIV in these lymphomas is unclear and currently there are no valid in vivo models for better understanding HIV-related lymphomagenesis. Transgenic (Tg) 26 mice have a 7.4-kb pNL4-3 HIV-1 provirus lacking a 3.1-kb sequence encompassing parts of the gag-pol region. Approximately 15% of these HIV Tg mice spontaneously develop lymphoma with hallmark pre-diagnostic markers including skin lesions, diffuse lymphadenopathy and an increase in pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. Here we describe the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of the B cell leukemia/lymphoma in the Tg mice. RESULTS: The transformed B cell population consists of CD19+pre-BCR+CD127+CD43+CD93+ precursor B cells. The tumor cells are clonal and characterized by an increased expression of several cellular oncogenes. Expression of B cell-stimulatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-13 and TNFalpha and HIV proteins p17, gp120 and nef were elevated in the Tg mice with lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of HIV proteins and the B-cell stimulatory factors is consistent with the interpretation that one or more of these factors play a role in lymphoma development. The lymphomas share many similarities with those occurring in HIV/AIDS+ patients and may provide a valuable model for understanding AIDS-related lymphomagenesis and elucidating the role played by HIV-1.",,"['Curreli, Sabrina', 'Krishnan, Selvi', 'Reitz, Marvin', 'Lunardi-Iskandar, Yanto', 'Lafferty, Mark K', 'Garzino-Demo, Alfredo', 'Zella, Davide', 'Gallo, Robert C', 'Bryant, Joseph']","['Curreli S', 'Krishnan S', 'Reitz M', 'Lunardi-Iskandar Y', 'Lafferty MK', 'Garzino-Demo A', 'Zella D', 'Gallo RC', 'Bryant J']","['Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. scurreli@ihv.umaryland.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130828,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/virology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology/*virology', 'Mice', '*Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,2013/08/30 06:00,2014/07/08 06:00,['2013/08/30 06:00'],"['2013/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-92 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-92 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 Aug 28;10:92. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-92.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins)']",PMC3847158,,"['P30 CA134274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA154274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1T32 CA154274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['GENBANK/AF033812'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LFER descriptors used for the prediction model (i.e. excess molar refraction (E), dipolarity/polarizability (S), hydrogen-bonding acidity (A), hydrogen-bonding basicity (B) and McGowan volume (V)) were calculated using sub-descriptors (sig2, sig3, HBD3, HBA4, MR, and volume) derived from COSMO-RS, COSMO and OBPROP. With the combination of two solute descriptors (B, V) of the cation we were able to predict cationic hydrophobicity values (log ko ) with r (2) = 0.987 and standard error (SE) = 0.139 log units. By using the calculated log k o values, we were able to deduce a linear toxicity prediction model. In the second prediction study for the cytotoxicity of ILs, analysis of descriptor sensitivity helped us to determine that the McGowan volume (V) terms of the cation was the most important predictor of cytotoxicity and to simplify prediction models for cytotoxicity of ILs towards the IPC-81 (r (2) of 0.778, SE of 0.450 log units), Vibrio fischeri (r (2) of 0.762, SE of 0.529 log units) and Scenedesmus vacuolatus (r (2) of 0.776, SE of 0.825 log units).

To further gather insight into PML's contribution to circadian behavior, we generated two strains of mice deficient in one of the two period (Per) genes and the PML gene, with Per1-/-/Pml-/- and Per2-/-/Pml-/- genotypes. RESULTS: Here we report the circadian behavior of these mice based on wheel-running behavioral analysis. In a free-running environment, the Per1-/-/Pml-/- mice maintained circadian rhythm but displayed a significantly shorter period of 22.2 h. In addition, these mice displayed significantly enhanced phase response to a light pulse given at zeitgeber time (ZT) 14 and 22. The Per2-/-/Pml-/- mice lose persistent rhythm when in a free-running environment, as also the case for Per2-/- mice. A transient post-light pulse rhythm seen in the arrhythmic Per2-/- mice was less apparent in Per2-/-/Pml-/- mice. Both the Per1-/-/Pml-/- and Per2-/-/Pml-/- mice displayed a more advanced phase angle of entrainment activity during light-dark cycles than the single gene deficient mice.

Likewise, current concerns of undertreatment and overtreatment with TKIs during the long-term clinical course of CML will be outlined. AREAS COVERED: Currently available TKIs for the management of CML are reviewed. The survival benefit of TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib) for the CML is excellent. The CML and TKI literature search was made in PubMed with particular focus on the clinical trials, recommendations, guidelines and expert opinions, as well as the ELN CML 2013 recommendations. EXPERT OPINION: Initial TKI treatment for low-risk chronic phase CML is imatinib 400 mg; high-Sokal risk and/or CML patients with complex karyotypic abnormalities would require more powerful second-generation TKIs (dasatinib 100 mg or nilotinib 600 mg). Absence of early molecular response after 6 months, complete cytogenetic response after 12 months and major molecular response after 18 months may require a more powerful TKI switch. If one of the two second-generation TKIs (nilotinib or dasatinib) was used as first-line therapy and failed, the other (dasatinib or nilotinib) could be administered.",,"['Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C']",['Haznedaroglu IC'],"['Hacettepe University Medical School, Department of Hematology , Ankara , Turkey haznedar@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130828,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,2013/08/30 06:00,2014/04/04 06:00,['2013/08/30 06:00'],"['2013/08/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2013.833185 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2013 Oct;14(15):2005-10. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2013.833185.

The B-cell-specific moloney leukemia virus insertion site 1 (the Bmi-1) gene is an important member in the family of polycomb group (PcG) genes that plays an oncogenic role in several types of cancer, but it's expression as a prognostic marker in pediatric brain tumors has not been indicated. Materials and Methods. The Bmi-1 gene expression, clinic pathological and prognostic significance in a series of pediatric brain tumors were examined by real-time PCR method in 56 pediatric brain tumors. Results. The Bmi-1 gene expression in various types of pediatric brain tumors compared to that in normal brain tissue was 4.85-fold. The relative expression varied from 8.64-fold in ependymomas to 2.89-fold in other types. Expression level in high-grade tumors compared to that in low-grade tumors was 2.5 times. In univariate survival analysis of the pediatric brain tumors, a significant association of high expression of the Bmi-1 with patient survival was demonstrated. In multivariate analysis, the Bmi-1 high expression provided significant independent prognostic factors. Conclusion. Increased expression of the Bmi-1 in pediatric brain tumors may be important in the acquisition of an aggressive phenotype. In addition, it can be used as a strong and independent molecular marker of prognosis in pediatric brain tumors.",,"['Farivar, Shirin', 'Zati Keikha, Reza', 'Shiari, Reza', 'Jadali, Farzaneh']","['Farivar S', 'Zati Keikha R', 'Shiari R', 'Jadali F']","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Biological Science, Shahid Beheshti University, GC, Tehran 1983963113, Iran. s farivar@sbu.ac.ir']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130728,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2013/08/29 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/08/29 06:00'],"['2013/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/192548 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2013;2013:192548. doi: 10.1155/2013/192548.

We investigated whether mutations in the DNA-binding domain of TP53 are associated with survival in stage III colon cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The impact of TP53 genotype was prospectively evaluated in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 89803, a trial that randomized stage III colon cancer patients to receive adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5FU/LV) or 5FU/LV with irinotecan (IFL). RESULTS: TP53 mutations were identified in 274 of 607 cases. The presence of any TP53 mutation did not predict disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival with either adjuvant regimen when men and women were considered together or as separate groups. However, outcome differences among women became apparent when tumor TP53 genotype was stratified as wild-type versus zinc- or non-zinc-binding mutations in the TP53 DNA-binding domain. DFS at 5 years was 0.59, 0.52, and 0.78 for women with TP53 wild-type tumors, and tumors with zinc- or non-zinc-binding mutations, respectively. Survival at 5 years for these same women was 0.72, 0.59, and 0.90, respectively. No differences in survival by TP53 genotype were observed in men. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of any TP53 mutation within the DNA-binding domain did not predict survival in stage III colon cancer. However, TP53 genotype was predictive of survival in women following adjuvant therapy. Future colon cancer therapeutic trials, with inclusion of correlative molecular markers, should be designed to permit evaluation of survival and/or response to treatment in women separately from men.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"['Warren, Robert S', 'Atreya, Chloe E', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Weinberg, Vivian K', 'Donner, David B', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Compton, Carolyn C', 'Zuraek, Marlene B', 'Ye, Cynthia', 'Saltz, Leonard B', 'Bertagnolli, Monica M']","['Warren RS', 'Atreya CE', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Weinberg VK', 'Donner DB', 'Mayer RJ', 'Goldberg RM', 'Compton CC', 'Zuraek MB', 'Ye C', 'Saltz LB', 'Bertagnolli MM']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio; National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland; and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130827,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein Binding', 'Sex Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zinc/chemistry/metabolism']",,,2013/08/29 06:00,2014/05/20 06:00,['2013/08/29 06:00'],"['2013/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-0351 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0351 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Oct 15;19(20):5777-87. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0351.

We treated 256 consecutive patients with elderly AML (>/=60 years) with a risk-adapted approach based on age, comorbidity score (CS), and performance status (ECOG). Eighty-five low-risk patients (age </= 65 years and ECOG 0-1 with CS < 2), 86 intermediate-risk patients (age > 65 years or ECOG = 2 with CS < 2), and 85 high-risk patients (ECOG > 2 or CS >/= 2) were treated with induction chemotherapies, including standard intensive regimens, abbreviated-scheduled regimens, and modified low-dose cytarabine with oral etoposide (mLDAC), respectively. Overall response rates (ORR; complete response and complete response with incomplete recovery) for these three groups were 71.8%, 60.5%, and 41.2%, respectively, without a significant difference in early death rate (17.6%, 25.6%, 23.5%, P = 0.415). Among three abbreviated-scheduled regimens, a gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO)-containing regimen (n = 43) showed a similar ORR rate (72.1%) to the intensive regimen. After achieving remission, 142 patients went on postremission treatments, including reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation (RIC, n = 41), standard consolidation (n = 71), and repeated mLDAC (n = 30) according to donor availability, age, ECOG, and CS. Multivariate analyses revealed that not only RIC, but also repeated mLDAC, resulted in significantly superior survival outcomes to standard consolidation independent of age, ECOG, and CS. Clinical benefits of mLDAC for high-risk patients and abbreviated induction with GO for intermediate-risk patients should be confirmed with further studies. Our results also suggest that RIC should be actively considered in elderly AML as a postremission treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Kim, Jung-Ho', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Park, Chong-Won']","['Yoon JH', 'Cho BS', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim JH', 'Shin SH', 'Yahng SA', 'Lee SE', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Park CW']","[""Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130912,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/08/29 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/08/29 06:00'],"['2013/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23576 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Dec;88(12):1074-81. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23576.

The knock-out of HSF1 impairs cancer formation and progression, suggesting that HSF1 is a promising therapeutic target. To identify inhibitors of HSF1 activity, we performed cell-based screening with a library of marketed and experimental drugs and identified cantharidin as an HSF1 inhibitor. Cantharidin is a potent antitumor agent from traditional Chinese medicine. Cantharidin inhibited heat shock-induced luciferase activity with an IC50 of 4.2 mum. In contrast, cantharidin did not inhibit NF-kappaB luciferase reporter activity, demonstrating that cantharidin is not a general transcription inhibitor. When the HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells were exposed to heat shock in the presence of cantharidin, the induction of HSF1 downstream target proteins, such as HSP70 and BAG3 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain 3), was suppressed. HSP70 and its co-chaperone BAG3 have been reported to protect cells from apoptosis by stabilizing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. As expected, treating HCT-116 cancer cells with cantharidin significantly decreased the amounts of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1 protein and induced apoptotic cell death. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that cantharidin inhibited the binding of HSF1 to the HSP70 promoter and subsequently blocked HSF1-dependent p-TEFb recruitment. Therefore, the p-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II was blocked, arresting transcription at the elongation step. Protein phosphatase 2A inhibition with PP2CA siRNA or okadaic acid did not block HSF1 activity, suggesting that cantharidin inhibits HSF1 in a protein phosphatase 2A-independent manner.

In eukaryotic cells, non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ) is the major mechanism for DSB repair. Human X-ray repair cross-complementing 5 (XRCC5) gene encodes for the protein KU86, an important component of NHEJ pathway. Variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism (rs 6147172) in the promoter region of XRCC5 gene was shown to have effect on gene expression and was found to be associated with the development of several cancers. We analyzed VNTR polymorphism of XRCC5 gene in 461 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cases and 408 controls by polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that frequency of 0R/0R genotype was significantly elevated in CML cases compared to that of controls (p = 0.05). Significant difference in the genotype distribution was observed between cases and controls (p = 0.02). The risk of CML development was found to be elevated for individuals carrying lower repeats (1R p = 0.03; 0R p = 0.007).

Real-time PCR base kits are wildly applicable in cancer signaling pathways, especially in cancer investigations. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a type of leukemia that is more common in older children and teenagers. Deregulation of the Notch signaling pathway promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of the lymphoblastic T cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Notch signaling activation on the expression of target genes using real-time QPCR and further use this method in clinical examination after validation. Two T-ALL cell lines, Jurkat and Molt-4, were used as models for activation of the Notch signaling via over-expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain. Expression analysis was performed for six downstream target genes (NCSTN, APH1, PSEN1, ADAM17, NOTCH1 and C-MYC) which play critical roles in the Notch signaling pathway. The results showed significant difference in the expression of target genes in the deregulated Notch signaling pathway. These results were also verified in 12 clinical samples bearing over-expression of the Notch signaling pathway.

Although inactivating mutations in PRC2-encoding genes EZH2, EED, and SUZ12 are present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in myeloid malignancies, gain-of-function mutations in EZH2 are frequently observed in B-cell lymphoma, implying disease-dependent effects of individual mutations. We show that, in contrast to PRC1, PRC2 is a tumor suppressor in Emicro-myc lymphomagenesis, because disease onset was accelerated by heterozygosity for Suz12 or by short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Suz12 or Ezh2. Accelerated lymphomagenesis was associated with increased accumulation of B-lymphoid cells in the absence of effects on apoptosis or cell cycling. However, Suz12-deficient B-lymphoid progenitors exhibit enhanced serial clonogenicity. Thus, PRC2 normally restricts the self-renewal of B-lymphoid progenitors, the disruption of which contributes to lymphomagenesis.

It reportedly possesses antitumor activity via the induction of apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines, including U937 and K562 cells. However, the effects of CA on human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) HL60 cells remains unknown. In the current study, the ability of CA to cause G0/G1 cycle arrest and induce apoptosis in the treatment of human APL HL60 cells was investigated. Following 5 days treatment with 1, 5 and 10 microM CA, cell viability and the effects of CA on the growth of HL60 cells were investigated using a growth curve constructed using trypan blue staining. Induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation were estimated using Wright'sGiemsa staining, Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) staining, DNA ladder analysis and flow cytometry, following 48 h cell treatment with various doses of CA. The results indicated that the growth of HL60 cells reached a plateau phase at 72 h and the proliferation inhibition rate of HL60 cells in CAtreated groups was significantly higher compared with the control, in a time and dosedependent manner. However, the level of apoptosis of HL60 cells treated with CA markedly increased and formed more apoptotic bodies compared with the cells with no drug treatment, according to the Wright'sGiemsa staining, Hoechst 33342 and PI staining, respectively. Using DNA ladder analysis and flow cytometry it was shown that a significant characteristic DNA ladder was observed when treated with CA. CA was capable of arresting cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Apoptosis of HL60 cells treated with CA for 48 h was promoted significantly in a dosedependent manner, as well as the inhibition of proliferation. The observations revealed that CA inhibits proliferation and induces preprophase apoptosis of HL60 cells.

A retrospective multicenter study was conducted with 44 F/P CEL patients identified in the French Eosinophil Network and treated with imatinib. The most frequently involved systems were skin (57%), spleen (52%), and lung (45%), and eosinophilic heart disease was observed in 15 patients (34%). Complete hematologic response (CHR) was obtained in all patients, and complete molecular response (CMR) in 95% of patients (average initial imatinib dose, 165 mg/d). For 29 patients the imatinib dose was tapered with a maintenance dose of 58 mg/d (+/-34 mg/d), allowing sustained CHR and CMR. None of the patients developed resistance during a median follow-up of 52.3 months (range, 1.4-97.4 mo). Imatinib was stopped in 11 patients; 6 of the patients subsequently relapsed, but 5 remained in persistent CHR or CMR (range, 9-88 mo). These results confirm that an initial low-dose regimen of imatinib (100 mg/d) followed by a lower maintenance dose can be efficient for obtaining long-term CHR and CMR. Our data also suggest that imatinib can be stopped in some patients without molecular relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Moreover, many cohorts have the problem of imbalanced classes where the number of patients belonging to each class is not the same. With this kind of dataset, biologists need to identify a small number of informative genes that can be used as biomarkers for a disease. RESULTS: This paper introduces a Balanced Iterative Random Forest (BIRF) algorithm to select the most relevant genes for a disease from imbalanced high-throughput gene expression microarray data. Balanced iterative random forest is applied on four cancer microarray datasets: a childhood leukaemia dataset, which represents the main target of this paper, collected from The Children's Hospital at Westmead, NCI 60, a Colon dataset and a Lung cancer dataset. The results obtained by BIRF are compared to those of Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), Multi-class SVM-RFE (MSVM-RFE), Random Forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. The results of the BIRF approach outperform these state-of-the-art methods, especially in the case of imbalanced datasets. Experiments on the childhood leukaemia dataset show that a 7% approximately 12% better accuracy is achieved by BIRF over MSVM-RFE with the ability to predict patients in the minor class. The informative biomarkers selected by the BIRF algorithm were validated by repeating training experiments three times to see whether they are globally informative, or just selected by chance. The results show that 64% of the top genes consistently appear in the three lists, and the top 20 genes remain near the top in the other three lists. CONCLUSION: The designed BIRF algorithm is an appropriate choice to select genes from imbalanced high-throughput gene expression microarray data. BIRF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially the ability to handle the class-imbalanced data. Moreover, the analysis of the selected genes also provides a way to distinguish between the predictive genes and those that only appear to be predictive.",,"['Anaissi, Ali', 'Kennedy, Paul J', 'Goyal, Madhu', 'Catchpoole, Daniel R']","['Anaissi A', 'Kennedy PJ', 'Goyal M', 'Catchpoole DR']","['Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems (QCIS), Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT), University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), Broadway New South Wales 2007, Australia. ali.anaissi@uts.edu.au.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130827,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Child', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Support Vector Machine']",,,2013/08/29 06:00,2014/06/15 06:00,['2013/08/29 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-14-261 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-14-261 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2013 Aug 27;14:261. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-14-261.,,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],PMC3766035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcomes of 84 consecutive adult patients with ALL (n=38) or AML (n=46) who underwent allo-HSCT from their HLA-identical siblings were evaluated retrospectively. The median age at transplantation was 34 (17-58 years) for the whole patient population. Of these, 24 patients received a MAC and 60 patients received a fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC). After a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 1-119), for the entire group, the 3-year estimated overall survival (OS) was 57.5% and the disease-free survival (DFS) was 51.5%. The OS for ALL and AML patients were 53.9% vs 62.1%: and DFS were 50.5% and 53.4%, respectively. The 3-year estimated OS for RIC and MAC patients were 63.2% and 41.7%; and DFS were 57.1% and 34.7%, respectively. In ALL patients, conditioning regimens (RIC vs MAC) led to similar OS and DFS; however, in AML patients both OS (70.1% vs 21.4%) and DFS (59.3% vs 42.9%) were found to be higher in RIC patients compared to MAC recipients. Overall, the TRM at day 100 was 1.7% and has increased up to 5.1% at 1st year. In multivariate analysis, the diagnosis (p=0.03) and RIC regimen (p=0.027) were the prognostic variables for prolonged OS in all patients; and RIC regimen (p=0.031) was the only prognostic factor for prolonged OS in AML patients. The first complete remission (CR1) was correlated with a prolonged DFS as an independent variable for all patients (p=0.09). Eleven of the RIC patients (18.3%) and 6 of the MAC patients (25%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Seventeen of the RIC patients (33.3%) and 4 of the MAC patients (16.7%) developed chronic GvHD.

METHODS: We identified patients diagnosed at Mayo Clinic with CLL between January 1, 2004, and June 1, 2012, who resided within 30 miles of Mayo Clinic. We evaluated adherence to skin cancer screening and identified the prevalence of skin malignancies during follow-up. Medical records were reviewed to document skin cancer screening and diagnosis of a skin malignancy. RESULTS: Collectively, 113 individuals who met criteria were diagnosed with CLL during the study interval. Forty-one patients (36%) had a whole body skin examination by either a dermatologist or primary care provider documented within 6 months of diagnosis; of these; nine (8% of overall cohort; 22% of examined patients) had a skin malignancy identified. Fifteen additional skin malignancies were diagnosed during follow-up. There were a total of 24 skin malignancies (21% of cohort) diagnosed, including basal cell carcinoma (n = 10), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11), sebaceous carcinomas (n = 2), and melanoma (n = 1).

Here we provide evidence that CD40L+IL-4, IL-8 or IL-6 enhance adhesion to stromal cells, with IL-6 showing a selective effect on ZAP-70 positive cells. Stimulatory effects of IL-8 or IL-6 are fully reversed by PI3K inhibition, while the effects of CD40L+IL-4 are partially reversed. While CD40L+IL-4 is the only stimulation increasing CLL cell survival for all patient groups, IL-6 protects ZAP-70 positive cells from cell death induced by PI3K inhibition.

Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and morphological changes associated with apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry and Hoescht staining respectively.

Treatment of HL-60 cells with G. epunctata (20, 50, 100 mug/ml) for 24 h led to a significant dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase by analysis of the content of DNA in cells, and a number of apoptotic bodies containing nuclear fragments were observed in cells treated with 100 mug/ml. The EtOAc fraction of G. epunctata treatment significantly arrested HL-60 cells at the G0/G1 phase (p<0.05) and ROS was significantly elevated as well as the loss of membrane mitochondrial potential in a concentration dependant manner.

The objective of this research was to develop a suitable drug delivery system in vivo which could improve therapeutic efficacy and decrease side effects. The tamibarotene-loaded-NLC (Am80-NLC) nanosuspension was formulated by the method of melt-emulsification at a high temperature and solidified by ice bath. Based on the optimized results of single-factor screening experiment, the Am80-NLC was found to be relatively uniform in size (189.38+/- 8.07 nm) with a narrow poly-dispersity index (PI) (0.27+/-0.02) and a negative zeta potential (-34.69+/-3.05 mV). The average drug entrapment efficiency and loading capacity was 90.85+/- 1.03% and 9.08+/- 0.10%, respectively. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicated that Am80 was not in crystalline state in Am80-NLC. The in vitro release profile of Am80-NLC possessed a sustained release characteristic and the release behavior was in accordance with the Ritger-Peppas equation. In vivo, after intravenous injection to mice, Am80-NLC showed a longer retention time and higher AUC values compared with the Am80 solution. In addition, biodistribution results clearly demonstrated that Am80-NLC preferentially decreased the drug distribution in kidney and liver of mice after intravenous injection.

METHODS: Effects of HHT, ATO, and HHT combined ATO on the growth of MM cell line RPMI 8226 were detected using MTT assay. The morphological changes of cell apoptosis were detected by Hoechst staining. The early apoptosis rate was detected using flow cytometry. Expressions of Caspase-3, Caspase-9, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, and AKT protein were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: HHT and ATO inhibited the proliferation of RPM1 8226 cell line in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Synergistic effects was shown in the combination group (Cl < 1). HHT and ATO induced the apoptosis of RPMI 8226 in a dose-dependent manner with typical morphological changes of apoptosis and higher early stage apoptosis rate. The enhancement in apoptotic induction was seen when two agents were combined. HHT activated expressions of Caspase-3 and PARP in a dose dependent manner at 24 h. HHT at 40 ng/mL and ATO at 8.5 micromol/L could significantly activate expressions of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9, and down-regulate expressions of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xl and Mcl-1.

METHODS: Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups, i.e., the sham-operative control group (the SH group), the I/R group, the low dose WJ I/R group (the I/R +JFL group), the middle dose WJ I/R group (the I/R +JFM group), the high dose WJ I/R group (the I/R +JFH group), 10 in each group. Rats in the latter three groups were administered with WJ at 0.75 mL/100 g, 1.50 mL/100 g, and 3.00 mL/100 g body weight for 14 consecutive days by gastrogavage. All groups except the SH group received ligation of left anterior descending branch of coronary artery for 30-min ischemia followed by 120-min reperfusion. The micro-structural changes of myocardial mitochondria were observed by transmission electron microscope. The ischemic cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected in each group using one-step terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL). The mRNA expressions of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated x protein (Bax) were detected by RT-PCR. The activities of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) were detected using ELISA. The myocardial infarct size was detected. RESULTS: Compared with the I/R group, WJ pretreatment significantly suppressed the release of LDH and CK (Besides, the release of LDH and CK reduced along with increased dose.), reduced the myocardial infarct size, and lowered myocardial apoptosis index (P < 0.05). WJ pretreatment also modulated Bcl-2/Bax ratio by up-regulating Bcl-2 expression level while decreasing Bax expression level.

The expression of SHP2 is necessary for BCR-ABL-dependent oncogenic transformation, but the precise signaling mechanisms of SHP2 are not well understood. We have developed binding proteins, termed monobodies, for the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of SHP2. Intracellular expression followed by interactome analysis showed that the monobodies are essentially monospecific to SHP2. Two crystal structures revealed that the monobodies occupy the phosphopeptide-binding sites of the SH2 domains and thus can serve as competitors of SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions. Surprisingly, the segments of both monobodies that bind to the peptide-binding grooves run in the opposite direction to that of canonical phosphotyrosine peptides, which may contribute to their exquisite specificity. When expressed in cells, monobodies targeting the N-SH2 domain disrupted the interaction of SHP2 with its upstream activator, the Grb2-associated binder 2 adaptor protein, suggesting decoupling of SHP2 from the BCR-ABL protein complex. Inhibition of either N-SH2 or C-SH2 was sufficient to inhibit two tyrosine phosphorylation events that are critical for SHP2 catalytic activity and to block ERK activation. In contrast, targeting the N-SH2 or C-SH2 revealed distinct roles of the two SH2 domains in downstream signaling, such as the phosphorylation of paxillin and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5. Our results delineate a hierarchy of function for the SH2 domains of SHP2 and validate monobodies as potent and specific antagonists of protein-protein interactions in cancer cells.",,"['Sha, Fern', 'Gencer, Emel Basak', 'Georgeon, Sandrine', 'Koide, Akiko', 'Yasui, Norihisa', 'Koide, Shohei', 'Hantschel, Oliver']","['Sha F', 'Gencer EB', 'Georgeon S', 'Koide A', 'Yasui N', 'Koide S', 'Hantschel O']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 and Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130826,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Models, Molecular', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'src Homology Domains']",['NOTNLM'],"['engineered proteins', 'interaction proteomics', 'protein interaction inhibitor', 'tyrosine phosphatase']",2013/08/28 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/08/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1303640110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1303640110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Sep 10;110(37):14924-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1303640110.

Intravenous (IV) Bu has more predictable bioavailability and a safer toxicity profile than the oral formulation. Comparative studies of outcomes have been performed between oral Bu/Cy and Cy/TBI, but there have been no comparative trials in the era of IV Bu. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective registry-based study comparing outcomes of patients with AML in first or second remission after alloSCT from sibling donors who underwent IV Bu/Cy (n = 795) or Cy/TBI (n = 864) conditioning. RESULTS: Engraftment rate was 98% and 99% after IV Bu/Cy and Cy/TBI, respectively. Grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly lower in the IV Bu/Cy compared with Cy/TBI group (P < .001). Similarly, chronic GVHD was significantly lower in the IV Bu/Cy compared with Cy/TBI group (P = .003). Cumulative incidence of 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM; +/- standard deviation [SD]) was 12% +/- 1% in the IV Bu/Cy group and 15% +/- 2% in the Cy/TBI group (P = .14), and 2-year relapse incidence (RI; +/- SD) was 26% +/- 3% and 21% +/- 1%, respectively (P = .012). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate (+/- SD) was 61% +/- 2% after IV Bu/Cy and 64% +/- 2% after Cy/TBI (P = .27). In multivariable analysis, adjusting for differences between both groups, patients who received IV Bu/Cy had lower acute and chronic GVHD, higher RI, and a trend toward lower NRM. LFS was not statistically different between the two conditioning regimens. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study shows that final outcomes after myeloablative conditioning using IV Bu/Cy were not statistically different from those after Cy/TBI.",,"['Nagler, Arnon', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Unal, Ali', 'Ben Othman, Tarek', 'Campos, Antonio', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Poire, Xavier', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Sengelov, Henrik', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Nagler A', 'Rocha V', 'Labopin M', 'Unal A', 'Ben Othman T', 'Campos A', 'Volin L', 'Poire X', 'Aljurf M', 'Masszi T', 'Socie G', 'Sengelov H', 'Michallet M', 'Passweg J', 'Veelken H', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Shimoni A', 'Mohty M']","['Arnon Nagler and Avichai Shimoni, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hasomer, Israel; Vanderson Rocha, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals, Oxford, United Kingdom; Myriam Labopin and Mohamad Mohty, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris University; Gerard Socie, Hopital St Louis, Paris; Mauricette Michallet, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon; Ibrahim Yakoub-Agha, University Hospital Lille, France; Ali Unal, Erciyes Medical School, Kayseri, Turkey; Tarek Ben Othman, Centre National de Greffe de Moelle, Tunis, Tunisia; Antonio Campos, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Porto, Portugal; Liisa Volin, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland; Xavier Poire, Cliniques Universitaires St Luc, Brussels, Belgium; Mahmoud Aljurf, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Tamas Masszi, St Istvan and St Laszlo Hospital, Budapest, Hungary; Henrik Sengelov, National University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark; Jakob Passweg, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland; and Hendrik Veelken, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130826,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Chemoradiotherapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/pathology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/08/28 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/08/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2013.48.8114 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2013.48.8114 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Oct 1;31(28):3549-56. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2013.48.8114.

The development of DS-TMD and DS-AMKL requires not only the presence of the trisomy 21 but also that of GATA1 mutations. Despite extensive studies into the genetics of DS-AMKL, the importance of epigenetic deregulation in this disease has been unexplored. We performed DNA methylation profiling at different stages of development of DS-AMKL and analyzed the dynamics of the epigenetic program. Early genome-wide DNA methylation changes can be detected in trisomy 21 fetal liver mononuclear cells, prior to the acquisition of GATA1 mutations. These early changes are characterized by marked loss of DNA methylation at genes associated with developmental disorders, including those affecting the cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrine systems. This is followed by a second wave of changes detected in DS-TMD and DS-AMKL, characterized by gains of methylation. This new wave of hypermethylation targets a distinct set of genes involved in hematopoiesis and regulation of cell growth and proliferation. These findings indicate that the final epigenetic landscape of DS-AMKL is the result of sequential and opposing changes in DNA methylation occurring at specific times in the disease development.",,"['Malinge, Sebastien', 'Chlon, Tim', 'Dore, Louis C', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Chou, Stella T', 'Weiss, Mitchell J', 'Crispino, John D', 'Figueroa, Maria E']","['Malinge S', 'Chlon T', 'Dore LC', 'Ketterling RP', 'Tallman MS', 'Paietta E', 'Gamis AS', 'Taub JW', 'Chou ST', 'Weiss MJ', 'Crispino JD', 'Figueroa ME']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130826,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics']",,,2013/08/28 06:00,2013/11/19 06:00,['2013/08/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49975-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-05-503011 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Oct 3;122(14):e33-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-05-503011.

METHODS: Computer-assisted literature search was performed with PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) to identify pertinent literatures. Software RevMan 5.0 was used for statistical analysis. The measurement of interest outcomes included severe neurotoxicity, death without breast cancer recurrences, leukemia, venous thrombus and severe cardiotoxicity. RESULTS: A total of 10 randomized controlled trial studies (RCTs) containing 18,198 cases were selected in this meta-analysis. Of which, 9,902 cases were treated with anthracycline & taxane and 8,296 cases treated with anthracycline alone as control. Anthracycline & taxane showed lower risks of incident leukemia (RR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.90), venous thrombus (RR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.84) and severe cardiotoxicity (RR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.26, 0.66), but higher risks of incident severe neurotoxicity (RR = 5.97; 95% CI: 1.72, 20.65) and non-recurrent death (RR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.06, 3.04), compared to anthracycline alone. CONCLUSION: Clinically important differences exist for general safety in favour of the anthracycline & taxane rather than anthracycline alone. However, as a result of tumor recurrent rate, anthracycline might be superior to anthracycline & taxane.

Previous meta-analysis found a borderline significant impact of this polymorphism on cancer risk; however, the result might be relatively unreliable due to absence of numerous newly published studies. Thus, we conducted an updated meta-analysis. A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase databases until April 9, 2013. The odds ratios were pooled by the fixed-effects/random-effects model in STATA 12.0 software. As a result, a total of 48 case-control studies with 17,159 cases and 22,002 controls were included. No significant association was detected between the Glu185Gln polymorphism and overall cancer risk. As to subgroup analysis by cancer site, the results showed that this polymorphism could increase the risk for leukemia and nasopharyngeal cancer. Notably, the Glu185Gln polymorphism was found to be related to increased risk for urinary system cancer, but decreased risk for digestive system cancer. No significant associations were obtained for other subgroup analyses such as ethnicity, sample size and smoking status. In conclusion, current evidence did not suggest that the NBS1 Glu185Gln polymorphism was associated with overall cancer risk, but this polymorphism might contribute to the risk for some specific cancer sites due to potential different mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to systematically identify a large series of cases of calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia and document the presentation, demographics, and clinical course across etiologies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The study was a hospital-based, retrospective case series, identifying subjects from 1999 through 2009 across the public hospital system in Queensland, Australia. All patients aged over 18 years were identified that had persistent hypercalcemia associated with elevated or inappropriately normal calcitriol concentration or elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. RESULTS: A total of 101 cases were identified. Sarcoidosis was the most common etiology (49%), followed by hematological malignancy (17%) and infections (8%). Etiologies not previously described include squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Median serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was higher in sarcoid patients compared with all other causes [218 U/L (176-277) vs 155 U/L (110-208), P < .001], but a level above the normal range did not discriminate well between cases of sarcoidosis and other causes (specificity at cutoff of 130 U/L was only 31%). However, a value greater than 250 U/L was highly specific (89%) for sarcoidosis but lacked sensitivity (31%). A calcitriol level greater than 300 pmol/L was not seen in sarcoidosis but was seen with other etiologies. Cases with neoplastic etiologies were older (61.4 +/- 11.4 y) than all other subjects (51.7 +/- 15.0 y, P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Hypercalcemia mediated by calcitriol remains a rare presentation.

The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the evidence for such a relationship. Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wangfang databases for studies of the polymorphism and ALL. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the GSTP1 polymorphism and childhood ALL were calculated in a fixed-effect model. Pooled ORs were calculated for a co-dominant model (GG vs AA, AG vs AA), a dominant model (GG + AG vs AA), and a recessive model (GG vs AA + AG). Analyses were also performed in subgroups stratified by race, study design, genotyping methods, and study sample size. This meta-analysis included 8 case-control studies with 1384 childhood ALL cases and 1755 controls. Overall, the variant genotypes (GG and AG) of A1578G were not associated with childhood ALL risk, when compared with the wild-type homozygote AA genotype (GG vs AA, OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.84-1.43; AG vs AA, OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.91-1.23). Similarly, no associations were found in the dominant and recessive models (dominant model, OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 0.92-1.23; recessive model, OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.84-1.43). Stratified analyses did not detect significant association in any subgroup. No heterogeneity or publication bias was observed in the present study. This updated meta-analysis indicates that the GSTP1 A1578G polymorphism is not associated with the risk of childhood ALL. In the future, additional studies in Asian and African-American patients should be performed to re-evaluate the association in these populations.",,"['Huang, G Z', 'Shan, W', 'Zeng, L', 'Huang, L G']","['Huang GZ', 'Shan W', 'Zeng L', 'Huang LG']","['Department of Pediatric Surgery, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20130724,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation, Missense', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,,2013/08/28 06:00,2014/02/13 06:00,['2013/08/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr2431 [pii]', '10.4238/2013.July.24.3 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2013 Jul 24;12(3):2481-91. doi: 10.4238/2013.July.24.3.,3,"['EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A case of fulminant HAdV hepatitis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia receiving rituximab and fludarabine is described. We conducted a comprehensive review of the English-language literature through May, 2012 in search of definite cases of HAdV hepatitis. RESULTS: Eighty-nine cases were reviewed. Forty-three (48 %) were liver transplant recipients, 19 (21 %) were bone marrow transplant recipients, 11 (12 %) had received chemotherapy, five (6 %) had severe combined immunodeficiency, four (4 %) were HIV infected, two had heart transplantation, and two were kidney transplant recipients. Ninety percent (46/51) of patients presented within 6 months following transplantation. Fever was the most common initial symptom. Abdominal CT scan revealed hypodense lesions in eight of nine patients. Diagnosis was made by liver biopsy in 43 (48 %), and on autopsy in 46 (52 %). The HAdV was isolated at other sites in 54 cases. Only 24 of 89 patients (27 %) survived: 16 whose immunosuppression was reduced, six with liver re-transplantation, and two who received cidofovir and intravenous immunoglobulin. CONCLUSION: HAdV hepatitis can manifest as a fulminant illness in immunocompromised hosts. Definitive diagnosis requires liver biopsy.

However, there is a marked variability in outcome within this group of AML, suggesting a significant biological and molecular heterogeneity. Chromosomal abnormalities may be cryptic by metaphase cytogenetics, but still have an impact on the process of leukemogenesis and/or the clinical outcome of NK-AML. Therefore, we analyzed the genomic complement of NK-AML cases to search for the presence of submicroscopic genomic imbalances. METHODS: We applied high-resolution oligo-based aCGH analysis to a cohort of AML patients with a normal karyotype, and FISH to validate the aCGH findings. Relative gene expression levels were examined by qPCR. RESULTS: High-resolution aCGH analysis of 21 NK-AML patients revealed one patient with a rare submicroscopic deletion at 7q31.1. This female patient exhibited a rapid disease progression and a dismal outcome. The deletion was mono-allelic, approximately 189,1 kb in size, and encompassed the major 3' part of the DOCK4 gene. The expression level of the DOCK4 gene in her leukemic cells was decreased when compared to CD34+ cells from healthy controls. When compared to AML patients with -7/del(7q) as the sole chromosomal anomaly, the DOCK4 expression level was found to be similarly low. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an acquired partial deletion of the DOCK4 gene in a patient with de novo NK-AML. DOCK4 is a strong tumor suppressor candidate, required for GTPase activation in signal transduction pathways controlling cellular proliferation, adhesion, migration and phagocytosis. Our findings may be relevant for understanding of the process of leukemogenesis and the response to therapy in a subset of NK-AML patients.",,"['Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Veigaard, Christopher']","['Kjeldsen E', 'Veigaard C']","['Hemodiagnostic Laboratory, Cancer Cytogenetics Section, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, Ent. 4A, 8000, Aarhus C, Denmark, Eigil.Kjeldsen@ki.au.dk.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130827,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged']",,,2013/08/28 06:00,2014/04/24 06:00,['2013/08/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13402-013-0145-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2013 Oct;36(5):395-403. doi: 10.1007/s13402-013-0145-5.

PTPN6 expression by immunohistochemistry in 40 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors was lost or suppressed in 53% (21/40). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of PTPN6 suppression, we performed a comprehensive epigenetic analysis of PTPN6 promoter 2 (P2). None of the DLBCL primary tumors (0/37) had PTPN6 hypermethylation on the CpG1 island using methylation-specific PCR, pyrosequencing, and high-resolution melting assays. However, hypermethylation in 57% (21/37) of cases was found in a novel CpG island (CpG2) in P2. PTPN6 gene suppression was reversed by 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) LBH589. LBH589 and 5-Aza in combination inhibited DLBCL survival and PTPN6 hypermethylation at CpG2. The role of histone modifications was investigated with a chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrating that PTPN6 P2 is associated with silencing histone marks H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 in DLBCL cells but not normal B cells. 3-Deazaneplanocin A, a histone methyltransferase inhibitor, decreased the H3K27me3 mark, whereas HDACi LBH589 increased the H3K9Ac mark within P2 resulting in re-expression of PTPN6. These studies have uncovered novel epigenetic mechanisms of PTPN6 suppression and suggest that PTPN6 may be a potential target of epigenetic therapy in DLBCL.",,"['Witzig, T E', 'Hu, G', 'Offer, S M', 'Wellik, L E', 'Han, J J', 'Stenson, M J', 'Dogan, A', 'Diasio, R B', 'Gupta, M']","['Witzig TE', 'Hu G', 'Offer SM', 'Wellik LE', 'Han JJ', 'Stenson MJ', 'Dogan A', 'Diasio RB', 'Gupta M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130827,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,,2013/08/28 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/08/28 06:00'],"['2013/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013251 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.251 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jan;28(1):147-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.251.

Increasing evidence has supported the idea that these subpopulations are selected in a Darwinian fashion, by which the genetic landscape of the tumor is continuously reshaped. Massively parallel sequencing has enabled a recent surge in our ability to study this process, adding to previous efforts using cytogenetic methods and targeted sequencing. Altogether, these studies reveal the complex evolutionary trajectories occurring across individual hematological malignancies.

A literature review.,154-8,10.4103/0019-509X.117033 [doi],"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in older adults differs biologically and clinically from that in younger patients and is characterized by adverse chromosomal abnormalities, stronger intrinsic resistance, and lower tolerance to chemotherapy. In patients over age 60 with AML, cure rates are under 10% despite intensive chemotherapy, and most of them die within a year of diagnosis. Over the last decade, metronomic chemotherapy has emerged as a potential strategy to control advanced/refractory cancer. Here, we report a case of a 68-year-old gentleman having AML with high-risk cytogenetic features, who achieved complete remission on our oral metronomic PrET (PrET: Prednisolone, etoposide, thioguanine) protocol on an outpatient basis. He was later treated with standard high-dose (HD) cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) consolidation followed by maintenance with etoposide, thioguanine, and sodium valproate. Presently, the patient is nearly 35 months since diagnosis and 21 months off treatment. This case report and review highlights that the combination of oral low-intensity metronomic therapy, followed by standard HD consolidation therapy and metronomic maintenance therapy may be well tolerated by elderly patients especially with less proliferative, high (cytogenetic)-risk AML who are otherwise deemed to be unfit for intensive intravenous induction chemotherapy regimens.

Inactivating RUNX1 mutations have frequently been found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, no somatic RUNX1 alteration was found in AMLs with leukemogenic fusion proteins, such as core-binding factor (CBF) leukemia and MLL fusion leukemia, raising the possibility that RUNX1 could actually promote the growth of these leukemia cells. Using normal human cord blood cells and those expressing leukemogenic fusion proteins, we discovered a dual role of RUNX1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. RUNX1 overexpression inhibited the growth of normal cord blood cells by inducing myeloid differentiation, whereas a certain level of RUNX1 activity was required for the growth of AML1-ETO and MLL-AF9 cells. Using a mouse genetic model, we also showed that the combined loss of Runx1/Cbfb inhibited leukemia development induced by MLL-AF9. RUNX2 could compensate for the loss of RUNX1. The survival effect of RUNX1 was mediated by BCL2 in MLL fusion leukemia. Our study unveiled an unexpected prosurvival role for RUNX1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. Inhibiting RUNX1 activity rather than enhancing it could be a promising therapeutic strategy for AMLs with leukemogenic fusion proteins.",,"['Goyama, Susumu', 'Schibler, Janet', 'Cunningham, Lea', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Rao, Yalan', 'Nishimoto, Nahoko', 'Nakagawa, Masahiro', 'Olsson, Andre', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Link, Kevin A', 'Mizukawa, Benjamin', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Liu, P Paul', 'Huang, Gang', 'Mulloy, James C']","['Goyama S', 'Schibler J', 'Cunningham L', 'Zhang Y', 'Rao Y', 'Nishimoto N', 'Nakagawa M', 'Olsson A', 'Wunderlich M', 'Link KA', 'Mizukawa B', 'Grimes HL', 'Kurokawa M', 'Liu PP', 'Huang G', 'Mulloy JC']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130827,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism/*physiology', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein']",,,2013/08/28 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/08/28 06:00'],"['2012/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['68557 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI68557 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2013 Sep;123(9):3876-88. doi: 10.1172/JCI68557.

One hundred human CLL samples and 20 normal B-cell samples from healthy controls were collected. We measured the BAG3 expression in these cells and explored its relationship with known prognostic factors for CLL. The roles of BAG3 in cell apoptosis and migration were evaluated by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of BAG3 in primary CLL cells. We showed that BAG3 expression level was increased in CLL cells compared with normal B cells. Moreover, BAG3 expression was particularly upregulated in CD38 positive, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain patients and those with lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly. Importantly, patients with increased BAG3 expression level have poor overall survival in subgroups with positive ZAP-70 or those without any ""p53 abnormality"".

DESIGN: Observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine patients (73 eyes) with CL. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features, histopathology, and systemic lymphoma. RESULTS: Of 59 patients with CL, systemic lymphoma was absent in 41 (primary CL; 69%) and present in 18 (secondary CL; 31%). Of 18 patients with systemic lymphoma at presentation, 14 (78%) had known systemic lymphoma and 4 (22%) were diagnosed with systemic lymphoma shortly after presentation. The most common types of systemic lymphoma in patients with secondary CL were diffuse large cell lymphoma (n = 5, 28%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (n = 4, 22%), multiple myeloma (n = 2, 11%), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (n = 2, 11%), extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (n = 2, 11%), plasmablastic lymphoma (n = 1, 6%), and unspecified non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2, 11%). Compared with patients with primary CL, patients with secondary CL had a shorter mean duration of ocular symptoms (5 vs. 17 months), had less often received steroids before referral (11% vs. 46%), and were more likely to have bilateral ocular involvement (33% vs. 20%). Eyes with secondary CL had a higher rate of poor vision (</=20/200) (46% vs. 12%), iris (20% vs. 4%) or ciliary body (30% vs. 8%) lymphoma, episcleral vascular congestion (40% vs. 16%), anterior chamber reaction (30% vs. 14%), hyphema (15% vs. 0%), vitreous cellular infiltration (30% vs. 4%), and severe media haziness (20% vs. 0%). Secondary CL was morphologically more high grade (50% diffuse large cell lymphoma) compared with primary CL (37% low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 27% extranodal marginal zone lymphoma). None of the 33 patients with primary CL and subsequent follow-up developed systemic lymphoma during a mean follow-up of 50 months (median, 35 months; range, 2-231 months). CONCLUSIONS: Secondary CL is morphologically high grade and associated with more severe ocular findings. Patients with CL and no known systemic lymphoma at presentation should undergo systemic evaluation to rule out the possibility of undiagnosed concurrent systemic lymphoma. However, none of the patients with primary CL in our study had late development of systemic lymphoma.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

METHODS: The uptakes of intracellular PpIX in K562 cells were detected by flow cytometry. The sub-cellular localization of PpIX was imaged by confocal microscope. The cytotoxic effect of PpIX-SDT was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenylter-trazolium bromide tetrazolium) assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by chromatin condensation with DAPI (4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, decrease of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP), re-distribution of Bax, and the expression changes of the key apoptosis-associated protein (Caspase-3 and polypeptide poly (ADP-robose) polymerase). The possible mechanism of SDT-induced apoptosis was investigated by detecting by intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation and effect of ROS scavenger-NAC (N-acetylcysteine) on SDT induced apoptosis. RESULTS: The intracellular PpIX increased quickly within 2 h after PpIX administration and PpIX mainly localized in the mitochondria. Compared with PpIX alone and ultrasound alone groups, the synergistic cytotoxicity of PpIX plus ultrasound was significantly boosted. In addition, the ultrasound induced some extent of chromatin condensation and MMP loss was greatly enhanced by the presence of 2 mug/ml PpIX, where PpIX alone treatment showed no or only slight effect. Time-dependent Bax translocation, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage were detected in SDT treatment groups. Besides, intracellular ROS production was significantly enhanced after SDT, and the general ROS scavenger NAC could obviously alleviate the SDT-caused cell viability loss, MMP loss, Bax redistribution and nuclear changes. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that PpIX-mediated sonodynamic action could induce apoptosis on K562 cells, and the intracellular ROS was involved in the PpIX-SDT induced apoptosis.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We propose gene transfer to hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) as a novel approach to deliver the CD19-specific CAR, with potential for ensuring persistent production of effector cells of multiple lineages targeting B-lineage malignant cells. Assessments were performed using in vitro myeloid or natural killer (NK) cell differentiation of human HSPCs transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying first and second generations of CD19-specific CAR. Gene transfer did not impair hematopoietic differentiation and cell proliferation when transduced at 1-2 copies/cell. CAR-bearing myeloid and NK cells specifically lysed CD19-positive cells, with second-generation CAR including CD28 domains being more efficient in NK cells.

Sulforaphane is the most extensively studied isothiocyanate, focused in its anti-tumoral activity and it is mainly found in great amounts in broccoli and other cruciferous. In a dose dependent manner, ITCs inhibit the cell viability of human cervical cancer cells, human pancreatic cancer cells, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, human ovarian cancer cells, and have antiinflammatory properties in the treatment of human T-cell leukemia cells. This protective effect may be due to improved antioxidant status.

We conducted a systematic search of three databases including PubMed and EMBASE for the period up to 20 February 2013 and identified 43 relevant studies. Six eligible studies were eventually selected for RAD51 (1764 cases and 3469 controls) and six studies for XRCC3 (1352 cases and 2582 controls). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of AML associated with RAD51 and XRCC3 were appropriately calculated based on fi xed- or random-effects models. The quality of studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Subgroup analyses were performed among Asian, Caucasian and other populations. The pooled results showed that the leukemia risk was not significantly associated with RAD51: the same results were obtained among any subgroup analysis.

METHODS: Serum polypeptides from 90 AL patients, 60 healthy controls and 20 patients with benign hematological disorders were enriched by copper chelate magnetic beads, and the peptidomics profile was obtained by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis. And the intensities of differential peptides were calculated to assess MRD level. RESULTS: The diagnostic models by using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm according to differential peptides between AL patients and healthy controls with P<0.01 by t-test were established. The sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing AL patients from healthy controls were 98% and 99%, respectively. The model obtained a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 96% for distinguishing newly-diagnosed AL patients from AL patients with hematological complete remission (AL-HCR). Then a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 93% were obtained for distinguishing patients with AL-CR from AL patients with molecular complete remission (AL- MR). The intensity of peptide with m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) 4468 was significantly higher in newly- diagnosed AL patients compared to healthy controls, and gradually decreased with the increase of remission degree, and it was not found increase in patients with benign hematological disorders. CONCLUSION: The SVM diagnostic model established by differential serum peptide profile could be used to discriminate AL patients with different stages of remission and to evaluate the treatment efficacy. The peptide of m/z 4468 could be used for MRD assessment, and continuous monitoring of its expression level will play an important role in the individual treatment and recurrence prediction.",,"['Song, Wei', 'Li, Wei', 'Wang, Guan-jun', 'Wang, Na', 'Liang, Ting-ting', 'Li, Yan', 'Cui, Jiu-wei']","['Song W', 'Li W', 'Wang GJ', 'Wang N', 'Liang TT', 'Li Y', 'Cui JW']","['The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/*diagnosis', 'Peptides', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/08/28 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/08/28 06:00'],"['2013/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.08.016 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2013 Aug;34(8):714-8. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2013.08.016.,8,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Peptides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Clinical data of 161 cases received allo-HSCT from July 2003 to November 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. The prognostic significance of HCT-CI, age, sex, conditioning regimens, disease status before transplantation, graft source and the degree of HLA matches for NRM and OS was conducted by COX regression model. The prognostic impact of HCT-CI on NRM and OS was performed in all patients under different disease status before transplantation. RESULTS: Of the 161 cases with allo-HSCT, 3-year NRM and OS were 26.4% and 61.4% respectively. NRM at 3 years in patients with HCT-CI score 0, 1-2 and >/=3 were 14.9%, 24.5% and 52.7% respectively.

In this paper, significant differences between the interaction of p53 with Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL were demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Bcl-xL was found to bind strongly to the p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD) with a dissociation constant (Kd) of ~600 nM, whereas Mcl-1 binds to the p53 DBD weakly with a dissociation constant in the mM range. In contrast, the p53 transactivation domain (TAD) binds weakly to Bcl-xL with a Kd ~ 300-500 muM and strongly to Mcl-1 with a Kd ~ 10-20 muM. NMR titrations indicate that although the p53 TAD binds to the BH3-binding grooves of both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, Bcl-xL prefers to bind to the first subdomain (TAD1) in the p53 TAD, and Mcl-1 prefers to bind to the second subdomain (TAD2). Therefore, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL have different p53-binding profiles. This indicates that the detailed interaction mechanisms are different, although both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL can mediate transcription-independent cytosolic roles of p53.

Cinnamon with scientific name ""cinnamomumzelanicum"" is a shrub of Laurales order, lauraceae family with cinnamomum genus. It is a medicinal shrub with anti-proliferation effect on tumor cells. This study was conducted to determine the effects of aqueous cinnamon extract on HL-60 cells as a model for APL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro experimental study, HL-60 cell line was cultured under the influence of cinnamon extract's concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 2 mg/ml in with intervals of 24, 48, and 72 h. Growth inhibition and toxic effects of cinnamon extract were evaluated through tetrazolium salt reduction. The effect of this herb on the cell cycle was studied by flow cytometry. The Hoechst stain was used to detect apoptotic cell nuclei. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells as correlated with concentration and time. After 72 h of treating HL-60 cells with 0.01 mg/l cinnamon extract, the growth of cells was inhibited by 90.1%. Cinnamon extract stopped the cell cycle in G1 phase and the Hoechst staining verified the apoptotic process in those cells. CONCLUSION: Considering the inhibitory property of cinnamon extract, we recommend it as a single drug or besides other medications for treating promyelocytic leukemia.",,"['Assadollahi, Vahideh', 'Parivar, Kazem', 'Roudbari, Nasim Hayati', 'Khalatbary, Ali Reza', 'Motamedi, Masoumeh', 'Ezatpour, Behrouz', 'Dashti, Gholam Reza']","['Assadollahi V', 'Parivar K', 'Roudbari NH', 'Khalatbary AR', 'Motamedi M', 'Ezatpour B', 'Dashti GR']","['Razi Herbal Medicines Research Center, Lorestan University of Medical sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130306,India,Adv Biomed Res,Advanced biomedical research,101586897,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'HL-60 cells', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'cinnamon extract']",2013/08/27 06:00,2013/08/27 06:01,['2013/08/27 06:00'],"['2012/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2277-9175.108001 [doi]', 'ABR-2-25 [pii]']",epublish,Adv Biomed Res. 2013 Mar 6;2:25. doi: 10.4103/2277-9175.108001. eCollection 2013.,,,PMC3748636,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally thought to be an important survival factor for multiple myeloma cells, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) has recently been shown in preclinical studies to be critical to the development and maintenance of AML, making it an attractive therapeutic target in this disease. Several characteristics, such as its very short half-life, distinguish Mcl-1 from other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Additionally, Mcl-1 levels are regulated by a large number of pathways affecting its transcription, translation and degradation. A variety of approaches exploiting these features has been developed to inhibit directly or indirectly the anti-apoptotic function of Mcl-1. Many of these lend themselves well to combination therapies, leading to striking synergism, at least in preclinical models.

The Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4) gene encodes a transcription factor important for key developmental stages of hematopoiesis, with known oncogenic implications in multiple myeloma, adult leukemias and lymphomas. Very few studies have reported an association of IRF4 with childhood malignancy, whereas high transcript levels have been observed in the more mature immunophenotype of ALL. Our aim was to investigate the expression levels of IRF4 in the diagnostic samples of pediatric leukemias and compare them to those of healthy controls, in order to determine aberrant gene expression and whether it extends to leukemic subtypes other than the relatively mature ALL subpopulation. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR methodology was used to investigate IRF4 expression in 58 children with acute leukemias, 4 leukemic cell lines and 20 healthy children. We show that aberrant IRF4 gene expression is implicated in a variety of leukemic subtypes; higher transcript levels appear in the more immature B-common ALL subtype and in T-cell than in B-cell leukemias, with the highest expression levels appearing in the AML group. Interestingly, we show that childhood leukemia, irrespective of subtype or cell maturation stage, is characterised by a minimum of approximately twice the amount of IRF4 gene expression encountered in healthy children. A statistically significant correlation also appeared to exist between high IRF4 expression and relapse. Our results show that ectopic expression of IRF4 follows the reverse expression pattern of what is encountered in normal B-cell development and that there might be a dose-dependency of childhood leukemia for aberrantly expressed IRF4, a characteristic that could be explored therapeutically. It is also suggested that high IRF4 expression might be used as an additional prognostic marker of relapse at diagnosis.",,"['Adamaki, Maria', 'Lambrou, George I', 'Athanasiadou, Anastasia', 'Tzanoudaki, Marianna', 'Vlahopoulos, Spiros', 'Moschovi, Maria']","['Adamaki M', 'Lambrou GI', 'Athanasiadou A', 'Tzanoudaki M', 'Vlahopoulos S', 'Moschovi M']","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Aghia Sofia Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece. madamaki@med.uoa.gr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130815,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2013/08/27 06:00,2015/01/23 06:00,['2013/08/27 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0072326 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-22937 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 15;8(8):e72326. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0072326. eCollection 2013.,8,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)']",PMC3744475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is highly expressed in these leukemias. In vitro studies have shown that pediatric MLL-rearranged ALL cells are sensitive to FLT3 inhibitors and clinical trials are ongoing to measure their therapeutic efficacy. We sought to determine the contribution of Flt3 in the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged leukemias using a myeloid leukemia mouse model. Bone marrow from Flt3 null mice transduced with MLL-ENL or MLL-CBP was transplanted into host mice and Flt3 (-/-) leukemias were compared to their Flt3 wild type counterparts. Flt3 deficiency did not delay disease onset and had minimal impact on leukemia characteristics. To determine the anti-leukemic effect of FLT3 inhibition we studied the sensitivity of MLL-ENL leukemia cells to the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 ex vivo. As previously reported for human MLL-rearranged leukemias, murine MLL-ENL leukemia cells with higher Flt3 levels were more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of PKC412. Interestingly, Flt3 deficient leukemia samples also displayed some sensitivity to PKC412. Our findings demonstrate that myeloid leukemias induced by MLL-rearranged genes are not dependent upon Flt3 signaling.

SP1049C, a Pluronic-based micellar formulation of doxorubicin (Dox) has completed Phase II clinical trial and demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. This study elucidates the ability of SP1049C to deplete cancer stem cells (CSC) and decrease tumorigenicity of cancer cells in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: P388 murine leukemia ascitic tumor was grown in BDF1 mice. The animals were treated with: (a) saline, (b) Pluronics alone, (c) Dox or (d) SP1049C. The ascitic cancer cells were isolated at different passages and examined for 1) in vitro colony formation potential, 2) in vivo tumorigenicity and aggressiveness, 3) development of drug resistance and Wnt signaling activation 4) global DNA methylation profiles, and 5) expression of CSC markers. RESULTS: SP1049C treatment reduced tumor aggressiveness, in vivo tumor formation frequency and in vitro clonogenic potential of the ascitic cells compared to drug, saline and polymer controls. SP1049C also prevented overexpression of BCRP and activation of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling observed with Dox alone. Moreover, SP1049C significantly altered the DNA methylation profiles of the cells. Finally, SP1049C decreased CD133(+) P388 cells populations, which displayed CSC-like properties and were more tumorigenic compared to CD133(-) cells. CONCLUSIONS: SP1049C therapy effectively suppresses the tumorigenicity and aggressiveness of P388 cells in a mouse model. This may be due to enhanced activity of SP1049C against CSC and/or altered epigenetic regulation restricting appearance of malignant cancer cell phenotype.",,"['Alakhova, Daria Y', 'Zhao, Yi', 'Li, Shu', 'Kabanov, Alexander V']","['Alakhova DY', 'Zhao Y', 'Li S', 'Kabanov AV']","['Center for Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130819,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ascites', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/prevention & control', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptides/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Poloxamer/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wnt Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/08/27 06:00,2015/01/23 06:00,['2013/08/27 06:00'],"['2013/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0072238 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-18380 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 19;8(8):e72238. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0072238. eCollection 2013.,8,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Abcg2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', '0 (SP 1049C)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '106392-12-5 (Poloxamer)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",PMC3747131,,"['1P20RR021937/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA151806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2R01 CA89225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 CA151806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR021937/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A specific set of mRNAs as internal control reference genes is considered as the preferred strategy to normalize RT-qPCR data. Proper selection of reference genes is a critical issue, especially in cancer cells that are subjected to different in vitro manipulations. These manipulations may result in dramatic alterations in gene expression levels, even of assumed reference genes. In this study, we evaluated the expression levels of 11 commonly used reference genes as internal controls for normalization of 19 experiments that include neuroblastoma, T-ALL, melanoma, breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer (NSCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and cervical cancer cell lines subjected to various perturbations. RESULTS: The geNorm algorithm in the software package qbase+ was used to rank the candidate reference genes according to their expression stability. We observed that the stability of most of the candidate reference genes varies greatly in perturbation experiments. Expressed Alu repeats show relatively stable expression regardless of experimental condition. These Alu repeats are ranked among the best reference assays in all perturbation experiments and display acceptable average expression stability values (M<0.5).

Therefore, a stringent regulation of Ikaros is of paramount importance for normal lymphocyte ontogeny. Here we provide genetic and biochemical evidence for a previously unknown function of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) as a partner and posttranslational regulator of Ikaros, a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in immune homeostasis. We demonstrate that BTK phosphorylates Ikaros at unique phosphorylation sites S214 and S215 in the close vicinity of its zinc finger 4 (ZF4) within the DNA binding domain, thereby augmenting its nuclear localization and sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Our results further demonstrate that BTK-induced activating phosphorylation is critical for the optimal transcription factor function of Ikaros.",,"['Ma, Hong', 'Qazi, Sanjive', 'Ozer, Zahide', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Ishkhanian, Rita', 'Uckun, Fatih M']","['Ma H', 'Qazi S', 'Ozer Z', 'Zhang J', 'Ishkhanian R', 'Uckun FM']","[""Systems Immunobiology Laboratory, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130819,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Infant', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Young Adult', 'Zinc Fingers']",,,2013/08/27 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/08/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0071302 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-12033 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 19;8(8):e71302. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0071302. eCollection 2013.,8,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)']",PMC3747153,,"['R21CA164098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA154471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01CA151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA164098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA154471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pituitary Tumor-Transforming gene 1 (PTTG1), an oncogenic transcription factor, is abundantly expressed in various human cancers and hematopoietic malignancies. However, its expression in normal leukocytes and most normal tissues is very low or undetectable. The mechanism by which PTTG1 overexpression modifies myeloid cell development and promotes leukemogenesis remain unclear. To investigate the mechanistic links between PTTG1 overexpression and leukemia cell differentiation, we utilized phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a well-known agent that triggers monocyte/macrophage differentiation, to analyze the expression patterns of PTTG1 in PMA-induced myeloid differentiation. We found that PTTG1 is down-regulated at the transcriptional level in PMA-treated HL-60 and THP1 cells. In addition, we identified a binding site for a tumor suppressor protein, Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), in the PTTG1 promoter. We found that KLF6 could directly bind and repress PTTG1 expression. In HL-60 and THP1 cells, KLF6 mRNA and protein levels are up-regulated with a concordant reduction of PTTG1 expression upon treatment with PMA. Furthermore, KLF6 knockdown by shRNA abolished the suppression of PTTG1 and reduced the activation of the differentiation marker CD11b in PMA-primed cells. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor and the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor significantly blocked the potentiation of PMA-mediated KLF6 induction and the down-regulation of PTTG1, indicating that PTTG1 is suppressed via the activation of PKC/ERK/KLF6 pathway. Our findings suggest that drugs that increase the KLF6 inhibition of PTTG1 may have a therapeutic application in AML treatment strategies.",,"['Chen, Pei-Yi', 'Yen, Jui-Hung', 'Kao, Ruey-Ho', 'Chen, Ji-Hshiung']","['Chen PY', 'Yen JH', 'Kao RH', 'Chen JH']","['Institute of Medical Science, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan ; Center of Medical Genetics, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130816,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CD11b Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 6', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Securin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",,,2013/08/27 06:00,2014/04/09 06:00,['2013/08/27 06:00'],"['2013/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0071282 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-11908 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 16;8(8):e71282. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0071282. eCollection 2013.,8,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (KLF6 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 6)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Securin)', '0 (pituitary tumor-transforming protein 1, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",PMC3745464,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We next characterized MYD88 expression in bone marrow CD34+ cells (N = 64). Increased MYD88 RNA was detected in 40% of patients. Patients with higher MYD88 expression in CD34+ cells had a tendency for shorter survival compared to the ones with lower MYD88, which was significant when controlled for IPSS and age. We then evaluated effect of MYD88 blockade in the CD34+ cells of patients with lower-risk MDS. Colony formation assays indicated that MYD88 blockade using a MYD88 inhibitor resulted in increased erythroid colony formation. MYD88 blockade also negatively regulated the secretion of interleukin-8. Treatment of MDS CD34+ cells with an IL-8 antibody also increased formation of erythroid colonies.

Second, AbBNPs are incubated with CRLF2-overexpressing (CRLF2+) or control blasts. Third, internalization of AbBNPs by blasts is evaluated by multicolor flow cytometry as a function of receptor expression, AbBNP size, and Ab/BNP ratio. Results from these experiments are con-firmed by electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and Western blotting. The optimal size and Ab/BNP for internalization of AbBNPs by CRLF2+ blasts is 50 nm with 10 Ab/BNP and 100 nm with 25 Ab/BNP. These studies show that internalization of AbBNPs in childhood B-ALL blasts is AbBNP size-and Ab/BNP ratio-dependent. All AbBNP combinations are non-cytotoxic. It is also shown that CD47 is very slightly up-regulated by blasts exposed to AbBNPs. CD47 is ""the marker of self"" overexpressed by blasts to escape phagocytosis, or ""cellular devouring"", by beneficial macrophages.

Notably, the contributions of uterine development to the subfertility phenotype were not elucidated in the previous report. In a readdress, the following study explores uterine aberration in Lgr4(K5 KO) female mice. Histological analysis revealed that the uteri of Lgr4(K5 KO) mice displayed altered epithelial differentiation characterized by a reduction in the number of uterine glands. Furthermore, Lgr4 deletion led to the reduced expression of morphoregulatory genes related to the Wnt signaling pathway. Additionally, the uteri of the Lgr4(K5 KO) mice lost the ability to undergo induced decidualization. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and administration of recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) demonstrated that the impaired decidualization in Lgr4(K5 KO) mice resulted from the decreased secretion of LIF concurrent with a reduction in uterine gland count.

It is important that we further our knowledge and understanding of a variety of stem cells from several different animal species before trials in humans commence. Here we describe methods for establishing rabbit embryonic stem (rES) cell lines with indefinite proliferation potential. rES cells attain maximum proliferation potential when cultured at a feeder cell density of one-sixth of that of full confluency. Higher and lower densities of feeder cells induced ES cell differentiation or division arrest. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 can maintain the undifferentiated status of rES cells; however leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is dispensable. Under optimized conditions, rES cells could be passaged by trypsinization 50 times. This culture system enabled efficient gene transduction and clonal expansion from single cells. rES cells grew as flat monolayer cell colonies, as reported for monkey and human ES cells, and expressed pluripotency markers. Embryoid bodies and teratomas formed readily in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Characterization of ES cells from different species is important for establishing common features of pluripotency.

However, the relationship between donor cell source and outcome of RIC-HCT in (Ph-)ALL patients has not been elucidated. In this study, we present the outcome of 57 (Ph-)ALL patients treated with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) followed by HCT from HLA-matched related (MRD, n = 34) or HLA partially matched related (PMRD, n = 23) donors from a multicenter cohort. Neutrophil recovery at day 100 occurred in 91.3 % of the PMRD group and 97.1 % of the MRD group (P = 0.84). One hundred days after treatment, the cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 30.4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 13.0-53.0 %) in patients who received PMRD grafts, and 27.3 % (95 % CI, 15.0-48.0 %) for those who received MRD grafts (P = 0.76). The cumulative risk of developing chronic GVHD was 59.4 % (95 % CI, 31.0-72.0 %) in the MRD group and 23.4 % (95 % CI, 4.0-43.0 %) in the PMRD group (P = 0.03). The cumulative incidence of relapse in patients who received PMRD grafts was 18.8 % (95 % CI, 3.0-34.0 %), while for those who received MRD grafts it was 37.2 % (95 % CI, 15.0-48.0 %) (P = 0.32). Overall treatment-related mortality was 41.6 % (95 % CI, 20.0-62.0 %) in the PMRD group and 19.9 % (95 % CI, 7.0-35.0 %) in the MRD group (P = 0.08). Relapse was the most common cause of mortality in the MRD group, while infection contributed to the majority of deaths in the PMRD group. The 3-year probability of disease-free survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (55.5 % for the PMRD group vs. 48.4 % for the MRD group; P = 0.81).

Here, we report that the cooperative synergy between prostate apoptosis response factor-4 (Par-4) and THAP1 induces cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) gene expression and cellular apoptosis in human T-ALL cell line Jurkat cells, CEM cells and primary cultured neoplastic T lymphocytes from children with T-ALL. Par-4 and THAP1 collaborated to activate the promoter of CCAR1 gene. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Par-4 and THAP1 formed a protein complex by the interaction of their carboxyl termini, and THAP1 bound to CCAR1 promoter though its zinc-dependent DNA-binding domain at amino terminus. Par-4/THAP1 complex and Notch3 competitively bound to CCAR1 promoter and competitively modulated alternative pre-mRNA splicing of CCAR1, which resulted in two different transcripts and played an opposite role in T-ALL cell survival. Despite Notch3 induced a shift splicing from the full-length isoform toward a shorter form of CCAR1 mRNA by splicing factor SRp40 and SRp55, Par-4/THAP1 complex strongly antagonized this inductive effect.

However, morbidity and early mortality in these patients are still very high, especially in children with acute monoblastic leukemia (AML FAB M5). Inflammatory syndromes complicating the management of these children after application of cytosine arabinoside and due to hyperleukocytosis at initial presentation have been reported. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been described as a serious and life-threatening acute complication during treatment of different oncologic entities; however, data on HLH in children with AML FAB M5 are extremely rare. METHODS: A retrospective study of all children with AML FAB M5 treated at our institution between 1993 and 2013 was performed to describe the clinical characteristics of patients who developed an inflammatory syndrome with HLH during oncologic treatment. RESULTS: Three of 10 children developed an inflammatory syndrome with fever, elevation of C-reactive protein, hyperferritinemia, elevation of soluble interleukin-2, and hemophagocytosis during prolonged aplasia following the first cycle of chemotherapy not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics. No infectious agents could be identified; the initial symptoms occurred 17, 18, and 28 days after diagnosis of AML, respectively. The children immediately responded to dexamethasone; however, the same syndrome was observed again after the second cycle of chemotherapy and, in one patient, also after the third cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Treating physicians should be aware of an inflammatory syndrome resembling HLH in children with monoblastic leukemia since this problem might extremely complicate management and supportive care of these children. The co-incidence of monoblastic leukemia with HLH might be explained by cytokines released from the monoblastic leukemic cells themselves.",,"['Lackner, H', 'Seidel, M G', 'Strenger, V', 'Sovinz, P', 'Schwinger, W', 'Benesch, M', 'Sperl, D', 'Urban, C']","['Lackner H', 'Seidel MG', 'Strenger V', 'Sovinz P', 'Schwinger W', 'Benesch M', 'Sperl D', 'Urban C']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 30, 8036, Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130824,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/08/27 06:00,2014/04/20 06:00,['2013/08/27 06:00'],"['2013/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-013-1937-x [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2013 Dec;21(12):3519-23. doi: 10.1007/s00520-013-1937-x.

Recently, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that influences heart interstitial fibrosis was mapped to chromosome 8. Our aim was to dissect the genetic basis of this QTL(s) predisposing SHR to hypertension, LVH, and interstitial fibrosis. METHODS: Hemodynamic and histomorphometric analyses were performed in genetically defined SHR.PD-chr.8 minimal congenic strain (PD5 subline) rats. RESULTS: The differential segment, genetically isolated within the PD5 subline, spans 788kb and contains 7 genes, including the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf) gene that has been implicated in hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. Mutant Plzf allele contains a 2,964-bp deletion in intron 2. The PD5 congenic strain, when compared with the SHR, showed significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by approximately 15mm Hg (P = 0.002), amelioration of LVH (0.23+/-0.02 vs. 0.39+/-0.02g/100g body weight; P < 0.00001), and reduced interstitial fibrosis (17,478+/-1,035 vs. 41,530+/-3,499 mum(2); P < 0.0001). The extent of amelioration of LVH and interstitial fibrosis was disproportionate to blood pressure decrease in congenic rats, suggesting an important role for genetic factors. Cardiac expression of Plzf was significantly reduced in prehypertensive (8 and 21 days) congenic animals compared with controls.

Less is known about patients treated with standard-dose cytarabine and anthracycline. We designed a risk-adapted remission induction regimen in which a second course of intermediate-dose cytarabine was delivered after standard ""7+3"" only if patients had 5% or more bone marrow blasts 15 days after chemotherapy initiation (d15-blasts). Of 823 included patients, 795 (96.6%) were evaluable. Five hundred and forty-five patients (68.6%) had less than 5% d15-blasts. Predictive factors for high d15-blasts were white blood cell count (P<0.0001) and cytogenetic risk (P<0.0001). Patients with fewer than 5% d15-blasts had a higher complete response rate (91.7% vs. 69.2%; P<0.0001) and a lower induction death rate (1.8% vs. 6.8%; P=0.001). Five-year event-free (48.4% vs. 25%; P<0.0001), relapse-free (52.7% vs. 36.9%; P=0.0016) and overall survival (55.3% vs. 36.5%; P<0.0001) were significantly higher in patients with d15-blasts lower than 5%. Multivariate analyses identified d15-blasts and cytogenetic risk as independent prognostic factors for the three end points. Failure to achieve early blast clearance remains a poor prognostic factor even after early salvage.

Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases exclusively overlap with immature cluster samples based on the expression of early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia signature genes, indicating that both are featuring a single disease entity. Patients lacking TRG@ rearrangements represent only 40% of immature cluster cases, but no further evidence was found to suggest that cases with absence of bi-allelic TRG@ deletions reflect a distinct and even more immature disease entity. Immature cluster/early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases are strongly enriched for genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells as well as genes expressed in normal early thymocyte progenitor or double negative-2A T-cell subsets. Identification of early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases solely by defined immunophenotypic criteria strongly underestimates the number of cases that have a corresponding gene signature. However, early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples correlate best with a CD1 negative, CD4 and CD8 double negative immunophenotype with expression of CD34 and/or myeloid markers CD13 or CD33.

As these miRNAs are also less abundant in patients without genomic deletion, their downregulation in CLL is likely to be caused by additional mechanisms. We found the primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) of MIR-15a/-16/-15b to be elevated and processing intermediates (precursor miRNAs) to be reduced in cells from CLL patients (22/38) compared with non-malignant B-cells (n=14), indicating a block of miRNA maturation at the DROSHA processing step. Using a luciferase reporter assay for pri-miR processing we validated the defect in primary CLL cells. The block of miRNA maturation is restricted to specific miRNAs and can be found in the cell line MEC-2, but not in MEC-1, even though both are derived from the same CLL patient. In these cells, the RNA-specific deaminase ADARB1 leads to reduced pri-miRNA processing, but full processing efficiency is recovered upon deletion of the RNA-binding domains or nuclear localization of ADARB1. Thus, we show that, apart from genomic deletion or transcriptional downregulation, aberrant processing of miRNA leads to specific reduction of miRNAs in leukemic cells.

METHODS: The data discussed in this review were obtained from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Consensus Conference on Diabetes and Cancer, held in New York, NY, USA, September 2012. RESULTS: The results of these studies demonstrate a significant association between diabetes and the risk of multiple cancers, including hepatocellular, pancreatic, endometrial, colorectal, breast, kidney, bladder, gastric, and ovarian cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, T cell lymphoma and leukemia. There are multiple potential biological mechanisms that may link type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may lead to direct activation of the insulin receptors on tumor cells and promote tumor growth. Other potential mechanisms include increased circulating, local or bioavailable insulin-like growth factor 1, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, increased circulating or local estrogen, adipokines and direct and indirect effects of inflammatory cytokines. Epidemiological studies have had conflicting results regarding the associations between various classes of antidiabetic medication and cancer development. Animal studies have demonstrated increased tumor growth with certain medications, but their relevance to humans is uncertain. Metformin may, however, have protective effects on cancer development and may improve survival in patients with cancer. CONCLUSION: We describe the current understanding of the links among diabetes, antidiabetic medication and cancer risk. We highlight some of the issues that should be addressed in the future to prevent cancer development and death in those with diabetes.",,"['Gallagher, Emily J', 'LeRoith, Derek']","['Gallagher EJ', 'LeRoith D']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Mt Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029-6574, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",101308636,IM,"['Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Incretins/therapeutic use', 'Insulin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Metformin/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Obesity/complications/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Thiazolidinediones/therapeutic use']",,,2013/08/27 06:00,2014/04/01 06:00,['2013/08/27 06:00'],"['2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/01.med.0000433065.16918.83 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes. 2013 Oct;20(5):485-94. doi: 10.1097/01.med.0000433065.16918.83.,5,"['0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Incretins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet how ERG causes leukemia is unclear. Here we show that pan-hematopoietic ERG expression induces an early progenitor myeloid leukemia in transgenic mice. Integrated genome-scale analysis of gene expression and ERG binding profiles revealed that ERG activates a transcriptional program similar to human AML stem/progenitor cells and to human AML with high ERG expression. This transcriptional program was associated with activation of RAS that was required for leukemia cells growth in vitro and in vivo. We further show that ERG induces expression of the Pim1 kinase oncogene through a novel hematopoietic enhancer validated in transgenic mice and human CD34(+) normal and leukemic cells. Pim1 inhibition disrupts growth and induces apoptosis of ERG-expressing leukemic cells. The importance of the ERG/PIM1 axis is further underscored by the poorer prognosis of AML highly expressing ERG and PIM1.

Here, we confirm miR-30c as a novel important target of C/EBPalpha during granulopoiesis. Thus, wild-type C/EBPalpha-p42 directly upregulates miR-30c expression, whereas C/EBPalpha-p30, found in AML, does not. miR-30c is downregulated in AML, especially in normal karyotype AML patients with CEBPA mutations. An induced C/EBPalpha knockout in mice leads to a significant downregulation of miR-30c expression in bone marrow cells. We identified NOTCH1 as a direct target of miR-30c. Finally, a block of miR-30c prevents C/EBPalpha-induced downregulation of Notch1 protein and leads to a reduced CD11b expression in myeloid differentiation. Our study presents the first evidence that C/EBPalpha, miR-30c, and Notch1 together play a critical role in granulocytic differentiation and AML, and particularly in AML with CEBPA mutations.

Enzymatic hyperactivity has been linked to aberrant repression of tumor suppressor genes in diverse cancers. Here, we report the development of stabilized alpha-helix of EZH2 (SAH-EZH2) peptides that selectively inhibit H3 Lys27 trimethylation by dose-responsively disrupting the EZH2-EED complex and reducing EZH2 protein levels, a mechanism distinct from that reported for small-molecule EZH2 inhibitors targeting the enzyme catalytic domain. MLL-AF9 leukemia cells, which are dependent on PRC2, undergo growth arrest and monocyte-macrophage differentiation upon treatment with SAH-EZH2, consistent with observed changes in expression of PRC2-regulated, lineage-specific marker genes.

Erlotinib and gefitinib alone did not promote differentiation, yet stimulated the acquisition of morphological and biochemical maturation markers (including the expression of CD11b and CD14 as well as increased NADPH oxidase activity) when combined with either ATRA or VD. Moreover, the combination of erlotinib and ATRA or VD synergistically induced all the processes that are normally linked to terminal hematopoietic differentiation, namely, a delayed proliferation arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. Erlotinib potently inhibited the (auto)phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14, best known as p38(MAPK)) and SRC family kinases (SFKs). If combined with the administration of ATRA or VD, the inhibition of p38(MAPK) or SFKs with specific pharmacological agents mimicked the pro-differentiation activity of erlotinib. These data were obtained with 2 distinct AML cell lines (HL-60 and MOLM-13 cells) and could be confirmed on primary leukemic blasts isolated from the circulation of AML patients. Altogether, these findings point to a new regimen for the treatment of AML, in which naturally occurring pro-differentiation agents (ATRA or VD) may be combined with EGFR inhibitors.",,"['Lainey, Elodie', 'Wolfromm, Alice', 'Sukkurwala, Abdul Qader', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Galluzzi, Lorenzo', 'Kepp, Oliver', 'Kroemer, Guido']","['Lainey E', 'Wolfromm A', 'Sukkurwala AQ', 'Micol JB', 'Fenaux P', 'Galluzzi L', 'Kepp O', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM; U848; Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy; Villejuif, France; Universite Paris Sud/Paris XI; Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; Hopital Robert Debre; AP-HP; Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130813,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'PML-RARalpha', 'cancer', 'dasatinib', 'imatinib', 'monocyte-specific esterase']",2013/08/27 06:00,2014/04/22 06:00,['2013/08/27 06:00'],"['2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['26016 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.26016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2013 Sep 15;12(18):2978-91. doi: 10.4161/cc.26016.

Although tremendous progress has been made understanding the downstream targets of MLL1 fusion oncoproteins and how manipulation of those targets impacts leukemogenesis, very little is known regarding how the initial expression of an MLL1 fusion protein impacts on that cell's behavior, particularly how the cell cycle is affected. Here, we focused on the function of endogenous MLL1 in the stem and progenitor cell types that are likely to be transformed upon MLL1 translocation.

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins, is over-expressed by several tumours. We aimed at determining whether COX-2 inhibitors down-regulate the IFN-g-induced expression of IDO1 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. IFN-gamma at 100 ng/mL up-regulated COX-2 and IDO1 in HL-60 AML cells, both at mRNA and protein level. The increased COX-2 and IDO1 expression correlated with heightened production of prostaglandin (PG)E(2) and kynurenines, respectively. Nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, down-regulated IDO1 mRNA/protein and attenuated kynurenine synthesis, suggesting that overall IDO inhibition resulted both from reduced IDO1 gene transcription and from inhibited IDO1 catalytic activity. From a functional standpoint, IFN-g-challenged HL-60 cells promoted the in vitro conversion of allogeneic CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells into bona fide CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells, an effect that was significantly reduced by treatment of IFN-gamma-activated HL-60 cells with nimesulide.

All-trans retinoic acid (RA), through binding to the retinoic acid receptors (RARs), alters interactions of the RARs with various protein components of the transcription complex at numerous genes in stem cells, and some of these protein components of the transcription complex then either place or remove epigenetic marks on histones or on DNA, altering chromatin structure and leading to an exit from the self-renewing, pluripotent stem cell state. Different epigenetic mechanisms, i.e. first, primarily H3K27me3 marks and then DNA methylation, may be employed by embryonic stem cells and other stem cells for control of early vs. late stages of cell differentiation. Creating these stable epigenetic changes requires the actions of many molecules, including tet1, polycomb protein complexes (PRCs), miRNAs, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and telomerase reverse transcriptase.

Together with qRT-PCR analysis, our data illustrated that primitive NSCs retained expression of key pluripotency genes Oct4 and Nanog, while exhibiting repression of other pluripotency-related genes Zscan4, Foxp1 and Dusp9 and up-regulation of neural markers Sox1 and Hes1. The early differentiation feature in primitive NSCs was also supported by their intermediate characters on cell cycle profiles. Moreover, re-plating primitive NSCs back to ESC culture condition could reverse them back to ESC stage, as shown by reversible regulation of marker genes, cell cycle profile changes and enhanced embryoid body formation.

To study the pharmacokinetics of allitinib and its two major metabolites in cancer patients, a rapid, sensitive and reliable LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of allitinib, M6 and M10 in human plasma. After simple protein precipitation, the analytes and the combined internal standards (lapatinib and NB-2, an analog of allitinib) were separated on a Zorbax Eclipase XDB C18 column (50 mm x 4.6 mm, 1.8 mum, Agilent) using a mobile phase of 5 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid (phase A) and 50% (v/v) methanol in acetonitrile (phase B) with gradient elution. Mass spectrometric detection was conducted by atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring modes using AB Sciex Triple Quad 6500 system.

Our aim here was to introduce granzyme M as an alternative and novel component of human cytolytic fusion proteins. We fused it to the humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) H22 which specifically binds to CD64, an FcgammaRI receptor overexpressed on activated myeloid cells and leukemic cells. We show that the humanized cytolytic fusion protein Gm-H22(scFv) specifically targets the acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL60 in vitro and is cytotoxic with an IC50 between 1.2 and 6.4 nM. These findings were confirmed ex vivo using leukemic primary cells from patients, which were killed by granzyme M despite the presence of the granzyme B inhibitor serpin B9.

The finding that defects of intracellular nucleases cause AGS led to the concept that intracellular accumulation of nucleic acids triggers inappropriate production of type I IFN and autoimmunity. AGS can also be caused by defects of SAMHD1, a 3' exonuclease and deoxynucleotide (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase. Human SAMHD1 is an HIV-1 restriction factor that hydrolyzes dNTPs and decreases their concentration below the levels required for retroviral reverse transcription. We show in gene-targeted mice that also mouse SAMHD1 reduces cellular dNTP concentrations and restricts retroviral replication in lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Importantly, the absence of SAMHD1 triggered IFN-beta-dependent transcriptional upregulation of type I IFN-inducible genes in various cell types indicative of spontaneous IFN production.

The cryopreservation and transplantation of these cells has been proposed as a fertility preservation strategy for young boys at risk for stem cell loss, i.e. patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer or as a conditioning treatment for bone marrow transplantation. To prevent lifelong sterility in boys, two fertility restoration strategies are being developed: the injection of SSC and the grafting of testicular tissue containing SSC. Depending on the disease of the patient one of these two approaches will be applicable. Grafting has the advantage that SSC can reside within their natural niche, preserving the interactions between germ cells and their supporting cells and may therefore be regarded as the first choice strategy.

Such representations of MTCL have thus far not been systematically appraised. We therefore provide an overview on existing models and point out their particular advantages and limitations in the context of the specific scientific questions. After addressing issues of species-specific differences and classifications, we summarize data on MTCL cell lines of human as well as murine origin, on murine strain predispositions to MTCL, on available models of genetically engineered mice, and on transplant systems. From an in-silico meta-analysis of available primary data of gene expression profiles on human MTCL we cross-reference genes reported to transform T-cells in mice and reflect on their general vs entity-restricted relevance and on target-promoter influences.

According to the current classification, PAH can be associated with exposure to certain drugs or toxins, particularly appetite suppressant drugs, such as aminorex, fenfluramine derivatives and benfluorex. These drugs have been confirmed to be risk factors for PAH and were withdrawn from the market. The supposed mechanism is an increase in serotonin levels, which was demonstrated to act as a growth factor for the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. Amphetamines, phentermine and mazindol were less frequently used but are also considered as possible risk factors for PAH. Dasatinib, a dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia was associated with cases of severe PAH, in part reversible after its withdrawal. Recently several studies raised the potential endothelial dysfunction that could be induced by interferon, and few cases of PAH have been reported with interferon therapy. Other possible risk factors for PAH include: nasal decongestants, like phenylpropanolamine, dietary supplement - L-Tryptophan, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, pergolide and other drugs that could act on 5HT2B receptors.

The research is aimed at determining whether Wnt5a affects the effects of Imatinib Mesylate against BCR-ABL positive CML cells (K562 cells and KU812 cells) and which signalling proteins are involved in. The results showed that Wnt5a augmented the effects of Imatinib Mesylate on inhibiting CML cells proliferation and inducing apoptosis in vitro; Wnt5a enhanced the inhibition effect of Imatinib Mesylate on the growth of K562 cells xenograft tumour in an animal model. Furthermore, Wnt5a inhibited beta-catenin and its target gene Survivin, increased the activity of JNK and suppressed gamma-catenin expression. When inhibiting the activity of JNK, the influence of Wnt5a on the effects of Imatinib Mesylate was attenuated. Moreover, JNK suppressed beta-catenin and its target gene Survivin, and enhanced the effects of Imatinib Mesylate.

METHODS: Analysis of children/adolescents with H&N B-NHL prospectively enrolled in the SFOP LMB-89 trial (July 1989-June 1996). RESULTS: One hundred and twelve of 561 patients (20%) had H&N involvement. The mean age of the patients was 8.4 years. Murphy staging differed between the H&N patients and the others (P < 0.0001): 9% versus 5% of the patients presented with stage I disease, 36% versus 11% presented with stage II disease, 12% versus 59% presented with stage III disease, 17% versus 10% with stage IV disease and 27% versus 16% with B-AL. Twenty-nine H&N patients (26%) had CNS involvement at diagnosis versus 8.5% in the group without H&N involvement (P < 0.0001). Patients were treated according to the LMB89 protocol: 3 H&N patients were allocated to group A, 70 to group B and 39 to group C. Ninety-seven percent of H&N patients achieved CR and event-free and overall survival at 4 years was 95.5% (5 deaths in patients with CNS disease).

Excavation adjacent to Children's Medical Center Dallas (CMCD) April 2006-February 2007 provided an opportunity to determine if excavation adjacent to a hospital building is associated with increased risk of developing HAEMI in children receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia. METHODS: Children who began receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia at CMCD from 2004 to 2008 were identified (n = 275). Exposures to the CMCD campus during intensive chemotherapy and duration of neutropenia per exposure were recorded. Proven, probable, or possible invasive fungal disease (IFD) was classified using EORTC/MSG guidelines. Institutional guidelines categorized mold infections as definite or possible HAEMI. A bivariate time-to-event model compared the association of excavation with HAEMI and yeast infections, controlling for neutropenia. RESULTS: There were 7,454 CMCD exposures, 1,007 (13.5%) during excavation. Of 50 cases of IFD, 31 were HAEMI. By time-to-event analysis exposure to the CMCD campus during the excavation period was significantly associated with HAEMI (HR = 2.8, P = 0.01) but not yeast infections (HR = 0.75, P = 0.75). Neutropenia was significantly associated with both HAEMI and yeast infections (P < 0.001). Voriconazole prophylaxis did not prevent HAEMI in 42% of the 14 patients with AML who had been receiving this agent. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate an association between exposure to hospital construction that includes excavation and HAEMI in pediatric oncology patients. Since neutropenic patients need protection from aerosolized fungal spores during visits to expanding medical centers, preventive strategies with adherence monitoring need additional study.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Pokala, Hanumantha R', 'Leonard, David', 'Cox, Jennifer', 'Metcalf, Pat', 'McClay, John', 'Siegel, Jane', 'Winick, Naomi']","['Pokala HR', 'Leonard D', 'Cox J', 'Metcalf P', 'McClay J', 'Siegel J', 'Winick N']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130823,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hospital Design and Construction', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*etiology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neutropenia/*etiology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'hospital construction', 'mold infections', 'pediatric oncology']",2013/08/24 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/08/24 06:00'],"['2013/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24685 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Feb;61(2):276-80. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24685.

Exportin-1 (XPO1), also known as chromosome maintenance protein 1, regulates cell growth and differentiation by controlling the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of proteins and RNAs, some of which are aberrantly modulated in BCR-ABL1(+) leukemias. Using CD34(+) progenitors from CML, B-ALL, and healthy individuals, we found that XPO1 expression was markedly increased, mostly in a TKI-sensitive manner, in CML-BC and Ph(+) B-ALL. Notably, XPO1 was also elevated in Ph(-) B-ALL. Moreover, the clinically relevant XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 strongly triggered apoptosis and impaired the clonogenic potential of leukemic, but not normal, CD34(+) progenitors, and increased survival of BCR-ABL1(+) mice, 50% of which remained alive and, mostly, became BCR-ABL1 negative. Moreover, KPT-330 compassionate use in a patient with TKI-resistant CML undergoing disease progression significantly reduced white blood cell count, blast cells, splenomegaly, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and bone pain. Mechanistically, KPT-330 altered the subcellular localization of leukemia-regulated factors including RNA-binding heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 and the oncogene SET, thereby inducing reactivation of protein phosphatase 2A tumor suppressor and inhibition of BCR-ABL1 in CML-BC cells.

On the one hand, autophagy might be induced as a prosurvival response to therapy, thereby reducing treatment efficiency. On the other hand, autophagy may contribute to degradation of fusion oncoproteins, as recently demonstrated for promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha and breakpoint cluster region-abelson, thereby facilitating leukemia treatment. Here, we investigated these opposing roles of autophagy in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, which express the most frequently occurring AML fusion oncoprotein, AML1-eight-twenty-one (ETO). We demonstrate that autophagy is induced by AML1-ETO-targeting drugs, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) valproic acid (VPA) and vorinostat. Furthermore, we show that autophagy does not mediate degradation of AML1-ETO but rather has a prosurvival role in AML cells, as inhibition of autophagy significantly reduced the viability and colony-forming ability of HDACi-treated AML cells. Combined treatment with HDACis and autophagy inhibitors such as chloroquine (CQ) led to a massive accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins that correlated with increased cell death. Finally, we show that VPA induced autophagy in t(8;21) AML patient cells, and combined treatment with CQ enhanced cell death. Because VPA and CQ are well-tolerated drugs, combinatorial therapy with VPA and CQ could represent an attractive treatment option for AML1-ETO-positive leukemia.",,"['Torgersen, Maria Lyngaas', 'Engedal, Nikolai', 'Boe, Stig-Ove', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Simonsen, Anne']","['Torgersen ML', 'Engedal N', 'Boe SO', 'Hokland P', 'Simonsen A']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130822,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transfection', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology', 'Vorinostat']",,,2013/08/24 06:00,2013/11/19 06:00,['2013/08/24 06:00'],"['2013/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49962-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-05-500629 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Oct 3;122(14):2467-76. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-05-500629.

However, only a few miRNAs have been reported to be altered in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURES: To uncover aberrantly expressed miRNAs in pediatric B-cell ALL, our study employed genome-wide miRNA microarray analysis and stem-loop real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to examine common precursor B-cell ALL samples. The target genes of miRNA-708 were then identified and verified by bioinformatics, dual-luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot. RESULTS: Significant upregulation of miR-708, miR-210, and miR-181b, and downregulation of miR-345 and miR-27a were observed in common precursor B-cell ALL (common-ALL) samples (P < 0.05). In addition, elevated expression of miR-708 and miR-181b were found in high-risk common-ALL compared to standard and intermediate ones. miR-708 inhibited luciferase reporter activity by binding to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of CNTFR, NNAT, and GNG12 mRNA in HEK-293 cell line and suppressed the protein levels of CNTFR, NNAT, and GNG12 in Jurkat cells. In addition, mRNA levels of CNTFR and NNAT, but not of GNG12, were found to be downregulated in high risk common-ALL samples. Mutational analysis revealed that miR-708 binds to the 394-400 bp sequence region of the 3'-UTR of CNTFR mRNA. CONCLUSION: The expression level of miR-708 reflects differences among the clinical types of common-ALL, and CNTFR, NNAT, and GNG12 were identified as targets of miR-708.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Li, Xue', 'Li, Dong', 'Zhuang, Yong', 'Shi, Qing', 'Wei, Wei', 'Ju, Xiuli']","['Li X', 'Li D', 'Zhuang Y', 'Shi Q', 'Wei W', 'Ju X']","['Department of Pediatrics, Cryomedicine Laboratory, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Shandong, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20130823,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['miRNA', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'regulatory region', 'target gene']",2013/08/24 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/08/24 06:00'],"['2013/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24583 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Dec;60(12):2060-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24583.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Six children with relapsed/refractory AML were treated with sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine, followed by single-agent sorafenib if not a candidate for transplantation. Sunitinib was initiated after sorafenib relapse. Bone marrow samples were obtained for assessment of FLT3 TKD mutations by deep amplicon sequencing. The phase of secondary mutations with ITD alleles was assessed by cloning and sequencing of FLT3 exons 14 through 20. Identified mutations were modeled in Ba/F3 cells, and the effect of kinase inhibitors on FLT3 signaling and cell viability was assessed. RESULTS: Four patients achieved complete remission, but 3 receiving maintenance therapy with sorafenib relapsed after 14 to 37 weeks. Sunitinib reduced circulating blasts in two patients and marrow blasts in one. Two patients did not respond to sorafenib combination therapy or sunitinib. FLT3 mutations at residues D835 and F691 were observed in sorafenib resistance samples on both ITD-positive and -negative alleles. Deep sequencing revealed low-level mutations and their evolution during sorafenib treatment. Sunitinib suppressed leukemic clones with D835H and F691L mutations, but not D835Y. Cells expressing sorafenib-resistant FLT3 mutations were sensitive to sunitinib in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib has activity in patients that are resistant to sorafenib and harbor secondary FLT3 TKD mutations. The use of sensitive methods to monitor FLT3 mutations during therapy may allow individualized treatment with the currently available kinase inhibitors.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"['Baker, Sharyn D', 'Zimmerman, Eric I', 'Wang, Yong-Dong', 'Orwick, Shelley', 'Zatechka, Douglas S', 'Buaboonnam, Jassada', 'Neale, Geoffrey A', 'Olsen, Scott R', 'Enemark, Eric J', 'Shurtleff, Sheila', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Inaba, Hiroto']","['Baker SD', 'Zimmerman EI', 'Wang YD', 'Orwick S', 'Zatechka DS', 'Buaboonnam J', 'Neale GA', 'Olsen SR', 'Enemark EJ', 'Shurtleff S', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Mullighan CG', 'Inaba H']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Structural Biology, Pathology, and Oncology, Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; and Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130822,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', '*Mutation', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Sunitinib', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/chemistry/*genetics']",,,2013/08/24 06:00,2014/05/20 06:00,['2013/08/24 06:00'],"['2013/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1323 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1323 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Oct 15;19(20):5758-68. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1323.

In adults, +21 has traditionally been considered an intermediate-risk cytogenetic aberration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 90 patients with newly diagnosed AML harboring +21. Four cytogenetic subgroups were defined based on associated cytogenetic abnormalities: +21 alone, +21 with favorable, +21 with intermediate, and +21 with unfavorable cytogenetics. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of patients with +21 AML achieved a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) after induction therapy with a trend toward improved CR/CRp rates in patients with +21 alone/+21 with favorable cytogenetics compared with patients with +21 with intermediate/+21 with unfavorable cytogenetics (76% vs. 50%; P = .057). Time to progression (TTP) was 12 months (range, 5-19) and overall survival (OS) was 9 months (range, 7-11) for the entire group. TTP was longer for patients with +21 alone (not reached) or with +21 with favorable cytogenetics (101 months) compared with those with +21 with intermediate cytogenetics (2 months) or +21 with unfavorable cytogenetics (11 months) (P = .02). Similarly, OS was improved in patients with +21 with favorable cytogenetics (not reached) or +21 alone (107 months), compared with +21 with unfavorable cytogenetics (9 months) or +21 with intermediate cytogenetics (8 months) (P < .001). The differences in TTP and OS were maintained on multivariate analysis (P = .04 and P = .001; respectively).

Current recommendations suggest a dose of 20 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days every 4 weeks. However, this therapy is associated with frequent grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity, requiring dose delays and/or dose reductions (DD/DR). RESULTS: We investigated the outcomes of 122 patients with MDS who had DD/DR of frontline decitabine therapy. Sixty-five patients (53%) had DR by at least 25% or DD (defined as a delay beyond 5 weeks between cycles). Thirty-five patients (29%) underwent DD/DR after achieving best objective response, 30 patients (25%) underwent DD/DR before best objective response, and 57 (54%) patients had no DD/DR. There was a trend for more durable responses in favor of patients requiring DD/DR after the achievement of best objective response (median not reached) (P = .161). Overall survival rates were significantly higher for patients who had DD/DR after best objective response compared with those who had DD/DR before best objective response or those with no DD/DR (30 vs. 22 vs. 11 months, respectively; P < .001). Progression-free survival (PFS) rates also trended higher for those with DD/DR after best objective response (median not reached) compared with those who required DD/DR before best objective response (median of 15 months) (P = .285). CONCLUSION: DD/DR may be safely accomplished once the patient has achieved best objective response (preferably complete remission [CR]) without impacting outcome.

Accumulated evidence has shown that leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in the bone marrow can survive TKI treatment via downstream BCR-ABL1-independent signaling pathways that are activated by soluble growth factors and interactions with the extracellular matrix in the bone marrow microenvironment. Research efforts have therefore turned to the identification and development of agents that target LSCs, and together with TKIs, have the potential to eradicate CML.

The mean diameter of LP-FTY720 was ~157 nm, and the FTY720 entrapment efficiency was ~85%. The liposomal formulation protected FTY720 from degradation in aqueous buffer and showed toxicity in CLL patient B cells comparable to that of free FTY720. Following intravenous injection in ICR mice, LP-FTY720 had an increased elimination phase half-life (~28 vs. ~19 hr) and decreased clearance (235 vs. 778 mL/h/kg) compared to the free drug. Antibodies against CD19, CD20 and CD37 were incorporated into LP-FTY720, which provided targeted delivery to CLL patient B cells and thus achieved higher killing efficacy.

TRIM proteins often play roles in the post-translational protein modification, including ubiquitylation and other ubiquitin-like modifications. Evidence has accumulated in regard to the contribution of TRIM proteins to diverse cellular processes, including such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, immunity and transcriptional regulation. In particular, some of the TRIM proteins have been characterized to exert oncogenic or tumour suppressor-like functions depending on the context. A recent report by Inoue and his colleagues has revealed that Terf/TRIM17 stimulates the degradation of a kinetochore protein ZWINT and regulates the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Terf has also been paid attention as a factor promoting neuronal apoptosis, by degrading a Bcl2-like anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1.

Recently, a few studies had concluded that this pathogen can indeed cause infection in immunocompromised hosts. However, the number of reports on K. kristinae infection in pediatric patients is still relatively limited. METHODS: Clinical data on pediatric patients who had K. kristinae cells isolated from their blood specimens during the period from January 2008 to May 2012 in a tertiary-care hospital in northern Taiwan were gathered and analyzed. RESULTS: Among 12 patients with K. kristinae cells isolated from their blood specimens, laboratory test results confirmed seven to have K. kristinae bloodstream infection. Six of them were premature babies, and one had acute leukemia. The infections were all healthcare associated. All the six premature babies had clinical presentation of sepsis and were inserted with percutaneous central venous catheters. One patient had two sets of blood culture positive for K. kristinae infection, and two premature patients had two sets of K. kristinae isolated, one from blood culture and the other from catheter tip culture, both of which were done at the same time. The leukemic child was inserted with a Broviac catheter and had K. kristinae isolated from both blood specimen and Broviac catheter. In the remaining five patients, K. kristinae infection was considered to be contaminant because they had only one set of positive blood culture and had other recognized infections. CONCLUSION: K. kristinae can cause infections in premature babies and immunocompromised pediatric patients using long-term intravenous catheters. Therefore, K. kristinae should be considered as a true pathogen and proper treatment should be provided to all susceptible pediatric patients.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

Arsenite (As2O3) is already being used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), yet its effects on GBM have not been evaluated in detail. In U87MG cell monolayers, we have previously shown that arsenite cytotoxicity significantly increases upon transient inhibition of lysosomal protease Cathepsin L (CatL). As multicellular spheroids more closely represent in vivo tumours, we aimed to evaluate the impact of permanent CatL silencing on arsenite treatment in U87MG spheroids. CatL was stably silenced using shRNA expression plasmid packed lentiviruses. By using metabolic- and cell viability assays, we demonstrated that long-term CatL silencing significantly increased arsenite cytotoxicity in U87MG spheroids. Silenced CatL also increased arsenite-mediated apoptosis in spheroids via elevated p53 expression, Bax/Bcl2 ratio and caspase 3/7 activity, though with lower efficacy than in monolayers. Arsenite cytotoxicity was enhanced by lower CatL activity, since similar cytotoxicity increase was also observed using the novel CatL inhibitor AT094. The results have significant translational impact, since stable CatL silencing would enable the application of lower systemic doses of arsenite to achieve the desired cytotoxic effects on GBMs in vivo.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Pertinent ongoing research questions, challenges arising out of the specific disease course and biology of PV as well as challenges and opportunities for new agents in PV are addressed. A focus is placed on pegylated interferon-alpha formulations (PEG-INFa2a) and JAK2 inhibitors. Newest data on symptom burden and incidence and prevalence of PV and MPNs are highlighted in the context of development of PV therapies. EXPERT OPINION: Therapeutic goals in PV are to prevent vascular events, reduce symptoms and for future therapies delay/prevent disease progression. Currently available treatments such as phlebotomy, antiplatelet therapy, managing risk factors and cytoreductive therapies such as hydroxyurea (HU) and PEG-INFa2a are effective. JAK2 inhibitors recently have shown promising activity in reducing PV symptoms and spleen size and improving blood counts. Yet the influence of long-term outcome and delaying disease progression is unknown.

The gene product, pVHL, regulates the level of proteins that play a central role in protecting cells against hypoxia. Clinical hallmarks of von Hippel-Lindau disease are the development of central nervous system hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, neuroendocrine tumors and endolymphatic sac tumors.In this article the case of a 38-year old hemodialyzed patient who became ill with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) three years after being diagnosed with von Hippel-Lindau disease is presented.After cytostatic treatment the patient went into complete hematologic remission but there was still residual disease at the genetic level. After consolidation therapy patient developed bone marrow aplasia and severe pneumonia. Despite intensive treatment the patient died from acute respiratory failure.In this paper we present for the first time a case of von Hippel-Lindau disease associated with acute myeloid leukemia. No evidence of relationship between VHL disease and blood cancers has been demonstrated so far. Despite the fact that there is an increased risk of cancer development in hemodialyzed patients, cancer is a relatively rare cause of death in the dialysed population, and the most common malignancies are genitourinary cancers. It seems likely that development of acute myeloid leukemia in patient with VHL disease can be related to epigenetic alterations of the VHL gene, but further studies are needed.",,"['Labno-Kirszniok, Katarzyna', 'Nieszporek, Teresa', 'Wiecek, Andrzej', 'Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Lubinski, Jan']","['Labno-Kirszniok K', 'Nieszporek T', 'Wiecek A', 'Helbig G', 'Lubinski J']","['Department of Nephrology, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, Medical University of Silesia, Francuska Street 20/24, Katowice 40-027, Poland. awiecek@sum.edu.pl.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20130822,Poland,Hered Cancer Clin Pract,Hereditary cancer in clinical practice,101231179,,,,,2013/08/24 06:00,2013/08/24 06:01,['2013/08/24 06:00'],"['2013/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/24 06:01 [medline]']","['1897-4287-11-11 [pii]', '10.1186/1897-4287-11-11 [doi]']",epublish,Hered Cancer Clin Pract. 2013 Aug 22;11(1):11. doi: 10.1186/1897-4287-11-11.,1,,PMC3846582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using MTT based cell viability assay, we evaluated the cytotoxic potential of fraction F2. It was the most effective on U937 cells (IC50ratio18.6 microg/ml). Inhibition of growth involved enhancement of Annexin V positivity. This was associated with elevated reactive oxygen species generation, measured by flow cytometry and reduced oxygen consumption - both effects being abrogated by anti-oxidant NAC. This caused stimulation of pro-apoptotic proteins and concomitant inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein expressions inducing mitochondrial depolarization, as measured by flow cytometry and release of cytochrome c. Interestingly, even with these molecular features of apoptosis, F2 was able to alter Atg protein levels and induce LC3 processing. This was accompanied by formation of autophagic vacuoles as revealed by fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy - confirming the occurrence of autophagy. Eventually, F2 triggered caspase cascade - executioners of programmed cell death and AIF translocation to nuclei. This culminated in cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase that caused DNA damage as proved by staining with Hoechst 33258 leading to cell death. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest fraction F2 triggers pro-oxidant activity and mediates its cytotoxicity in leukemic cells via apoptosis and autophagy. Thus, it merits consideration and further investigation as a therapeutic option for the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Roy, Rajneeta', 'Kumar, Deepak', 'Chakraborty, Biswajit', 'Chowdhury, Chinmay', 'Das, Padma']","['Roy R', 'Kumar D', 'Chakraborty B', 'Chowdhury C', 'Das P']","['Cancer Biology and Inflammatory Disorder Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130813,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flowers/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sesbania/*chemistry', 'U937 Cells']",,,2013/08/24 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2013/08/23 06:00'],"['2012/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0071672 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-38137 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 13;8(8):e71672. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0071672. eCollection 2013.,8,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",PMC3742510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It inhibits mutant and wild-type FLT3 in vivo at 0.1 and 0.5 microM, respectively, and has shown favorable activity and tolerability in phase I and II trials in acute myeloid leukemia, with QT prolongation as the dose-limiting toxicity. Co-administration with chemotherapy is planned. We characterized interactions of quizartinib with the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein). Its effects on uptake of fluorescent substrates and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry, binding to ABCB1 and ABCG2 drug-binding sites by effects on [(1)(2)(5)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin ([(1)(2)(5)I]-IAAP) photolabeling and ATPase activity, and cell viability by the WST-1 colorimetric assay. Quizartinib inhibited transport of fluorescent ABCG2 and ABCB1 substrates in ABCG2- and ABCB1-overexpressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner, from 0.1 to 5 microM and from 0.5 to 10 microM, respectively, and inhibited [(1)(2)(5)I]-IAAP photolabeling of ABCG2 and ABCB1 with IC(5)(0) values of 0.07 and 3.3 microM, respectively. Quizartinib at higher concentrations decreased ABCG2, but not ABCB1, ATPase activity. Co-incubation with quizartinib at 0.1 to 1 microM sensitized ABCG2-overexpressing K562/ABCG2 and 8226/MR20 cells to ABCG2 substrate chemotherapy drugs in a concentration-dependent manner in cell viability and apoptosis assays. Additionally, quizartinib increased cellular uptake of the ABCG2 substrate fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin, which also prolongs the QT interval, in a concentration-dependent manner, predicting altered ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics when co-administered with quizartinib. Thus quizartinib inhibits ABCG2 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, with implications for both chemosensitization and adverse drug interactions.

Therefore, we developed and optimized quantitative expression assays for both, the wild type, or the reference sequence (WT-IRF8) and novel splice variants (SV-IRF8). These assays were used to quantify IRF8 transcript levels in 194 adult patients with AML, and multivariate analyses investigated the prognostic significance of these expression levels. After adjusting for known prognostic factors, expression levels of WT- or SV-IRF8 transcripts were not significantly associated with complete responses or overall survival. However, increased expression of WT-IRF8 was associated with decreased relapse-free survival (RFS) in both univariate (P = 0.010) and multivariate (P = 0.019) analyses. Similarly, increased expression of SV-IRF8 was associated with a decreased RFS (univariate, P = 0.026 and multivariate, P = 0.021).

HTLV-1 is capable of transforming T lymphocytes in infected patients resulting in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma whereas HTLV-2 is not clearly associated with lymphoproliferative diseases. Numerous studies have provided accumulating evidence on the involvement of the viral transactivators Tax-1 versus Tax-2 in T cell transformation. Tax-1 is a potent transcriptional activator of both viral and cellular genes. Tax-1 post-translational modifications and specifically ubiquitylation and SUMOylation have been implicated in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and may contribute to its transformation capacity. Although Tax-2 has similar protein structure compared to Tax-1, the two proteins display differences both in their protein-protein interaction and activation of signal transduction pathways. Recent studies on Tax-2 have suggested ubiquitylation and SUMOylation independent mechanisms of NF-kappaB activation. In this present review, structural and functional differences between Tax-1 and Tax-2 will be summarized. Specifically, we will address their subcellular localization, nuclear trafficking and their effect on cellular regulatory proteins.

After the identification of the antisense strand-encoded human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) bZIP (HBZ) factor, we reported that HBZ could interact with CRE-binding protein (CREB) transcription factors and consequently turn off the important activating potential of the viral Tax protein on HTLV-1 5' LTR promoter activity. We have recently accumulated new results demonstrating that antisense transcripts also exist in HTLV-2, -3, and -4. Furthermore, our data have confirmed the existence of encoded proteins from these antisense transcripts (termed antisense proteins of HTLVs or APHs). APHs are also involved in the down-regulation of Tax-dependent viral transcription. In this review, we will focus on the different molecular mechanisms used by HBZ and APH-2 to control viral expression. While HBZ interacts with CREB through its basic zipper domain, APH-2 binds to this cellular factor through a five amino acid motif localized in its carboxyl terminus. Moreover, unlike APH-2, HBZ possesses an N-terminal activation domain that also contributes to the inhibition of the viral transcription by interacting with the KIX domain of p300/CBP. On the other hand, HBZ was found to induce T cell proliferation while APH-2 was unable to promote such proliferation. Interestingly, HTLV-2 has not been causally linked to human T cell leukemia, while HTLV-1 is responsible for the development of the adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma.

Although a full blood count and a peripheral blood film can go a long way to resolve some of these diagnostic challenges faced by doctors in the districts, this information was generally not provided in the referral letter. After careful selection, 80 patients actually underwent a bone marrow examination. The result of the full blood count and peripheral film were available before bone marrow sampling was done. RESULTS: Lymphoproliferative disorders were the most common diseases that caused infiltration of the bone marrow. 27.5% of lymphomas were diagnosed on morphological examination of the bone marrow as high grade B cell NHL, 13.75% had tropical splenic lymphoma, 10% had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 5% had disseminated high grade T cell lymphoma and 2.5% had Adult T cell Leukaemia Lymphoma (ATLL). Other disorders diagnosed after bone marrow examination include myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), aplastic anaemia, megaloblastic anaemia and myelofibrosis. Only 8.75% of these patients had a normal bone marrow.

The EWS-FLI1 fusion protein acts in a positive feedback loop to maintain the expression of PARP-1, which is involved in repair of DNA damage. Here, we examine the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and radiation therapy on Ewing sarcomas. In proliferation assays, the Ewing sarcoma cell lines RD-ES and SK-N-MC were much more sensitive than non-Ewing sarcoma cell lines to the PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib (Ola; IC50 0.5-1 mumol/L vs. >5 mumol/L) and to radiation (IC50 2-4 Gy vs. >6 Gy). PARP-1 inhibition with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or Ola sensitized Ewing sarcoma cells, but not non-Ewing sarcoma cells, to radiation therapy in both proliferation and colony formation assays. Using the Comet assay, radiation of Ewing sarcoma cells with Ola, compared to without Ola, resulted in more DNA damage at 1 hour (mean tail moment 36-54 vs. 26-28) and sustained DNA damage at 24 hours (24-29 vs. 6-8). This DNA damage led to a 2.9- to 4.0-fold increase in apoptosis and a 1.6- to 2.4-fold increase in cell death. The effect of PARP-1 inhibition and radiation therapy on Ewing sarcoma cells was lost when EWS-FLI1 was silenced by shRNA. A small dose of radiation therapy (4 Gy), when combined with PARP-1 inhibition, stopped the growth of SK-N-MC flank tumors xenografts. In conclusion, PARP-1 inhibition in Ewing sarcomas amplifies the level and duration of DNA damage caused by radiation therapy, leading to synergistic increases in apoptosis and cell death in a EWS-FLI1-dependent manner.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"['Lee, Hae-June', 'Yoon, Changhwan', 'Schmidt, Benjamin', 'Park, Do Joong', 'Zhang, Alexia Y', 'Erkizan, Hayriye V', 'Toretsky, Jeffrey A', 'Kirsch, David G', 'Yoon, Sam S']","['Lee HJ', 'Yoon C', 'Schmidt B', 'Park DJ', 'Zhang AY', 'Erkizan HV', 'Toretsky JA', 'Kirsch DG', 'Yoon SS']","['Corresponding Author: Sam S.

However, the understanding of how CR affects the response to cancer therapy is still rudimentary. Here, using the Emicro-Myc transgenic mouse model of B-cell lymphoma, we report that by reducing protein translation, CR can reduce expression of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 and sensitize lymphomas to ABT-737-induced death in vivo. By using Emicro-Myc lymphoma cells lacking p53, we showed that CR mimetics such as 2-deoxyglucose led to a decrease in Mcl-1 expression and sensitized lymphoma cells to ABT-737-induced death independently of p53. In keeping with this, Emicro-Myc lymphoma cells lacking the BH3-only proapoptotic members Noxa, Puma, or Bim were also sensitized by CR mimetics to ABT-737-induced death. Remarkably, neither the loss of both Puma and Noxa, the loss of both Puma and Bim, nor the loss of all three BH3-only proteins prevented sensitization to ABT-737 induced by CR mimetics. Thus, CR can influence Mcl-1 expression and sensitize cells to BH3 mimetic-induced apoptosis, independently of the main BH3-only proteins and of p53.

Several cellular factors that restrict retroviral infection have been identified in the hosts. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a gammaretrovirus that is classified into several receptor interference groups, including a novel FeLV-subgroup D (FeLV-D) that we recently identified. FeLV-D is generated by transduction of the env gene of feline endogenous gammaretrovirus of the domestic cat (ERV-DCs) into FeLV. Some ERV-DCs are replication competent viruses which are present and hereditary in cats. We report here the determination of new viral receptor interference groups and the discovery of a soluble antiretroviral factor, termed Refrex-1. Detailed analysis of FeLV-D strains and ERV-DCs showed two receptor interference groups that are distinct from other FeLV subgroups, and Refrex-1 specifically inhibited one of them. Refrex-1 is characterized as a truncated envelope protein of ERV-DC and includes the N-terminal region of surface unit, which is a putative receptor-binding domain, but lacks the transmembrane region. Refrex-1 is efficiently secreted from the cells and appears to cause receptor interference extracellularly. Two variants of Refrex-1 encoded by provirus loci, ERV-DC7 and DC16, are expressed in a broad range of feline tissues. The host retains Refrex-1 as an antiretroviral factor, which may potentially prevent reemergence of the ERVs and the emergence of novel ERV-related viruses in cats. Refrex-1 may have been acquired during endogenization of ERV-DCs and may play an important role in retroviral restriction and antiviral defense in cats.",,"['Ito, Jumpei', 'Watanabe, Shinya', 'Hiratsuka, Takahiro', 'Kuse, Kyohei', 'Odahara, Yuka', 'Ochi, Haruyo', 'Kawamura, Maki', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Ito J', 'Watanabe S', 'Hiratsuka T', 'Kuse K', 'Odahara Y', 'Ochi H', 'Kawamura M', 'Nishigaki K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130821,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cats', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/*pharmacology/*physiology', 'Genes, env/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology/*physiology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*prevention & control/veterinary/virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*prevention & control/veterinary/virology', 'Viral Interference', 'Virus Replication']",,,2013/08/24 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2013/08/23 06:00'],"['2013/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01267-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01267-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Nov;87(22):12029-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01267-13.

To determine the recombination potential of PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2, we examined the generation of replication-competent retroviruses (RCRs) over time in a cell culture system. We observed that either virus alone was noninfectious and the RNA transcripts of the viruses were undetectable in the blood and spleen of nude mice that carry them. To determine their potential to generate RCRs through recombination, we transfected PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 into 293T cells and used the virus produced to infect fresh cells; the presence of reverse transcriptase activity at 10 days postinfection indicated the presence of RCRs. Population sequencing of proviral DNA indicated that all RCRs contained the gag and 5' half of pol from PreXMRV-2 and the long terminal repeat, 3' half of pol (including integrase), and env from PreXMRV-1. All crossovers were within sequences of at least 9 identical nucleotides, and crossovers within each of two selected recombination zones of 415 nucleotides (nt) in the 5' untranslated region and 982 nt in pol were required to generate RCRs. A recombinant with the same genotype as XMRV was not detected, and our analysis indicates that the probability of generating an identical RCR is vanishingly small. In addition, the studies indicate that the process of RCR formation is primarily driven by selection for viable cis and trans elements from the parental proviruses.",,"['Delviks-Frankenberry, Krista', 'Paprotka, Tobias', 'Cingoz, Oya', 'Wildt, Sheryl', 'Hu, Wei-Shau', 'Coffin, John M', 'Pathak, Vinay K']","['Delviks-Frankenberry K', 'Paprotka T', 'Cingoz O', 'Wildt S', 'Hu WS', 'Coffin JM', 'Pathak VK']",['Viral Mutation Section.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130821,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animal Structures/virology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', '*Virus Replication', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*physiology']",,,2013/08/24 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/08/23 06:00'],"['2013/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01787-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01787-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Nov;87(21):11525-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01787-13.

The BCR/ABL protein displays a constitutively increased tyrosine kinase activity that alters many regulatory pathways, leading to uncontrolled growth, impaired differentiation and increased resistance to apoptosis featured by leukemic cells. Current CML therapy is based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), primarily imatinib, which induce apoptosis in leukemic cells. However, some patients show primary resistance to TKIs while others develop it in the course of therapy. In both cases, resistance may be underlined by perturbations in apoptotic signaling in leukemic cells. As mitochondria may play an important role in such signaling, alteration in mitochondrial metabolism may change resistance to pro-apoptotic action of TKIs in BCR/ABL-positive cells. Because BCR/ABL may induce reactive oxygen species and unfaithful DNA repair, it may affect the stability of mitochondrial DNA, influencing mitochondrial apoptotic signaling and in this way change the sensitivity of CML cells to TKIs. Moreover, cancer cells, including BCR/ABL-positive cells, show an increased level of glucose metabolism, resulting from the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis to supply ATP for extensive proliferation. Enhanced level of glycolysis may be associated with TKI resistance and requires change in the expression of several genes regulated mostly by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, HIF-1alpha. Such regulation may be associated with the impaired mitochondrial respiratory system in CML cells. In summary, mitochondria and mitochondria-associated molecules and pathways may be attractive targets to overcome TKI resistance in CML.",,"['Glowacki, Sylwester', 'Synowiec, Ewelina', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Glowacki S', 'Synowiec E', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, Lodz 90-236, Poland. sglowa@biol.uni.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130807,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genome, Mitochondrial', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",,,2013/08/24 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/08/23 06:00'],"['2013/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms140816348 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms140816348 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2013 Aug 7;14(8):16348-64. doi: 10.3390/ijms140816348.,8,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC3759915,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to better characterize osteochondromas occurring in these children. METHODS: We identified all children (0 to 18 y) who received an allogeneic HSCT and TBI from 2000 to 2012 from a blood and marrow transplant (BMT) database. Thereafter, we identified those who developed osteochondromas through a chart review. In addition, we searched for diagnosis and operative codes from 1996 to 2012 in our pediatric orthopaedic clinical records, isolating osteochondroma patients with a history of radiation exposure. RESULTS: Four patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT and were later diagnosed with osteochondromas were identified from the BMT database (N=233 children); all 4 were among a group of 72 patients who received TBI. Three patients were identified from orthopaedic records. The cohort included 5 boys and 2 girls with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (N=5) or neuroblastoma (N=2), diagnosed at a median age of 2.0 years. Therapy for all patients included chemotherapy, radiation therapy (TBI, N=5; abdominal, N=2), and HSCT. A diagnosis of osteochondroma was made at a median age of 11.7 years (range, 5 to 16 y), on average 8.6 years after radiation therapy. Diagnosis was incidental in 2 patients and secondary to symptoms (pain or genu valgum) in 5. Locations of osteochondromas were the proximal tibia (N=3), distal tibia, distal femur, distal ulna, and the distal phalanx (N=1 each). Three patients underwent surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: Children may be more likely to develop osteochondromas after early exposure to radiation therapy, which may cause pain and require surgical resection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a radiation-induced osteochondroma causing lower extremity malalignment. Patients typically present to the pediatric orthopaedist's attention when symptomatic, but there may be an expanded role for counseling for potential for long-term skeletal effects in this group.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Cross sectional study in 134 patients aged 2-18, who visited department of pediatrics at Thammasat University Hospital were performed. Health related quality of life was evaluated using Thai version of Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL 4.0). For children aged 2-4 and 5-18, the questionnaire was answered by their guardians and by themselves and their guardians, respectively. The present study evaluated health related quality of life in four aspects: physical, emotional, social and school functioning. Points were then pooled and divided into three categories, namely total, physical health summary and psychosocial health summary scale scores. Each category could have a maximum score of 100. RESULTS: The mean total scale score from the questionnaire answering by guardians was highest in allergic rhinitis (77.6 +/- 12.1). Physical and psychosocial scale scores were 81.7 +/- 16.8 and 75.4 +/- 12.5. Total scale scores in asthma, chronic renal diseases, leukemia and lymphoma, and congenital heart defects were 73.8 +/- 14.7, 73.5 +/- 18.9, 64.5 +/- 14.0 and 76.2 +/- 19.6, respectively Cerebral palsy had the lowest total scale score of 27.1 +/- 16.7 with physical and psychosocial scale scores of 16.9 +/- 7.5 and 33.0 +/- 23.2, respectively. When patients answered the questionnaire by themselves, it was found that allergic rhinitis had the highest total scale score (79.5 +/- 13.2). Total scale scores in asthma, chronic renal diseases, leukemia and lymphoma, and heart diseases were 75.2 +/- 16.4, 76.3 +/- 16.2, 70.5 +/- 9.4 and 72.4 +/- 22.7, respectively. Cerebral palsy had the lowest scale scores in all categories, with total scale score of 46.1 +/- 14.6, physical scale score of 23.4 +/- 6.6 and psychosocial scale score of 58.3 +/- 18.8.

Using a combination of Thymic Leukemia (TL) antigen tetramer, which directly binds CD8alphaalpha, anti-CD161, and anti-Valpha7.2 antibodies we have been able for the first time to clearly define CD8alphaalpha expression on human CD8 T cells subsets. In healthy controls CD8alphaalpha is most highly expressed by CD161 ""bright"" (CD161++) mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, with CD8alphaalpha expression highly restricted to the TCR Valpha7.2+ cells of this subset. We also identified CD8alphaalpha-expressing populations within the CD161 ""mid"" (CD161+) and ""negative"" (CD161-) non-MAIT CD8 T cell subsets and show TL-tetramer binding to correlate with expression of CD8beta at low levels in the context of maintained CD8alpha expression (CD8alpha+CD8beta(low)). In addition, we found CD161-CD8alpha+CD8beta(low) populations to be significantly expanded in the peripheral blood of HIV-1 and hepatitis B (mean of 47 and 40% of CD161- T cells respectively) infected individuals. Such CD8alphaalpha expressing T cells are an effector-memory population (CD45RA-, CCR7-, CD62L-) that express markers of activation and maturation (HLA-DR+, CD28-, CD27-, CD57+) and are functionally distinct, expressing greater levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma on stimulation and perforin at rest than their CD8alpha+CD8beta(high) counterparts. Antigen-specific T cells in HLA-B( *)4201+HIV-1 infected patients are found within both the CD161-CD8alpha+CD8beta(high) and CD161-CD8alpha+CD8beta(low) populations. Overall we have clearly defined CD8alphaalpha expressing human T cell subsets using the TL-tetramer, and have demonstrated CD161-CD8alpha+CD8beta(low) populations, highly expanded in disease settings, to co-express CD8alphabeta and CD8alphaalpha.

Here we describe a case study to validate predictions while treating the methods as a ""black box."" METHODS: Medical Prognosis Institute (MPI) constructed cell-line-derived sensitivity scores (SSs) and combined scores (CSs) that incorporate clinical variables. MD Anderson researchers evaluated their predictions. We searched the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify validation datasets, and we performed statistical evaluation of the agreement between prediction and clinical observation. RESULTS: We identified 3 suitable datasets: GSE16446 (n = 120; binary outcome), GSE17920 (n = 130; binary outcome), and GSE10255 (n = 161; continuous and time-to-event outcomes). The SS was statistically significantly associated with primary treatment responses for all studies (GSE16446: P = .02; GSE17920: P = .02; GSE10255: P = .02). Dichotomized SSs performed no better than chance for GSE16446 and GSE17920, and categorized SSs did not predict disease-free survival (GSE10255). SSs sometimes improved on predictions using clinical variables (GSE16446: P = .05; GSE17920: P = .31; GSE10255: P = .045), but gains were limited (95% confidence intervals for GSE16446 and GSE17920 include 0). The CS did not predict treatment response for GSE16446 (P = .55), but it did for GSE17920 (P < .001). Coefficients of clinical variables provided by MPI for CSs agree with estimates for GSE17920 better than estimates for GSE16446. CONCLUSIONS: Model predictions were better than chance in all three datasets. However, these scores added little to existing clinical predictors; statistically significant contributions were likely to be too small to change clinical practice. These findings suggest that discovering better predictors will require both cell line data and a clinical training dataset of patient samples.",,"['Wang, Wenting', 'Baggerly, Keith A', 'Knudsen, Steen', 'Askaa, Jon', 'Mazin, Wiktor', 'Coombes, Kevin R']","['Wang W', 'Baggerly KA', 'Knudsen S', 'Askaa J', 'Mazin W', 'Coombes KR']","['Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20130820,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'ROC Curve', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage']",,,2013/08/22 06:00,2013/11/05 06:00,['2013/08/22 06:00'],"['2013/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['djt202 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djt202 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2013 Sep 4;105(17):1284-91. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djt202.

Clinically, it is difficult to simultaneously obtain cell morphology and distribution of surface markers with flow cytometry, especially for some surrogate markers such as CD38. Here, as an alternative and complementary prognostic method, fluorescence microscopy and image processing method are introduced to directly visualize the cells from patients and to quantitatively determine the expression status of surface markers. In this study, the morphological parameters of B-CLL cells were measured to establish the correlation between the cellular morphology and the surface marker expression. It was clear that the CD38+ and CD38- B-CLL cells from the same CD38+ patients had hardly any size differences; however, an increase in perimeter was observed for CD38- patients. Moreover, the expression level of the receptors on the cell was independent of the cell size. There was no evidence showing that the expression intensities of CD19 and CD38 were related to each other for the CD38+ B-CLL cells. On the same cells, CD5 was more selectively expressed on the cell membrane; however, the expression patterns suggested that the cell membrane of CD38- B-CLL cells contained the least expression level of CD19.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Niu, Suli', 'Chan, Ryan', 'Berini, Pierre', 'Wang, Chen', 'Zou, Shan']","['Niu S', 'Chan R', 'Berini P', 'Wang C', 'Zou S']","['National Research Council Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K1A 0R6; Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K1N 6N5.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130820,United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/*cytology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', '*Cell Shape', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'CD19', 'CD20', 'CD38', 'CD5', 'ImageJ', 'fluorescence microscope']",2013/08/22 06:00,2014/05/27 06:00,['2013/08/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jemt.22278 [doi]'],ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 2013 Nov;76(11):1147-53. doi: 10.1002/jemt.22278.

It is characterized by absolute monocytosis (>1 x 10(9)/L) in the peripheral blood that persists for at least 3 months. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of CMML rests on a combination of morphologic, histopathologic and chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow. It is important to exclude other myeloproliferative neoplasms and infectious/autoimmune conditions that can cause monocytosis. RISK STRATIFICATION: Several CMML-specific prognostic models incorporating novel mutations have been recently reported. The Mayo prognostic model classified CMML patients into three risk groups based on: increased absolute monocyte count, presence of circulating blasts, hemoglobin <10 gm/dL and platelets <100 x 10(9)/L. The median survival was 32 months, 18.5 months and 10 months in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The Groupe Francophone des (GFM) score segregated CMML patients into three risk groups based on: age >65 years, WBC >15 x 10(9)/L, anemia, platelets <100 x 10(9)/L, and ASXL1 mutation status. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, survival ranged from not reached in the low-risk group to 14.4 months in the high-risk group. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The Food and Drug Administration has approved azacitidine and decitabine for the treatment of patients with CMML. An allogeneic stem cell transplant can potentially offer a curative option to a subset of CMML patients. It is hoped that with the discovery of several novel mutations, targeted therapies will become available in the near future.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Parikh, Sameer A', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Parikh SA', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decision Trees', 'Decitabine', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Leukocytosis/etiology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Mutation', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis']",,,2013/08/22 06:00,2013/12/25 06:00,['2013/08/22 06:00'],"['2013/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23574 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Nov;88(11):967-74. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23574.,11,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the best examples is the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which has significantly improved the outcome for patients with this specific form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In considering how differentiation therapy could be used in other forms of AML, we predicted that compounds that induce terminal differentiation of megakaryocytes would be effective therapies for the megakaryocytic form of AML, named acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL). We also speculated that such agents would reduce the burden of abnormal hematopoietic cells in primary myelofibrosis and alter the differentiation of megakaryocytes in myelodysplastic syndromes. Using a high-throughput chemical screening approach, we identified small molecules that promoted many features of terminal megakaryocyte differentiation, including the induction of polyploidization, the process by which cells accumulate DNA to 32N or greater. As the induction of polyploidization is an irreversible process, cells that enter this form of the cell cycle do not divide again. Thus, this would be an effective way to reduce the tumor burden.

The median of measured IMA Ctrough in our patient group was 905.8 ng ml (range: 27.7-4628.1 ng/ml). We found a correlation between IMA Ctrough and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein plasma concentrations (rS = 0.42; p < 0.001). All other analysed parameters revealed only weak (gender, dose of IMA per kg) or not significant (age, albumin, creatinine plasma concentration or body mass index) impact on measured IMA Ctrough. The IMA Ctrough decreased during the first 6 months and significantly increased later during treatment. The IMA Ctrough at the first month of therapy did not differ between patients with and without an optimal response at the 12th (p = 0.724) and 18th month (p = 0.135) of therapy. There were no significant differences in medians of IMA Ctrough between both groups measured during the first year of treatment. The IMA Cintrac during the first month were not different between patients with and without an optimal response at the 6th (p = 0.273) and the 12th month (p = 0.193) of therapy. Our data obtained from real life clinical practice did not find a benefit of routine and regular IMA Ctrough nor IMA Cintrac therapeutic drug monitoring in chronic myelogenous leukaemia patients or for subsequent adjustments of the IMA dose based on these results.

We previously showed that Pkig is the primary family member expressed in osteoblasts and that Pkig knockdown increases the effects of parathyroid hormone and isoproterenol on PKA activation, gene expression, and inhibition of apoptosis. Here, we determined whether endogenous levels of Pkig regulate osteoblast differentiation. Pkig is the primary family member in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), murine marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and human mesenchymal stem cells. Pkig deletion increased forskolin-dependent nuclear PKA activation and gene expression and Pkig deletion or knockdown increased osteoblast differentiation. PKA signaling is known to stimulate adipogenesis; however, adipogenesis and osteogenesis are often reciprocally regulated. We found that the reciprocal regulation predominates over the direct effects of PKA since adipogenesis was decreased by Pkig deletion or knockdown. Pkig deletion or knockdown also simultaneously increased osteogenesis and decreased adipogenesis in mixed osteogenic/adipogenic medium. Pkig deletion increased PKA-induced expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) mRNA and LIF protein. LIF neutralizing antibodies inhibited the effects on osteogenesis and adipogenesis of either Pkig deletion in MEFs or PKIgamma knockdown in both murine and human mesenchymal stem cells. Collectively, our results show that endogenous levels of Pkig reciprocally regulate osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation and that this reciprocal regulation is mediated in part by LIF.

Zinc has been extensively studied in neoplastic processes but its role in children with leukemia still remains to be elucidated in several aspects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral zinc supplementation on weight gain and infectious episodes in children and adolescents with acute leukemia. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study included 38 patients, and was carried out as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation. The dosage of plasma zinc levels and the evaluation of nutritional status were performed during a period of 60 days. Zinc was supplemented orally, 2 mg/kg/day, in the form of amino acid salt. RESULTS: The results showed that plasma zinc concentrations did not increase significantly with the addition of the micronutrient. However, from a clinical point of view, it has become evident that supplementary zinc exerts a positive effect on nutritional status as positive weight gain. Moreover, the number of infection episodes was significantly reduced, possibly because of the immune stimuli.

A relevant question is whether such defective species can contribute to viral pathogenesis. Indeed, we previously reported that a presumed recombination of defective proviral DNA with other complementary defective proviral DNA or with wild-type viral DNA in the aftermath of superinfection could lead to the rescue of defective provirus and the production of replication-competent virus. We then wished to determine whether such rescue could be affected by viruses of different subtypes or even by other members of the retrovirus family. METHODS: Here, we have used drug resistance mutations within the HIV genome as markers of potential recombination. RESULTS: We show that a defective proviral DNA within cells can be rescued by the superinfection of MT2 cells by various subtypes of HIV-1, and by HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus, but not by human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 or by human herpes virus-6. The drug-resistance phenotype of the rescued HIV was confirmed in a second round of infection.

Studies have shown that children with cancer experience deficits in physical performance during treatment that may be present years after therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if distance on the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) changed in children during the first 3 cycles of cancer treatment and to compare the distances walked with healthy norms. METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of 19 boys and 10 girls, aged 6 to 17 years, who were newly diagnosed with cancer and were part of a larger study that measured changes in fatigue and physical performance during the first 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Participants performed the 6MWT between days 15 and 29 of the first and third cycles of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Pediatric cancer patients did not have a significant change in the distance walked at cycle 3 of chemotherapy compared with cycle 1. When compared with 2 different normative data sets for healthy children, most children with cancer performed significantly below their peers. CONCLUSIONS: Children had poor strength and endurance after 3 cycles of chemotherapy even when their disease was responding to treatment. Interventions are needed to promote rehabilitation and maintenance of physical performance, as both are important to quality of life and ongoing child development.

Firstly, graphene sheets (GS) suspension was prepared with the aid of chitosan (CS) solution and then fabricated onto the glassy carbon electrode (GCE), followed by the electro-polymerization of aniline to form the PANI layer, then, Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) were electro-deposited onto the modified GCE to immobilize the capture probes. The capture probe employed a hairpin structure and dually labeled with a 5'-SH and a 3'-biotin. After hybridization with the target DNA, hairpin structure was compelled to open and 3'-biotin was forced to stay away from the electrode surface. As a result, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (SA-AP) was covalently binded to the capture probe via biotin-avidin system. Reduction currents were then generated after catalyzing the hydrolysis of the electroinactive 1-naphthyl phosphate (1-NP) to 1-naphthol and monitored by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under optimum conditions, the amperometric signals increased linearly with the target DNA concentrations (10 pM to 1000 pM), and the DNA sensor exhibited a detection limit as low as 2.11 pM (S/N=3) with an excellent differentiation ability, and the proposed method showed acceptable stability and reproducibility.

We performed a meta-analysis on published data from over 4500 AML patients to provide robust evidence supporting DNMT3A mutation testing in clinical setting for AML patients. Our meta-analysis showed that DNMT3A mutations were associated with M4 and M5 AML subtypes. Those mutations conferred significantly worse prognosis with both shorter OS (p=0.0004) and shorter RFS (p=0.002). Notably, DNMT3A mutations appeared to be an independent adverse prognostic factor also in younger patients with normal cytogenetics AML (OS (p=0.01) and RFS (p=0.0005)) and also in the subgroup of patients with high risk genotypes defined according to the criteria of the European Leukemia Net (ELN) (OS (p=0.002)).

Therefore, the development of small-molecule inhibitors of STAT signaling bearing pharmacological activity has therapeutic potential for the treatment of human cancers. In this study, we identified sophoraflavanone G as a novel small-molecule inhibitor of STAT signaling in human cancer cells. Sophoraflavanone G inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins in Hodgkin's lymphoma and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in solid cancer cells by inhibiting phosphorylation of the Janus kinase (JAK) proteins, Src family tyrosine kinases, such as Lyn and Src, Akt, and ERK1/2. In addition, sophoraflavanone G inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation in murine-bone-marrow-derived pro-B cells transfected with translocated Ets Leukemia (TEL)-JAKs and cytokine-induced rat pre-T lymphoma cells, as well as STAT5b reporter activity in TEL-JAKs and STAT5b reporter systems. Sophoraflavanone G also inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling in multiple myeloma cells. Furthermore, sophoraflavanone G inhibited cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins.

The development of severe bone marrow toxicity, in patients taking standard doses of thiopurine drugs, is associated with TPMT deficiency whilst the TPMT heterozygote is at an increased risk of developing myelosuppression. Factors influencing TPMT enzyme activity, as measured in the surrogate red blood cell, are discussed in this review to enable an appreciation of why concordance between TPMT genotype and phenotype is not 100%. This is particularly important for lower/intermediate TPMT activities to avoid misclassification of TPMT status. TPMT testing is now widely available in routine service laboratories. The British National Formulary suggests TPMT testing before starting thiopurine drugs. Dermatologists were quick to adopt routine TPMT testing whilst gastroenterologists do not specifically recommend TPMT screening. TPMT testing is mandatory prior to the use of mercaptopurine in childhood leukaemia. Thiopurine drug dose and other treatment related influences on cell counts explain some of the differing recommendations between clinical specialities. TPMT testing is cost-effective and the major role is in the identification of the TPMT deficient individual prior to the start of thiopurine drugs.",['(c) 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Lennard, Lynne']",['Lennard L'],"['Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Department of Human Metabolism, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Azathioprine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis/economics', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*diagnosis', 'Drug Labeling/standards', 'Genetic Testing/*economics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/*diagnosis', 'Thioguanine/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['TPMT', 'azathioprine', 'childhood leukaemia', 'mercaptopurine', 'thioguanine nucleotides', 'thiopurine methyltransferase']",2013/08/22 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/08/22 06:00'],"['2013/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bcp.12226 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2014 Apr;77(4):704-14. doi: 10.1111/bcp.12226.,4,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)', 'Thiopurine S methyltranferase deficiency']",PMC3971986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of zidovudine and interferon-alpha (IFN) significantly improved survival in ATL. Promising results were reported by adding arsenic trioxide to zidovudine and IFN. RESULTS: Here we assessed Th1/Th2/T(reg) cytokine gene expression profiles in 16 ATL patients before and 30 days after treatment with arsenic/IFN/zidovudine, in comparison with HTLV-I healthy carriers and sero-negative blood donors. ATL patients at diagnosis displayed a T(reg)/Th2 cytokine profile with significantly elevated transcript levels of Foxp3, interleukin-10 (IL-10), and IL-4 and had a reduced Th1 profile evidenced by decreased transcript levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-2. Most patients (15/16) responded, with CD4(+)CD25(+) cells significantly decreasing after therapy, paralleled by decreases in Foxp3 transcript. Importantly, arsenic/IFN/zidovudine therapy sharply diminished IL-10 transcript and serum levels concomittant with decrease in IL-4 and increases in IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA, whether or not values were adjusted to the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells. Finally, IL-10 transcript level negatively correlated with clinical response at Day 30. CONCLUSIONS: The observed shift from a T(reg)/Th2 phenotype before treatment toward a Th1 phenotype after treatment with arsenic/IFN/zidovudine may play an important role in restoring an immuno-competent micro-environment, which enhances the eradication of ATL cells and the prevention of opportunistic infections.",,"['Kchour, Ghada', 'Rezaee, Rahim', 'Farid, Reza', 'Ghantous, Akram', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang', 'Tarhini, Mahdi', 'Kooshyar, Mohamad-Mehdi', 'El Hajj, Hiba', 'Berry, Fadwa', 'Mortada, Mohamad', 'Nasser, Roudaina', 'Shirdel, Abbas', 'Dassouki, Zeina', 'Ezzedine, Mohamad', 'Rahimi, Hossein', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'de The, Hugues', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Mahmoudi, Mahmoud', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Kchour G', 'Rezaee R', 'Farid R', 'Ghantous A', 'Rafatpanah H', 'Tarhini M', 'Kooshyar MM', 'El Hajj H', 'Berry F', 'Mortada M', 'Nasser R', 'Shirdel A', 'Dassouki Z', 'Ezzedine M', 'Rahimi H', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'de The H', 'Hermine O', 'Mahmoudi M', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Lebanese University, Hadath, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130820,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HTLV-I Infections/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*administration & dosage', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Zidovudine/*administration & dosage']",,,2013/08/22 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/08/22 06:00'],"['2013/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-10-91 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-10-91 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2013 Aug 20;10:91. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-91.,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oxides)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",PMC3751834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied genome-wide promoter DNA methylation in RS and clonally related CLL-phases of transformed patients, alongside de novo DLBCL (of non-germinal centre B type), untransformed-CLL and normal B-cells. The greatest differences in global DNA methylation levels were observed between RS and DLBCL, indicating that these two diseases, although histologically similar, are epigenetically distinct. RS was more highly methylated for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. When RS was compared to the preceding CLL-phase and with untransformed-CLL, RS presented a higher degree of methylation for genes possessing the H3K27me3 mark and PRC2 targets, as well as for gene targets of TP53 and RB1. Comparison of the methylation levels of individual genes revealed that OSM, a stem cell regulatory gene, exhibited significantly higher methylation levels in RS compared to CLL-phases. Its transcriptional repression by DNA methylation was confirmed by 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine treatment of DLBCL cells, determining an increased OSM expression. Our results showed that methylation patterns in RS are largely different from de novo DLBCL.

These aberrations are mostly detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), as chromosomal banding analysis has been scarce due to low proliferative activity of malignant B-lymphocytes in vitro. In 2006, a new method using stimulation with IL-2 and CpG oligonucleotide DSP30 for metaphase generation in CLL was published [1]. The objective of our study was to verify the efficacy of stimulation and to evaluate if the method is suitable for routine diagnostics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, peripheral blood samples of 369 CLL patients were analyzed in parallel by chromosomal banding analysis and by FISH probes for 13q14, 11q22-23, CEP12 and 17p13. RESULTS: Out of 369 patients, 307 (83%) were successfully stimulated for metaphase generation. Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 243 (79%) out of 307 patients evaluated by chromosomal banding analysis. Other aberrations that are not included into standard FISH panel were detected in patients karyotypes, e.g. del(6q), del(14q), t(14;18)(q32;q21), t(11;14)(q13;q32) and t(18;22)(q21;q11). One hundred and three (42%) patients showed complex aberrant karyotype not detected by FISH analysis. CONCLUSION: Stimulation with IL-2 and oligonucleotide DSP30 is an efficient method how to induce proliferation of malignant B-lymphocytes and allows detection of a substantial number of chromosomal aberrations in addition to those detected by standard FISH panel.

This study aimed to assess their impact on the maturing brain 20 to 30 years after diagnosis, providing a much stronger perspective on long-term quality of life than previous studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients treated between 1978 and 1990 at various intensities, with and without CRT, and 49 healthy controls were assessed with magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological tests. Differences in fractional anisotropy (FA)-a DTI measure describing white matter (WM) microstructure-were analyzed by using whole brain voxel-based analysis. RESULTS: CRT-treated survivors demonstrated significantly decreased FA compared with controls in frontal, parietal, and temporal WM tracts. Trends for lower FA were seen in the CT-treated survivors. Decreases in FA correlated well with neuropsychological dysfunction. In contrast to the CT group and controls, the CRT group showed a steep decline of FA with age at assessment. Younger age at cranial irradiation and higher dosage were associated with worse outcome of WM integrity. CONCLUSION: CRT-treated survivors show decreased WM integrity reflected by significantly decreased FA and associated neuropsychological dysfunction 25 years after treatment, although effects of CT alone seem mild.

This study explored the feasibility of using chickens as a bioreactor for producing human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (huPA). Recombinant huPA gene, under the control of a ubiquitous Rous sarcoma virus promoter, was injected into the subgerminal cavity of freshly laid chicken eggs at stage X using the replication-defective Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retrovirus vectors encapsidated with VSV-G (vesicular stomatitis virus G) glycoprotein. A total of 38 chicks, out of 573 virus-injected eggs, hatched and contained the huPA gene in their various body parts. The mRNA transcript of the huPA gene was present in various organs, including blood and egg, and was germ-line transmitted to the next generation. The level of active huPA protein was 16-fold higher in the blood of the transgenic chicken than in the nontransgenic chicken (P < 0.05). The expression of huPA protein in eggs increased from 7.82 IU/egg in the G0 generation to 17.02 IU/egg in the G1 generation. However, huPA-expressing embryos had reduced survival and hatchability at d 18 and 21 of incubation, respectively, and the blood clotting time was significantly higher in transgenic chickens than their nontransgenic counterparts (P < 0.05). Furthermore, adult transgenic rooster showed reduced (P < 0.05) fertility, as revealed by reduced volume of semen ejaculate, sperm concentration, and sperm viability. Taken together, our data suggest that huPA transgenic chickens could be successfully produced by the retroviral vector system. Transgenic chickens, expressing the huPA under the control of a ubiquitous promoter, may not only be used as a bioreactor for pharming of the huPA drug but also be useful for studying huPA-induced bleeding and other disorders.",,"['Lee, Sung Ho', 'Gupta, Mukesh Kumar', 'Ho, Young Tae', 'Kim, Teoan', 'Lee, Hoon Taek']","['Lee SH', 'Gupta MK', 'Ho YT', 'Kim T', 'Lee HT']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology, Bio-Organ Research Center, Konkuk University, 1 Hwayang-dong, Gwangjin-Gu, Seoul, 143 701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Transfer Techniques/veterinary', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Microinjections/veterinary', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Ovum/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2013/11/13 06:00,['2013/08/21 06:00'],"['2013/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0032-5791(19)39452-0 [pii]', '10.3382/ps.2013-03223 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2013 Sep;92(9):2396-403. doi: 10.3382/ps.2013-03223.,9,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we observed that miR-29a was repressed by androgen/androgen receptor signaling in mouse epididymis by targeting a conserved androgen response element located 8 kb upstream of miR-29b1a loci. It is well known that multiple regulatory programs often form a complicated network. Here, we found that miR-29a reversibly suppressed androgen receptor and its target genes by targeting IGF1 and p53 pathways. miR-29b1a-overexpressing transgenic mice displayed epididymis hypoplasia partially similar to the phenotype of those mice with an impaired androgen-androgen receptor signal system.

In cells overexpressing Bcl-XL, mTORC1 activity is increased and becomes less sensitive to growth factor or nutrient conditions. In contrast, reduction in expression levels of the two antiapoptotic proteins inhibits mTORC1 signaling activity. Our results suggest that the effect of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL on mTORC1 is mediated by FKBP38, an inhibitor of mTORC1.

The ability of these tandems to adopt multiple conformations is as important for proper regulation as the individual domain specificity. A paradigmatic example is Abl, a ubiquitous tyrosine kinase of significant pharmacological interest. SH3 and SH2 domains inhibit Abl by assembling onto the catalytic domain, allosterically clamping it in an inactive state. We investigate the dynamics of this SH3-SH2 tandem, using microsecond all-atom simulations and differential scanning calorimetry. Our results indicate that the Abl tandem is a two-state switch, alternating between the conformation observed in the structure of the autoinhibited enzyme and another configuration that is consistent with existing scattering data for an activated form. Intriguingly, we find that the latter is the most probable when the tandem is disengaged from the catalytic domain. Nevertheless, an amino acid stretch preceding the SH3 domain, the so-called N-cap, reshapes the free-energy landscape of the tandem and favors the interaction of this domain with the SH2-kinase linker, an intermediate step necessary for assembly of the autoinhibited complex. This allosteric effect arises from interactions between N-cap and the SH2 domain and SH3-SH2 connector, which involve a phosphorylation site. We also show that the SH3-SH2 connector plays a determinant role in the assembly equilibrium of Abl, because mutations thereof hinder the engagement of the SH2-kinase linker. These results provide a thermodynamic rationale for the involvement of N-cap and SH3-SH2 connector in Abl regulation and expand our understanding of the principles of modular domain organization.",,"['Corbi-Verge, Carles', 'Marinelli, Fabrizio', 'Zafra-Ruano, Ana', 'Ruiz-Sanz, Javier', 'Luque, Irene', 'Faraldo-Gomez, Jose D']","['Corbi-Verge C', 'Marinelli F', 'Zafra-Ruano A', 'Ruiz-Sanz J', 'Luque I', 'Faraldo-Gomez JD']","['Department of Physical Chemistry and Institute of Biotechnology, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130819,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutation', '*Protein Conformation', '*Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', '*src Homology Domains']",['NOTNLM'],"['allosteric inhibitors', 'leukemia', 'macromolecular assembly', 'population shift', 'protein-protein interactions']",2013/08/21 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/08/21 06:00'],"['2013/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1303966110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1303966110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Sep 3;110(36):E3372-80. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1303966110.

There has been a significant rise in the number of HSCT procedures performed over the past decade due in part to improved supportive care and innovative techniques such as reduced-intensity conditioning. Expanding alternative donor options such as umbilical cord blood and haploidentical HSCT, taken together with improved outcomes of matched unrelated donors, has resulted in a suitable donor for most patients with an HSCT indication. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics that incorporate genetic mutational analysis into existing cytogenetic-based models should improve selection of patients at high risk of relapse most likely to benefit from HSCT. Improvements in minimal residual disease monitoring hold promise for adding prognostic information, and informing the clinician of impending relapse.

However, while allo-HSCT usually induces a beneficial graft-versus leukemia effect, a major source of morbidity and mortality following allo-HSCT is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Currently available diagnostic and staging tools frequently fail to identify those at higher risk for GVHD morbidity, treatment unresponsiveness, and death. Furthermore, there are shortcomings in the risk stratification of patients before GVHD clinical signs develop. In parallel, recent years have been characterized by an explosive evolution of omics technologies, largely due to technological advancements in chemistry, engineering, and bioinformatics. Building on these opportunities, plasma biomarkers have been identified and validated as promising diagnostic and prognostic tools for acute GVHD. This review summarizes current information on the types of GVHD biomarkers, the omics tools used to identify them, the biomarkers currently validated as acute GVHD markers, and future recommendations for incorporating biomarkers into new grading algorithms for risk-stratifying patients and creating more personalized treatment courses. Future directions will include randomized evaluations of these biomarkers in multicenter prospective studies while extending on the need for biomarkers of chronic GVHD.",,"['Paczesny, Sophie', 'Raiker, Nisha', 'Brooks, Sam', 'Mumaw, Christy']","['Paczesny S', 'Raiker N', 'Brooks S', 'Mumaw C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Allografts', 'Biomarkers', 'Chronic Disease', '*Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Precision Medicine/methods/trends', 'Prognosis', '*Proteomics/methods/trends', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2013/08/21 06:00'],"['2013/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-013-1406-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Sep;98(3):275-92. doi: 10.1007/s12185-013-1406-9.,3,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",PMC4005044,,"['R01 CA168814/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA174667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA168814/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA174667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS572971'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identify natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp44 (NKp44L), a novel isoform of the mixed-lineage leukemia-5 protein, as a cellular ligand for NKp44. Unlike the other MLL family members, NKp44L is excluded from the nucleus, but expressed at the cell-surface level; its subcellular localization is being associated with the presence of a specific C-terminal motif. Strikingly, NKp44L has not been detected on circulating cells isolated from healthy individuals, but it is expressed on a large panel of the tumor and transformed cells. The sharply decreased NK lysis activity induced by anti-NKp44L antibodies directly demonstrates the role of NKp44L in cytotoxicity.

One potential target for retargeting of T cells to AML blasts is the surface molecule CD33. Here we describe a novel modular targeting platform that consists of a universal effector module (EM) and individual target modules (TMs). Both modules can form an immune complex via a peptide epitope. The resulting targeting complex can functionally replace a conventional bsAb. By fusion of a costimulatory domain (for example, the extracellular CD137 ligand domain) to the TM, the targeting complex can even provide a costimulatory signal to the redirected T cells at their side of interaction with the tumor cell. Furthermore, we observed that an efficient killing of tumor cells expressing low levels of the tumor target CD33 becomes critical at low effector-to-target cell ratios but can be improved by costimulation via CD137 using our novel targeting system.",,"['Arndt, C', 'Feldmann, A', 'von Bonin, M', 'Cartellieri, M', 'Ewen, E-M', 'Koristka, S', 'Michalk, I', 'Stamova, S', 'Berndt, N', 'Gocht, A', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Ehninger, G', 'Schmitz, M', 'Bachmann, M']","['Arndt C', 'Feldmann A', 'von Bonin M', 'Cartellieri M', 'Ewen EM', 'Koristka S', 'Michalk I', 'Stamova S', 'Berndt N', 'Gocht A', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G', 'Schmitz M', 'Bachmann M']","[""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""1] Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany [2] Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Department of Radioimmunology, Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medical Clinic and Polyclinic I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medical Clinic and Polyclinic I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""Medical Clinic and Polyclinic I, University Hospital 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""1] Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany [2] Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany."", ""1] Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany [2] Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Department of Radioimmunology, Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research, Dresden, Germany [3] Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130820,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/08/21 06:00'],"['2013/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013243 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.243 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jan;28(1):59-69. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.243.

We defined a gene signature that accurately discriminates between prednisolone-resistant and prednisolone-sensitive MLL-rearranged infant ALL patient samples. In the current study, we applied Connectivity Map analysis to perform an in silico screening for agents capable of reversing the prednisolone-resistance profile and induce sensitivity. These analyses revealed that LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, would potentially fulfill this task. Subsequent validation experiments demonstrated that indeed LY294002, and other known PI3K inhibitors, markedly sensitized otherwise resistant MLL-rearranged ALL cells to prednisolone in vitro. Using quantitative RT-PCR analyses, we validated the modulating effects of the PI3K inhibitors on the expression of the genes present in our prednisolone-resistance profile. Interestingly, prednisolone-sensitizing actions may be mediated by inhibition of FCGR1B. Moreover, only high-level expression of FCGR1B showed to be predictive for a poor prognosis and shRNA-mediated knock-down of FCGR1B led to in vitro prednisolone sensitization. Thus, implementing FDA-approved PI3K inhibitors in current treatments may potentially improve the GC response and prognosis in patients with MLL-rearranged ALL.",,"['Spijkers-Hagelstein, J A P', 'Pinhancos, S S', 'Schneider, P', 'Pieters, R', 'Stam, R W']","['Spijkers-Hagelstein JA', 'Pinhancos SS', 'Schneider P', 'Pieters R', 'Stam RW']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130820,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, IgG/physiology']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/08/21 06:00'],"['2013/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013245 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.245 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Apr;28(4):761-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.245.

Furthermore, in 57 patients paired samples from diagnosis and relapse were analyzed. In 47/57 (82.5%) cases the same alterations detected at diagnosis were present at relapse, whereas in 1/57 (1.8%) cases the mutation from the diagnostic sample was no longer detectable. Discrepancies were observed in 9/57 (15.8%) cases, also including the occurrence of novel RUNX1 mutations not restricted to those regions affected at diagnosis. Moreover, in 103 patients the prognostic impact of residual levels of RUNX1 mutations during complete remission was studied. Separation of patients according to median residual mutation burden into 'good responders' and 'poor responders' (median: 3.61%; range: 0.03-48.0%) resulted in significant differences of both event-free (median 21.0 vs. 5.7 months, P<0.001) and overall survival (OS; median 56.9 vs. 32.0 months, P=0.002).

The mechanisms behind aberrant DNA methylation have long remained obscure. New genome-wide studies have elucidated the genome and epigenome of solid tumors and AML. Molecular subtypes of AML were found to exhibit highly distinct DNA methylation profiles. Clonal evolution patterns of AML were recently dissected and might shape epigenetic dysregulation. Also, recurrent mutations in epigenetic modifying enzymes were identified in AML and linked to distinct DNA methylation signatures. The genetic background, thus, takes center stage as a driver of epigenetic dysregulation in AML. First mechanistic insights into the dysregulation of DNA methylation by recurrent mutations have already been gained. Other studies suggest that epigenomic plasticity and aging-associated changes in DNA methylation also contribute extensively to aberrant DNA methylation in cancer. Epigenetic dysregulation, therefore, seems to also occur independently of the genetic background. Furthermore, global changes in chromatin conformation and nuclear organization have also been proposed as potential contributors to aberrant DNA methylation.

Only a small subset of PCa patients will have an aggressive disease that requires intensive therapy, and there is currently no biomarker to predict disease aggressiveness at the time of surgery. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported to be involved in PCa pathogenesis. METHODS: This study involved 105 participants. For the discovery phase, prostatectomy samples were dichotomized to high-risk (n = 27, biochemical failure <36 months after prostatectomy) and low-risk groups (n = 14, >/= 36 months without biochemical failure). Expression of 754 mature miRNAs was compared between the 2 groups. Linear regression models were built to accurately predict biochemical failure risk. miRNA mimics were transfected into PCa model cell lines to test effects on proliferation and to deduce responding signaling pathways. RESULTS: We identified 25 differentially expressed miRNAs between the biochemical failure risk groups. Based on the expression of 2-3 miRNAs, 3 logistic regression models were developed, each with a high positive predictive value. Candidate miRNAs and the best-performing model were also verified on an independent PCa set. miRNA-152, featured in the models, was further investigated by using cell line models and was shown to affect cell proliferation. Predicted interaction between miR-152 and (mRNA)ERBB3 (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3) was experimentally validated in vitro.

Currently, there is not a single procedure that enables accurate prognosis and triaging of those patients who need immediate and aggressive treatment. All CLL cells are characterised by the expression of the B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22 and CD23, with aberrant expression of the T-cell antigen CD5. METHODS: We have developed a CD antibody microarray (DotScan) containing 182 immobilised CD antibodies that has been used to obtain extensive surface profiles of CLL cells obtained from 96 patients. RESULTS: Of these 182 antigens, 27 were significantly differentially expressed between stable, stable-progressive and progressive CLL. Some of these antigens are not expressed on normal B-cells and may be targets for therapeutic antibodies against CLL. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the surface profiles from 96 patients showed that those with progressive CLL could be distinguished based solely upon this 'disease signature'.

A series of 271 consecutive APL patients has been cytogenetically investigated between 2004 and 2011 in our institution. The incidence of ACAs was 27% (46/172) in APL cases with t(15;17). Trisomy 8 was the most recurrent abnormality, accounting for 30% (14/46) of patients with ACAs, followed by +21 (7%, 3/46) and -7/7q (7%, 3/46). Nine cases (14.1%) were found to have additional balanced translocation aberrations, most of them are new and non-recurrent. Treatment protocols consisted of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy with or without the ATO therapy. Overall, patients with and without ACAs had similar complete remission (CR) rates (94% and 98%, respectively, P=0.344). With a median follow-up of 41 months, univariate analysis showed that ACAs did not show any prognostic significance in relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). In addition, ATO treatment was an independent favorable predictor for RFS. Thus, this data provides insights into cytogenetic features of APL, and suggests that ATO-based combination therapy improved RFS in de novo APL patients, while ACAs had no impact on prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The process, termed V(D)J recombination, juxtaposes modular coding sequences for antigen binding. Erroneous recombination events causing chromosomal translocations are recognized causes of lymphoid malignancies. Here we show a hybridization based method for sequence enrichment can be used to efficiently and selectively capture genomic DNA adjacent to V(D)J recombination breakpoints for massively parallel sequencing. The approach obviates the need for PCR amplification of recombined sequences. RESULTS: Using tailored informatics analyses to resolve alignment and assembly issues in these repetitive regions, we were able to detect numerous recombination events across a panel of cancer cell lines and primary lymphoid tumors, and an EBV transformed lymphoblast line. With reassembly, breakpoints could be defined to single base pair resolution. The observed events consist of canonical V(D)J or V-J rearrangements, non-canonical rearrangements, and putatively oncogenic reciprocal chromosome translocations. We validated non-canonical and chromosome translocation junctions by PCR and Sanger sequencing. The translocations involved the MYC and BCL-2 loci, and activation of these was consistent with histopathologic features of the respective B-cell tumors. We also show an impressive prevalence of novel erroneous V-V recombination events at sites not incorporated with other downstream coding segments. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the ability of next generation sequencing to describe human V(D)J recombinase activity and provide a scalable means to chronicle off-target, unexpressed, and non-amplifiable recombinations occurring in the development of lymphoid cancers.",,"['Halper-Stromberg, Eitan', 'Steranka, Jared', 'Giraldo-Castillo, Nicolas', 'Fuller, Timothy', 'Desiderio, Stephen', 'Burns, Kathleen H']","['Halper-Stromberg E', 'Steranka J', 'Giraldo-Castillo N', 'Fuller T', 'Desiderio S', 'Burns KH']","['McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA. kburns9@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130819,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'VDJ Recombinases/*physiology']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2013/08/21 06:00'],"['2013/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-14-565 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-14-565 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2013 Aug 19;14:565. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-14-565.,,['EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)'],PMC3846541,,"['R01 CA160256/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HG005220/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant cytochemical nonspecific esterase/alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (NSE/alphaNAE) positive B-lymphoblasts can cause confusion with monoblasts, a potentially dangerous pitfall. This unusual cytochemical NSE/alphaNAE positivity had been associated with relatively poorer outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the era prior to the advent of routine multicolor flow cytometric immunophenotyping. We reviewed morphological, cytochemical and flow-cytometric data from five cases of B-lineage ALL that showed NSE/alphaNAE positivity and were diagnosed definitively using multi-parametric flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis. Diffuse or dot-like (localized) strong cytochemical NSE/alphaNAE activity was detected in all cases and all showed one or more features of high risk disease. The number of NSE/alphaNAE positive blasts in the marrow varied from 10 to 75%. The morphological differential diagnoses included T-lymphoid lineage ALL and acute monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Flow cytometric data revealed B-lineage antigens and the absence of monocytic or other myeloid markers resolved the diagnosis. These cases underscore the importance of immunophenotyping in all cases of suspected ALL regardless of the cytochemical findings. Although the numbers are small, the association with high risk disease observed in all five of our cases may corroborate the previously reported poor prognostic value of such aberrant cytochemical staining.",,"['Sharma, P', 'Tyagi, S']","['Sharma P', 'Tyagi S']","['Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Sector 12, Chandigarh 160012.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130819,England,Biotech Histochem,Biotechnic & histochemistry : official publication of the Biological Stain Commission,9107378,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Carboxylesterase/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*standards', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*enzymology/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2014/09/13 06:00,['2013/08/21 06:00'],"['2013/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10520295.2013.797105 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotech Histochem. 2014 Jan;89(1):19-22. doi: 10.3109/10520295.2013.797105.

The molecular mechanisms and the genes involved in the generation of T-ALL remain largely undefined. In this study, we propose a set of genes to differentiate individuals with T-ALL from the nonleukemia/healthy ones and genes that are not differential themselves but interconnected with highly differentially expressed ones. We provide new suggestions for pathways involved in the cause of T-ALL and show that network-based classification techniques produce fewer genes with more meaningful and successful results than expression-based approaches. We have identified 19 significant subnetworks, containing 102 genes. The classification/prediction accuracies of subnetworks are considerably high, as high as 98%. Subnetworks contain 6 nondifferentially expressed genes, which could potentially participate in pathogenesis of T-ALL. Although these genes are not differential, they may serve as biomarkers if their loss/gain of function contributes to generation of T-ALL via SNPs.

Essential for cure of childhood ALL is prophylactic treatment of the central nervous system (CNS), with methotrexate (MTX) being the most widely used drug in this treatment. While CNS treatment has contributed to long-term disease-free survival, resulting declines in academic abilities have been reported. There is growing evidence that CNS treatment with MTX increases oxidative stress, a potential mechanism of CNS injury. This article reports changes in oxidative stress, measured by the biomarker F2-isoprostane (F2-IsoP), in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 47 children with ALL during the first 18 months of treatment. The number of CSF samples ranged from 5 to 14 during postinduction and from 1 to 9 during continuation. Total doses of intrathecal MTX during postinduction were significantly correlated with the mean and highest concentrations of F2-IsoP during postinduction and the mean concentration of F2-IsoP during continuation. F2-IsoP concentrations during postinduction and continuation were higher in children who received more than six doses of intrathecal MTX. New therapies for a highly curable disease such as childhood leukemia have the potential to be individualized in the future, requiring reliable molecular and biochemical markers, such as oxidative stress indicators.

We recently demonstrated that WT1 SNP rs16754 correlates with favorable outcome and high diagnostic WT1 expression in childhood AML. We examined the clinical correlates of diagnostic WT1 expression within a contemporary COG trial and determined whether its prognostic impact differs between SNP+ and SNP- patients. PROCEDURE: WT1 mRNA expression was measured via qRT-PCR in diagnostic specimens obtained from 225 patients enrolled on COG-AAML03P1. Direct sequencing of WT1 exon 7 was performed to determine SNP rs16754 genotype. WT1 expression was correlated with disease characteristics, SNP status, and outcome. RESULTS: Patients were categorized into four groups (quartiles: Q1 through Q4) based on diagnostic WT1 expression for analysis. FLT3/ITD (P = 0.017) and WT1 mutations (P < 0.001) both occurred more frequently in patients with the highest WT1 expression. SNP rs16754 frequency did not vary significantly among the quartiles. When all patients were considered, survival outcomes were similar between quartiles. However, when only SNP- patients (n = 150) were analyzed, those with highest WT1 expression (Q4) had the poorest OS (51% vs. 72% for Q1-Q3, P = 0.006) and EFS (35% vs. 54% for Q1-Q3, P = 0.031). Among SNP+ patients (n = 75), survival did not vary significantly between WT1 expression quartiles. CONCLUSION: Although WT1 expression was not prognostic when all patients were considered together, stratifying patients by SNP rs16754 genotype revealed significant differences in outcome. In SNP- patients, high WT1 expression predicted decreased survival in univariate, but not multivariate, analysis, due to a preponderance of high-risk cyto/molecular abnormalities in the highest expression quartile.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ho, Phoenix A', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Kuhn, Julia', 'Pollard, Jessica A', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Ho PA', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Kuhn J', 'Pollard JA', 'Hirsch B', 'Raimondi SC', 'Gamis AS', 'Meshinchi S']","[""Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington; Children's Oncology Group, Arcadia, California.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130816,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'WT1', 'molecular diagnosis and therapy', 'prognostic factors', 'rs16754']",2013/08/21 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2013/08/20 06:00'],"['2013/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24700 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jan;61(1):81-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24700.

However, the abundance of specific replication-dependent isoforms of histone H2A is altered in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Similar changes in the abundance of H2A isoforms are also associated with the proliferation and tumorigenicity of bladder cancer cells. To determine whether these H2A isoforms can perform distinct functions, expression of several H2A isoforms was reduced by siRNA knockdown. Reduced expression of the HIST1H2AC locus leads to increased rates of cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. We also observe that regulation of replication-dependent histone H2A expression can occur on a gene-specific level. Specific replication-dependent histone H2A genes are either up- or downregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia tumor tissue samples. In addition, discreet elements are identified in the 5' untranslated region of the HIST1H2AC locus that confer translational repression.

PROCEDURES: Outcomes were compared among patients aged less than 21 years with cytogenetically defined poor-risk AML treated with chemotherapy, matched related (MRD), or unrelated donor (URD) transplantation in CR1. Poor-risk cytogenetics was defined as monosomy 7/del7q, monosomy 5/del 5q, abnormalities of 3q, t(6;9)(p23;q34), or complex karyotype. Included are patients treated on Children's Oncology Group trials or reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research from 1989 to 2006. RESULTS: Of the 233 patients, 123 received chemotherapy, 55 received MRD HCT, and 55 received URD HCT. The 5-year overall survival from the time of consolidation chemotherapy or transplant conditioning was similar: chemotherapy (43% +/- 9%), MRD (46% +/- 14%), or URD (50% +/- 14%), P = 0.99. Similarly, multivariate analysis demonstrated no significant differences in survival [(reference group = chemotherapy); MRD HR 1.08, P = 0.76; URD HR 1.13, P = 0.67] despite lower relapse risk with URD HCT (HR = 0.43, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not provide support for the preferential use of HCT over chemotherapy alone for children with cytogenetically defined poor-risk AML in CR1.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kelly, Michael J', 'Horan, John T', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Eapen, Mary', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'He, Wensheng', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Parsons, Susan K', 'Woods, William G']","['Kelly MJ', 'Horan JT', 'Alonzo TA', 'Eapen M', 'Gerbing RB', 'He W', 'Lange BJ', 'Parsons SK', 'Woods WG']","['The Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Pediatrics, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130819,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', '*Donor Selection', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/etiology/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality/therapy', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'pediatrics']",2013/08/21 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/08/20 06:00'],"['2013/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24739 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Feb;61(2):269-75. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24739.

We performed meta-analyses to evaluate the impact of being overweight on acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) risk and survival. Original data were obtained from MEDLINE, and studies that evaluated being overweight before transplantation in recipients as a risk factor for aGVHD or a prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) were extracted. Study-specific relative risks on the log scale comparing overweight with non-overweight patients were used to obtain a pooled RR with 95% confidence interval (CI). We identified 8 studies of aGVHD and 21 of OS. In allogeneic HSCT, the meta-analysis determined statistically significant associations of overweight recipients with aGVHD risk and OS. Meta-analysis of the 8 studies of aGVHD indicated that the RR for overweight to non-overweight patients was 1.186 (95% CI: 1.072-1.312). Regarding OS, meta-analysis of 11 allogeneic HSCT studies indicated that the RR for overweight to non-overweight patients was 1.163 (1.009-1.340). Our results indicate that being overweight before transplantation in recipients is associated with a high aGVHD rate and worse survival after allogeneic HSCT.

The growth of leukemic cell lines harboring a mutation in RAD21 (Kasumi-1 cells) or having severely reduced expression of RAD21 and STAG2 (MOLM-13 cells) was suppressed by forced expression of wild-type RAD21 and wild-type RAD21 and STAG2, respectively.

In the current study, we have constructed a p210 BCR/ABL1 mutant that can no longer bind to XPB. The mutant has normal kinase activity and interacts with GRB2, but can no longer phosphorylate XPB. Loss of XPB binding is associated with reduced expression of c-MYC and reduced transforming potential in ex-vivo clonogenicity assays, but does not affect nucleotide excision repair in lymphoid or myeloid cells. When examined in a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model for chronic myelogenous leukemia, mice that express the mutant exhibit attenuated myeloproliferation and lymphoproliferation when compared with mice that express unmodified p210 BCR/ABL1. Thus, the mutant-transplanted mice show predominantly neutrophilic expansion and altered progenitor expansion, and have significantly extended lifespans. This was confirmed in a BMT model for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, wherein the majority of the mutant-transplanted mice remain disease free.

The LAIPs could be identified in 96% and 81.6% of patients with the sensitivity of 10(-4) and 10(-5), respectively.

In multivariate analysis, MRD status was associated with RFS or OS independently. Furthermore, MRD assessed by LAIPs and RQ-PCR assay for patients with BCR-ABL fusion gene yielded concordant results in 89.7% of cases.

Tax interacts with the I kappaB kinase regulatory subunit NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator) to activate NF-kappaB, and this interaction is maintained in part by a molecular chaperone, heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), and its co-chaperone cell division cycle 37 (CDC37). The antibiotic geldanamycin (GA) inhibits HSP90's ATP binding for its proper interaction with client proteins. Administration of a novel water-soluble and less toxic GA derivative, 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin hydrochloride (17-DMAG), to Tax-expressing ATL-transformed cell lines, C8166 and MT4, induced significant degradation of Tax. 17-DMAG also facilitated growth arrest and cellular apoptosis to C8166 and MT4 and other ATL cell lines, although this treatment has no apparent effects on normal PBLs. 17-DMAG also downregulated Tax-mediated intracellular signals including the activation of NF-kappaB, activator protein 1 or HTLV-1 long terminal repeat in Tax-transfected HEK293 cells. Oral administration of 17-DMAG to ATL model mice xenografted with lymphomatous transgenic Lck-Tax (Lck proximal promoter-driven Tax transgene) cells or HTLV-1-producing tumor cells dramatically attenuated aggressive infiltration into multiple organs, inhibited de novo viral production and improved survival period.

By acting downstream of the B-cell antigen receptor, Syk promotes signaling pathways involved in proliferation, differentiation and survival of B cells. To study the oncogenic potential of Syk, we generated a mouse model for the inducible expression of the leukemia-derived TEL-Syk fusion protein exhibiting constitutive kinase activity. To achieve B-cell-specific expression of TEL-Syk in adult mice, we used a tamoxifen-inducible Cre mouse line. This study shows that inducible expression of TEL-Syk in B cells leads to transient proliferation and subsequent plasma cell differentiation. However, it does not lead to B-cell transformation. Instead, Syk activation induces the tumor suppressor B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), which interferes with the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Combined induction of TEL-Syk with transgenic expression of Bcl-2 results in a severe phenotype and plasma cell expansion. Our results suggest that deregulated Syk activity by itself is not sufficient for the transformation of B cells, as downstream effectors, such as Blimp-1, limit the survival and expansion of the activated B cell.",,"['Hug, E', 'Hobeika, E', 'Reth, M', 'Jumaa, H']","['Hug E', 'Hobeika E', 'Reth M', 'Jumaa H']","['1] BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Freiburg, Germany [2] Department of Molecular Immunology, Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Freiburg, Germany [3] Max-Planck-Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany.', '1] Department of Molecular Immunology, Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Freiburg, Germany [2] Max-Planck-Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany.', '1] BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Freiburg, Germany [2] Department of Molecular Immunology, Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Freiburg, Germany [3] Max-Planck-Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany.', '1] BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Freiburg, Germany [2] Department of Molecular Immunology, Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Freiburg, Germany [3] Max-Planck-Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130819,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma Cells/cytology', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2014/09/02 06:00,['2013/08/20 06:00'],"['2013/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2013326 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2013.326 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Jul 10;33(28):3730-41. doi: 10.1038/onc.2013.326.

Here, we demonstrate the antileukemic effects of simultaneous inhibition of PI3K by the selective class I PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 and of Bcl-2 family members by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 in the context of the bone marrow microenvironment, where hypoxia and interactions with bone marrow stromal cells promote AML cell survival and chemoresistance. The combination of GDC-0941 and ABT-737 profoundly downregulated antiapoptotic Mcl-1 expression levels, activated BAX, and induced mitochondrial apoptosis in AML cells co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia caused degradation of Mcl-1 and rendered Mcl-1-overexpressing OCI-AML3 cells sensitive to ABT-737.

Down-modulation of surface IgM (sIgM) occurs, but expression and signal capacity can recover in vitro and apparently in vivo during recirculation. We have now dissected individual circulating clones of CLL cases according to sIgM expression level by differential binding to bead-bound anti-IgM. Four clear subgroups (SG1-4) with increasing sIgM were identified in 37/37 cases. Engagement of sIgM induced phosphorylation of PLCgamma2 and ERK1/2 at levels ranging from very low in SG1 to high in SG4. Phosphorylation was suppressed by the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. Expression of CXCR4 also increased from SG1 to SG4, but markers of previous activation and proliferation were dominant in SG1. Incubation of whole CLL populations in vitro led to striking increases in CXCR4 expression as well as recovery of sIgM. Clonal analysis reveals dynamic SGs following presumed antigen stimulation in tissues. SG4 represents a fully recovered, potentially dangerous population equipped to migrate to tissue and receive a proliferative stimulus. SG1 likely represents a postmitotic unresponsive ""resting"" population.

Recently, we constructed a new recombinant immunotoxin for possible clinical application in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A functional humanized single chain variable fragment (hscFv) against CML patient cells was previously obtained from an anti-CML cell hybridoma derived monoclonal antibody. By insertion into the bacterial vector pWW20, the hscFv was fused with a deletion mutant of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA'). Then the fusion fragment was inserted into the bacterial vector pET32a(+). After isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction, the 6x His tagged hscFv-ETA' protein was periplasmically expressed and purified by Ni(2+)-NTA column. The characteristics of the recombinant protein were assessed by cell membrane-ELISA, flow cytometry, and toxicity assays in CML cell lines and CML patient cells. The recombinant immunotoxin showed significant toxicity toward the CML cell lines K562 and KU812 as tested by MTT and apoptosis assay. Approximately 37% of leukemia cells of CML patients were driven into apoptosis by hscFv-ETA' as measured by flow cytometric analysis. In conclusion, the hscFv-ETA' is efficacious against CML in vitro, providing the basis for a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we show that in lean mice, abrogation of IL-6Ralpha signaling protects against diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC development. HCC protection occurs via Mcl-1 destabilization, thus promoting hepatocyte apoptosis. IL-6 regulates Mcl-1 stability via the inhibition of PP-1alpha expression, promoting GSK-3beta inactivation. In addition, IL-6 suppresses expression of the Mcl-1 E3 ligase (Mule). Consequently, IL-6Ralpha deficiency activates PP-1alpha and Mule expression, resulting in increased Mcl-1 turnover and protection against HCC development. In contrast, in obesity, inhibition of PP-1alpha and Mule expression, leading to Mcl-1 stabilization, occurs independently of IL-6 signaling. Collectively, this study provides evidence that obesity inhibits hepatocyte apoptosis through Mcl-1 stabilization independent of IL-6 signaling, thus promoting liver carcinogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors.

Trauma to the central nervous system (CNS) results in a distinct inflammatory response caused by local and infiltrating immune cells. This makes NSC-supported regeneration difficult due to the presence of inhibitory immune factors which are upregulated around the lesion site. The continual and dual role of the neuroinflammatory response leaves it difficult to decipher upon a single modulatory strategy. Therefore, understanding the influence of cytokines upon regulation of NSC self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation is crucial when designing therapies for CNS repair. There is a plethora of partially conflicting data in vitro and in vivo on the role of cytokines in modulating the stem cell niche and the milieu around NSC transplants. This is mainly due to the pleiotropic role of many factors. In order for cell-based therapy to thrive, treatment must be phase-specific to the injury and also be personalized for each patient, i.e. taking age, sex, neuroimmune and endocrine status as well as other key parameters into consideration. In this review, we will summarize the most relevant information concerning interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-gamma, the neuropoietic cytokine family and TNF-alpha in order to extract promising therapeutic approaches for further research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed charts of all consecutive pediatric patients treated from 1986 to 2010. We analyzed demographics, underlying diagnosis and treatment data to assess risk factors for hemorrhagic cystitis. We also correlated disease severity scores with clinical predisposing factors, and performed univariate and multivariate analyses to examine associations between risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic cystitis was observed in 97 of 6,119 children (1.6%), most of whom (75%) had severity scores of II or III. Mean +/- SD age was 12.2 +/- 6.3 years for patients with hemorrhagic cystitis and 10.5 +/- 7 years for patients without hemorrhagic cystitis (p = 0.017). On univariate analysis increased risk of hemorrhagic cystitis was significantly associated with age greater than 5 years, male gender, cyclophosphamide or busulfan chemotherapy, bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, pelvic radiotherapy and underlying diagnoses of rhabdomyosarcoma, acute leukemia and aplastic anemia. On multivariate analysis age greater than 5 years, allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and pelvic radiotherapy were significantly associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic cystitis. Older age, late onset hemorrhagic cystitis, positive urine culture for BK virus and bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation were associated with greater disease severity. Patients with higher severity scores more frequently experienced bladder perforation, hydronephrosis, overall hemorrhagic cystitis complications, and increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels during followup. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, previous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and BK virus in the urine are risk factors for hemorrhagic cystitis and are associated with a higher severity score. Higher severity scores are associated with increased rates of genitourinary complications and renal impairment.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aptamer forms a stem-and-loop confirmation as determined by circular dichroism. This conformation is adopted in both water and phosphate buffered saline solutions. The metal complex binds through intercalation into the aptamer's double helical stem with a binding constant of approximately 4.3 x 10(4) M(-1). Binding of the metal complex to the aptamer had a significant effect on the aptamer's global conformation, and increased its melting temperature by 28 degrees C possibly through lengthening and stiffening of the aptamer stem. The effect of the aptamer on the metal complex's cytotoxicity and cellular uptake was determined using in vitro assays with the target leukaemia cell line CCRF-CEM and the off-target ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and A2780cp70.

The aim of this study was to delineate the mechanism of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in pancreatic cancer (PaCa) cell survival. We first analyzed the endogenous expression and subcellular localization of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in six PaCa cell lines by Western blot. To delineate the functional role of Bcl-2 family proteins, siRNA-mediated knock-down of protein expression was used. Apoptosis was measured by Cell Death ELISA and Hoechst 33258 staining. In the results, the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins varied between PaCa cell lines. Mcl-1 knock-down resulted in marked cleavage of PARP and induction of apoptosis. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL had a much weaker effect. Simultaneous knock-down of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 strongly induced apoptosis, but simultaneous knock-down of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 or Mcl-1/Bcl-2 had no additive effect. The apoptosis-inducing effect of simultaneous knock-down of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 was associated with translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. These results demonstrated that Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 play an important role in pancreatic cancer cell survival.

Abnormal placentation can result in early miscarriage or preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, leading to impaired fetal and/or maternal health. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) is involved in cancer cell migration and invasion, processes which are critical during placentation but unlike in cancer, trophoblast invasion is highly regulated. CSPG4 expression and function in trophoblast is unknown. We determined CSPG4 expression in human first trimester placenta and implantation sites, and investigated whether CSPG4 influenced proliferation, migration and invasion of a human extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cell line (HTR8/SVneo cells) as a model for extravillous trophoblast (EVT). METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunoreactive CSPG4 localized to EVT cells in the trophoblast shell, subpopulations of interstitial EVT cells within the decidua and cytotrophoblast cells in placental villi. In HTR8/SVneo cells, siRNA knockdown of CSPG4 stimulated proliferation and decreased migration/invasion. In primary first trimester placental villi explants two cytokines, interleukin 11 (IL11) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) with known roles in trophoblast function, stimulated CSPG4 mRNA expression and immunoreactive protein in the cyotrophoblast. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration of the production and function of CSPG4 in human placentation. These data suggest that locally produced CSPG4 stimulates human EVT migration and invasion and suggests that IL11 and LIF regulate villous cytotrophoblast differentiation towards the invasive phenotype at least in part via CSPG4.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This review addresses the diagnosis and management of isolated neutropenia, not multiple cytopenias due to splenomegaly, bone marrow replacement, or myelosuppression by chemotherapy or radiation. Laboratory evaluation generally includes repeat complete blood cell counts (CBCs) with differentials and bone marrow examination with cytogenetics. Neutrophil antibody testing may be useful but only in the context of clinical and bone marrow findings. The discovery of genes responsible for congenital neutropenias now permits genetic diagnosis in many cases. Management of severe chronic neutropenia includes commonsense precautions to avoid infection, aggressive treatment of bacterial or fungal infections, and administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Patients with severe chronic neutropenia, particularly those who respond poorly to G-CSF, have a risk of eventually developing myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and require monitoring for this complication, which also can occur without G-CSF therapy. Patients with cyclic, idiopathic, and autoimmune neutropenia have virtually no risk of evolving to MDS or AML.

PURPOSE: To investigate the interaction between an antineoplastic agent - paclitaxel (PTX) and low-level ultrasound in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562, their combined efficacy, and the potential mechanisms in sonochemotherapy. METHODS: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis and Guava Viacount assay were adopted to examine cell viability. Apoptosis was analyzed using Annexin V-PE/7-amino-actinomycin D staining. Changes in plasma membrane permeability were monitored by FD500-uptake and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays. Additionally, the ultrastructure changes were evaluated under scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS: When 5 ng/ml PTX was combined with sonication at Load Power (LP) = 2 W, the expected synergistic effects on cell viability loss (p < 0.05) and apoptosis enhancement could be significantly detected, the plasma membrane permeability showed the best response, and relatively serious cell damages were observed under SEM. CONCLUSION: The interaction between these two therapies depended on specific parameter settings, such as PTX dose and ultrasound intensity. Under synergistic conditions, ultrasound significantly potentiated the efficacies of PTX, including cytotoxicity, apoptosis and cell damage induction, which may be due to the enhanced membrane permeability and the increased intracellular PTX level.",,"['Yang, Shuang', 'Wang, Pan', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Zhang, Kun', 'Zhang, Xing', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Yang S', 'Wang P', 'Wang X', 'Zhang K', 'Zhang X', 'Liu Q']","[""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University , Xi'an, Shaanxi , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130819,England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Electrochemical, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Sound', '*Ultrasonic Therapy']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2014/05/17 06:00,['2013/08/20 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/1061186X.2013.830309 [doi]'],ppublish,J Drug Target. 2013 Nov;21(9):874-84. doi: 10.3109/1061186X.2013.830309.

Patients with this potentially fatal condition may often first present with gingival enlargement. Early diagnosis of the underlying condition and prompt referral for appropriate therapy, may be life-saving. CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old female was referred to the Department of Oral Medicine and Periodontology complaining of a generalised gingival enlargement that was aesthetically displeasing to her. She insisted on immediate surgical removal of the enlarged gingival tissue but, on counseling, agreed to have prior diagnostic tests performed. A full blood count suggested the presence of an underlying acute myeloid leukaemia. The patient was consequently referred to the Oncology Department for further investigation and management. The diagnosis was confirmed and the subsequent chemotherapeutic intervention was strikingly successful, leading to the complete resolution of the gingival enlargement. CONCLUSION: This paper emphasises the importance of a full diagnostic evaluation of all cases of gingival enlargement and immediate referral should a life-threatening condition be identified, such as, in the present case, acute myeloid leukaemia.",,"['Singh-Rambiritch, S', 'Wood, N H']","['Singh-Rambiritch S', 'Wood NH']","['Department of Oral Medicine and Periodontology, School of Oral Health Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,South Africa,SADJ,SADJ : journal of the South African Dental Association = tydskrif van die Suid-Afrikaanse Tandheelkundige Vereniging,9812497,,"['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gingiva/pathology', 'Gingival Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Gingival Overgrowth/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Gingivitis, Necrotizing Ulcerative/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/complications', 'Remission Induction']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/08/20 06:00'],"['2013/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,SADJ. 2012 Aug;67(7):344-7.,7,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furazolidone has been used in the treatment of certain bacterial and protozoan infections in human and animals for more than sixty years. We investigated the anti-leukemic activity of FZD in a series of AML cells. FZD displayed potent antiproliferative properties at submicromolar concentrations and induced apoptosis in AML cell lines. Importantly, FZD treatment of certain AML cells induced myeloid cell differentiation by morphology and flow cytometry for CD11b expression.

The domain does not support the auto- or trans-kinase activity of p210 BCR/ABL or its ability to interact with GRB2 and activate ERK1/2 signaling. Expression of p210 BCR/ABL, but not a beta-catenin-binding mutant, in hematopoietic cells is associated with the accumulation of p-beta-catenin (Tyr654) and increased TCF/LEF-mediated transcription. In a bone marrow transplantation model, the interaction between beta-catenin and p-beta-catenin (Tyr654) is detectable in mice transplanted with p210 BCR/ABL, but not the mutant. Whereas mice transplanted with p210 BCR/ABL exhibit myeloid disease with expansion of monocytes and neutrophils, mice transplanted with the mutant predominantly exhibit expansion of neutrophils, polycythemia, and increased lifespan. The increased disease latency is associated with expansion of megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors, a decrease in common myeloid progenitors, and reduced beta-catenin signaling in the bone marrow of the diseased mice. These observations support a model in which p210 BCR/ABL may influence lineage-specific leukemic expansion by directly binding and phosphorylating beta-catenin and altering its transcriptional activity.

Acquisition of these mutations in hematopoietic stem cells can lead to their clonal expansion resulting in a pre-leukemic stem cell (pre-LSC) population. Pre-LSCs retain the ability to differentiate into the full spectrum of mature daughter cells but can become fully transformed with the acquisition of additional driver mutations.

In an effort to reverse this undesirable feature of MSCs, we manipulated human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) to express indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that induces immune suppression by inhibiting T cell proliferation and triggering apoptosis in immune cells. Cultures of human UC-MSCs were generated by plastic adherence method. Full-length cDNA of human IDO was cloned into adenovirus shuttle vector. Then, the recombinant virus harboring IDO gene was produced in 293 cells and used to infect UC-MSCs. Expression of IDO protein was detected within infected UC-MSCs, and accumulation of kynurenine was observed in the supernatant. Two human leukemia cell lines, Jurkat and HL-60, were cultured on the monolayer of native or infected UC-MSCs, respectively. It was observed that forced IDO expression abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of UC-MSCs on these leukemia cells and enhanced their proliferation inhibitory effect on activated human lymphocytes as well as leukemia cells.

This study assessed the activity of dinaciclib in acute leukemia both in the clinic and in vitro. METHODS: Adults with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (n = 14) and acute lymphoid leukemia (n = 6) were treated with dinaciclib 50 mg/m(2) given as a 2-h infusion every 21 days. RESULTS: Most patients had dramatic but transient reduction in circulating blasts; however, no remissions were achieved on this schedule. The most common toxicities were gastrointestinal, fatigue, transaminitis, and clinical and laboratory manifestations of tumor lysis syndrome, including one patient who died of acute renal failure. Dinaciclib pharmacokinetics showed rapid (2 h) achievement of maximum concentration and a short elimination/distribution phase. Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated in vivo inhibition of Mcl-1 expression and induction of PARP cleavage in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells 4 h after dinaciclib infusion, but the effects were lost by 24 h and did not correlate with clinical outcome. Correlative in vitro studies showed that prolonged exposures to dinaciclib, at clinically attainable concentrations, result in improved leukemia cell kill.

IDH2 mutations are heterozygous; they alter a single arginine residue at position 140 or 172 and have distinct prognostic significance. The current detection methods of IDH2 mutations are laborious and time consuming as they require DNA sequencing. Herein, we report a new allele-specific oligonucleotide-polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) method to detect the IDH2 mutations. Analysis of leukemic DNA samples from 120 AML patients enabled to identify IDH2 mutations in 22 cases which were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Of these, 17 harbored IDH2 (R140Q) and 5 IDH2 (R172K) mutations. Serial dilution experiments showed that the assay enable to detect mutations in 10(-)(3) dilutions.

METHODS: We combined data from national registers on all Danish patients diagnosed with hematological malignancies between 2000 and 2007. A total of 1,741 patients on long-term sick leave were followed until RTW, emigration, permanent withdrawal from the labor market, death, or February 2012, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 1,140 (65 %) patients returned to work. A strong association was found between type of diagnosis and RTW (p < 0.001), and the proportion of RTW was lowest for patients with multiple myeloma or acute leukemia compared to patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphoid leukemia. Use of antidepressants or anxiolytics after diagnosis, gender, age, and educational level were also associated with RTW. Surprisingly, comorbidity was not associated with RTW (p = 0.94); gender only modified the association between age and RTW. CONCLUSION: Two thirds of patients with hematological malignancies on sick leave RTW. A number of factors seem to lead to a poor prognosis, the hematological diagnosis being the most important, and these should be taken into account when performing studies on work outcome for patients with hematological malignancies.

We found that MPT0B169 prevented tubulin assembly by binding the colchicine-binding site of tubulin in vitro. MPT0B169 also induced tubulin depolymerization in vivo. MPT0B169 inhibited the growth of HL60, NB4, and U937 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. It also inhibited the growth of paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells. In addition, MPT0B169 caused G2/M cell cycle arrest in nonresistant and paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells, with a concomitant increase in cyclin B1 levels and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylation.

A growing body of evidence indicates that alterations in the adhesion properties of neoplastic cells play a pivotal role in the development and progression of CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of 71 cell surface molecules was examined on CLL peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over 3 weeks in culture. The most highly upregulated marker, CD62L, was examined further for expression on CD5(+)/CD19(+) CLL cells in vitro and in lymph node and bone marrow biopsies. The prosurvival role of CD62L was examined using a functional blocking antibody and therapeutic potential evaluated by comparison with current chemotherapy agents. RESULTS: Blocking CD62L resulted in apoptosis of CLL cells but not PBMCs from healthy donors suggesting a novel role for CD62L in CLL cell survival. The beneficial effect of coculturing CLL cells with bone marrow stromal cells or endothelial cells does not protect CLL cells from anti-CD62L-related toxicity. Moreover, combining fludarabine or mafosfamide with the anti-CD62L in vitro produced an additive effect both with and without stromal cells. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported data showing that blocking the activation and homing marker, CD62L, regulates CLL cell survival in vitro. These data also suggest that therapeutic antibodies against CD62L may provide additional clinical benefit to patients with CLL receiving current standard chemotherapy protocols.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"['Burgess, Melinda', 'Gill, Devinder', 'Singhania, Richa', 'Cheung, Catherine', 'Chambers, Lynne', 'Renyolds, Brent A', 'Smith, Louise', 'Mollee, Peter', 'Saunders, Nicholas', 'McMillan, Nigel Aj']","['Burgess M', 'Gill D', 'Singhania R', 'Cheung C', 'Chambers L', 'Renyolds BA', 'Smith L', 'Mollee P', 'Saunders N', 'McMillan NA']","[""Authors' Affiliations: University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Brisbane, Australia; Department of Haematology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; Department of Neurosurgery, McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida; and Griffith Health Institute and School of Medical Sciences, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130815,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology']",,,2013/08/21 06:00,2014/05/20 06:00,['2013/08/17 06:00'],"['2013/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-1037 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1037 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Oct 15;19(20):5675-85. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1037.

Therefore, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY) and MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (PD) are used to sensitize many types of cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutic agents, where AKT and ERK pathways are over activated. However, in this study, we show for the first time that PD could protect the leukemia cells independent of ERK pathway inhibition, besides, we also report a detailed mechanism for antiapoptotic effect of LY in HL-60 cells against the cytotoxicity induced by a boswellic acid analog BA145. Apoptosis induced by BA145 is accompanied by downregulation of PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways in human myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cells, having activating N-Ras mutation. Both LY and PD protected the cells against mitochondrial stress caused by BA145, and reduced the release of cytochrome c and consequent activation of caspase-9. LY and PD also diminished the activation of caspase-8 without affecting the death receptors. Besides, LY and PD also reversed the caspase dependent DNA damage induced by BA145. Further studies revealed that LY and PD significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of BA145 on cell cycle regulatory proteins by upregulating hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma, pRB (S795) and downregulating p21 and cyclin E. More importantly, all these events were reversed by caspase inhibition by Z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that both LY and PD act at the level of caspases to diminish the apoptosis induced by BA145.

Afterwards, a 4x4 full factorial design and the estimated marginal means plot were performed to assess the combined effects of these two compounds. According to the linear discriminant functions and classification criteria, bisphenol A and genistein were classified as weakly embryotoxic and strongly embryotoxic respectively. As for combined effects, the overall interaction between BPA and GEN on embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiation was synergistic at low dosages, however, on ESCs and 3T3 cell proliferation, the predominate action was additive. Considering the actual daily intake of these chemicals, it is concluded that BPA alone might not have adverse reproductive or developmental effects on human being.

Contributing the physical and psychological dysfunction, stress has now been linked with a wide range of diagnoses including cancer, cardiac disease and arthritis. The importance of incorporating stress management activities into daily life is increasingly apparent. Occupational therapists concerned with patients' ability to achieve health enhancing independent living skills are in a key position to help patients master stress management skills and incorporate them into activities of daily living. This article will explore the incorporation of stress management into occupational therapy programming for a variety of acute care patients. It will review the components of stress, the stress cycle, the relaxation response, the occupational therapy role based on a model of human occupation, and will review current programs through case study of four patients: one diagnosed with cancer (leukemia), one with anorexia nervosa, one with chronic pain and the fourth, a patient in medical intensive care.",,"['Affleck, A', 'Bianchi, E', 'Cleckley, M', 'Donaldson, K', 'McCormack, G', 'Polon, J']","['Affleck A', 'Bianchi E', 'Cleckley M', 'Donaldson K', 'McCormack G', 'Polon J']","['Assistant Director of Physical and Occupational Therapy, Stanford University Hospital, Stanford, CA; Supervisor of Occupational Therapy; Part-time Instructor Occupational Therapy, San Jose State University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Occup Ther Health Care,Occupational therapy in health care,8309883,,,,,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['2013/08/17 06:00'],"['2013/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/J003v01n03_04 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Ther Health Care. 1984;1(3):17-41. doi: 10.1080/J003v01n03_04.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNMT3A expression was detected in mono-nuclear cells of the bone marrow in these patients and in normal individuals using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and 17.5% (10/57) of AML patients were found to exhibit DNMT3A mutations. Four missense mutations were observed in the DNMT3A-mutated AML patients, including R882 mutations and a novel single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in the M880V amino acid substitution. However, the ALL and BAL patients were not found to exhibit DNMT3A mutations. The DNMT3A expression levels in the AML patients were significantly higher compared with those of the ALL patients or normal controls. The reduced expression levels of DNMT3A were associated with a significantly lower complete remission rate in the AML patients.

It has become the ideal tyrosine kinase inhibitor and the standard treatment for chronic-phase leukemia. Striking results have recently been reported, but intolerance to imatinib and noncompliance with treatment remain to be solved. Molecular monitoring by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard for monitoring patients, and imatinib blood levels have also become an important tool for monitoring. METHODS: A fast and cheap method was developed and validated using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for quantification of imatinib in human serum and tamsulosin as the internal standard. Remarkable advantages of the method includes use of serum instead of plasma, less time spent on processing and analysis, simpler procedures, and requiring reduced amounts of biological material, solvents, and reagents. Stability of the analyte was also studied. This research also intended to drive the validation scheme in clinical centers. The method was validated according to the requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration and Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency within the range of 0.500-10.0 mug/mL with a limit of detection of 0.155 mug/mL.

Brd4 is also involved in gene bookmarking during mitosis and is a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. The Drosophila melanogaster Brd4 homologue is called Fs(1)h and, like its vertebrate counterpart, encodes different isoforms. We have used ChIP-seq to examine the genome-wide distribution of Fs(1)h isoforms. We are able to distinguish the Fs(1)h-L and Fs(1)h-S binding profiles and discriminate between the genomic locations of the two isoforms. Fs(1)h-S is present at enhancers and promoters and its amount parallels transcription levels. Correlations between the distribution of Fs(1)h-S and various forms of acetylated histones H3 and H4 suggest a preference for binding to H3K9acS10ph. Surprisingly, Fs(1)h-L is located at sites in the genome where multiple insulator proteins are also present. The results suggest that Fs(1)h-S may be responsible for the classical role assigned to this protein, whereas Fs(1)h-L may have a new and unexpected role in chromatin architecture by working in conjunction with insulator proteins to mediate intra- or inter-chromosome interactions.",,"['Kellner, Wendy A', 'Van Bortle, Kevin', 'Li, Li', 'Ramos, Edward', 'Takenaka, Naomi', 'Corces, Victor G']","['Kellner WA', 'Van Bortle K', 'Li L', 'Ramos E', 'Takenaka N', 'Corces VG']","['Department of Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA and Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130813,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Drosophila Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Histones/metabolism', '*Insulator Elements', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2013/08/16 06:00,2014/01/08 06:00,['2013/08/16 06:00'],"['2013/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gkt722 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkt722 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Nov;41(20):9274-83. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt722.

METHODS: The BCR-ABL fusion gene as well as the expression of IL-12 and IL-17 mRNA were performed by RT-PCR. The serum concentrations of cytokine IL-12 and IL-17 were determined by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). Immunochemistry staining and cytochemistry staining were used to observe the peroxidase (POX) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression of EOS in bone marrow. Immunofluorescence staining was used to observe mannose receptor (MR), IL-12, IL-17A and IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) expression of EOS. The results between the CML patients and the healthy controls were compared. RESULT: Serum levels of IL-12 and IL-17 were higher in the 60 CML patients [(196.33 +/- 21.79) ng/L and (36.55 +/- 3.01) ng/L] than those in the controls [(96.60 +/- 4.92) ng/L and (23.74 +/- 1.36) ng/L]. In the 32 patients with activated EOS, the levels of IL-12 and IL-17 were (273.12 +/- 17.16) ng/L and (40.11 +/- 6.13) ng/L, which were significantly higher than those in the non-activated EOS [(126.16 +/- 14.27) ng/L and (28.14 +/- 5.29) ng/L] (P values < 0.01). IL-12 and IL-17 mRNA were expressed in activated EOS, while BCR-ABL fusion gene was not found. The amounts of EOS were increased abnormally in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of the CML patients with POX positive staining in the cytoplasm and weakly positive HLA-DR staining. It was observed easily by a microscope that EOS could attack leukemic cells in bone marrow through adhesion, capture and phagocytosis. Activated EOS could express IL-12, IL-17A and MR, which was related with the serum levels of these cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Activated EOS in bone marrow of CML patients could express IL-12 and IL-17. Activated EOS could induce coup injury to leukemic cell by releasing POX and expressing IL-12 and IL-17. It can also capture or swallow target cells via the expression of MR on the membrane. EOS may play an important role in the anti-tumor immunologic function in bone marrow of CML patients.",,"['Sun, Li-fei', 'Wu, Qiang-qiang', 'Hao, Hong-feng', 'Ma, Xiang-shan', 'Du, Yan-hui', 'Wang, Gui-chen', 'Zhang, Jin-biao']","['Sun LF', 'Wu QQ', 'Hao HF', 'Ma XS', 'Du YH', 'Wang GC', 'Zhang JB']","['Department of Tumor Research and Treatment Centricity, the 148th Hospital of PLA, Zibo, Shandong Province 255300, China. sunlifei_2007@163.com']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-17/genetics/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mannose Receptor', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism']",,,2013/08/16 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/08/16 06:00'],"['2013/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2013 May;52(5):395-9.,5,"['0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Mannose Receptor)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C-KIT signaling network has been the subject of intense research and pharmaceutical strategies to identify novel target-based approaches for cancer treatment. Evidence that c-KIT signaling promotes cell proliferation and survival, along with the frequency in which this pathway is aberrantly activated in cancer, support the current efforts to identify approaches for its efficient inhibition. C-KIT mutations are associatied with several human malignancies, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, acute myeloid leukemia, mast cell leukemia, and melanoma. Novel therapies are developed that target some of the identified genetic defects. It is therefore anticipated that newly-identified genetic markers will acquire a predictive value, that is, the ability to predict differential efficacy of a therapy.

This study explored patient experiences of barriers to accessing care and associated financial and social impacts of the disease. Metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan experiences were compared. METHODS: A state-based Australian cancer registry identified adult survivors of hematological cancers (including lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma) diagnosed in the previous 3 years. Survivors were mailed a self-report pen and paper survey. FINDINGS: Of the 732 eligible survivors, 268 (37%) completed a survey. Forty percent of participants reported at least one locational barrier which limited access to care. Only 2% reported cancer-related expenses had restricted their treatment choices. Almost two-thirds (64%) reported at least one financial or social impact on their daily lives related to cancer. The most frequently reported impacts were the need to take time off work (44%) and difficulty paying bills (21%). Survivors living in a nonmetropolitan location had 17 times the odds of reporting locational or financial barriers compared with those in metropolitan areas. Preferred potential solutions to alleviate the financial and social impacts of the disease were: free parking for tests or treatment (37%), free medications or treatments (29%), and being able to get treatment in their local region (20%). CONCLUSIONS: Providing more equitable access to care for hematological cancer patients in Australia requires addressing distances traveled to attend treatment and their associated financial and social impacts on nonmetropolitan patients.

Alternative staffing models have emerged secondary to American Counsel for Graduate Medical Education work-hour restrictions. The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) care provided by a physician assistant (PA) service compared with a traditional model. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected on patients admitted with AML for reinduction chemotherapy from 2008 to 2012. Primary outcome measures were inpatient mortality and length of stay (LOS). Secondary measures included readmissions, intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, consults requested, and radiologic studies ordered. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients with AML were reviewed. Forty-seven patients (49.5%) were admitted to the HO service, and 48 patients (50.5%) were admitted to the PA service. Demographic data were similar between services. LOS was significantly different between the services, with a mean of 36.8 days with the HO model compared with 30.9 days with the PA service (P=.03). The 14-day readmission rate also differed significantly; it was 10.6% (five of 47 patients) and zero for the HO and PA models, respectively (P=.03). The mean number of consults with the HO model was 2.11 (range, zero to five) versus 1.47 (range, zero to four) with the PA service (P=.03). Mortality and ICU transfers were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate equivalent mortality and ICU transfers, with a decrease in LOS, readmission rates, and consults for patients cared for in the PA service. This suggests that the PA service is associated with increased operational efficiency and decreased health service use without compromising health care outcomes.",,"['Glotzbecker, Brett E', 'Yolin-Raley, Deborah S', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Alyea, Edwin P 3rd']","['Glotzbecker BE', 'Yolin-Raley DS', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stone RM', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Alyea EP 3rd']","[""Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130611,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers/*organization & administration', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Patient Readmission/statistics & numerical data', '*Physician Assistants', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/08/15 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2013/08/15 06:00'],"['2013/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JOP.2012.000841 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2012.000841 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2013 Sep;9(5):e228-33. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2012.000841.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (age>/=18 years) with at least one CML diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition Clinical Modification: 205.1x) during the period January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2011, and initiated on IM as first-line therapy were identified in the VISN 16 data warehouse (N=137). Accelerated and blastic phases (AP/BP) were identified on the basis of WHO classification using complete blood count (CBC) data. Rates of IM dose adjustment, discontinuation, and switching to another drug therapy were estimated. Time to discontinuation, progression to AP/BP, and survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis (KM). RESULTS: During follow-up, 19.0% of patients had at least one dose increase; of these, 19.2% switched to another therapy. Dose reductions occurred in 25.6% of patients. Among patients who discontinued IM (n=74; 54.0%), whereas 16.2% switched to other therapies, 27.0% neither restarted IM nor switched to other therapies. KM showed that 25.6% and 42.4% of patients discontinued IM treatment by year 1 and 2, and 8.1% and 16.0% demonstrated disease progression by year 1 and 2, respectively.

Owing to its constitutive kinase activity FLT3 ITD partially accumulates at endomembranes, a feature shared with other disease-associated, mutated receptor tyrosine kinases. Because Ras proteins also transit through endomembranes we have investigated the possible existence of an intracellular FLT3-ITD/Ras signaling pathway by comparing Ras signaling of FLT3 ITD with that of wild-type FLT3. Ligand stimulation activated both K- and N-Ras in cells expressing wild-type FLT3. Live-cell Ras-GTP imaging revealed ligand-induced Ras activation at the plasma membrane (PM). FLT3-ITD-dependent constitutive activation of K-Ras and N-Ras was also observed primarily at the PM, supporting the view that the PM-resident pool of FLT3 ITD engaged the Ras/Erk pathway in AML cells. Accordingly, specific interference with FLT3-ITD/Ras signaling at the PM using PM-restricted dominant negative K-RasS17N potently inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. In conclusion, Ras signaling is crucial for FLT3-ITD-dependent cell transformation and FLT3 ITD addresses PM-bound Ras despite its pronounced mislocalization to endomembranes.",,"['Kothe, Susanne', 'Muller, Jorg P', 'Bohmer, Sylvia-Annette', 'Tschongov, Todor', 'Fricke, Melanie', 'Koch, Sina', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Requardt, Robert P', 'Rubio, Ignacio', 'Bohmer, Frank D']","['Kothe S', 'Muller JP', 'Bohmer SA', 'Tschongov T', 'Fricke M', 'Koch S', 'Thiede C', 'Requardt RP', 'Rubio I', 'Bohmer FD']","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, 07743 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130813,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Endomembrane', 'FLT3', 'FLT3 ITD', 'Leukemia', 'Localization', 'Oncogenic RTK', 'Plasma membrane', 'Ras']",2013/08/15 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/08/15 06:00'],"['2013/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.131789 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.131789 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2013 Oct 15;126(Pt 20):4746-55. doi: 10.1242/jcs.131789.

In general, ATL is resistant to chemotherapy, and while awaiting new therapeutics, patients commonly face a detrimental progress of the disease and death. The viral oncoprotein Tax is a key player in the cause of ATL and acts by interfering with DNA repair, cell cycle, apoptosis, and proliferative cellular programs. The Shimoyama classification describes four different subtypes (acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering) associated with different outcomes, and that require different treatment strategies tailored to the clinical presentation. In aggressive ATL (acute and lymphoma subtypes), clinical trials, mostly from Japan, have demonstrated that combinations of chemotherapy can induce acceptable response rates, especially in the lymphoma subtype. However, the overall outcome remains extremely poor owing to a high rate of relapse. Similarly, the so-called indolent forms (smoldering and chronic subtypes) have a poor outcome whether they are managed with watching and waiting or treated with chemotherapy. We recently realized a worldwide meta-analysis and showed that the combination of zidovudine and interferon alpha is highly effective in the leukemic subtypes of ATL and should be considered as standard first-line therapy in that setting. This combination has changed the natural history of the disease through achievement of significantly improved long-term survival in patients with smoldering and chronic ATL as well as a subset of patients with acute ATL. Patients with lymphoma-type ATL still benefit from chemotherapy induction with concurrent or sequential antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine and interferon alpha. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a promising option but has several barriers. New drugs such as the new antibody anti-CXCR4 show promising results. Prospective trials testing maintenance therapy in order to avoid relapse are warranted when the patient cannot undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",,"['Marcais, Ambroise', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Sibon, David', 'Frenzel, Laurent', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Marcais A', 'Suarez F', 'Sibon D', 'Frenzel L', 'Hermine O', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Hematology, Institut Imagine, Necker Hospital, Paris Descartes University, 149 rue de Sevres, 75473, Paris Cedex 15, France, ambroise.marcais@nck.aphp.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Prognosis']",,,2013/08/15 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/08/15 06:00'],"['2013/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11912-013-0332-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2013 Oct;15(5):457-64. doi: 10.1007/s11912-013-0332-6.,5,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its therapeutic power is counterbalanced by significant hematologic toxicity. Persistent and new-onset cytopenia after the completion of FCR raise concern about disease recurrence, the development of therapy-related myeloid malignancies (TRMM), and infections. METHODS: A total of 207 patients with CLL who achieved complete response, complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, or nodular partial remission were analyzed after frontline FCR therapy. RESULTS: Three months after the completion of therapy, 35% of patients had developed grade 2 to 4 cytopenia (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]). Factors found to be associated with cytopenia at 3 months after therapy were older age, advanced Rai stage disease, and lower baseline blood counts. Moreover, patients with cytopenia were less likely to have completed 6 courses of therapy with FCR. At 6 months and 9 months after therapy, the prevalence of grade 2 to 4 cytopenia was 24% and 12%, respectively. No differences in progression-free survival and overall survival were noted between cytopenic and noncytopenic patients or between patients with persistent and new-onset cytopenia. The prevalence of TRMM was 2.3% and did not differ significantly between cytopenic and noncytopenic patients or between those with persistent and new-onset disease. Late infections were more common in patients who were cytopenic at 9 months (38%) and were mostly bacterial (67%). CONCLUSIONS: Cytopenia after the completion of therapy is a common complication of frontline FCR that improves over time, particularly for new-onset cases. The presence of persistent cytopenia (lasting up to 9 months after the completion of therapy) should not raise concern about CLL recurrence of the development of TRMM, but should encourage surveillance for bacterial infections for an additional 9 months.",['(c) 2013 American Cancer Society.'],"['Strati, Paolo', 'Wierda, William', 'Burger, Jan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Tam, Constantine', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Keating, Michael J', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Strati P', 'Wierda W', 'Burger J', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Tam C', 'Lerner S', 'Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130813,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Immunotherapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/epidemiology/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy/adverse effects', 'Pancytopenia/blood/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab', 'cytopenia', 'prognosis']",2013/08/15 06:00,2013/12/20 06:00,['2013/08/15 06:00'],"['2013/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28318 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Nov 1;119(21):3805-11. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28318.

Published clinical trial data on 599 patients who received 100-180 days of prophylactic therapy with voriconazole or fluconazole were used to model specified IFI-prevention and mortality outcomes; 6-month, 12-month, and lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated, with a bootstrap analysis performed to reffect the uncertainty of the clinical trial data. RESULTS: Estimated mean total prophylaxis and IFI-related costs associated with voriconazole versus fluconazole prophylaxis over 12 months were higher in the entire study population and among patients receiving HCT for diagnoses other than acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but were not significantly different for patients with AML. The cost per IFI avoided ($66,919) and the cost per life-year gained ($5,453) were lower among patients with AML who received voriconazole relative to the full study population. ICERs were more favorable for voriconazole over a 6-month time frame and when modeling was conducted using generic price data. Assuming a threshold value of $50,000 for one year of life gained, the calculated probability of voriconazole being cost-effective was 33% for the full study population and 85% for the AML subgroup. CONCLUSION: The decision model indicated that voriconazole prophylaxis was cost-effective for patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for AML.",,"['Mauskopf, Josephine', 'Chirila, Costel', 'Graham, Jon', 'Gersten, Iris D', 'Leather, Helen', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Baden, Lindsey R', 'Bolanos-Meade, Javier', 'Brown, Janice M Y', 'Walsh, Thomas J', 'Horowitz, Mary H', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Marr, Kieren A', 'Wingard, John R']","['Mauskopf J', 'Chirila C', 'Graham J', 'Gersten ID', 'Leather H', 'Maziarz RT', 'Baden LR', 'Bolanos-Meade J', 'Brown JM', 'Walsh TJ', 'Horowitz MH', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Marr KA', 'Wingard JR']","['Health Economics, RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, NC 12194, USA. jmauskopf@rti.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fluconazole/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*economics/methods', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/*economics/epidemiology', 'Pyrimidines/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Triazoles/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",,,2013/08/15 06:00,2014/04/23 06:00,['2013/08/15 06:00'],"['2013/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['70/17/1518 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp120599 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2013 Sep 1;70(17):1518-27. doi: 10.2146/ajhp120599.,17,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",PMC4019750,,"['U10 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 HL069286/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069274/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069301/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069310/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 HL069274/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069348/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069286/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS566545'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether tamoxifen's effect can be modulated by S6K1 inhibition. S6K1 inhibition by PF4708671, a selective inhibitor of S6K1, acts synergistically with tamoxifen in S6K1-high MCF-7 cells. Similarly, the knockdown of S6K1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly sensitized MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen. Inhibition of S6K1 by PF4708671 led to a marked decrease in the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and survivin, which was not related to mRNA levels. In addition, suppression of Mcl-1 or survivin, using specific siRNA, further enhanced cell sensitivity to tamoxifen. These results showed that inhibition of S6K1 acts synergistically with tamoxifen, via translational modulation of Mcl-1 and survivin.

Dasatinib is approved for the treatment of all phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib treatment and first-line treatment for CML in chronic phase. In this article, the development of dasatinib as a treatment for patients with CML is reviewed. METHODS: This is a review of the relevant literature regarding dasatinib development in CML (2003-2013). RESULTS: Dasatinib demonstrates efficacy against most BCR-ABL mutations arising during imatinib therapy and is effective in treating patients with imatinib resistance due to other mechanisms. Randomized trial data show that first-line dasatinib provides superior responses compared with imatinib and enables patients to achieve early, deep responses correlated with improved longer-term outcomes. Dasatinib has a generally acceptable safety profile, with most adverse events (AEs) proving manageable and reversible. Cytopenias are commonly observed with dasatinib, and some nonhematologic AEs including pleural effusion have been consistently reported.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between domestic radon exposure and childhood cancers, particularly leukemia and central nervous system (CNS) tumors. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide census-based cohort study including all children < 16 years of age living in Switzerland on 5 December 2000, the date of the 2000 census. Follow-up lasted until the date of diagnosis, death, emigration, a child's 16th birthday, or 31 December 2008. Domestic radon levels were estimated for each individual home address using a model developed and validated based on approximately 45,000 measurements taken throughout Switzerland. Data were analyzed with Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for child age, child sex, birth order, parents' socioeconomic status, environmental gamma radiation, and period effects. RESULTS: In total, 997 childhood cancer cases were included in the study. Compared with children exposed to a radon concentration below the median (< 77.7 Bq/m3), adjusted hazard ratios for children with exposure >/= the 90th percentile (>/= 139.9 Bq/m3) were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.16) for all cancers, 0.95 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.43) for all leukemias, 0.90 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.43) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.61) for CNS tumors.

Several downstream targets of the pathways involved have been identified that when individually overexpressed can partially support self-renewal. However, none of these targets is shared among the involved pathways. Here, we show that the CP2 family transcription factor Tfcp2l1 is a common target in LIF/Stat3- and 2i-mediated self-renewal, and forced expression of Tfcp2l1 can recapitulate the self-renewal-promoting effect of LIF or either of the 2i components. In addition, Tfcp2l1 can reprogram post-implantation epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotent ESCs. Tfcp2l1 upregulates Nanog expression and promotes self-renewal in a Nanog-dependent manner. We conclude that Tfcp2l1 is at the intersection of LIF- and 2i-mediated self-renewal pathways and plays a critical role in maintaining ESC identity.

We took advantage of Stat3 null ES cells to confirm that Stat3 mediates the self-renewal response to LIF. Through comparative transcriptome analysis intersected with genome location data, we arrived at a set of candidate transcription factor effectors. Among these, Tfcp2l1 (also known as Crtr-1) was most abundant. Constitutive expression of Tfcp2l1 at levels similar to those induced by LIF effectively substituted for LIF or Stat3 in sustaining clonal self-renewal and pluripotency. Conversely, knockdown of Tfcp2l1 profoundly compromised responsiveness to LIF. We further found that Tfcp2l1 is both necessary and sufficient to direct molecular reprogramming of post-implantation epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotency.

Our objectives were to assess stroke prevalence in children with cancer, to establish cancer and stroke type, and to determine if modifiable risk factors for stroke were present. METHODS: Children with stroke and cancer were compared with all children seen for cancer at a single institution between 2000 and 2009. An International Classification of Disease, 9th version, code search and search of existing pediatric oncology and stroke databases identified children <18 years with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. RESULTS: Of 1411 children with cancer, 15 had a stroke (1.1%, 95% CI: 0.6-1.7%). Stroke classifications were seven intracerebral hemorrhages, five ischemic strokes (one of which was followed by intracerebral hemorrhage), and three sinovenous thromboses. Stroke occurred at a median of 5 months after cancer diagnosis. Ten children with strokes had hematologic malignancies and five had brain tumors. Thirteen patients died poststroke, eight because of withdrawal of care. White blood cell count >/=48,000/mm3 was found in four children, all with intracerebral hemorrhage. Five of seven children with intracerebral hemorrhage had platelets <50,000/mm3. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke has a prevalence of approximately 1% in children with cancer. Hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke occur with approximately equal frequency; children with leukemia and brain tumors are at greatest risk.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Herein we review the role chronic inflammation plays in the initiation and progression of CLL. The robust production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines accompanied by activation of intra-cellular pro-inflammatory pathways, and the presence of somatic mutations that activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, suggest that chronic inflammation plays a pathophysiological role in this disease. Indeed, glucocorticoids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory possess anti-tumor activity, and glucocorticoids have been broadly used to treat CLL and its complications. Recent clinical trials demonstrated that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as ibrutinib and the immune-modulatory agent lenalidomide, induced impressive clinical responses in CLL patients with relapsed or refractory disease. As those pro-inflammatory pathway inhibitors and immune modulating drugs proved to be effective in CLL, other agents with similar activities are currently investigated in clinical trials. New insights into the pathobiology of CLL and the development of novel classes of drugs will undoubtedly provide us with effective tools to treat and perhaps cure CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The introduction of imatinib significantly changed the prognosis of CML, challenging the concept of a fatal disease. Nowdays, imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are registered for first-line treatment of CML patients in chronic phase (CP). Considering elderly patients, the most extensively studied TKI is imatinib, that induces a rate of cytogenetic and molecular responses comparable between the younger and the elderly patients. Once a CCgR with imatinib is achieved, the probability to be alive and disease free at 8 years is more than 80%. These results confirm that imatinib has to be considered the first-line treatment for the elderly and that the CCgR is the guide parameter for treatment modulation and the most solid marker of long term outcome. Nevertheless, older patients tolerate imatinib worse in comparison to the younger, and this causes a higher rate of therapy discontinuation and less adherence to chronic treatment. Thus, the toxic profile of each TKI is one of the most important factors driving the choice of the best drug. Another important factor is the potency of the TKI. Since nilotinib and dasatinib are more potent than imatinib in inducing cytogenetic and molecular responses, they could be preferred for increasing the proportion of patients who can achieve deeper molecular responses, allowing treatment discontinuation. This approach is intriguing, but it is still experimental. Another therapeutic strategy could be the identification of the minimal effective dose of TKI in order to maintain the CCgR, but also this approach is under clinical investigation.",,"['Russo, Domenico', 'Malagola, Michele', 'Skert, Cristina', 'Fili, Carla', 'Bergonzi, Cesare', 'Cancelli, Valeria', 'Cattina, Federica']","['Russo D', 'Malagola M', 'Skert C', 'Fili C', 'Bergonzi C', 'Cancelli V', 'Cattina F']","['Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Cell Therapies, University of Brescia - AO Spedali Civili Brescia, P.le Spedali Civili 1, 25100 Brescia, Italy. russo@med.unibs.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/mortality/pathology', 'Medication Adherence', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Patient Selection', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2013/08/15 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2013/08/15 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['55012 [pii]', '10.2174/15680096113139990090 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2013 Sep;13(7):755-67. doi: 10.2174/15680096113139990090.,7,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: We describe Barnacle, a production-grade analysis tool that detects such chimeras in de novo assemblies of RNA-seq data, and supports prioritizing them for review and validation by reporting the relative coverage of co-occurring chimeric and wild-type transcripts. We demonstrate applications in large-scale disease studies, by identifying PTDs in MLL, ITDs in FLT3, and reciprocal fusions between PML and RARA, in two deeply sequenced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses of real and simulated data sets show that, with appropriate filter settings, Barnacle makes highly specific predictions for three types of chimeric transcripts that are important in a range of cancers: PTDs, ITDs, and fusions. High specificity makes manual review and validation efficient, which is necessary in large-scale disease studies.

To confirm the role of PPP2R5C in proliferation and its molecular mechanism, three PPP2R5C-siRNAs and a scrambled nonsilencing siRNA control were used to treat Molt-4 and Jurkat T cells. After nucleofection, PPP2R5C expression and biological consequences based on a highly efficient and specific PPP2R5C-siRNA were demonstrated by qRT-PCR, CCK-8 assay, Annexin V/PI, and flow cytometry. The global gene expression profile of PPP2R5C-siRNA-treated Jurkat T cells was established. A significant reduction in the PPP2R5C mRNA level was observed at 24 to 72 h in Molt-4 and Jurkat T cells with all of the PPP2R5C-siRNAs. The proliferation rate of Molt-4 and Jurkat T cells transfected with different PPP2R5C-siRNAs was significantly decreased at 72 h compared with the control (p<0.05). However, the transfected cells did not show a significant increase in Annexin V/PI-positive cells (apoptosis). The highly efficient PPP2R5C-siRNA2 was used to treat Jurkat T cells for gene expression profile analysis. In total, 439 genes were upregulated, and 524 genes were downregulated at least twofold in PPP2R5C-siRNA-treated Jurkat T cells. Changes in signaling pathway genes closely related to the TCR, Wnt, calcium, MAPK, and p53 signaling pathways were observed. In conclusion, the suppression of PPP2R5C by RNA interference could effectively inhibit the proliferation of leukemic T cells, the PPP2R5C-siRNA treatment altered gene expression profiles, and the differential expression of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3beta), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and Mdm2 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM2) genes may play an important role in the effects of PPP2R5C knockdown in Jurkat T cells.",,"['Chen, Yu', 'Liu, Sichu', 'Shen, Qi', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Zheng, Haitao', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Li, Bo', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Chen Y', 'Liu S', 'Shen Q', 'Zha X', 'Zheng H', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Wu X', 'Li B', 'Li Y']","['1 Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University , Guangzhou, China .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130813,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Exons/genetics', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*deficiency/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",,,2013/08/15 06:00,2013/11/19 06:00,['2013/08/15 06:00'],"['2013/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dna.2013.2138 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2013 Oct;32(10):573-81. doi: 10.1089/dna.2013.2138.

Here, we asked whether quantification of T cell receptor excision circle, (TREC) and kappa-deleting recombination excision circle (KREC) before and within six month after allogeneic HSCT could be used to measure the thymic and bone marrow outputs in such patients. METHODS: We used a duplex real time PCR assay to quantify the absolute copy counts of TREC and KREC, and correlated the data with absolute cell counts of CD3+CD4+ T-cell and CD19+ B-cell subsets determined by flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: By comparing two recently proposed naive T cell subsets, CD31+ naive and CD31- naive T cells, we found a better correlation for the CD31+ subset with TREC level post alloHSCT, in line with the assumption that it contained T cells recently derived from the thymus, indicating that TREC levels reflected real thymic de novo production. Transitional as well as naive B cells highly correlated with KREC levels, which suggested an association of KREC levels with ongoing bone marrow B cell output. CD45RO+ memory T cells and CD27+ memory B cells were significantly less correlated with TREC and KREC recovery, respectively.

Mitochondrial metabolism is different in cancer and normal cells. A novel cytosolic type 2-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, BDH2, originally named DHRS6, plays a physiological role in the cytosolic utilization of ketone bodies, which can subsequently enter mitochondria and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Moreover, BDH2 catalyzes the production of 2, 3-DHBA during enterobactin biosynthesis and participates in 24p3 (LCN2)-mediated iron transport and apoptosis. RESULTS: We observed that BDH2 expression is an independent poor prognostic factor for CN-AML, with an anti-apoptotic role. Patients with high BDH2 expression have relatively shorter overall survival (P = 0.007) and a low complete response rate (P = 0.032). BDH2-knockdown (BDH2-KD) in THP1 and HL60 cells increased the apoptosis rate under reactive oxygen species stimulation. Decrease inducible survivin, a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis family, but not members of the Bcl-2 family, induced apoptosis via a caspase-3-independent pathway upon BDH2-KD.

Epidemiological studies suggest an association between an increased incidence of childhood leukemia and benzene exposure during the early stages of pregnancy. However, experimental evidence supporting the association is lacking at the present time. It is believed that benzene and its metabolites target hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to cause toxicity and cancer in the hematopoietic system. In the current study, we compared the effects of hydroquinone (HQ), a major metabolite of benzene in humans and animals, on mouse embryonic yolk sac hematopoietic stem cells (YS-HSCs) and adult bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs). YS-HSCs and BM-HSCs were isolated and enriched, and were exposed to HQ at increasing concentrations. HQ reduced the proliferation and the differentiation and colony formation, but increased the apoptosis of both YS-HSCs and BM-HSCs. However, the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of HQ were more apparent and reduction of colony formation by HQ was more severe in YS-HSCs than in BM-HSCs. Differences in gene expression profiles were observed in HQ-treated YS-HSCs and BM-HSCs. Cyp4f18 was induced by HQ both in YS-HSCs and BM-HSCs, whereas DNA-PKcs was induced in BM-HSCs only.

As shown by us recently, the growth suppressive function of N-CoR largely relies on its capacity to repress Flt3, a key regulator of cellular gorwth during normal and malignant hematopoesis. We further demonstrated how de-repression of Flt3 due to the misfolded conformation dependent loss (MCDL) of N-CoR contributed to malignant growth in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the MCDL of N-CoR and its implication in AML pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we report that Akt-induced phosphorylation of N-CoR at the consensus Akt motif is crucial for its misfolding and subsequent loss in AML (AML-M5). N-CoR displayed significantly higher level of serine specific phosphorylation in almost all AML-M5 derived cells and was subjected to processing by AML-M5 specific aberrant protease activity. To identify the kinase linked to N-CoR phosphorylation, a library of activated kinases was screened with the extracts of AML cells; leading to the identification of Akt as the putative kinase linked to N-CoR phosphorylation. Consistent with this finding, a constitutively active Akt consistently phosphorylated N-CoR leading to its misfolding; while the therapeutic and genetic ablation of Akt largely abrogated the MCDL of N-CoR in AML-M5 cells. Site directed mutagenic analysis of N-CoR identified serine 1450 as the crucial residue whose phosphorylation by Akt was essential for the misfolding and loss of N-CoR protein. Moreover, Akt-induced phosphorylation of N-CoR contributed to the de-repression of Flt3, suggesting a cross talk between Akt signaling and N-CoR misfolding pathway in the pathogenesis of AML-M5.

Therefore, PRAME has been recognized as a promising target for both active and adoptive anti-leukemia immunotherapy. However, in most patients with PRAME-expressing acute myeloid leukemia, PRAME antigen-specific CD8(+) CTL response are either undetectable or too weak to exert immune surveillance presumably due to the inadequate PRAME antigen expression and PRAME-specific antigen presentation by leukemia cells. In this study, we observed remarkably increased PRAME mRNA expression in human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia cells after treatment with a novel subtype-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor chidamide in vitro. PRAME expression was further enhanced in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines after combined treatment with chidamide and DNA demethylating agent decitabine. Pre-treatment of an HLA-A0201(+) acute myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1 with chidamide and/or decitabine increased sensitivity to purified CTLs that recognize PRAME(100-108) or PRAME(300-309) peptide presented by HLA-A0201. Chidamide-induced epigenetic upregulation of CD86 also contributed to increased cytotoxicity of PRAME antigen-specific CTLs. Our data thus provide a new line of evidence that epigenetic upregulation of cancer testis antigens by a subtype-selective HDAC inhibitor or in combination with hypomethylating agent increases CTL cytotoxicity and may represent a new opportunity in future design of treatment strategy targeting specifically PRAME-expressing acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Yao, Yushi', 'Zhou, Jihao', 'Wang, Lixin', 'Gao, Xiaoning', 'Ning, Qiaoyang', 'Jiang, Mengmeng', 'Wang, Jia', 'Wang, Lili', 'Yu, Li']","['Yao Y', 'Zhou J', 'Wang L', 'Gao X', 'Ning Q', 'Jiang M', 'Wang J', 'Wang L', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology and BMT Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130805,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Decitabine', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,,2013/08/14 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0070522 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-37968 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 5;8(8):e70522. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0070522.

For this we selected and genotyped 67 SNPs in 15 genes in the folate pathway in 543 children with ALL and 529 controls. The results were evaluated by gender adjusted logistic regression and by the Bayesian network based Bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance (BN-BMLA) methods. Bayesian structure based odds ratios for the relevant variables and interactions were also calculated. Altogether 9 SNPs in 8 genes were associated with altered susceptibility to ALL. After correction for multiple testing, two associations remained significant. The genotype distribution of the MTHFD1 rs1076991 differed significantly between the ALL and control population. Analyzing the subtypes of the disease the GG genotype increased only the risk of B-cell ALL (p = 3.52x10(-4); OR = 2.00). The GG genotype of the rs3776455 SNP in the MTRR gene was associated with a significantly reduced risk to ALL (p = 1.21x10(-3); OR = 0.55), which resulted mainly from the reduced risk to B-cell and hyperdiploid-ALL. The TC genotype of the rs9909104 SNP in the SHMT1 gene was associated with a lower survival rate comparing it to the TT genotype (80.2% vs. 88.8%; p = 0.01). The BN-BMLA confirmed the main findings of the frequentist-based analysis and showed structural interactional maps and the probabilities of the different structural association types of the relevant SNPs especially in the hyperdiploid-ALL, involving additional SNPs in genes like TYMS, DHFR and GGH. We also investigated the statistical interactions and redundancies using structural model properties. These results gave further evidence that polymorphisms in the folate pathway could influence the ALL risk and the effectiveness of the therapy.

Maximum impedance sensitivity is achieved using a tapered microfluidic channel, which effectively routes electric fields across the cell membranes. The SMC is extracted by curve-fitting impedance spectra to an equivalent circuit model. From our measurement, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are found to exhibit larger SMC values in hypertonic solutions as compared with those in isotonic solutions.

Specifically, in a protein, the process of allostery refers to the transmission of a local perturbation, such as ligand binding, to a distant site. Decades after the discovery of this phenomenon, models built on static images of proteins are being reconsidered with the knowledge that protein dynamics plays an important role in its function. Molecular dynamics simulations are a valuable tool for studying complex biomolecular systems, providing an atomistic description of their structure and dynamics. Unfortunately, their predictive power has been limited by the complexity of the biomolecule free-energy surface and by the length of the allosteric timescale (in the order of milliseconds). In this work, we are able to probe the origins of the allosteric changes that transcription factor mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) causes to the interactions of KIX domain of CREB-binding protein (CBP) with phosphorylated kinase inducible domain (pKID), by combing all-atom molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling methods recently developed in our group.

Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often show marked, transient increases of circulating CLL cells following ibrutinib treatments, as seen with other inhibitors of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway. In a phase 1 study of ibrutinib, we noted similar effects in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Here, we characterize the patterns and phenotypes of cells mobilized among patients with MCL and further investigate the mechanism of this effect. Peripheral blood CD19(+)CD5(+) cells from MCL patients were found to have significant reduction in the expression of CXCR4, CD38, and Ki67 after 7 days of treatment. In addition, plasma chemokines such as CCL22, CCL4, and CXCL13 were reduced 40% to 60% after treatment. Mechanistically, ibrutinib inhibited BCR- and chemokine-mediated adhesion and chemotaxis of MCL cell lines and dose-dependently inhibited BCR, stromal cell, and CXCL12/CXCL13 stimulations of pBTK, pPLCgamma2, pERK, or pAKT. Importantly, ibrutinib inhibited migration of MCL cells beneath stromal cells in coculture.

We assess three combinations in induction and consolidation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Younger untreated patients with AML (median age, 49 years; range, 0 to 73 years) were randomly allocated to two induction courses of daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) with or without etoposide (ADE; n = 1983) or ADE versus fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin (FLAG-Ida; n = 1268), and to amsacrine, cytarabine, etoposide, and then mitoxantrone/cytarabine (MACE-MidAC) or high-dose cytarabine (n = 1,445) 3 g/m(2) or 1.5 g/m(2) (n = 657) in consolidation, and finally to a fifth course (cytarabine) or not (n = 227). RESULTS: Overall remission rates were similar for DA versus ADE (84% v 86%; P = .14) and ADE versus FLAG-Ida (86% v 85%; P = .7), with more course 1 remissions after FLAG-Ida (77%) reducing relapse (38% v 55%; P < .001) and improving relapse-free survival (45% v 34%; P = .01), overall and in subgroups, but with increased myelosuppression, reducing participation in the consolidation randomization. Overall outcomes were similar between MACE/MidAc and high-dose cytarabine (1.5/3.0 g/m(2)), but cytarabine required less supportive care. MACE/MidAc was superior for high-risk patients. A fifth course provided no benefit. The outcome for recipients of only two FLAG-Ida courses were not different from that with DA/ADE with consolidation. CONCLUSION: FLAG-Ida is an effective remission induction treatment, with a high complete remission rate after course 1 and reduced relapse. Consolidation with MACE/MidAc is similar overall to high-dose cytarabine, but superior in high-risk patients. Cytarabine at 1.5 g/m(2) is equivalent to a 3 g/m(2) dose. A fifth course is unnecessary. In patients receiving FLAG-Ida (two courses) and cytarabine (two courses), 8-year survival was 63% for patients with intermediate-risk and 95% for those with favorable-risk disease.",,"['Burnett, Alan K', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Hunter, Ann E', 'Kjeldsen, Lars', 'Yin, John', 'Gibson, Brenda E S', 'Wheatley, Keith', 'Milligan, Donald']","['Burnett AK', 'Russell NH', 'Hills RK', 'Hunter AE', 'Kjeldsen L', 'Yin J', 'Gibson BE', 'Wheatley K', 'Milligan D']","['Alan K.

RESULTS: iAMP21 was found in 158 (2%) of 7,793 patients with B-ALL age >/= 1 year; 74 (1.5%) of 5,057 standard-risk (SR) patients, and 84 (3.1%) of 2,736 high-risk (HR) patients. iAMP21 was associated with age >/= 10 years, WBC less than 50,000/muL, female sex, and detectable MRD at day 29. Four-year EFS and OS were significantly worse for patients with iAMP21 and SR B-ALL, but iAMP21 was not a statistically significant prognostic factor in HR patients. There was no interaction between MRD and iAMP21. Among SR patients, day 29 MRD >/= 0.01% and iAMP21 were associated with the poorest EFS and OS; absence of both was associated with the best outcome. CONCLUSION: iAMP21 is associated with inferior outcome in pediatric B-ALL, particularly SR patients who require more intensive therapy and are now treated on HR COG ALL protocols.",,"['Heerema, Nyla A', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Larsen, Eric C', 'Mattano, Leonard A Jr', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A']","['Heerema NA', 'Carroll AJ', 'Devidas M', 'Loh ML', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Larsen EC', 'Mattano LA Jr', 'Maloney KW', 'Willman CL', 'Wood BL', 'Winick NJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP', 'Raetz EA']","[""Nyla A.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report two cohorts of patients treated on Medical Research Council ALL97 or United Kingdom (UK) ALL2003. iAMP21 was identified retrospectively in ALL97 and was not used to guide therapy. However, in UKALL2003, iAMP21 was determined prospectively, and patients were allocated to the most intensive treatment arm (regimen C), which included augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster consolidation, escalating Capizzi maintenance, double delayed intensification, and an option for first remission transplantation. The presence of iAMP21 was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes specific for the RUNX1 gene. RESULTS: iAMP21 was identified in 2% of patients with B-cell precursor ALL treated on UKALL2003 and ALL97. The event-free survival, relapse, and overall survival rates at 5 years for iAMP21 patients treated on ALL97 and UKALL2003 were 29% and 78%, 70% and 16%, and 67% and 89%, respectively (all P < .01). Patients treated on ALL97 had an increased risk of relapse compared with patients treated on UKALL2003 (hazard ratio, 7.2; 95% CI, 2.91 to 17.87; P < .001). CONCLUSION: iAMP21 patients with ALL benefitted from receiving more intensive therapy in UKALL2003. In UKALL2011, they will continue to be treated as cytogenetic high risk, receive intensive chemotherapy (regimen C), and will only be recommended for transplantation if they do not achieve a complete remission by the end of induction therapy.

We identified retrospectively 16 patients with bone marrow involvement by BPDCN: 11 men and 5 women with a median age of 62.5 years (range, 19-86 years). Myelodysplastic changes were observed in five patients. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for CD4, CD123, TCL-1, and HLA-DR and were negative for CD3, CD8, CD13, CD19, CD34, and myeloperoxidase. Other antigens expressed by subsets of BPDCN cases included the following: CD56 (13/15; 81%), CD33 (7/10; 70%), CD7 (11/14; 69%), TdT (5/15; 33%), CD2 (5/11; 31%), CD117 (2/9; 22%), and CD5 (2/13; 15%). Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed chromosomal abnormalities in 6 of 13 (46%) cases analyzed, of which 3 cases had -13/13q-. Targeted next-generation sequencing performed on five BPDCN cases identified TET2 (ten eleven translocation 2) mutations and no other AML-associated mutations. In conclusion, BPDCN in the bone marrow has a characteristic immunoprofile (CD4+, CD56+, CD123+, and TCL-1+) and appears to be commonly associated with myelodysplastic features and a high frequency of TET2 mutations in the absence of other mutations commonly observed in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Alayed, Khaled', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'Singh, Rajesh R', 'Routbort, Mark J', 'Reddy, Neelima', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Zhang, Liping', 'Shaikh, Abdulaziz Al', 'Aladily, Tariq N', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Khoury, Joseph D']","['Alayed K', 'Patel KP', 'Konoplev S', 'Singh RR', 'Routbort MJ', 'Reddy N', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Zhang L', 'Shaikh AA', 'Aladily TN', 'Jain N', 'Luthra R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Khoury JD']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; Department of Pathology, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130930,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/ultrastructure', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/08/14 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/08/14 06:00'],"['2013/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23567 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Dec;88(12):1055-61. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23567.

This study was conducted to establish processes for collaborative data collection and provide clinical characteristics and outcome of children with ALL in SA. PROCEDURE: Clinical data for patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2008 were retrospectively collected at eight institutions and entered remotely into a custom-built database. Statistics regarding clinical and genetic characteristics and treatment outcome were calculated. RESULTS: The 594 evaluable patients had a median age of 4.37 years and 56.4% were boys. Majority of patients had B-precursor ALL while 10.7% had T-ALL. CNS leukemia was present in 5.2% of patients. The distribution of common genetic abnormalities was similar to that reported from western populations, with 24.6% hyperdiploidy, 21% RUNX1-ETV6 positivity, 4.2% BCR-ABL1 positivity, and 2.5% with MLL gene rearrangement. Patients received risk-adapted therapy according to various protocols, although treatment strategies for the majority were similar. Five-year OS, RFS and EFS were 86.9%, 79.1%, and 73.3%, respectively. The OS for patients with pre-B ALL was significantly higher than for T-ALL (88.0% vs. 71.8%; P = 0.019, Log-Rank test). Patients with pre-B ALL categorized as low-risk by NCI/Rome criteria and those with hyperdiploidy had OS of 93.4% and 95.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of childhood ALL in SA are similar to those observed in developed countries.

The discrepancy between SPMs in these studies could be attributed to geographical and ethnic heterogeneity. Thus, there is a clear need for another large-scale epidemiological study, particularly in Asian countries, to define the incidence and risk of SPMs in thyroid cancer survivors. DESIGN: A population-based study was conducted using the nation-wide database from Taiwan Cancer Registry between 1979 and 2006. METHODS: We quantified standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and cumulative incidence of SPMs among 19,068 individuals (4205 males and 14,863 females) with primary thyroid cancer. RESULTS: A total of 644 cases (3.38%) developed at least a SPM during 134,678 person-years of follow-up. The risk for subsequent SPMs was significantly greater than that of the general population (SIR=1.33, 95% CI 1.23-1.44). There was a greater risk of developing major salivary glands, nasopharyngeal, lung, thymus, breast (females), bladder, and brain cancers, and leukemia and lymphoma. We observed that the risk was highest within the first 5 years of diagnosis of thyroid cancer (SIR=5.29, 1.68, and 0.68 for </= 5, 5-10, and >10 respectively) and in the younger patients (SIR=1.81 vs 1.61 for <50 and >/= 50 respectively). The median overall survival for primary thyroid cancer patients was 23.28 years, but it was only 4.73 years for those who developed SPMs. CONCLUSION: Thyroid cancer is associated with a 33% risk increment of SPMs, which had a negative impact on survival. There are sites of SPMs in the Asian population that are distinctive from those in the Western population, suggesting that other genetic predisposition or environmental factors may play a role.",,"['Lu, Chang-Hsien', 'Lee, Kuan-Der', 'Chen, Ping-Tsung', 'Chen, Chih-Cheng', 'Kuan, Feng-Che', 'Huang, Cih-En', 'Chen, Miao-Fen', 'Chen, Min-Chi']","['Lu CH', 'Lee KD', 'Chen PT', 'Chen CC', 'Kuan FC', 'Huang CE', 'Chen MF', 'Chen MC']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, No. 6, Chia-Pu Road, Putz City, Chia-Yi, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131001,England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*pathology']",,,2013/08/14 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/08/14 06:00'],"['2013/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['EJE-13-0309 [pii]', '10.1530/EJE-13-0309 [doi]']",epublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2013 Oct 1;169(5):577-85. doi: 10.1530/EJE-13-0309.

It often presents with nonspecific symptoms similar to those of benign conditions, leading to delays in the diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment. Primary care physicians should have a raised index of suspicion and explore the possibility of cancer in children who have worrisome or persisting signs and symptoms. Red flag signs for leukemia or lymphoma include unexplained and protracted pallor, malaise, fever, anorexia, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hemorrhagic diathesis, and hepatosplenomegaly. New onset or persistent morning headaches associated with vomiting, neurologic symptoms, or back pain should raise concern for tumors of the central nervous system. Palpable masses in the abdomen or soft tissues, and persistent bone pain that awakens the child are red flags for abdominal, soft tissue, and bone tumors. Leukokoria is a red flag for retinoblastoma. Endocrine symptoms such as growth arrest, diabetes insipidus, and precocious or delayed puberty may be signs of endocranial or germ cell tumors. Paraneoplastic manifestations such as opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, rheumatic symptoms, or hypertension are rare and may be related to neuroblastoma, leukemia, or Wilms tumor, respectively.

METHODS: All patients <17 years, recorded in EPIMAD registry, and diagnosed between 1988 and 2004 with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) were included. The observed incidences of death and cancer were compared with those expected in the regional general population obtained by French Statistical Institute (INSEE) and the cancer Registry from Lille. Comparisons were performed using Fisher's exact test and were expressed using the standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and standardized incidence ratios. RESULTS: A total of 698 patients (538 with CD and 160 with UC) were identified; 360 (52%) were men, the median age at IBD diagnosis was 14 years (12-16) and the median follow-up time was 11.5 years (7-15). During follow-up, the mortality rate was 0.84% (6/698) and did not differ from that in the reference population (SMR=1.4 (0.5-3.0); P=0.27). After a median follow-up of 15 years (10-17), 1.3% of patients (9/698) had a cancer: colon (n=2), biliary tract (cholangiocarcinoma; n=1), uterine cervix (n=1), prepuce (n=1), skin (basal cell carcinoma (n=2), hematological (acute leukemia; n=1), and small bowel carcinoid (n=1).

The hyper reactivity of the B-cell receptor (BCR) to unknown antigen ligation plays a pivotal role in CLL-cell survival. We aimed to investigate the BCR signalling pathway using proteomics to identify novel proteins which may have clinical relevance in this disease. Three CLL samples were selected based upon BCR responsiveness, demonstrated by upregulation of phospho-ERK following in vitro stimulation. The differential expression of proteins, upon artificial stimulation of the BCR, was examined in these samples using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry. Proteins of interest were subsequently examined using immunoblotting. Proteomic analysis revealed that kininogen, a critical protein of kinin-kallikrein system, was upregulated in all 3 clinical samples upon BCR stimulation. There are 2 forms of kininogen: HMWK and LMWK. The upregulation of LMWK upon BCR stimulation was confirmed by immunoblotting in all 3 of these samples. In a pilot series of 52 unselected CLL samples, 71% demonstrated basal LMWK expression. There was a trend towards shorter median survival in LMWK positive cases (147months versus 253months for LMWK negative cases; p=0.125). Kininogen may be a novel therapeutic target in CLL and the possible association with prognosis warrants further investigation. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: We have identified the upregulation of LMWK upon BCR stimulation of CLL samples. There is no previous published research to suggest a link between kininogen and normal B-cells or CLL cells. In 52 unselected CLL samples, 71% demonstrated basal LMWK expression. There was a trend towards shorter median survival in LMWK positive cases. The absence of LMWK protein expression on normal B-cells suggests that this could be a biomarker for CLL and further research should be undertaken.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Kashuba, Elena', 'Eagle, Gina L', 'Bailey, James', 'Evans, Paul', 'Welham, Kevin J', 'Allsup, David', 'Cawkwell, Lynn']","['Kashuba E', 'Eagle GL', 'Bailey J', 'Evans P', 'Welham KJ', 'Allsup D', 'Cawkwell L']","['Cancer Biology Proteomics Group, Postgraduate Medical Institute of the University of Hull, UK; Hull York Medical School, Hull, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130811,Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kininogens/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'Kininogen', 'Proteomics']",2013/08/14 06:00,2014/10/13 06:00,['2013/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-3919(13)00440-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2013.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2013 Oct 8;91:478-85. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2013.08.002.

Approaches based on drug donations or adaptive pricing strategies yield promising but varying results across countries or programs, The Glivec International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP) is a program designed to provide imatinib free of charge to patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The objective of this work was to identify institutional factors associated with enrollment and patient survival in GIPAP. METHODS: We analyzed follow-up data from 4,946 patients participating in 47 institutions within 44 countries between 2003 and 2010. Active status in the program was considered as a proxy for survival. RESULTS: Presence of >/=1 hematologist or oncologist at the institution was associated with increased patient enrollment. After adjusting for individual factors such as age (>55 years: Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.42 [1.16; 1.73]; p = 0.001) and initial stage of disease (accelerated or blast crisis at diagnosis: HR = 4.16 [1.87; 9.25]; p < 10(-)(4)), increased survival was found in institutions with research capabilities (HR = 0.55 [0.35; 0.86]; p = 0.01) and those with enrollment of >5 patients/year into GIPAP (HR = 0.48 [0.35; 0.67]; p < 10(-)(4)), while a non-significant trend for decreased survival was found for treatment at a public institution (HR = 1.32 [0.95; 1.84]; p = 0.10). The negative impact of an accelerated form of CML was attenuated by the presence of >/=1 hematologist or oncologist at the institution (interaction term HR = 0.43 [0.18; 0.99]; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Application of these findings to the support and selection of institutions participating in GIPAP may help to optimize care and outcomes for CML and GIST patients in the developing world. These results may also be applicable to the treatment of patients with other forms of cancer, due to the overlap of infrastructure and staff resources used to treat a variety of cancer indications. A multi-sector approach is required to address these barriers.",,"['Tekinturhan, Ebru', 'Audureau, Etienne', 'Tavolacci, Marie-Pierre', 'Garcia-Gonzalez, Patricia', 'Ladner, Joel', 'Saba, Joseph']","['Tekinturhan E', 'Audureau E', 'Tavolacci MP', 'Garcia-Gonzalez P', 'Ladner J', 'Saba J']","['Axios International, 7, Boulevard de la Madeleine, Paris 75001, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130810,England,BMC Health Serv Res,BMC health services research,101088677,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*supply & distribution', 'Benzamides/*supply & distribution', '*Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Piperazines/*supply & distribution', 'Pyrimidines/*supply & distribution', '*Quality Improvement', 'Survival']",,,2013/08/14 06:00,2013/10/22 06:00,['2013/08/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6963-13-304 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6963-13-304 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Health Serv Res. 2013 Aug 10;13:304. doi: 10.1186/1472-6963-13-304.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",PMC3751648,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measurement of AMC was based on direct morphological enumeration, due to our findings that complete blood count data may yield incorrect monocytes enumeration values in CLL. The median AMC in patients with CLL was within normal limits, however the AMC range exceeded the values of healthy individuals. The AMC trichotomized patients into 3 distinct sub-groups with different characteristics and outcomes. High AMC patients were younger and had higher absolute lymphocytes count, while patients with low AMC had prominent immune dysregulation (lower serum IgA levels, susceptibility to infections and a tendency for positive direct anti-globulin test).

AML is the initial presentation in approximately one third of patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 17 year old male presented to the emergency room with history of high grade fever since two weeks. Examination revealed pallor, short stature and thumb polydactyly. There was no visceromegaly or lymphadenopathy. Complete blood count showed haemoglobin 3.4 gm/dl, MCV 100 fl and MCH 36 pg, white blood cell count 55.9 x 10 E9/L and platelet count 8 x 10E9/L. Peripheral blood smear revealed 26% blast cells. Bone marrow was hypercellular exhibiting infiltration with 21% blast cells. Auer rods were seen in few blast cells. These findings were consistent with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. These blasts cells expressed CD33, CD13, HLA-DR, CD117, CD34 antigens and cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase on immunophenotyping. Bone marrow cytogenetics revealed 46, XY, t (8:21) (q22; q22) [11] / 46, XY, add (2) (q37), t (8; 21) [4] / 46, XY [5]. Molecular studies showed positivity of FLT 3 D835 variant and negativity of NPM 1 and FLT3 ITD (internal tandem domain) mutation. Peripheral blood analysis for chromosomal breakage exhibited tri-radial and complex figures. He received induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin (3 + 7). Day 14 marrow revealed clearance of blast cells.

Methods have been evaluated for optimal DNA collection in studies of adults; however, DNA collection in young children poses additional challenges. Here, we have evaluated predictors of DNA quantity in buccal cells collected for population-based studies of infant leukemia (N = 489 mothers and 392 children) and hepatoblastoma (HB; N = 446 mothers and 412 children) conducted through the Children's Oncology Group. DNA samples were collected by mail using mouthwash (for mothers and some children) and buccal brush (for children) collection kits and quantified using quantitative real-time PCR. Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify predictors of DNA yield. RESULTS: Median DNA yield was higher for mothers in both studies compared with their children (14 mug vs. <1 mug). Significant predictors of DNA yield in children included case-control status (beta = -0.69, 50% reduction, P = 0.01 for case vs. control children), brush collection type, and season of sample collection. Demographic factors were not strong predictors of DNA yield in mothers or children in this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The association with seasonality suggests that conditions during transport may influence DNA yield. The low yields observed in most children in these studies highlight the importance of developing alternative methods for DNA collection in younger age groups.",,"['Poynter, Jenny N', 'Ross, Julie A', 'Hooten, Anthony J', 'Langer, Erica', 'Blommer, Crystal', 'Spector, Logan G']","['Poynter JN', 'Ross JA', 'Hooten AJ', 'Langer E', 'Blommer C', 'Spector LG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130812,England,BMC Genet,BMC genetics,100966978,IM,"['Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mothers', '*Mouth Mucosa', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Specimen Handling']",,,2013/08/14 06:00,2014/10/10 06:00,['2013/08/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2156-14-69 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2156-14-69 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genet. 2013 Aug 12;14:69. doi: 10.1186/1471-2156-14-69.,,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],PMC3751424,,"['K05 CA157439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA079940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K05 157439/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency and outcome of graft versus host disease after stem cell transplantation for various haematological disorders in Pakistan. Materials and Methods. Pretransplant workup of the patient and donor was performed. Mobilization was done with G-CSF 300 mu g twice daily for five day. Standard GvHD prophylaxis was done with methotrexate 15 mg/m(2) on day +1 followed by 10 mg/m(2) on days +3 and +6 and cyclosporine. Grading was done according to the Glucksberg classification. Results. A total of 153 transplants were done from April 2004 to December 2011. Out of these were allogeneic transplants. There were females and males. The overall frequency of any degree of graft versus host disease was 34%. Acute GvHD was present in patients while had chronic GvHD. Grade II GvHD was present in patients while grade III and IV GvHD was seen in patients each. Acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia were most commonly associated with GvHD. The mortality in acute and chronic GvHD was 8.8% and 12% respectively. Conclusion. The frequency of graft versus host disease in this study was 34% which is lower compared to international literature. The decreased incidence can be attributed to reduced diversity of histocompatibility antigens in our population.,,"['Ali, Natasha', 'Adil, Salman Naseem', 'Shaikh, Mohammad Usman', 'Masood, Nehal']","['Ali N', 'Adil SN', 'Shaikh MU', 'Masood N']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, The Aga Khan University and Hospital, P.O.

The asparaginase activity measured in serum reflects the effectiveness of the drug. However, the wide inter-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics of asparaginase suggests that the serum activity should be closely monitored in patients during therapy. In order to identify patients with low asparaginase exposure during treatment, a fast, sensitive, and high-throughput assay is required for measuring asparaginase activity in patient sera. In this study, asparaginase activity was determined by monitoring the enzymatically-coupled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD(+) in a 96-well format. The rate of disappearance of NADH (DeltamOD/minute) was directly proportional to the activity of asparaginase, and the linear range of the assay was established from 0.025 to 2.2 IU/mL (R(2) = 0.998) with a reportable range that was extended to 4.0 IU/mL by dilution with serum albumin. Inter-assay precision was established (low control CV% = 8.8, high control CV% = 9.0), as was intra-assay precision (low control CV% = 3.3, high control CV% = 2.7). The method is high-throughput and provides a broader linear range of detection compared to previously described assays.

The latter include a recently identified regulatory phosphorylation of the GM-CSF/IL-3 betac receptor contributing to survival of acute myeloid leukaemia cells. Previous studies suggested differences in the protein kinase activity of the 4 isoforms of class-I PI 3-kinase so we compared the ability of all class-I PI 3-kinases and 2 common oncogenic mutants to autophosphorylate, and to phosphorylate an intracellular fragment of the GM-CSF/IL-3 betac receptor (betaic). We find p110alpha, p110beta and p110gamma all phosphorylate betaic but p110delta is much less effective. The two most common oncogenic mutants of p110alpha, H1047R and E545K have stronger protein kinase activity than wildtype p110alpha, both in terms of autophosphorylation and towards betaic. Importantly, the lipid kinase activity of the oncogenic mutants is still inhibited by autophosphorylation to a similar extent as wildtype p110alpha. Previous evidence indicates the protein kinase activity of p110alpha is Mn(2+) dependent, casting doubt over its role in vivo. However, we show that the oncogenic mutants of p110alpha plus p110beta and p110gamma all display significant activity in the presence of Mg(2+). Furthermore we demonstrate that some small molecule inhibitors of p110alpha lipid kinase activity (PIK-75 and A66) are equally effective against the protein kinase activity, but other inhibitors (e.g. wortmannin and TGX221) show different patterns of inhibition against the lipid and protein kinases activities. These findings have implications for the function of PI 3-kinase, especially in tumours carrying p110alpha mutations.",,"['Buchanan, Christina M', 'Dickson, James M J', 'Lee, Woo-Jeong', 'Guthridge, Mark A', 'Kendall, Jackie D', 'Shepherd, Peter R']","['Buchanan CM', 'Dickson JM', 'Lee WJ', 'Guthridge MA', 'Kendall JD', 'Shepherd PR']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130801,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cations, Divalent/metabolism', 'Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Sf9 Cells', 'Spodoptera', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics']",,,2013/08/13 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/08/13 06:00'],"['2013/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0071337 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-21149 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 1;8(8):e71337. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0071337.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target BCR/ABL, such as imatinib, have improved treatment of Ph(+)ALL and are generally incorporated into induction regimens. This approach has improved clinical responses, but molecular remissions are seen in less than 50% of patients leaving few treatment options in the event of relapse. Thus, identification of additional targets for therapeutic intervention has potential to improve outcomes for Ph+ALL. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2) is expressed in ~30% of B-ALLs, and numerous small molecule inhibitors are available to prevent its activation. We analyzed a cohort of 129 ALL patient samples using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) with ErbB2 and phospho-ErbB2 antibodies and found that activity of ErbB2 was elevated in 56% of Ph(+)ALL as compared to just 4.8% of Ph(-)ALL. In two human Ph+ALL cell lines, inhibition of ErbB kinase activity with canertinib resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of an ErbB kinase signaling target p70S6-kinase T389 (by 60% in Z119 and 39% in Z181 cells at 3 microM). Downstream, phosphorylation of S6-kinase was also diminished in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (by 91% in both cell lines at 3 microM). Canertinib treatment increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim by as much as 144% in Z119 cells and 49% in Z181 cells, and further produced caspase-3 activation and consequent apoptotic cell death. Both canertinib and the FDA-approved ErbB1/2-directed TKI lapatinib abrogated proliferation and increased sensitivity to BCR/ABL-directed TKIs at clinically relevant doses. Our results suggest that ErbB signaling is an additional molecular target in Ph(+)ALL and encourage the development of clinical strategies combining ErbB and BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors for this subset of ALL patients.",,"['Irwin, Mary E', 'Nelson, Laura D', ""Santiago-O'Farrill, Janice M"", 'Knouse, Phillip D', 'Miller, Claudia P', 'Palla, Shana L', 'Siwak, Doris R', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Li, Shulin', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Hughes, Dennis P', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Irwin ME', 'Nelson LD', ""Santiago-O'Farrill JM"", 'Knouse PD', 'Miller CP', 'Palla SL', 'Siwak DR', 'Mills GB', 'Estrov Z', 'Li S', 'Kornblau SM', 'Hughes DP', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130801,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Philadelphia Chromosome/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/08/13 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/08/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0070608 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-14008 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Aug 1;8(8):e70608. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0070608.

We then evaluated proliferation/survival in these cells using MTT, (3)H-thymidine uptake and Annexin-V apoptosis assays. We also measured expression levels of downstream molecules involved in B-cell proliferation/survival signaling including STAT1, NFATC2, c-Fos, c-Myc, and Bcl-2 using microarray, PCR, western blotting analyses, and a stromal cell culture system. CLL cells with CTLA4 down-regulation demonstrated a significant increase in proliferation and survival along with an increased expression of STAT1, STAT1 phosphorylation, NFATC2, c-Fos phosphorylation, c-Myc, Ki-67 and Bcl-2 molecules. In addition, compared to controls, the CTLA4-downregulated CLL cells showed a decreased frequency of apoptosis, which also correlated with increased expression of Bcl-2. Interestingly, CLL cells from lymph node and CLL cells co-cultured on stroma expressed lower levels of CTLA4 and higher levels of c-Fos, c-Myc, and Bcl-2 compared to CLL control cells.

In ALL-IC-BFM 2002 study, we employed a standardized method of flow cytometry MRD monitoring for multiple centers internationally using uniformed gating, and determined the relevant MRD-based risk stratification strategies in our local patient cohort. We also evaluated a novel method of PCR MRD quantitation using peripheral blood plasma. For the bone marrow flow MRD study, patients could be stratified into 3 risk groups according to MRD level using a single time-point at day-15 (Model I) (I-A: <0.1%, I-B: 0.1-10%, I-C: >10%), or using two time-points at day-15 and day-33 (Model II) (II-A: day-15<10% and day-33<0.01%, II-B: day-15 >/= 10% or day-33 >/= 0.01% but not both, II-C: day-15 >/= 10% and day-33 >/= 0.01%), which showed significantly superior prediction of relapse (p = .00047 and <0.0001 respectively). Importantly, patients with good outcome (frequency: 56.0%, event-free survival: 90.1%) could be more accurately predicted by Model II. In peripheral blood plasma PCR MRD investigation, patients with day-15-MRD >/= 10(-4) were at a significantly higher risk of relapse (p = 0.0117). By multivariate analysis, MRD results from both methods could independently predict patients' prognosis, with 20-35-fold increase in risk of relapse for flow MRD I-C and II-C respectively, and 5.8-fold for patients having plasma MRD of >/= 10(-4). We confirmed that MRD detection by flow cytometry is useful for prognostic evaluation in our Chinese cohort of childhood ALL after treatment.

Interestingly, depletion of MCAF1 in fibroblasts induced premature senescence that was characterized by cell cycle arrest, SA-beta-gal activity, and senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) formation. Under this condition, core histones and the linker histone H1 significantly decreased at both mRNA and protein levels, resulting in reduced nucleosome formation. Consistently, in activated Ras-induced senescent fibroblasts, the accumulation of MCAF1 in PML bodies was enhanced via the binding of this protein to SUMO molecules, suggesting that sequestration of MCAF1 to PML bodies promotes cellular senescence.

The present study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity of a panel of 280 Korean medicinal plants belonging to 73 families and 198 species against human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. Selected phytochemicals were investigated in more detail for their mode of action. Methods. The resazurin assay was used to determine cytotoxicity of the plant extracts. Microarray-based mRNA expression profiling, COMPARE, and hierarchical cluster analyses were applied to identify which genes correlate with sensitivity or resistance to selected phytochemicals of the Korean plants. Results. The results of the resazurin assay showed that cytotoxicity extracts tested at 10 mu g/mL from 13 samples inhibited proliferation more than 50% (IC50 < 10 mu g/mL) and the most active plants are Sedum middendorffianum (15.33%) and Lycoris radiata (17.61%). Out of 13 selected phytochemicals from these plants, hopeaphenol and deoxynarciclasine were the most cytotoxic ones. Genes from various functional groups (transcriptional or translational regulation, signal transduction, cellular proliferation, intracellular trafficking, RNA metabolism, endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum function, etc.) were significantly correlated with response of tumor cell lines to these two compounds.

Current targeted therapies designed to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein have made a significant breakthrough in the treatment of CML patients. However, CML remains a chronic disease that a patient must manage for life. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy has completely transformed the prognosis of CML, it has made the therapeutic management more complex. The interruption of TKI treatment results in early disease progression because it does not eliminate quiescent CML stem cells which remain a potential reservoir for disease relapse. This highlights the need to develop new therapeutic strategies for CML to achieve a permanent cure, and to allow TKI interruption. This review summarizes recent research done on alternative targeted therapies with a particular focus on some important signaling pathways (such as Alox5, Hedgehog, Wnt/b-catenin, autophagy, and PML) that have the potential to target CML stem cells and potentially provide cure for CML.",,"['Hamad, Ahmad', 'Sahli, Zeyad', 'El Sabban, Maya', 'Mouteirik, Maha', 'Nasr, Rihab']","['Hamad A', 'Sahli Z', 'El Sabban M', 'Mouteirik M', 'Nasr R']","['Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut 1107 2020, Lebanon.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130709,United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,,,2013/08/13 06:00,2013/08/13 06:01,['2013/08/13 06:00'],"['2013/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2013/724360 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Int. 2013;2013:724360. doi: 10.1155/2013/724360.

Here, we used the recombinant adenoviruses assay to introduce BMP9 into C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells to elucidate the role of CXCL12/CXCR4 signal axis during BMP9-incuced osteogenic differentiation. The results showed that CXCL12 and CXCR4 expressions were down-regulated at the stage of BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation, in a dose- and time-dependent. Pretreatment of C3H10T1/2 cells with CXCL12/CXCR4 could significantly affect the early and mid osteogenic markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN), the transcription factors of Runx2, Osx, Plzf and Dlx5 expression, through activating the Smad, MAPK signaling pathway.

The World Health Organization classifies it as a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and patients typically present with anemia, hepatosplenomegaly and diffuse lymphadenopathies. Historically, the genetic characterization of the disease has been hampered by the relatively low proliferative rate of WM cells, thus making karyotyping challenging. The use of novel technologies such as fluorescence in situ hybridization, gene array, and whole genome sequencing has contributed greatly to establishing candidate genes in the pathophysiology of WM and to identifying potential treatment targets, such as L265P MYD88. The discovery of microRNAs and the recognition of epigenetics as a major modulatory mechanism of oncogene expression and/or oncosuppressor silencing have aided in further understanding the pathogenesis of WM. Once thought to closely resemble multiple myeloma, a cancer of terminally differentiated, immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells, WM appears to genetically cluster with other indolent B-cell lymphomas such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphoma. The relative high incidence of familial cases of WM and other B-cell malignancies has been helpful in identifying high-risk gene candidates.

The potential influence of environmental and behavioral factors remains poorly understood. Early population-based and case-control studies suggested that higher serum levels of IGF1 could be associated with increased cancer risk. Since GH therapy increases IGF1 levels, concern has been raised regarding its potential role as a cancer initiation factor. Experimental evidence and some clinical studies showed that when GH/IGF1 secretion or action was inhibited, a decreased incidence and rate of progression of cancers occurred. However, human populations comprise a garden variety of genotypes that respond differently to the same kind of exposures. Human population studies frequently reveal only very small effects to these exposures. So, are GH and cancer guilty by association? After more than 20 years, leukemia, a major safety issue initially believed associated with GH treatment in children with GH deficiency (GHD), has not been confirmed but the risk of second malignancies in patients previously treated with irradiation has been detected or confirmed through the National Cooperative Growth Study. Overall, this large study confirmed the favorable overall safety profile of GH therapy in children with GHD, and also highlighted specific populations at potential risk. The risk of secondary malignancy following radiotherapy is surely related to radiotherapy more than GH therapy that may increase growth but is less likely to start the oncogenic process. In GH-deficient adults treated with GH, observational studies (KIMS, HypoCCS) have shown that when IGF1 levels were targeted within normal age-related reference ranges, the occurrence of malignancies was not higher than in the general population.",,"['Pekic, Sandra', 'Popovic, Vera']","['Pekic S', 'Popovic V']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade and Clinic for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, University Clinical Center Belgrade, <br/>Dr Subotica 13, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20131001,England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,IM,"['Acromegaly/complications', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Human Growth Hormone/*adverse effects/deficiency/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypopituitarism/*complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/deficiency/physiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Obesity/complications/prevention & control', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Somatomedins/physiology']",,,2013/08/13 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/08/13 06:00'],"['2013/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['EJE-13-0389 [pii]', '10.1530/EJE-13-0389 [doi]']",epublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2013 Oct 1;169(5):R89-97. doi: 10.1530/EJE-13-0389.

In fact, extrapolation of the survival curves may suggest that life expectancy of patients who achieve and maintain predetermined milestones may not differ from that of the age-matched healthy adults. The main reasons for such success are the presence of a well-defined molecular target, the BCR-ABL oncogene, necessary and sufficient for the initiation and propagation of CML, and the powerful and selective agents that inhibit it. Five U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), each with unique activities and toxicity profiles, allow for individualized patient care. Despite the remarkable responses of most patients, a small but significant fraction of patients develops clinical resistance to the TKIs, some of which is attributed to the BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations affecting TKI binding and activity. The recently approved third-generation TKI ponatinib showed remarkable activity in the patients with multi-TKI-resistant disease. Particularly impressive was its efficacy in patients with T315I mutation that is resistant to all other TKIs. In lieu of the current emphasis on achieving earlier and more profound responses and excellent activity of ponatinib in the refractory setting, its optimal position among the available armamentarium of agents is being established.",,"['Frankfurt, Olga', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['Frankfurt O', 'Licht JD']","[""Authors' Affiliation: Robert H.

Most cases of myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome are characterized by additional cytogenetic changes besides the constitutional trisomy 21, but their potential prognostic impact is not known. We, therefore, conducted an international retrospective study of clinical characteristics, cytogenetics, treatment, and outcome of 451 children with myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome. All karyotypes were centrally reviewed before assigning patients to subgroups. The overall 7-year event-free survival for the entire cohort was 78% (+/- 2%), with the overall survival rate being 79% (+/- 2%), the cumulative incidence of relapse 12% (+/- 2%), and the cumulative incidence of toxic death 7% (+/- 1%). Outcome estimates showed large differences across the different cytogenetic subgroups. Based on the cumulative incidence of relapse, we could risk-stratify patients into two groups: cases with a normal karyotype (n=103) with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (21%+/- 4%) than cases with an aberrant karyotype (n=255) with a cumulative incidence of relapse of 9% (+/- 2%) (P=0.004). Multivariate analyses revealed that white blood cell count >/= 20 x 10(9)/L and age >3 years were independent predictors for poor event-free survival, while normal karyotype independently predicted inferior overall survival, event-free survival, and relapse-free survival.

Arsenic trioxide was suggested to decrease CML LIC. We investigated the effects of arsenic and IFN on human CML cell lines or primary cells and the bone marrow retroviral transduction/transplantation murine CML model. In vitro, the combination of arsenic and IFN inhibited proliferation and activated apoptosis. Importantly, arsenic and IFN synergistically reduced the clonogenic activity of primary bone marrow cells derived from CML patients. Finally, in vivo, combined interferon and arsenic treatment, but not single agents, prolonged the survival of primary CML mice. Importantly, the combination severely impaired engraftment into untreated secondary recipients, with some recipients never developing the disease, demonstrating a dramatic decrease in CML LIC activity.

A potent derivative of indirubin, indirubin-3'-oxime 2,3-dihydroxypropyl ether (E804), has been shown to block the Src-Stat3 and Src-Stat5 signaling pathway in human cancer cells, inducing apoptosis. The anticancer effects of E804, however, cannot be easily examined in vivo because of its poor water solubility and low absorption. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) containing E804 for enhancing its solubility and bioavailability. Solubility of E804 was determined in various vehicles, and pseudoternary phase diagram was used to evaluate the self-emulsifying existence area. The SNEDDS composed of Capmul MCM (oil), Solutol HS 15 (surfactant), and polyethylene glycol 400 (cosurfactant) on the ratio of 20.5:62.5:16 loaded 1.5% of E804. The particle size of droplets was found to be 16.8 and 140 nm, and SNEDDS was stable after freeze-thaw cycles and upon dilution in HCl 0.1 N and pH 7.4 HBSS++. The ability of formulation for absorption enhancement was studied in rats in vivo after oral administration. The results showed that the developed SNEDDS increased the E804 bioavailability 984.23% compared with the aqueous suspension.

It is found that OA significantly inhibited the growth of myeloid leukemia cell lines and as xenografts in immunodeficient mice and primary blasts from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Furthermore, OA-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation were observed in OA-treated AML cell lines. OA-induced increase of CD11b/CD14 expression was reversed by GW9662, a specific PPARgamma inhibitor, or transient transfection with PPARgamma siRNA. Docking study showed OA bound to ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma via forming hydrogen bonds with Arg288 and Leu340 sites. Results of fluorescence polarization-based ligand assay verified PPARgamma-binding activity of OA, and in OA-treated cells, intranuclear accumulation and increased binding activity of PPARgamma to PPRE were detected. We also found that GW9662 attenuated OA-induced upregulation of C/EBPbeta, an important regulator of leukemic differentiation, and p21, which is a potent inhibitor of CDKs that can inhibit phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes. Moreover, our results showed that OA displayed synergistic effects with all-trans retinoic acid and VD3 in part related to reduction of intranuclear phosphorylated RXRalpha that has been reported to block nuclear receptor/RXRalpha heterodimer transcriptional activity. This reduction of phosphorylated RXRalpha was associated with inhibition of the specific upstream MAP kinase ERK1/2.

Lentiviral transduction of Bcr-Abl into either Ba/F3 or CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells potently increased levels of AURKA and AURKB in association with phosphorylation of AKT and stimulated their proliferation. Bcr-Abl-mediated expression of AURKA and AURKB were decreased in CD34(+) HSPCs when AKT was inactivated by an shRNA against AKT, suggesting that Bcr-Abl induced expression of AURKA and AURKB via AKT signaling. MLN8237, an inhibitor of AURKA, significantly inhibited the proliferation of freshly isolated CD34(+) CML cells in a dose-dependent manner as measured by colony forming assay. Importantly, inhibition of AURKA in CD34(+) leukemia cells freshly isolated from individuals with blast crisis of CML with Bcr-Abl T315I mutant (n = 2) by MLN8237 significantly impaired the engraftment of these cells in severely immunocompromised mice and decreased the weight of spleens.

Replacement of lysine by alanine in the catalytic subunit yields the inactive (K851A)JAK3 mutant that underlies severe combined immune deficiency. The gain-of-function mutation (A572V)JAK3 is found in acute megakaryoplastic leukemia and T cell lymphoma. The excessive nutrient demand of tumor cells requires upregulation of transporters in the cell membrane including peptide transporters PEPT1 and PEPT2. The carriers further accomplish intestinal peptide transport. Little is known about signaling regulating peptide transport. The present study explored whether PEPT1 and PEPT2 are upregulated by JAK3. PEPT1 or PEPT2 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes with or without additional expression of JAK3, and electrogenic peptide (glycine-glycine) transport was determined by dual-electrode voltage clamp. PEPT2-HA membrane protein abundance was analyzed by chemiluminescence. Intestinal electrogenic peptide transport was estimated from peptide-induced current in Ussing chamber experiments. In PEPT1- and PEPT2-expressing oocytes, but not in water-injected oocytes, the dipeptide gly-gly generated an inward current, which was significantly increased following coexpression of JAK3. The effect of JAK3 on PEPT1 was mimicked by (A568V)JAK3 but not by (K851A)JAK3. JAK3 increased maximal peptide-induced current in PEPT1-expressing oocytes but rather decreased apparent affinity of the carrier. Coexpression of JAK3 enhanced the PEPT2-HA protein abundance in the cell membrane. In JAK3- and PEPT1-expressing oocytes, peptide-induced current was blunted by the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P154, 4-[(3'-bromo-4'-hydroxyphenyl)amino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (22 muM). In intestinal segments gly-gly generated a current which was significantly smaller in JAK3-deficient mice (jak3(-)/(-)) than in wild-type mice (jak3(+)/(+)).

METHODS: Here, crocin effects on human T-cell leukemia cell line, MOLT-4, were evaluated. In this study, we examined the effects of 24 and 48 h of crocin treatment (50, 250 and 500 microM) on the viability of MOLT-4 cell line. Moreover, probable apoptotic/necrotic outcomes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production variations along with crocin treatment consequences on DNA, were investigated. RESULTS: Results from MTT assay demonstrated that 48-h crocin treatment at 500 microM, significantly reduced cell viability (p<0.01). DNA fragmentation was recorded to be significantly increased at higher doses of crocin following 24 and 48 h (p<0.01). According to our results, while apoptosis was detected at all concentrations, necrosis detected at the highest dose, only. In comparison with control, ROS production was reduced at 50 and 250 microM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with gallbladder malignancies and nine patients with benign gallbladder pathology were included in this study. In one of the patients with a malignancy, a lesion was determined on the porcelain gallbladder; in another patient, acute myeloblastic leukemia had infiltrated the gallbladder, causing the diffuse wall thickening. Five subjects had a primary malignant gallbladder. The view of the bladder wall was evaluated visually in increasing b values. Apparent diffusion coefficient measurements were obtained from at least three sites of the bladder wall in each patient, and the results of the measurements were analyzed after comparing the malignant and benign groups. In the malignant group, the results of the radiological outcomes were compared with histological examinations. In the benign group, cholecystitis was diagnosed by observing normalization of the bladder wall thickening via surgery or medical treatment. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in apparent diffusion coefficient levels between the malignant group, which caused diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall, and the benign group (Student t test, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: According to this preliminary study, observation of distinct brightness of the gallbladder wall in diffusion-weighted examination with a high b value is a significant finding in terms of diffuse gallbladder malignancy.

The repair of the radiation damage, as observed 72 h after irradiation, was more rapid in the group exposed solely to irradiation and in the group treated with KU55933 (80 and 77 % of cells, respectively, were free of DSBs), whereas in the group incubated with 10 muM VE-821, there were only 61 % of cells free of DSBs. The inhibition of kinase ATR with its specific inhibitor VE-821 resulted in a more pronounced radiosensitizing effect in HL-60 cells as compared to the inhibition of kinase ATM with the inhibitor KU55933. In contrast to KU55933, the VE-821 treatment prevented HL-60 cells from undergoing G2 cell cycle arrest.

HBx has a close relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma, however, the role of HBx in hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) is poorly understood. In this study, we sought to determine the role of HBx in regulating HPCs apoptosis and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) using HPCs derived from mouse fetal liver. The apoptotic ratio of HPCs infected with adenovirus-expressing HBx (Ad-HBx) was examined using flow cytometry. Results showed that the Ad-HBx treatment led to substantially decreased apoptotic ratio of HPCs, as confirmed by the Hoechst 33342 staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL). Possible alterations of relative proteins were examined using Western blot and real-time PCR assays. The HBx expression in HPCs increased the expression levels of Bcl2 and Mcl1 while decreasing the expression levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-9 and -3. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression levels of beta-catenin were both increased. The beta-catenin protein were mainly accumulated in cytoplasm and tended to transfer into cell nucleus after Ad-HBx treatment. The over-expression of beta-catenin decreased the apoptotic ratio of HPCs and inhibited the expression of cleaved caspase-9 and -3 while blocking beta-catenin expression resulted in the opposite results. Taken together, our results strongly suggested that the HBx protein may inhibits apoptosis of hepatic progenitor cells, at least in part by activating the WNT/beta-catenin pathway.

However, several types of tumor cells express telomerase in very high levels to overcome this crisis and achieve the ability to proliferate endlessly. The telomerase inhibitors can partly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and promote apoptosis, but their roles are only limited. Tankyrase is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase which has synergistic effect on telomerase, and is expressed in lung cancer cells in high levels. In the present study, antisense oligonucleotides of telomerase (ashTERT) and tankyrase (asTANKS) were used as specific inhibitors to silence the expression of target genes in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells by transfection. The results showed that ashTERT and asTANKS suppressed the expression of telomerase and tankyrase significantly; both inhibited the activity of telomerase and the combination group achieved better effect, but only ashTERT shortened the length of telomeres, asTANKS did not. Further studies showed that ashTERT and asTANKS-promoted A549 apoptosis was not mediated by downregulation of the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 or upregulation of the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BAX, but by adjusting the two isoforms proportion of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) which can interact with tankyrase directly. MCL-1short (MCL-1S), a pro-apoptotic gene, increased more than MCL-1Long (MCL-1L) which is an anti-apoptotic gene, leading to A549 cell apoptosis and a similar result was obtained in nude mice in vivo.

Here we report that loss of WRN function elicits accumulation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP protein), a major effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, both experimentally and in WS-derived fibroblasts. YAP upregulation correlates with slower cell proliferation and accelerated senescence, which are partially mediated by the formation of a complex between YAP and the PML protein, whose activity promotes p53 activation. The ATM kinase is necessary for YAP and PML accumulation in WRN-depleted cells. Notably, the depletion of either YAP or PML partially impairs the induction of senescence following WRN loss. Altogether, our findings reveal that loss of WRN activity triggers the activation of an ATM-YAP-PML-p53 axis, thereby accelerating cellular senescence. The latter has features of SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype), whose protumorigenic properties are potentiated by YAP, PML and p53 depletion.",,"['Fausti, F', 'Di Agostino, S', 'Cioce, M', 'Bielli, P', 'Sette, C', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Oren, M', 'Sudol, M', 'Strano, S', 'Blandino, G']","['Fausti F', 'Di Agostino S', 'Cioce M', 'Bielli P', 'Sette C', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Oren M', 'Sudol M', 'Strano S', 'Blandino G']","['Molecular Chemoprevention Group, Molecular Medicine Area, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130809,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/deficiency/*metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RecQ Helicases/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Werner Syndrome Helicase', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,,2013/08/13 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2013/08/13 06:00'],"['2013/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2013101 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2013.101 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2013 Nov;20(11):1498-509. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.101.

We re-evaluated 85 AML patients receiving RIC allo-HCT in CR to test if a strict definition of CR had direct implications for the outcome. These patients had leukemia immunophenotype documented at diagnosis and analyzed at allo-HCT. Eight (9.4%) had persistent leukemia by flow cytometric criteria at allo-HCT.

AlloSCT is associated with a beneficial GVL response mediated by donor T cells. However, GVHD results in substantial mortality and long-term morbidity. T-cell depletion (TCD) of the graft reduces the severity of GVHD, but is associated with an increased relapse rate after alloSCT. Therefore, early sequential donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is likely to be necessary for a successful GVL reaction. Twenty-five adult ALL patients (10 Ph(+)ALL) were eligible for early DLI after initial disease control with myeloablative TCD-alloSCT in first CR (CR1), if active GVHD was absent at 3-6 months after alloSCT. Patients with a sibling donor or an unrelated donor were scheduled for 3.0 x 10(6) CD3(+) cells/kg or 1.5 x 10(6) CD3(+) cells/kg, respectively, at 6 months after alloSCT. Three patients died before evaluation (one early relapse). Five patients had active GVHD. Fourteen of the remaining seventeen patients received DLI (median time-to-DLI: 185 days). Overall, only 17% required long-term systemic immunosuppression for GVHD. With a median follow-up after TCD-alloSCT of 50 months, 2-year survival probability was 68% (95% confidence interval (CI) 49-87%).

Using serum deprivation from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and IL-3 withdrawal from promyeloid 32D cells, we showed that pro-survival signaling by activated RAF but not AKT prevented the decline in Mcl-1 following GF abrogation. GF starvation increased levels of Bim in both model systems, which was prevented by RAF in 32D cells but not in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. RAF and AKT suppressed activation and mitochondrial translocation of BAX. Also, antioxidant treatment efficiently prevented BAX activation and death of 32D cells but showed little effect on its mitochondrial translocation.

STUDY DESIGN: Using genome-wide expression profiling and deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing, we compared pelvic and matched extrapelvic implants from 30 patients with advanced-stage OVCA for expression of molecular signaling pathways and p53 gene mutations. Differentially expressed pathways were further evaluated in a series of primary or early-stage vs metastatic or recurrent cancer samples from 389 ovarian, prostate, and oral cancer patients. Metastasis pathways were also evaluated for associations with survival in 9 independent clinicogenomic datasets from 1691 ovarian, breast, colon, brain, and lung cancer and leukemia patients. The inhibitory effects of 1 pathway (transforming growth factor [TGF]-WNT) on in vitro OVCA cell migration were studied. RESULTS: Pelvic and extrapelvic OVCA implants demonstrated similar patterns of signaling pathway expression and identical p53 mutations. However, we identified 3 molecular pathways/cellular processes that were differentially expressed between pelvic and extrapelvic OVCA samples and between primary/early-stage and metastatic/advanced or recurrent ovarian, oral, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, their expression was associated with overall survival from ovarian cancer (P = .006), colon cancer (1 pathway at P = .005), and leukemia (P = .05). Artesunate-induced TGF-WNT pathway inhibition impaired OVCA cell migration. CONCLUSION: Advanced-stage OVCA has a unifocal origin in the pelvis. Molecular pathways associated with extrapelvic OVCA spread are also associated with metastasis from other human cancers and with overall patient survival. Such pathways represent appealing therapeutic targets for patients with metastatic disease.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Mosby, Inc.

Four major forms of MEN, which are autosomal dominant disorders, are recognized and referred to as: MEN type 1 (MEN1), due to menin mutations; MEN2 (previously MEN2A) due to mutations of a tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the rearranged during transfection (RET) protoncogene; MEN3 (previously MEN2B) due to RET mutations; and MEN4 due to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDNK1B) mutations. Each MEN type is associated with the occurrence of specific tumors. Thus, MEN1 is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic islet and anterior pituitary tumors; MEN2 is characterized by the occurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in association with phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid tumors; MEN3 is characterized by the occurrence of MTC and phaeochromocytoma in association with a marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, medullated corneal fibers and intestinal autonomic ganglion dysfunction, leading to megacolon; and MEN4, which is also referred to as MENX, is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid and anterior pituitary tumors in possible association with tumors of the adrenals, kidneys, and reproductive organs. This review will focus on the clinical and molecular details of the MEN1 and MEN4 syndromes. The gene causing MEN1 is located on chromosome 11q13, and encodes a 610 amino-acid protein, menin, which has functions in cell division, genome stability, and transcription regulation. Menin, which acts as scaffold protein, may increase or decrease gene expression by epigenetic regulation of gene expression via histone methylation. Thus, menin by forming a subunit of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) complexes that trimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), facilitates activation of transcriptional activity in target genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors; and by interacting with the suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog family protein (SUV39H1) to mediate H3K methylation, thereby silencing transcriptional activity of target genes. MEN1-associated tumors harbor germline and somatic mutations, consistent with Knudson's two-hit hypothesis. Genetic diagnosis to identify individuals with germline MEN1 mutations has facilitated appropriate targeting of clinical, biochemical and radiological screening for this high risk group of patients for whom earlier implementation of treatments can then be considered. MEN4 is caused by heterozygous mutations of CDNK1B which encodes the 196 amino-acid CDK1 p27Kip1, which is activated by H3K4 methylation.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This corruption of the normal B cell response to antigens, leading to sustained BcR signaling, has given great impulse to investigate in detail the role of antigen in lymphomas. Suffice it to conclude from such studies, largely immunogenetics based, that the evidence implicating antigens (exogenous or self) in lymphoma development is substantial and that lymphomagenesis is functionally driven and dynamic, rather than a simple stochastic process. As the paradigm of antigen-driven lymphoma evolves, further investigation will be paramount to the identification of the inciting agent(s) that may be responsible for immunoproliferative neoplasms and also for the development of therapeutic agents targeting effectors of the BcR signaling pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the value of MRD monitoring by flowcytometry (FCM) in predicting outcome in adult Precursor ALL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) samples were analyzed by 4-color FCM collected at diagnosis and after induction therapy (MRD1) to correlate MRD positivity with disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Study included 57 adult ALL patients (44 males and 13 females) with a median age of 22 years (18-49). DFS showed no significant difference with age, gender and initial TLC (p=0.838, 0.888 and 0.743, respectively). Cumulative DFS at 2 years was 34% for B-lineage ALL (n: 35) and 57% for T-lineage ALL (n: 18) (p = 0.057). Cumulative DFS at 2 years was 7% for MRD1 positive (high risk, HR) versus 57% for MRD1 negative patients (Low risk, LR) (p < 0.001). Cumulative DFS at 2 years was 29% for HR patients (n: 26) versus 55% for LR (n: 27) according to GMALL classification (p = 0.064). Cumulative OS did not differ according to age, gender and TLC (p = 0.526, 0.594 and 0.513, respectively). Cumulative OS at 2 years was 36% for B ALL (n: 39) versus 77% for TALL (n: 18) (p = 0.016) and was 49% for Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) negative patients versus 0% for Ph-positive patients (p < 0.001). Regarding MRD1, OS at 2 years was 18% for MRD1 HR (n: 17) versus 65% for MRD1 LR (n: 38) (p < 0.001). OS was 35% for high-risk patients (n: 30) and 62% for low-risk patients (n: 27) classified according to GMALL risk stratification (p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: MRD by FCM is a strong independent predictor of outcome in terms of DFS and OS and is a powerful informative parameter in guiding individual treatment in ALL patients.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

Tumor suppressor protein C/EBPa is a key regulator of granulocytic differentiation whose functional inactivation has become a pathophysiological signature of myeloid leukemia. Given the role that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) plays in myelopoiesis, we anticipated that their expression might be disrupted in myeloid neoplasms. PURPOSE: To estimate the expression of C/EBPalpha mRNA in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and correlate its expression with the pathogenesis of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty AML patients and 20 age and sex matched healthy controls were included in the study. Blood samples of patients and controls were analyzed for CEBPalpha mRNA expression by quantitative RT-real time PCR using TaqMan technology & DeltaDeltaCt method for calculation of gene expression. RESULTS: Twenty-nine (72.5%) patients out of the 40 showed low expression levels of CEBPalpha mRNA below the cutoff value with median of 0.19 (range:0-0.87). While eleven (27.5%) patients out of the 40 showed higher expression levels of CEBPalpha above the cutoff value with median of 1.52 (range:1.07-2). Seven patients out of the 11 showed higher expression levels of CEBPalpha mRNA belong to the M3 subtype of AML harboring the t(15;17) PML-RARa translocation. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the majority of the AML patients analyzed, express low levels of C/EBPa mRNA. However, a subset of patients represented by the M3 subtype, express higher levels of C/EBPa.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

Consistent with this model, TLR4 signaling primarily regulates macrophage gene expression through a pre-existing enhancer landscape. However, TLR4 signaling also induces priming of approximately 3,000 enhancer-like regions de novo, enabling visualization of intermediates in enhancer selection and activation. Unexpectedly, we find that enhancer transcription precedes local mono- and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2). H3K4 methylation at de novo enhancers is primarily dependent on the histone methyltransferases Mll1, Mll2/4, and Mll3 and is significantly reduced by inhibition of RNA polymerase II elongation. Collectively, these findings suggest an essential role of enhancer transcription in H3K4me1/2 deposition at de novo enhancers that is independent of potential functions of the resulting eRNA transcripts.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N-terminal truncating mutations in the key haematopoietic transcription factor GATA1 are acquired during foetal life in virtually every case. These mutations are not leukaemogenic in the absence of trisomy 21. In mouse models, deregulated expression of chromosome 21-encoded genes is implicated in leukaemic transformation, but does not recapitulate the effects of trisomy 21 in a human context. Recent work using primary human foetal liver and bone marrow cells, human embryonic stem cells and iPS cells shows that prior to acquisition of GATA1 mutations, trisomy 21 itself alters human foetal haematopoietic stem cell and progenitor cell biology causing multiple abnormalities in myelopoiesis and B-lymphopoiesis.

This is not a marginal problem since monoclonal gammopathy is present in 1-3% of the population above 50 years in whom it is often asymptomatic, and in at least 8% of patients is associated with a symptomatic neuropathy, representing one of the leading causes of neuropathy in aged people. Monoclonal gammopathy may result from malignant lymphoproliferative diseases including multiple myeloma or solitary plasmocytoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), other IgM-secreting lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and primary systemic amyloidosis (AL). In most instances it is not associated with any of these disorders and is defined monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) for its possible, though infrequent, evolution into malignant forms. Several data support the pathogenetic role of the monoclonal gammopathy in the neuropathy particularly when of IgM isotype where IgM reactivity to several neural antigens has been reported.

In preclinical leukemia models, perifosine has an independent cytotoxic potential but also synergizes well with other rationally selected targeted agents. The evidence from clinical trials supporting the use of perifosine in the therapy of leukemias is limited. The optimal dose and schedule have yet to be defined. However, given its favorable toxicity profile and mechanism of action, the therapeutic potential of perifosine should be evaluated in well-designed clinical trials. AREAS COVERED: The role of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt zpathway in normal cells, cancer and leukemias is discussed. The mechanism of action of perifosine and the basic information on the development and chemical properties are summarized. The evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies is presented. The efficacy and side effect profile are summarized. EXPERT OPINION: The safety and tolerability profile of perifosine are satisfactory. The evidence from clinical trials in patients with leukemias is very limited. The preclinical data are encouraging.

RESULTS: Doxorubicin- or imatinib-induced apoptosis was enhanced when anticancer agents were used in combination with TPL. When combined with TPL, both doxorubicin and imatinib downregulate Nrf2 and HIF-1alpha expression at protein and mRNA levels. Genes downstream of Nrf2, for example, NQO1, GSR and HO-1, as well as target genes of HIF-1alpha, for example, BNIP3, VEGF and CAIX are also downregulated at the mRNA level.

The overall incidence of hematological malignancies appears to be rising in United States of America and Europe, and estimated to be rising in Africa. This study was conducted as there is scarcity of information regarding clinical characteristics of hematological malignancies in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to determine the distribution and spectrum of various hematological malignancies encountered in the locality. METHOD: This is a retrospective descriptive study done in Gondar University Hospital, North West Ethiopia from January 2008 to December 2011 in those admitted with the diagnosis of hematological malignancies. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were admitted with the diagnosis of hematological malignancies during the study period The mean and median ages of patients with hematological malignancies were 42 yrs and 45 yrs respectively. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) comprised 22/67 (32.8%) of all hematological malignancies, followed by 17/67 (25.4%) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 13/67 (19.4%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Majority of patients with NHL presented with advanced disease (77%), high-grade type (73%) with B-symptoms (68%), reflecting aggressive nature of the disease. Patients with acute leukemia, especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), presented with features of cytopenia (fatigue, fever and bleeding tendency), while chronic leukemia (CML and CLL) cases had fatigue, weight loss and organomegally on admission.

The current study was carried out to compare effectiveness and safety of Iranian vs. Indian imatinib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical study was performed on newly diagnosed CML patients in Seyyed-oShohada Hospital (Isfahan) and Khansari Hospital (Arak) from January to June 2011. The control group consisted of CML patients who received Indian imatinib previously. The drug was initiated with the dose of 400 mg daily. The patients were followed for six months, and the treatment outcomes (WBC <10(4)) and molecular response. Finally, the two groups were compared in these respects. RESULT: We evaluated 43 patients in each group. The hematological and molecular responses for the Iranian Imatinib were respectively 86.0% and 46.5%, while the rates were respectively 86.0 and 44.2% for the Indian imatinib. The two groups were similar with regard to the treatment outcome. The two groups were not significantly different with regard to the drug adverse effects. CONCLUSION: According to the findings, the Iranian imatinib is not different from the Indian drug in the hematological and molecular responses in treatment of the chronic phase of CML patients. Furthermore, the adverse effects of the two kinds were not significantly different.

Ruthenium was seen as a promising metal due to its similar kinetics to platinum and its lower toxicity. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the newer mononuclear ruthenium (II) compounds for antinociceptive and antitumor activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ruthenium (II) compounds were evaluated for antinociceptive and antitumor activity using the various in vitro and in vivo models. The compounds were injected to mice at concentrations of 1 and 2 mg kg(-1) intraperitoneally and were screened for antinociceptive activity, and the antiproliferative effect was evaluated against murine leukemia cells (L1210), human T-lymphocyte cells (CEM) and human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa) using MTT assay. RESULTS: The results for antitumor activity clearly indicated that compound R1 was potent cytotoxic agent than R2 with IC50 values ranging from 4-6 muM for R1, whereas IC50 values for compound R2 ranging from 65-103 muM. The compounds have shown a significant anti-inflammatory effect in carrageenan and dextran models but do not having the central analgesic activity, this indicating that the antinociceptive activity is related to the peripheral nervous system. The results for 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) activity showed that both R1 and R2 compounds were found to be significant 5-LOX inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 14.35 mug ml(-1) and 29.24 mug ml(-1) respectively.

Honey is a good source of antioxidants since it contains a great variety of phenolic compounds. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this work was to investigate the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of three crude commercial honeys of different floral origin (heather, rosemary and polyfloral honey) from Madrid Autonomic Community (Spain) as well as of an artificial honey in human peripheral blood promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). MATERIAL AND METHODS: HL-60 cells were cultured in the presence of honeys at various concentrations for up to 72 hours and the percentage of cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were identified by chromatin condensation and flow cytometry analysis. ROS production was determined using 2 ,7 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA). RESULTS: The three types of crude commercial honey induced apoptosis in a concentration and time dependent-manner. In addition, honeys with the higher phenolic content, heather and polyfloral, were the most effective to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells. However, honeys did not generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could not block honeys-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: These data support that honeys induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells through a ROS-independent cell death pathway.

PRL-3, a metastasis-associated phosphatase, is a downstream target of FLT3-ITD. This study investigates the regulation and function of PRL-3 in leukaemia cell lines and AML patients associated with FLT3-ITD mutations. PRL-3 expression is upregulated by the FLT3-STAT5 signalling pathway in leukaemia cells, leading an activation of AP-1 transcription factors via ERK and JNK pathways. PRL-3-depleted AML cells showed a significant decrease in cell growth. Clinically, high PRL-3 mRNA expression was associated with FLT3-ITD mutations in four independent AML datasets with 1158 patients. Multivariable Cox-regression analysis on our Cohort 1 with 221 patients identified PRL-3 as a novel prognostic marker independent of other clinical parameters. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed high PRL-3 mRNA expression was significantly associated with poorer survival among 491 patients with normal karyotype.

However, patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics represent a largely heterogeneous population regarding treatment response and clinical outcome. In this study, we integrated cytogenetics and molecular mutations in the analysis of 318 patients with de novo non-M3 AML who received standard chemotherapy. According to the mutation status of eight genes, including NPM1, CEBPA, IDH2, RUNX1, WT1, ASXL1, DNMT3A and FLT3, that had prognostic significance, 229 patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics could be refinedly stratified into three groups with distinct prognosis (P<0.001); patients with good-risk genotypes had a favorable outcome (overall survival, OS, not reached) similar to those with good-risk cytogenetics, whereas those with poor-risk genotypes had an unfavorable prognosis (OS, 10 months) similar to those with poor-risk cytogenetics (OS, 13.5 months), and the remaining patients with other genotypes had an intermediate outcome (OS, 25 months). Integration of cytogenetic and molecular profiling could thus reduce the number of intermediate-risk AML patients from around three-fourth to one-fourth.

One of the genes most highly downregulated by I-BET151 was LMO2, an important oncogenic regulator of hematopoietic stem cell development and erythropoiesis. We previously reported that LMO2 transcription is dependent upon Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) kinase activity in HEL cells. Here, we show that the transcriptional changes induced by a JAK2 inhibitor (TG101209) and I-BET151 in HEL cells are significantly over-lapping, suggesting a common pathway of action.

This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the feasibility and anti-leukemic activity of a sequential therapy using clofarabine for cytoreduction followed by conditioning for haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with non-remission acute leukemia. Patients received clofarabine (5 x 30 mg/m(2) IV) followed by a T cell replete haploidentical transplantation for AML (n = 15) or ALL (n = 3). Conditioning consisted of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus either melphalan, total body irradiation or treosulfan/etoposide. High-dose cyclophosphamide was administered for post-grafting immunosuppression. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved in 83 % and complete remission in 78% at day +30. The rate of acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) grade II-IV was 22%, while chronic GvHD occured in five patients (28%). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) after 1 year was 23%.

The concept of a sequential therapy using clofarabine for cytoreduction followed by haploidentical HSCT proved to be feasible and allows successful engraftment, while providing an acceptable toxicity profile and anti-leukemic efficacy in patients with advanced acute leukemia.

METHODS: Sixty-eight cases of SBLs were included collected from November 2008 to June 2012. The patterns of FDCs and Ki-67 expression were studied on paraffin sections by CD21, CD23 and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. The characteristic staining patterns of FDCs and Ki-67 expression among different SBLs were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The age of SBL patients ranged from 28 to 85 years with a mean of 55.2 years. The male to female ratio was 1.2:1. Fifty-five cases involved only lymph nodes (80.9%), and the remaining cases involved multiple extra-nodal sites. Histological classification of the cases was made according to the 2008 WHO lymphoma classification criteria: 22 were low-grade follicular lymphomas (FLs, including grade 1 and grade 2), 19 marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs), 17 mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs), and 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas (CLL/SLLs). FDC meshwork limited to the central part of neoplastic follicles was characteristic for FL (90.9%, 20/22). The germinal center FDC meshwork was destroyed primarily at periphery in MZL (14/19). The absence or scattered FDC clusters were typical of SLL/ CLL. Irregular FDC was seen in 7/17 of MCL, while 7/17 MCL displayed FDC pattern similar to that of CLL/SLLs. The pattern of FDCs was a significantly diagnostic feature in distinguishing the four types of SBLs (P < 0.01). Ki-67 was also a statistically significant parameter (P < 0.05) with decreasing labeling index as the following: MCL, FL, SLL and MZL. Ki-67 showed scattered pattern in germinal centers with loss of polarity in FLs. MZL presented uniformly scattered positive pattern in interfollicullar areas. Ki-67 staining was uniform in MCL, but its labeling index varied from 5% to 90%. The Ki-67 index was higher in the morphological ""proliferation centers"" of all CLL/SLLs.

Using small angle x-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that the N-Cap and the Src homology (SH) 3 domain acquire mus-ms motions upon N-Cap association with the SH2-L domain, revealing a stabilizing synergy between these segments. The N-Cap-myristoyl tether likely triggers the protein to anchor to the membrane because of these flip-flop dynamics, which occur in the mus-ms time range. This segment not only presents the myristate during c-Abl inhibition but may also trigger protein localization inside the cell in a functional and stability-dependent mechanism that is lost in Bcr-Abl(+) cells, which underlie chronic myeloid leukemia.

Recently, the application of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has uncovered many new cryptic genomic copy number imbalances, most of which are now recognized as clinically useful markers of haematological malignancies. In view of the limitations of both FISH and aCGH techniques, in terms of their routine application as a first line screening test, we designed a new multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) probemix for use in addition to classic karyotype analysis. METHODS: A novel MLPA probemix was developed to interrogate copy number changes involving chromosomal regions: 2p23-24 (MYCN, ALK), 5q32-34 (MIR145A, EBF1, MIR146A), 6q21-27, 7p12.2 (IKZF1), 7q21-36, 8q24.21 (MYC), 9p24 (JAK2 V617F point mutation), 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/2B), 9p13.2 (PAX5), 10q23 (PTEN), 11q22.3 (ATM), 12p13.2 (ETV6), 13q14 (RB1, MIR15A, DLEU2, DLEU1), 17p13.1 (TP53), and 21q22.1 (RUNX1/AML1) and was applied to DNA extracted from 313 consecutive bone marrow patient samples, referred for routine karyotype analysis. RESULTS: More than half of the samples originated from newly investigated patients. We discovered clinically relevant genomic aberrations, involving a total of 24 patients (8%) all with a normal karyotype, which would have remained undiagnosed. DISCUSSION: Our data clearly indicate that routine application of this MLPA screening panel, as an adjunct to karyotype analysis, provides a sensitive, robust, rapid and low-cost approach for uncovering clinically important genomic abnormalities, which would have otherwise remained undetected.",,"['Konialis, Christopher', 'Savola, Suvi', 'Karapanou, Sophia', 'Markaki, Aggeliki', 'Karabela, Maria', 'Polychronopoulou, Sophia', 'Ampatzidou, Maria', 'Voulgarelis, Michael', 'Viniou, Nora-Athina', 'Variami, Eleni', 'Koumarianou, Argyro', 'Zoi, Katerina', 'Hagnefelt, Birgitta', 'Schouten, Jan P', 'Pangalos, Constantinos']","['Konialis C', 'Savola S', 'Karapanou S', 'Markaki A', 'Karabela M', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Ampatzidou M', 'Voulgarelis M', 'Viniou NA', 'Variami E', 'Koumarianou A', 'Zoi K', 'Hagnefelt B', 'Schouten JP', 'Pangalos C']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20131125,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/economics/*methods', '*Gene Dosage', 'Genomics/economics/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans']",['NOTNLM'],"['Copy number aberrations', 'Haematological malignancies', 'Leukaemia', 'Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification']",2013/08/10 06:00,2015/01/07 06:00,['2013/08/10 06:00'],"['2013/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['hem225 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000112 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Jun;19(4):217-24. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000112.

T LGL and chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK-cells are indolent diseases frequently associated with cytopenias and a wide spectrum of auto-immune manifestations. Neutropenia can lead to recurrent bacterial infections, which represent an indication of initiating a treatment in most of the cases. Immunosuppressive therapies are usually used in this context. In contrast, aggressive NK-cell leukemia follows a fulminant course with a poor prognosis because patients are refractory to most of the treatments.

Members of the ETS ('E twenty-six') family of transcription factors are recognized as key regulators within the gene regulatory networks governing hematopoiesis, including the ontogeny of HSCs. Remarkably, although all ETS transcription factors bind the same DNA consensus sequence and overlapping tissue expression is observed, individual ETS transcription factors play unique roles in the development of HSCs. Also, these transcription factors are recurrently used throughout development and their functions are context-dependent, increasing the challenge of studying their mechanism of action. Critically, ETS factors also play roles under pathological conditions, such as leukemia and, therefore, deciphering their mechanism of action will not only enhance our knowledge of normal hematopoiesis, but also inform protocols for their creation in vitro from pluripotent stem cells and the design of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of malignant blood cell diseases. In this review, we summarize the key findings on the roles of ETS transcription factors in HSC development and discuss novel mechanisms by which they could control hematopoiesis.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Ciau-Uitz, Aldo', 'Wang, Lu', 'Patient, Roger', 'Liu, Feng']","['Ciau-Uitz A', 'Wang L', 'Patient R', 'Liu F']","['Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130806,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Vessels/embryology/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transdifferentiation', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mesoderm/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['ETS transcription factors', 'Endothelial to hematopoietic transition', 'Gene regulatory network', 'HSC', 'Hemangioblast', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic stem cell', 'VEGF', 'hematopoietic stem cell', 'vascular endothelial growth factor']",2013/08/10 06:00,2014/06/10 06:00,['2013/08/10 06:00'],"['2013/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(13)00161-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2013.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2013 Dec;51(4):248-55. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2013.07.010.

It induces differentiation and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. The NO prodrug O(2) -(2,4-dinitrophenyl)1-((4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate, or JS-K, has potent antileukaemic activity. JS-K is also active in vitro and in vivo against multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, glioma and liver cancer. Using the Pluronic P123 polymer, we have developed a micelle formulation for JS-K to increase its solubility and stability. The goal of the current study was to investigate the cellular distribution of JS-K in AML cells. METHODS: We investigated the intracellular distribution of JS-K (free drug) and JS-K formulated in P123 micelles (P123/JS-K) using HL-60 AML cells. We also studied the S-glutathionylating effects of JS-K on proteins in the cytoplasmic and nuclear cellular fractions. KEY FINDINGS: Both free JS-K and P123/JS-K accumulate primarily in the nucleus. Both free JS-K and P123/JS-K induced S-glutathionylation of nuclear proteins, although the effect produced was more pronounced with P123/JS-K. Minimal S-glutathionylation of cytoplasmic proteins was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a micelle formulation of JS-K increases its accumulation in the nucleus. Post-translational protein modification through S-glutathionylation may contribute to JS-K's antileukaemic properties.",['(c) 2013 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.'],"['Kaur, Imit', 'Terrazas, Moises', 'Kosak, Ken M', 'Kern, Steven E', 'Boucher, Kenneth M', 'Shami, Paul J']","['Kaur I', 'Terrazas M', 'Kosak KM', 'Kern SE', 'Boucher KM', 'Shami PJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130710,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azo Compounds/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Stability', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Micelles', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Donors/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Poloxalene/*metabolism', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Solubility']",['NOTNLM'],"['JS-K', 'Pluronic', 'leukaemia', 'nitric oxide', 'poloxamer']",2013/08/10 06:00,2014/02/26 06:00,['2013/08/10 06:00'],"['2013/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jphp.12100 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2013 Sep;65(9):1329-36. doi: 10.1111/jphp.12100.

As soon as the diagnosis was made, HCL was treated with 2-CDA, obtaining complete hematological remission. Immunosuppression with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin was maintained, and the graft was preserved. In kidney transplant recipients supported with immunosuppressive drugs, post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLDs) are frequent and typically related to immunosuppression via a loss of control of infectious/EBV-related proliferative stimuli. To date, HCL has not been considered among PTLDs. Recently, however, the oncogenic mutation V600E of the BRAF protein kinase has been found to be a hallmark of HCL, and calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to interfere with signaling downstream of V600E BRAF early on by counteracting senescence-associated mechanisms that protect against the oncogenic potential of the mutated kinase. Such a biochemical link between the oncogene-dependent signaling and calcineurin inhibitor activities suggests that HCL in transplanted patients might be a peculiar type of PTLD based on the presence of a specific mutation. This mechanism might also be involved in other neoplasias bearing the same or similar mutations, such as melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer.",,"['Vinante, Fabrizio', 'Tomei, Paola', 'Zaza, Gianluigi', 'Zamo, Alberto', 'Lupo, Antonio']","['Vinante F', 'Tomei P', 'Zaza G', 'Zamo A', 'Lupo A']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Renal Unit, Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Renal Unit, Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Pathological Anatomy, Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Renal Unit, Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20130808,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF', 'Calcineurin inhibitors', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Immunosuppression', 'Kidney transplantation', 'Post-transplant cancer', 'Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease', 'Treatment', 'V600E BRAF']",2013/08/10 06:00,2013/08/10 06:01,['2013/08/10 06:00'],"['2013/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/2162-3619-2-22 [doi]', '2162-3619-2-22 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2013 Aug 8;2:22. doi: 10.1186/2162-3619-2-22. eCollection 2013.,,,PMC3750510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL cells are characterized by expression of CD5 and CD23 along with CD19 and CD20, hence anti-CD5 Abs that engage secondary effector functions represent an attractive opportunity for CLL treatment. Here, a repertoire of mAbs against human CD5 was generated and tested for ability to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) both as single mAbs and combinations of two mAbs against non-overlapping epitopes on human CD5. The results demonstrated that combinations of two mAbs significantly increased the level of CDC compared to the single mAbs, while no enhancement of ADCC was seen with anti-CD5 mAb combinations. High levels of CDC and ADCC correlated with low levels of Ab-induced CD5 internalization and degradation. Importantly, an anti-CD5 mAb combination enhanced CDC of CLL cells when combined with the anti-CD20 mAbs rituximab and ofatumumab as well as with the anti-CD52 mAb alemtuzumab. These results suggest that an anti-CD5 mAb combination inducing CDC and ADCC may be effective alone, in combination with mAbs against other targets or combined with chemotherapy for CLL and other CD5-expressing haematological or lymphoid malignancies.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Klitgaard, Josephine L', 'Koefoed, Klaus', 'Geisler, Christian', 'Gadeberg, Ole V', 'Frank, David A', 'Petersen, Jorgen', 'Jurlander, Jesper', 'Pedersen, Mikkel W']","['Klitgaard JL', 'Koefoed K', 'Geisler C', 'Gadeberg OV', 'Frank DA', 'Petersen J', 'Jurlander J', 'Pedersen MW']","['Symphogen A/S, Lyngby, Denmark; Department of Haematology L4042, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130808,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD5', 'antibody combinations', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'complement-dependent cytotoxicity', 'epitope binning']",2013/08/10 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/08/10 06:00'],"['2013/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12503 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Oct;163(2):182-93. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12503.

We analyzed the outcomes of patients who chose to discontinue TKI therapy regardless of their ongoing response. Thirty-five patients with chronic phase CML discontinued TKI in complete cytogenetic response. Of them, 51% discontinued due to adverse effects, 23% due to long complete molecular response (CMR) (> 5 years), 9% due to pregnancy and 17% due to financial problems. After TKI discontinuation, patients were followed for a median of 16 months. Among 27 patients (77%) who discontinued TKIs in CMR, 11 (41%) had a molecular relapse after a median of 3.5 months. In univariate analysis we observed that patients with >/= 64 months of CMR before TKI discontinuation had superior cumulative proportions of sustained CMR and major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months after discontinuation: 88.9% vs. 45.5% (p = 0.02) and 100% vs. 75% (p = 0.05), respectively. Patients treated with high dose imatinib or second generation TKIs had a higher cumulative proportion of sustained MMR at 12 months after discontinuation than patients treated with standard dose imatinib: 100% vs. 72.2% (p = 0.03), respectively. Of the five patients who stopped TKI in MR(4.5) (molecular response of 4.5-log reduction) one lost cytogenetic response. All three patients who discontinued TKIs in MMR lost cytogenetic response; one progressed to accelerated phase. Thirteen patients (37%) restarted TKIs after loss of response: 11 improved their response, and for two it is too early to assess. Treatment discontinuation can lead to sustained CMR in some patients, but risk of relapse is higher if patients discontinue TKIs when not in CMR.",,"['Benjamini, Ohad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Jabbour, Elias', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jain, Preetesh', 'Cardenas-Turanzas, Marylou', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Benjamini O', 'Kantarjian H', 'Rios MB', 'Jabbour E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jain P', 'Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Much effort has been devoted to trying to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this genetic risk. Familial CLL appears to be clinically and biologically similar to sporadic CLL, and most if not all CLL appears to be preceded by monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), which does appear to occur at higher frequency in relatives in families with CLL. Neither linkage studies nor candidate gene association studies have proven particularly informative in CLL, but genomewide association studies have identified multiple low-risk variants that together explain about 16% of the familial risk of CLL. Studies of individual families have identified higher-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number variants associated with disease risk in those families.

Clonal proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells is driven by somatically acquired mutations, most notably JAK2 V617F, but there are important features relating to pathogenesis and phenotypic diversity that cannot be explained by acquired mutations alone. In this review we consider what is currently known about the role that inherited factors play in the development and biology of both sporadic and familial forms of MPN. Although most MPN cases appear to be sporadic, familial predisposition has been recognized for many years in a subset of cases and epidemiological studies have indicated the presence of common susceptibility alleles. Currently the JAK2 46/1 haplotype (also referred to as 'GGCC') is the strongest known predisposition factor for sporadic MPNs carrying a JAK2 V617F mutation, explaining a large proportion of the heritability of this disorder. Less is known about what genetic variants predispose to MPNs that lack JAK2 V617F, but there have been recent reports of interesting associations in biologically plausible candidates, and more loci are set to emerge with the application of systematic genome-wide association methodologies. Several highly penetrant predisposition variants that affect erythropoietin signalling, thrombopoietin signalling or oxygen sensing have been characterized in families with nonclonal hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, but much less is known about familial predisposition to true clonal MPN.

Signaling pathways that regulate this choice of self-renewal versus differentiation are currently under extensive investigation. In this study, we report that deregulation of Notch signaling skews HSC differentiation in mouse models of Fanconi anemia (FA), a genetic disorder associated with bone marrow failure and progression to leukemia and other cancers. In mice expressing a transgenic Notch reporter, deletion of the Fanca or Fancc gene enhances Notch signaling in multipotential progenitors (MPPs), which is correlated with decreased phenotypic long-term HSCs and increased formation of MPP1 progenitors. Furthermore, we found an inverse correlation between Notch signaling and self-renewal capacity in FA hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Significantly, FA deficiency in MPPs deregulates a complex network of genes in the Notch and canonical NF-kappaB pathways. Genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of NF-kappaB reduces Notch signaling in FA MPPs to near wild type level, and blocking either NF-kappaB or Notch signaling partially restores FA HSC quiescence and self-renewal capacity.

Lmo2 must be recruited to DNA by binding to the hematopoietic basic helix-loop-helix factors Scl/Tal1 or Lyl1. However, it is unknown which of these factors can mediate the leukemic activity of Lmo2. To address this, we have generated Lmo2-transgenic mice lacking either Scl or Lyl1 in the thymus. We show that although Scl is dispensable for Lmo2-driven leukemia, Lyl1 is critical for all oncogenic functions of Lmo2, including upregulation of a stem cell-like gene signature, aberrant self-renewal of thymocytes, and subsequent generation of T-cell leukemia. Lyl1 expression is restricted to preleukemic and leukemic stem cell populations in this model, providing a molecular explanation for the stage-specific expression of the Lmo2-induced gene expression program. Moreover, LMO2 and LYL1 are coexpressed in ETP-ALL patient samples, and LYL1 is required for growth of ETP-ALL cell lines.

A recent genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study identified IRF4 as a major susceptibility gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although the SNPs located in the IRF4 gene were linked to a downregulation of IRF4 in CLL patients, whether a low level of IRF4 is critical for CLL development remains unclear. In rodents, CLL cells are derived from B1 cells whose population is dramatically expanded in immunoglobulin heavy chain Vh11 knock-in mice. We bred a Vh11 knock-in allele into IRF4-deficient mice (IRF4(-/-)Vh11). Here, we report that IRF4(-/-)Vh11 mice develop spontaneous early-onset CLL with 100% penetrance. Further analysis shows that IRF4(-/-)Vh11 CLL cells proliferate predominantly in spleen and express high levels of Mcl-1. IRF4(-/-)Vh11 CLL cells are resistant to apoptosis but reconstitution of IRF4 expression in the IRF4(-/-)Vh11 CLL cells inhibits their survival. Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time a causal relationship between low levels of IRF4 and the development of CLL. Moreover, our findings establish IRF4(-/-)Vh11 mice as a novel mouse model of CLL that not only is valuable for dissecting molecular pathogenesis of CLL but could also be used for therapeutic purposes.",,"['Shukla, Vipul', 'Ma, Shibin', 'Hardy, Richard R', 'Joshi, Shantaram S', 'Lu, Runqing']","['Shukla V', 'Ma S', 'Hardy RR', 'Joshi SS', 'Lu R']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130807,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/metabolism']",,,2013/08/09 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/08/09 06:00'],"['2013/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36473-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-492769 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Oct 17;122(16):2848-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-492769.

STAT5 is an essential component in the signaling network that maintains the survival and growth of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. In contrast, the function of the prototypical upstream kinase of STAT5, the Janus kinase JAK2, in CML is still under debate. Although there is widespread agreement that JAK2 is part of the signaling network downstream of BCR-ABL1, it is unclear whether and under what circumstances JAK2 inhibitors may be beneficial for CML patients. Recent studies in murine models have cast doubt on the importance of JAK2 in CML maintenance. Nevertheless, JAK2 has been proposed to have a central role in the cytokine signaling machinery that allows the survival of CML stem cells in the presence of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the current debate and provide an overview of the arguments on both sides of the fence.

FTY720 is also a potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-activating drug (PAD). PP2A is a tumor suppressor found inactivated in different types of cancer. We show here that PP2A is inactive in polycythemia vera (PV) and other myeloproliferative neoplasms characterized by the expression of the transforming Jak2(V617F) oncogene. PP2A inactivation occurs in a Jak2(V617F) dose/kinase-dependent manner through the PI-3Kgamma-PKC-induced phosphorylation of the PP2A inhibitor SET. Genetic or PAD-mediated PP2A reactivation induces Jak2(V617F) inactivation/downregulation and impairs clonogenic potential of Jak2(V617F) cell lines and PV but not normal CD34(+) progenitors. Likewise, FTY720 decreases leukemic allelic burden, reduces splenomegaly, and significantly increases survival of Jak2(V617F) leukemic mice without adverse effects. Mechanistically, we show that in Jak2(V617F) cells, FTY720 antileukemic activity requires neither FTY720 phosphorylation (FTY720-P) nor SET dimerization or ceramide induction but depends on interaction with SET K209. Moreover, we show that Jak2(V617F) also utilizes an alternative sphingosine kinase-1-mediated pathway to inhibit PP2A and that FTY720-P, acting as a sphingosine-1-phosphate-receptor-1 agonist, elicits signals leading to the Jak2-PI-3Kgamma-PKC-SET-mediated PP2A inhibition.

We hypothesize that application of an in vitro exercise stimulus as electric pulse stimulation (EPS) to human myotubes enables the investigation of the molecular response to exercise in a clearly defined model. We applied EPS for 24 h to primary human myotubes and studied the whole genome-wide transcriptional response as well as the release of candidate myokines. We observed 183 differentially regulated transcripts with fold changes >1.3. The transcriptional response resembles several properties of the in vivo situation in the skeletal muscle after endurance exercise, namely significant enrichment of pathways associated with interleukin and chemokine signaling, lipid metabolism, and antioxidant defense. Multiplex immunoassays verified the translation of the transcriptional response of several cytokines into high-secretion levels (IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, LIF, CSF3, IL-1B, and TNF) and the increased secretion of further myokines such as angiopoietin-like 4. Notably, EPS did not induce the release of creatine kinase. Inhibitor studies and immunoblotting revealed the participation of ERK1/2-, JNK-, and NF-kappaB-dependent pathways in the upregulation of myokines. To conclude, our data highlight the importance of skeletal muscle cells as endocrine cells.

In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of galangin on two types of human colon cancer cells (HCT-15 and HT-29). We found that galangin induced apoptosis and DNA condensation of human colon cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. We also determined that galangin increased the activation of caspase-3 and -9, and release of apoptosis inducing factor from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm by Western blot analysis. In addition, galangin induced human colon cancer cell death through the alteration of mitochondria membrane potential and dysfunction.

The aim of the study was to investigate antiangiogenesis-associated alterations in antiapoptotic and antioxidative proteins in PE. METHOD: Of the 46 patients with PE, 25 (54.3%) were with gestational hypertension (GH), 12 (26%) were with mild, and 9 (19.5%) were with severe PE. The serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (Bcl-2) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In the severe PE group, the VEGFR-1 serum levels (27.3 +/- 16.8 vs 13.3 +/- 10.7 ng/mL, P = .023) were higher, but the Bcl-2 levels (1.5 +/- 0.2 vs 2.1 +/- 1.7 ng/mL, P = .047) were lower than the levels in the GH-mild PE group (P = .047).

Two major subtypes of myeloma, hyperdiploid MM (HMM) and non-hyperdiploid MM (NHMM), have distinct chromosomal alterations and different survival outcomes. Transcription factors (TrFs) have been implicated in myeloma oncogenesis, but their dysregulation in myeloma subtypes are less studied. Here, we developed a TrF-pathway coexpression analysis to identify altered coexpression between two sample types. We apply the method to the two myeloma subtypes and the cell cycle arrest pathway, which is significantly differentially expressed between the two subtypes. We find that TrFs MYC, nuclear factor-kappaB and HOXA9 have significantly lower coexpression with cell cycle arrest in HMM, co-occurring with their overactivation in HMM. In contrast, TrFs ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1), SP1 and E2F1 have significantly lower coexpression with cell cycle arrest in NHMM. SP1 chromatin immunoprecipitation targets are enriched by cell cycle arrest genes. These results motivate a cooperation model of ESR1 and SP1 in regulating cell cycle arrest, and a hypothesis that their overactivation in NHMM disrupts proper regulation of cell cycle arrest. Cotargeting ESR1 and SP1 shows a synergistic effect on inhibiting myeloma proliferation in NHMM cell lines. Therefore, studying TrF-pathway coexpression dysregulation in human cancers facilitates forming novel hypotheses toward clinical utility.",,"['Wang, X', 'Yan, Z', 'Fulciniti, M', 'Li, Y', 'Gkotzamanidou, M', 'Amin, S B', 'Shah, P K', 'Zhang, Y', 'Munshi, N C', 'Li, C']","['Wang X', 'Yan Z', 'Fulciniti M', 'Li Y', 'Gkotzamanidou M', 'Amin SB', 'Shah PK', 'Zhang Y', 'Munshi NC', 'Li C']","['Department of Bioinformatics, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.', '1] Department of Bioinformatics, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China [2] Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130808,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Bayes Theorem', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/analysis', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/analysis/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",,,2013/08/09 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/08/09 06:00'],"['2013/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013233 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.233 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Apr;28(4):894-903. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.233.

Current effort tries to exploit DNMTi application beyond acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, especially to solid tumors. Although both drugs only differ by a minimal structural difference, they trigger distinct molecular mechanisms that are highly relevant for a rational choice of new combination therapies. Therefore, we investigated cell death pathways in vitro in human hepatoma, colon, renal, and lung cancer cells and in vivo in chorioallantoic membrane and xenograft models. Real-time cancer cell monitoring and cytokine profiling revealed a profoundly distinct response pattern to both drugs. 5-aza-dC induced p53-dependent tumor cell senescence and a high number of DNA double-strand breaks. In contrast, 5-aza-CR downregulated p53, induced caspase activation and apoptosis. These individual response patterns of tumor cells could be verified in vivo in chorioallantoic membrane assays and in a hepatoma xenograft model. Although 5-aza-CR and 5-aza-dC are viewed as drugs with similar therapeutic activity, they induce a diverse molecular response in tumor cells.

Posaconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal drug with efficacy in prevention of IFI; however, it has not been previously studied as prophylaxis in a Chinese population. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized study in China enrolled AML and MDS patients with persistent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Prophylaxis with posaconazole or fluconazole was administered for a maximum of 12 weeks, or until patients recovered from neutropenia and achieved complete remission or an IFI occurred. The primary endpoint was incidence of proven, probable, or possible IFI during treatment. Clinical failure rate, all-cause mortality and time to first systemic antifungal treatment were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Patients were randomized to receive posaconazole (n = 129) or fluconazole (n = 123); 117 patients in each group were included in the statistical analysis. The incidence of proven, probable or possible IFI was 9.4% (11/117) and 22.2% (26/117) in the posaconazole and fluconazole groups, respectively (p = 0.0114). The clinical failure rate was numerically lower in the posaconazole group (37/117 (31.6%; 95%CI: 23.3 - 40.9)) than in the fluconazole group (49/117 (41.88%; 95% CI: 32.8 - 51.4)) (p = 0.168). Patients receiving posaconazole had a later onset of first systematic antifungal treatment than those receiving fluconazole (p = 0.0139). The most common important adverse events were liver function abnormalities (11 patients (8.8%) on posaconazole and 6 (5.0%) on fluconazole (p = 0.221)).

This process is accompanied by posttranslational modifications of the chromatin (DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications), also termed the ""epigenetic layer"". All epigenetic processes are mediated by protein complexes that either mediate specific DNA methylation patterns, or modify nucleosomal proteins in a covalent fashion (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation). One important player involved in epigenetics is the MLL protein which represents a histone H3 methyltransferase. The MLL gene gained much attention because of its frequent genetic rearrangements, thereby creating oncogenic MLL fusion genes that cause acute leukemia in pediatric and adult patients. This article is summarizing certain functional aspects about MLL, but is mainly emphasizing on an alternative splice event within the PHD domain.

Langerhans cell sarcoma (LCS) transdifferentiated from chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphoma (CLL/SLL) is extremely rare. The underlying mechanisms of LCS tumorogenesis and its transdifferentiation from CLL/SLL are largely unknown. AIMS: the authors strive to further characterize LCS, to understand the potential molecular changes in LCS and the underlying mechanisms of CLL/SLL transformation to LCS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: a progressively enlarging right inguinal lymph node from a 68-year-old female patient with a history of CLL was biopsied and submitted for flow cytometry analysis, routine hematoxylin, and eosin (H and E) stain and immunohistochemical study. Furthermore, clonality study (fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with a CLL panel probes) and BRAF V600E mutation study (pyrosequencing and immunostain) were performed. RESULTS: two different neoplasms, LCS and CLL/SLL, were discovered to occur simultaneously in the same lymph node. These two entities were shown to be clonally related. More importantly, for the first time, BRAF V600E mutation was detected in LCS.

This effect was observed in lymphocytes from clinically resistant cases and with cytogenetic abnormalities associated with bad prognosis. Imetelstat mediated-sensitization to fludarabine was not associated with telomerase activity, but with the basal expression of Ku80. Since both Imetelstat and Ku80 bind hTR, we assessed 1) if Ku80 and Imetelstat alter each other's binding to hTR in vitro and 2) the effect of an oligonucleotide complementary to the Ku binding site in hTR (Ku oligo) on the survival of primary CLL lymphocytes exposed to fludarabine. We show that Imetelstat interferes with the binding of Ku70/80 (Ku) to hTR and that the Ku oligo can sensitize CLL lymphocytes to FLU.

As E- and P-selectin constitute the starting point for the leucocyte adhesion/invasion cascade, and CEL and CML cells share many properties with normal granulocytes, we investigated the role of these selectins in CEL and CML cell expansion and organ invasion in a xenotransplantation model using scid mice. Using two human leukemic cell lines (EOL-1 and K562), we were able to show that E- and P-selectins mediate leukemia cell tethering and adherence in a laminar flow assay. While E-selectin binding depended on sialylated carbohydrate moieties, P-selectin binding was completely (K562) or partially (EOL-1) independent of these carbohydrates indicating the involvement of non-canonical selectin ligands. In a xenograft model in scid mice, both cell lines invaded the bone marrow and other organs, formed chloromas, and ultimately produced an overt leukemia. In contrast, in E- and P-selectin knockout scid mice, the cells failed to show engraftment in 8 out of 10 animals and even if they did engraft, they produced only little organ invasion and chloroma formation.

Thus, Runx1-deficient mice generate primitive, but not definitive hematopoiesis, while Tal-1-deficient mice are completely defective. Primitive as well as definitive hematopoiesis can be developed ""in vitro"" from embryonic stem cells (ESC). We show that wild type, as well as Tal-1(-/-) and Runx1(-/-) ESCs, induced to differentiation, all expand within 5 days to comparable numbers of Flk1(+) mesodermal cells. While wild type ESCs further differentiate to primitive and definitive erythrocytes, to c-fms(+)Gr1(+)Mac1(+) myeloid cells, and to B220(+)CD19(+) B- and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-lymphoid cells, Runx1(-/-) ESCs, as expected, only develop primitive erythrocytes, and Tal-1(-/-) ESCs do not generate any hematopoietic cells. Retroviral transduction with Runx1 of Runx1(-/-) ESCs, differentiated for 4 days to mesoderm, rescues definitive erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis, though only with 1-10% of the efficiencies of wild type ESC hematopoiesis. Surprisingly, Tal-1(-/-) ESCs can also be rescued at comparably low efficiencies to primitive and definitive erythropoiesis, and to myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis by retroviral transduction with Runx1. These results suggest that Tal-1 expression is needed to express Runx1 in mesoderm, and that ectopic expression of Runx1 in mesoderm is sufficient to induce primitive as well as definitive hematopoiesis in the absence of Tal-1. Retroviral transduction of ""in vitro"" differentiating Tal-1(-/-) and Runx1(-/-) ESCs should be a useful experimental tool to probe selected genes for activities in the generation of hematopoietic progenitors ""in vitro"", and to assess the potential transforming activities in hematopoiesis of mutant forms of Tal-1 and Runx1 from acute myeloid leukemia and related tumors.",,"['Tornack, Julia', 'Seiler, Katharina', 'Grutzkau, Andreas', 'Grun, Joachim R', 'Onodera, Masafumi', 'Melchers, Fritz', 'Tsuneto, Motokazu']","['Tornack J', 'Seiler K', 'Grutzkau A', 'Grun JR', 'Onodera M', 'Melchers F', 'Tsuneto M']","['Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130729,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/deficiency/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,,2013/08/08 06:00,2014/08/22 06:00,['2013/08/08 06:00'],"['2013/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0070116 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-07595 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jul 29;8(7):e70116. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0070116.

Although the majority of leukemia patients initially respond to chemotherapy, relapse is still the leading cause of death. Hence targeting apoptosis pathway would be a promising strategy for the improved treatment of leukemia. Hydantoin derivatives possess a wide range of important biological and pharmacological properties including anticancer properties. Here we investigated the antileukemic activity and mechanism of action of one of the potent azaspiro hydantoin derivative, (ASHD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the antileukemic efficacy of ASHD, we have used MTT assay, cell cycle analysis by FACS, tritiated thymidine incorporation assay, Annexin V staining, JC1 staining and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Results showed that ASHD was approximately 3-fold more potent than the parent compounds in inducing cytotoxicity. Tritiated thymidine assay in conjunction with cell cycle analysis suggests that ASHD inhibited the growth of leukemic cells. The limited effect of ASHD on cell viability of normal cells indicated that it may be specifically directed to cancer cells. Translocation of phosphatidyl serine, activation of caspase 3, caspase 9, PARP, alteration in the ratio of BCL2/BAD protein expression as well as the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential suggests activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.

Importantly, we could establish a hierarchical pattern of subclonal evolution, thus revealing which somatic hypermutations were negatively or positively selected. In addition, distinct clusters of subcloned sequences with cluster-specific mutational profiles were observed initially; however, at later time points, the minor cluster had often disappeared and hence not been selected.

Median CD4 count after induction and 6 months later were 186 x 10(6)/L and 272 x 10(6) /L. The overall response rate was 96% (46 of 48 patients), and the CR rate was 46% (22 of 48 patients). Among the 38 patients who underwent minimal residual disease evaluation, 7 (18%) were negative for minimal residual disease. After median follow-up of 24 months, 10 (21%) patients have progressed and 8 (17%) have required retreatment. The efficacy and toxicity of ofatumumab-based CIT compare favorably to our historical trials of rituximab-based CIT using an identical chemotherapy backbone (n = 64). Time to retreatment also appeared longer for ofatumumab-based CIT (free of retreatment at 24 months: 86% [95% confidence interval = 75-99] versus 68% [95% confidence interval = 56-81] for rituximab-based CIT). CONCLUSIONS: Ofatumumab-based CIT is well tolerated in patients with previously untreated CLL. The efficacy of ofatumumab-based CIT compares favorably to historical trials of rituximab-based CIT, suggesting randomized trials comparing ofatumumab-based CIT and rituximab-based CIT should be considered.",['(c) 2013 American Cancer Society.'],"['Shanafelt, Tait', 'Lanasa, Mark C', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Beaven, Anne W', 'Leis, Jose F', 'LaPlant, Betsy', 'Bowen, Deborah', 'Conte, Michael', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Zent, Clive S']","['Shanafelt T', 'Lanasa MC', 'Call TG', 'Beaven AW', 'Leis JF', 'LaPlant B', 'Bowen D', 'Conte M', 'Jelinek DF', 'Hanson CA', 'Kay NE', 'Zent CS']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130806,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['chemoimmunotherapy', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'fludarabine', 'ofatumumab', 'pentostatin', 'rituximab', 'small lymphocytic lymphoma', 'treatment']",2013/08/08 06:00,2013/12/20 06:00,['2013/08/08 06:00'],"['2013/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28292 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Nov 1;119(21):3788-96. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28292.

The objective of this study was to determine whether specific operator techniques and/or use of a specimen preparation checklist could impact the quality of bone marrow assessment by reducing the frequency of nonspicular aspirates, small cores, and nondiagnostic samples. METHODS: All bone marrow biopsies performed at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from April, 2012 to September, 2012 were eligible for inclusion. Six operator techniques were linked with specimen quality in a preintervention cohort. Next, a specimen preparation checklist was implemented, and outcomes were compared from the preintervention and postintervention cohorts. RESULTS: In total, 830 procedures performed by 41 operators were prospectively observed and analyzed. In the preintervention cohort (n = 413), no operator technique was associated with specimen quality in multivariable models accounting for patient characteristics and operator. Compared with the preintervention cohort, in multivariable analyses, the postintervention cohort (n = 417) had decreased odds of nondiagnostic specimens (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.87; P = .01) and core lengths </=1 cm (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.90; P = .009), but there was no significant difference in spicularity.

AAE is associated with lymphoproliferative conditions and autoantibodies against C1 inhibitor (C1INH). Rituximab (RTX) is increasingly used in the treatment of AAE patients. METHODS: A nationwide study of AAE patients was performed in Denmark. Clinical features, associated disorders, treatments and outcomes were registered. RESULTS: Eight AAE patients were identified. The diagnostic delay was on average 1 year and 8 months. Patients were treated with C1INH concentrate or icatibant on demand. Six patients were diagnosed with a clonal B-cell disorder during follow-up, on average 2.5 years after the first swelling. Two patients had monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Two patients received RTX. CONCLUSIONS: AAE is a rare condition occurring in less than 10% of patients with C1INH deficiency in Denmark. AAE is highly associated with haematologic disorders, and we recommend yearly follow-up visits with clinical examination and blood tests including flow cytometry to diagnose B-cell conditions at an early stage. We report 2 patients with AAE and associated MBL, which is a benign expansion of clonal B lymphocytes. MBL can be the precursor of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or is associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. If angioedema is poorly controlled with standard treatment regimens, we suggest treatment of the associated haematologic disorder. Based on a review of the literature and our own data, we recommend therapy with RTX, especially in patients with anti-C1INH autoantibodies.","['Copyright (c) 2013 S.

The observations were performed in a flock of 55,000 commercial layers (50,000 Lohmann White and 5,000 Lohmann Brown). At the age of 30 weeks, Lohmann White layers exhibited a number of growths (at an average of 60 hens per week, representing 0.1% of the flock) in the region of leg toes on a daily basis over 28 weeks that regressed during the remaining flock production period. Gross and histological investigations identified the lesions as keratoacanthomas. PCR analysis was negative for avian leukosis virus (ALV) and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). The present investigations have revealed an unusual case: this is the first report on an enzootic outbreak of multiple keratoacanthomas in commercial layers. The results of the aetiological investigations do not show a relation to any infectious agent or a chemical-toxic cause.

Because HDAC3 associates with oncoproteins that drive leukemia and lymphoma, we engineered a conditional deletion allele in mice to explore the physiological roles of Hdac3 in hematopoiesis. We used the Vav-Cre transgenic allele to trigger recombination, which yielded a dramatic loss of lymphoid cells, hypocellular bone marrow, and mild anemia. Phenotypic and functional analysis suggested that Hdac3 was required for the formation of the earliest lymphoid progenitor cells in the marrow, but that the marrow contained 3-5 times more multipotent progenitor cells. Hdac3(-/-) stem cells were severely compromised in competitive bone marrow transplantation. In vitro, Hdac3(-/-) stem and progenitor cells failed to proliferate, and most cells remained undifferentiated. Moreover, one-third of the Hdac3(-/-) stem and progenitor cells were in S phase 2 hours after BrdU labeling in vivo, suggesting that these cells were impaired in transit through the S phase.

Previous studies of DNA methylation suggest epigenetic alterations may also be important, but an integrated genome-wide analysis of genetic and epigenetic alterations in ALL has not been performed. We analyzed 137 B-lineage and 30 T-lineage childhood ALL cases using microarray analysis of DNA copy number alterations and gene expression, and genome-wide cytosine methylation profiling using the HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR (HELP) assay. We found that the different genetic subtypes of ALL are characterized by distinct DNA methylation signatures that exhibit significant correlation with gene expression profiles. We also identified an epigenetic signature common to all cases, with correlation to gene expression in 65% of these genes, suggesting that a core set of epigenetically deregulated genes is central to the initiation or maintenance of lymphoid transformation.

The aim of the present study was to identify drugs effective on multidrug resistant cells. METHODS: The RPMI 8226 myeloma cell line and its multidrug resistant subline 8226/Dox40 was screened for cytotoxicity in response to 3,000 chemically diverse compounds using a fluorometric cytotoxicity assay (FMCA). Follow-up profiling was subsequently performed using various cellular and biochemical assays. RESULTS: One compound, designated VLX40, demonstrated a higher activity against 8226/Dox40 cells compared to its parental counterpart. VLX40 induced delayed cell death with apoptotic features. Mechanistic exploration was performed using gene expression analysis of drug exposed tumor cells to generate a drug-specific signature. Strong connections to tubulin inhibitors and microtubule cytoskeleton were retrieved. The mechanistic hypothesis of VLX40 acting as a tubulin inhibitor was confirmed by direct measurements of interaction with tubulin polymerization using a biochemical assay and supported by demonstration of G2/M cell cycle arrest. When tested against a broad panel of primary cultures of patient tumor cells (PCPTC) representing different forms of leukemia and solid tumors, VLX40 displayed high activity against both myeloid and lymphoid leukemias in contrast to the reference compound vincristine to which myeloid blast cells are often insensitive. Significant in vivo activity was confirmed in myeloid U-937 cells implanted subcutaneously in mice using the hollow fiber model.

The standard dose of cytarabine used to treat this leukemia is 100 mg per square meter. In an attempt to improve the effectiveness of cytarabine against acute myeloid leukemia, a high-dose treatment (3,000 mg per square meter) was introduced into therapy. The side effects of high-dose cytarabine was a major concern, especially its neurological toxicity. A review of recent clinical trials indicates that this high-dose cytarabine can be replaced by the intermediate-dose of 1,000 mg per square meter without loss of efficacy and with less toxicity. This is an important step to improve the efficacy of cytarabine for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Despite the improvements in the therapy for this leukemia, the current overall survival rate for adult patients is less than 30%. To optimize the cytarabine therapy, it is important to determine how some leukemic stem cells survive treatment. Preclinical data suggest that survival of the leukemic stem cells could be due to the long 12 hour interval between infusions of cytarabine, which permits some leukemic cells to escape its S phase specific action. Among the other factors that can lead to leukemic cell survival are the high levels in the liver and spleen of cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that inactivates cytarabine and drug resistance due to deficiency in deoxycytidine kinase, the enzyme that activates the prodrug, cytarabine. Several approaches are proposed in this commentary to overcome these impediments with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of cytarabine for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Momparler, Richard L']",['Momparler RL'],"[""Departement de pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal and Service d'hematologie/oncologie, CHU-Saint-Justine, 3175 Cote Sainte-Catherine, Montreal QC H3T 1C5, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130806,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cytarabine', 'Cytosine arabinoside', 'Drug resistance', 'Pharmacology']",2013/08/08 06:00,2013/08/08 06:01,['2013/08/08 06:00'],"['2013/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/2162-3619-2-20 [doi]', '2162-3619-2-20 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2013 Aug 6;2:20. doi: 10.1186/2162-3619-2-20. eCollection 2013.,,,PMC3750587,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyperleukocytic leukaemia is associated with a risk of organ failure and early death secondary to leukostasis. Mechanical removal of leukocytes by the apheresis technique, leukocytapheresis, is a therapeutic option in these patients. METHODS: During a 16-year period, 16 patients were treated with leukocytapheresis (35 apheresis procedures) for hyperleukocytosis/leukostasis. We present our experience, and in addition we review previous studies of hyperleukocytosis/leukocytapheresis in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). RESULTS: We used a highly standardised approach for leukocytapheresis in leukaemia patients with hyperleukocytosis. The average leukocytapheresis number for each patient was 2.2 (range 1-6). Median leukocyte count before apheresis was 309 x 10(9) L(-1) (range 104-935); the mean leukocyte count reduction was 71%, corresponding to a mean absolute reduction of 219 x 10(9) L(-1). No serious side effects were seen during or immediately after apheresis. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that our standardised technique for leukocytapheresis effectively reduced the peripheral blood leukaemia cell counts. Previous studies in AML also support the conclusion that this is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of a potentially life-threatening complication, but apheresis should always be combined with early chemotherapy.","['(c) 2013 The Authors.

Downregulation of HLA class I expression is one mechanism by which CMV evades T cell-mediated immune detection, rendering infected cells vulnerable to killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR)(+) NK cells. In this study, we observed that the amplified NKG2C(+) NK cell population observed specifically in CMV seropositive individuals mainly expressed KIR2DL receptors. We have shown that HLA class I expression was downregulated on CMV-infected immature dendritic cells (iDCs), which escape to HLA-A2-pp65-specific T lymphocytes but strongly trigger the degranulation of KIR2D(+) NK cells. CMV infection conferred a vulnerability of C2C2(+) iDCs to educated KIR2DL1(+) and KIR2DL3(+) NK cell subsets. Alloreactivity of KIR2DL1(+) NK cell subsets against C1C1(+) iDCs was maintained independently of CMV infection. Unexpectedly, CMV-infected C1C1(+) iDCs did not activate KIR2DL3(+) NK cell reactivity, suggesting a potential CMV evasion to KIR2DL3 NK cell recognition. Altogether, the coexpression of KIR and NKG2C on expanded NK cell subsets could be related to a functional contribution of KIR in CMV infection and should be investigated in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in which the beneficial impact of CMV infection has been reported on the graft-versus-leukemia effect.",,"['Djaoud, Zakia', 'David, Gaelle', 'Bressollette, Celine', 'Willem, Catherine', 'Rettman, Pauline', 'Gagne, Katia', 'Legrand, Nolwenn', 'Mehlal, Souad', 'Cesbron, Anne', 'Imbert-Marcille, Berthe-Marie', 'Retiere, Christelle']","['Djaoud Z', 'David G', 'Bressollette C', 'Willem C', 'Rettman P', 'Gagne K', 'Legrand N', 'Mehlal S', 'Cesbron A', 'Imbert-Marcille BM', 'Retiere C']","['Etablissement Francais du Sang-Pays de la Loire, EA4271, Immunovirologie et Polymorphisme Genetique, 44011 Nantes Cedex 01, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130805,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Cytomegalovirus Infections/*immunology/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR2DL1/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR2DL3/biosynthesis/immunology']",,,2013/08/07 06:00,2013/11/07 06:00,['2013/08/07 06:00'],"['2013/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1301138 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1301138 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Sep 1;191(5):2708-16. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1301138.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective registry study on 179 HSCT2s given for relapse after HSCT1 from matched related donors (n = 75) or unrelated donors (n = 104), using identical or alternative donors for HSCT2. Separate analyses were performed according to donor at HSCT1. RESULTS: Independent of donor, 74% of patients achieved complete remission after HSCT2, and half of these patients experienced relapse again. Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 25% +/- 4% (39% +/- 7% after related HSCT2; 19% +/- 4% after unrelated HSCT2). Long-term survivors were observed even after two unrelated HSCT2s. Multivariate analysis for OS from HSCT2 confirmed established risk factors (remission duration after HSCT1: hazard ratio [HR], 2.37; 95% CI, 1.61 to 3.46; P < .001; stage at HSCT2: HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.83; P = .006). Outcome of HSCT2 was better after related HSCT1 than after unrelated HSCT1 (2-year OS: 37% +/- 6% v 16% +/- 4%, respectively; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.98; P = .042, multivariate Cox regression). After both related and unrelated HSCT1, selecting a new donor for HSCT2 did not result in a relevant improvement in OS compared with HSCT2 from the original donor; however, donor change was not detrimental either. CONCLUSION: After relapse from allogeneic HSCT1, HSCT2 can induce 2-year OS in approximately 25% of patients. Unrelated HSCT2 is feasible after related and unrelated HSCT1. Donor change for HSCT2 is a valid option. However, a clear advantage in terms of OS could not be demonstrated.",,"['Christopeit, Maximilian', 'Kuss, Oliver', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Beelen, Dietrich Wilhelm', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Bethge, Wolfgang Andreas', 'Basara, Nadezda', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Uharek, Lutz', 'Meyer, Ralf G', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Scheid, Christof', 'Martin, Hans', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Bertz, Hartmut', 'Schrezenmeier, Hubert', 'Schmid, Christoph']","['Christopeit M', 'Kuss O', 'Finke J', 'Bacher U', 'Beelen DW', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Bethge WA', 'Basara N', 'Gramatzki M', 'Tischer J', 'Kolb HJ', 'Uharek L', 'Meyer RG', 'Bunjes D', 'Scheid C', 'Martin H', 'Niederwieser D', 'Kroger N', 'Bertz H', 'Schrezenmeier H', 'Schmid C']","['Maximilian Christopeit and Oliver Kuss, University of Halle, Halle (Saale); Jurgen Finke and Hartmut Bertz, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg; Ulrike Bacher and Nicolaus Kroger, Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg; Ulrike Bacher, Munich Leukaemia Laboratory; Johanna Tischer, Ludwig Maximilian University Hospital; Hans-Jochem Kolb, Technical University Hospital, Munich; Christoph Schmid, Augsburg Medical Hospital, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Augsburg; Dietrich Wilhelm Beelen, University Hospital Essen, Essen; Martin Bornhauser, University Hospital Dresden, Dresden; Rainer Schwerdtfeger, Deutsche Klinik fur Diagnostik, Wiesbaden; Wolfgang Andreas Bethge, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen; Nadezda Basara and Dietger Niederwieser, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig; Martin Gramatzki, University Hospital Kiel, Kiel; Lutz Uharek, Charite-Campus B.

We showed that treatment with Mev alone and DAC followed by Mev resulted in apoptotic response in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We also found that pretreatment with DAC sensitized HL-60 cells to Mev and caused more apoptotic cell death than Mev-alone treatment via caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, sequential addition of Mev after DAC diminished DNA synthesis rate more effectively than Mev-alone treatment. Furthermore, DAC pretreatment significantly increased CASP3 and CASP9 mRNA expression even with lower doses of Mev.

The phenotype is variable, and limited genotype phenotype correlation exists with SOS1 mutations often associated with normal cognition and stature, RAF1 mutations entailing a high HCM risk, and certain PTPN11 mutations predisposing to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The recently identified SHOC2 mutation (p.Ser2Gly) causes Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair. We report five patients with this mutation. All had skin hyperpigmentation, sparse light colored hair, increased fine wrinkles, ligamentous laxity, developmental delay, and 4/4 had a structural cardiac anomaly. Hypotonia and macrocephaly occurred in 4/5 (80%); 3/5 (60%) had polyhydramnios, increased birth weight or required use of a feeding tube. Distinctive brain abnormalities included relative megalencephaly and enlarged subarachnoid spaces suggestive of benign external hydrocephalus, and a relatively small posterior fossa as indicated by a vertical tentorium. The combination of a large brain with a small posterior fossa likely resulted in the high rate of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia (3/4; 75%). Periventricular nodular heterotopia was seen in one patient with a thick and dysplastic corpus callosum. We report on the first hematologic neoplasm, myelofibrosis, in a 2-year-old patient with SHOC2 mutation. Myelofibrosis is exceedingly rare in children and young adults. The absence of a somatic JAK2 mutation, seen in the majority of patients with myelofibrosis, is noteworthy as it suggests that germline or somatic SHOC2 mutations are causally involved in myelofibrosis.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gripp, Karen W', 'Zand, Dina J', 'Demmer, Laurie', 'Anderson, Carol E', 'Dobyns, William B', 'Zackai, Elaine H', 'Denenberg, Elizabeth', 'Jenny, Kim', 'Stabley, Deborah L', 'Sol-Church, Katia']","['Gripp KW', 'Zand DJ', 'Demmer L', 'Anderson CE', 'Dobyns WB', 'Zackai EH', 'Denenberg E', 'Jenny K', 'Stabley DL', 'Sol-Church K']","['Division of Medical Genetics, A.

Recent evidences indicate that galectin-3 (Gal-3) plays an anti-apoptotic role in chemotherapy induced tumor cell death. This study was intended to clarify the exact roles of Gal-3 performed in ATO-induced apoptosis in RCC cells. Weak apoptosis was observed in Gal-3-positive RCC cells (Caki-1, Caki-2, 786-0, and ACHN) following ATO treatment. However, ATO treatment upregulated Gal-3 expression concurrently caused a Synexin-cooperated translocation of Gal-3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Gal-3-knockdown cells were more sensitive to ATO treatment as indicated by a strong mitochondria-dependent apoptosis following ATO treatment. Meanwhile, Gal-3 was found to inhibit ATO-induced apoptosis through enhancing Bcl-2 expression and stabilizing mitochondria. To confirm the results obtained from genetic method, we employed a Gal-3 inhibitor, modified citrus prectin (MCP), and co-treated the RCC cells with ATO. The cells showed an increased apoptosis in the syngeneic application of Gal-3 inhibition and ATO compared with ATO application alone. Based on these results, we conclude that Gal-3 inhibition sensitizes human renal cell carcinoma cells to ATO treatment through increasing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.

Pg inhibited the cell growth of both cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner to a similar extent, regardless of the status of caspase-8 expression. The activation of caspase-9 and -3 was observed in both cell lines following treatment with 50 microM Pg for 24 h. In addition, the activation of caspase-8 was observed in A3 cells. The addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor Boc-D-FMK, significantly suppressed Pg-triggered cytocidal effects in both types of cells. Moreover, exposure to 50 microM Pg for 48 and 72 h resulted in lactate dehydrogenase leakage characteristic of the disruption of cellular membrane integrity. The function of membrane progesterone receptor alpha coupled directly with the Gi protein was revealed based on the restoration of Pg-triggered loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in the presence of pertussis toxin, an inhibitor specific for Gi protein. These results suggest that growth suppression accompanied with induction of apoptosis by Pg in both Jurkat clone cells was mediated through mitochondrial membrane disruption followed by the activation of the caspase cascade, as a result of the activation of non-genomic effects. The results of the present study provide novel insight into Pg actions toward its use for clinical application in patients with lymphocytic T cell leukemia.",,"['Kon, Asami', 'Yuan, Bo', 'Hanazawa, Tomoyuki', 'Kikuchi, Hidetomo', 'Sato, Mari', 'Furutani, Ryota', 'Takagi, Norio', 'Toyoda, Hiroo']","['Kon A', 'Yuan B', 'Hanazawa T', 'Kikuchi H', 'Sato M', 'Furutani R', 'Takagi N', 'Toyoda H']","['Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130805,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin/metabolism', 'Progesterone/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/*metabolism']",,,2013/08/07 06:00,2014/04/30 06:00,['2013/08/07 06:00'],"['2013/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2013.2657 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 Oct;30(4):1965-70. doi: 10.3892/or.2013.2657.

We have synthesized ND vectors capable of chemotherapeutic loading and delivery with applications towards chemoresistant leukemia. The loading of Daunorubicin (DNR) onto NDs was optimized by adjusting reaction parameters such as acidity and concentration. The resulting conjugate, a novel therapeutic payload for NDs, was characterized extensively for size, surface charge, and loading efficiency. A K562 human myelogenous leukemia cell line, with multidrug resistance conferred by incremental DNR exposure, was used to demonstrate the efficacy enhancement resulting from ND-based delivery. While resistant K562 cells were able to overcome treatment from DNR alone, as compared with non-resistant K562 cells, NDs were able to improve DNR delivery into resistant K562 cells. By overcoming efflux mechanisms present in this resistant leukemia line, ND-enabled therapeutics have demonstrated the potential to improve cancer treatment efficacy, especially towards resistant strains.

The risk of malignancy is high, with rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, and leukemia reported in several cases. Clinical features also include prenatal-onset growth retardation, microcephaly, mild dysmorphism, feeding difficulty, hypotonia, seizures, and developmental delay. PATIENT: A boy patient exhibited severe developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, intractable seizures including infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia at 6 months old, and Dandy-Walker malformation on magnetic resonance imaging. Seizures were refractory to conventional antiepileptics and treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone. Wilms tumor and an unidentified intraorbital tumor also developed at 22 months old. RESULTS: Chromosomal analysis showed multiple aneuploid cells, and premature chromatid separation was found in all chromosomes in 59.5% of 119 cells, indicating mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The present case report demonstrates that mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome can be associated with developmental brain anomalies that lead to early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.

The aim of this study is to provide preliminary data regarding potential clients' perceptions of using evidenced based treatments with dying populations who are experiencing death anxiety. METHODS: 104 college students were used as potential clients and randomly assigned to watch either a short video of a cognitive therapy (CT) session or of an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) session focused on treating a young adult diagnosed with an acute lymphoid leukemia expressing death anxiety. After watching the video, potential clients rated the session impact of the therapy approach using the Session Evaluation Questionnaire. RESULTS: No differences in ratings of session impact were found between potential clients who viewed the CT session and the ACT session. In regards to potential clients' views of session impact variables, their view of session smoothness was positively related to their post-session positivity, but inversely related to their view of session depth. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between potential clients' views of the therapist and session depth. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This preliminary study suggests that palliative care patients expressing death anxiety may benefit from either ACT or CT for death anxiety, however, future research is needed to explore the usefulness of each approach.

While tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown great efficacy as treatment options for CML, their use may cause an acquisition of mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain, which prevent TKI binding and lead to a loss in activity [Woessner, D. W.; et al. Cancer J. 2011, 17(6), 477-486]. Previously, we have shown that a rationally modified coiled-coil domain (CC(mut3)) can disrupt this oligomerization, inhibit proliferation, and induce apoptosis in CML cells [Dixon, A. S.; et al. Mol. Pharmaceutics 2012, 9(1), 187-195]. Here, we show that using the most recently approved TKI, ponatinib (Iclusig), in combination with CC(mut3) allows a dose reduction of ponatinib and increased therapeutic efficacy in vitro measured by reduction in kinase activity, induction of apoptosis via caspase-3/7 and 7-AAD/Annexin V assays, and reduced transformative ability measured by a colony forming assay. The combination was effective not only in cells containing wild-type Bcr-Abl (K562, Ba/F3-p210) but also cells with Bcr-Abl containing the T315I mutation (Ba/F3-p210-T315I). In addition, we report for the first time the ability of CC(mut3) alone to inhibit the T315I mutant form of Bcr-Abl.

Previous studies have demonstrated that a subset of these patients can benefit from disease-stabilizing therapy based on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and valproic acid. Even though complete hematological remission is only achieved for exceptional patients, a relatively large subset of patients respond to this treatment with stabilization of normal peripheral blood cell counts. METHODS: In this clinical study we investigated the efficiency and safety of combining (i) continuous administration of valproic acid with (ii) intermittent oral ATRA treatment (21.5 mg/m2 twice daily) for 14 days and low-dose cytarabine (10 mg/m2 daily) for 10 days administered subcutaneously. If cytarabine could not control hyperleukocytosis it was replaced by hydroxyurea or 6-mercaptopurin to keep the peripheral blood blast count below 50 x 109/L. RESULTS: The study included 36 AML patients (median age 77 years, range 48 to 90 years) unfit for conventional intensive chemotherapy; 11 patients responded to the treatment according to the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) response criteria and two of these responders achieved complete hematological remission. The most common response to treatment was increased and stabilized platelet counts. The responder patients had a median survival of 171 days (range 102 to > 574 days) and they could spend most of this time outside hospital, whereas the nonresponders had a median survival of 33 days (range 8 to 149 days). The valproic acid serum levels did not differ between responder and nonresponder patients and the treatment was associated with a decrease in the level of circulating regulatory T cells. CONCLUSION: Treatment with continuous valproic acid and intermittent ATRA plus low-dose cytarabine has a low frequency of side effects and complete hematological remission is seen for a small minority of patients. However, disease stabilization is seen for a subset of AML patients unfit for conventional intensive chemotherapy.",,"['Fredly, Hanne', 'Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Kittang, Astrid Olsnes', 'Tsykunova, Galina', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Fredly H', 'Ersvaer E', 'Kittang AO', 'Tsykunova G', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. hanne.fredly@med.uib.no.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130801,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,,,,,2013/08/07 06:00,2013/08/07 06:01,['2013/08/07 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/07 06:01 [medline]']","['1868-7083-5-13 [pii]', '10.1186/1868-7083-5-13 [doi]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2013 Aug 1;5(1):13. doi: 10.1186/1868-7083-5-13.,1,,PMC3765924,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was to identify serum candidate peptides for monitoring adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) MRD. RESULTS: 47 statistically different expressed peptide peaks were obtained in the molecular weight range of 700-10000 Da. Quick classifier (QC) model had optimal distinction efficiency, in the training set with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 93.33%. Peptides were identified as ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1(UBA1), isoform 1 of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor and platelet factor 4(PF4). The peptide up-regulated in newly diagnosed AML patients were decreased to the normal level after CR. When refractory & relapsed, relative intensity was elevated again. Results were contrary to down-regulated peptide peaks. Western blot demonstrated that levels of the UBA1 protein did not differ between the leukemia and normal cells. Levels of isoform 1 of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor protein and PF4 protein were both decreased in leukemia cells comparing with normal cells. The serum levels of the PF4 in the newly diagnosed AML patients and healthy controls were significantly different. Further correlation analysis did not indicate the correlated relation between platelet counts and PF4 content, the correlation coefficient was 0.097.

Although expressed in the heart, CIP4 has not been studied with regards to its potential function in cardiac myocytes. RESULTS: We now show using RNA interference that CIP4 expression in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes is required for the induction of non-mitotic, hypertrophic growth by the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, the IL-6 cytokine leukemia inhibitor factor, and fetal bovine serum, as assayed using morphometry, immunocytochemistry for the hypertrophic marker atrial natriuretic factor and [3H]leucine incorporation for de novo protein synthesis. This requirement was consistent with the induction of CIP4 expression by hypertrophic stimulation.

An increasing number of patients also achieve deep molecular responses (MR). We determined the frequency and significance of deep MR after TKI therapy for CML in CP. MR included: major molecular response (MMR), MR4, MR4.5, and undetectable transcripts (UND), i.e., BCR-ABL/ABL of </=0.1, </=0.01, </=0.0032%, and undetectable transcripts, respectively. Four hundred eighty-three patients received imatinib 400 mg/day (IM400, 71, July 2000 to April 2001), imatinib 800 mg/day (IM800, 204, June 2001 to July 2005), nilotinib (106, July 2005 to date), or dasatinib (102, November 2005 to date). UND rates at 36 months were 18.1, 30.6, 29.2, and 28.6%, respectively. Patients achieving UND have superior transformation-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) versus those obtaining </=MMR, but not other MR levels. At the 18- and 24-month landmark analysis, patients achieving UND have no advantage in TFS and OS compared to those achieving a lesser degree of MR. Among patients achieving MR4.5, those who maintain it for >/=2 years (susMR4.5) have no additional benefit in TFS or OS. Most patients with early CP CML receiving TKI achieve MMR. BCR-ABL transcripts become undetectable in a significant fraction of them. Deeper MR at 18 or 24 months are not associated with a benefit in TFS or OS. Furthermore, achieving susMR4.5 does not appear to further reduce the risk of transformation or death.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Falchi, Lorenzo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Verma, Dushyant', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Ravandi-Kashani, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Luthra, Raja', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Falchi L', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Wang X', 'Verma D', 'Quintas-Cardama A', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jabbour EJ', 'Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Borthakur G', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Verstovsek S', 'Burger JA', 'Luthra R', 'Cortes JE']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130912,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/08/06 06:00,2014/01/31 06:00,['2013/08/06 06:00'],"['2013/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23560 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Dec;88(12):1024-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23560.

Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 90401 (Alliance), a phase 3 trial in patients with mCRPC who received docetaxel-based chemotherapy, offered the opportunity to evaluate effect of prior ketoconazole, an earlier generation ASI, on clinical outcomes after docetaxel. METHODS: In CALGB trial 90401, 1050 men with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC were randomized to receive treatment with docetaxel and prednisone that included either bevacizumab or placebo. In total, 1005 men (96%) had data available regarding prior ketoconazole therapy. The observed effects of prior ketoconazole on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline, and the objective response rate (ORR) were assessed using proportional hazards and Poisson regression methods adjusted for validated prognostic factors and treatment arm. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics between patients who did (N=277) and did not (N=728) receive prior ketoconazole therapy were similar. There were no statistically significant differences between patients who did and those who did not receive prior ketoconazole therapy with respect to OS (median OS, 21.1 months vs 22.3 months, respectively; stratified log-rank P=.635), PFS (median PFS, 8.1 months vs 8.6 months, respectively; stratified log-rank P=.342), the proportion achieving a decline >/= 50% in PSA (61% vs 66%, respectively; relative risk, 1.09; adjusted P=.129), or ORR (39% vs 43%, respectively; relative risk, 1.11; adjusted P=.366). CONCLUSIONS: As measured by OS, PFS, PSA, and the ORR, there was no evidence that prior treatment with ketoconazole had an impact on the clinical outcomes of patients with mCRPC who received subsequent docetaxel-based therapy. The current results highlight the need for prospective studies to assess for potential cross-resistance with novel ASIs and to define the optimal sequence of therapy in mCRPC.",['Copyright (c) 2013 American Cancer Society.'],"['Aggarwal, Rahul', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Kelly, William Kevin', 'George, Daniel', 'Mahoney, John F', 'Millard, Frederick', 'Stadler, Walter M', 'Morris, Michael J', 'Kantoff, Philip', 'Monk, J Paul', 'Carducci, Michael', 'Small, Eric J']","['Aggarwal R', 'Halabi S', 'Kelly WK', 'George D', 'Mahoney JF', 'Millard F', 'Stadler WM', 'Morris MJ', 'Kantoff P', 'Monk JP', 'Carducci M', 'Small EJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130731,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Androgen Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bevacizumab', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/secondary', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Disease Progression', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'International Agencies', 'Ketoconazole/pharmacology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/secondary', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/secondary', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Orchiectomy', 'Prednisone/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['androgen antagonists', 'chemotherapy', 'ketoconazole', 'prostatic neoplasms', 'steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase']",2013/08/06 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/08/06 06:00'],"['2013/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2013/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28285 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Oct 15;119(20):3636-43. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28285.

Many HDAC inhibitors have already shown remarkable antitumor activities in the preclinical setting; however, their clinical utility is limited because of unfavorable toxicities associated with their broad range HDAC inhibitory effects. Isoform-selective HDAC inhibition may allow for MM cytotoxicity without attendant side effects. In this study, we demonstrated that HDAC3 knockdown and a small-molecule HDAC3 inhibitor BG45 trigger significant MM cell growth inhibition via apoptosis, evidenced by caspase and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Importantly, HDAC3 inhibition downregulates phosphorylation (tyrosine 705 and serine 727) of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3). Neither interleukin-6 nor bone marrow stromal cells overcome this inhibitory effect of HDAC3 inhibition on phospho-STAT3 and MM cell growth. Moreover, HDAC3 inhibition also triggers hyperacetylation of STAT3, suggesting crosstalk signaling between phosphorylation and acetylation of STAT3.

Myelodysplastic syndrome in childhood is extremely rare and accounts for less than 5% of all hematopoietic neoplasms in children below the age of 14 y.

MDS associated with Down syndrome which accounts for approximately one-fourth of cases of childhood MDS is now considered a unique biologic entity synonymous with Down syndrome-related myeloid leukemia and is biologically distinct from other cases of childhood MDS. Refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) is the commonest type of MDS. Genetic changes predisposing to MDS in childhood remain largely obscure. Monosomy 7 is by-far the commonest cytogenetic abnormality associated with childhood MDS; however most cases of RCC show a normal karyotype. Complex cytogenetic abnormalities and trisomy 8 and trisomy 21 are also occasionally observed.

In quarterly meetings, consensus LAPs were defined, with the performance of centers compared with these. In a learning (29 patients) and a test phase (35 patients), a mean of 2.2 aberrancies/patient was detected, and only 1/63 patients (1.6%) had no consensus LAP(s).

We conducted a prospective clinical trial to test whether vaccination with whole leukemia cells early after transplantation facilitates the expansion of leukemia-reactive T cells and thereby enhances antitumor immunity. METHODS: We enrolled 22 patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 18 of whom received up to 6 vaccines initiated between days 30 and 45 after transplantation. Each vaccine consisted of irradiated autologous tumor cells admixed with GM-CSF-secreting bystander cells. Serial patient PBMC samples following transplantation were collected, and the impact of vaccination on T cell activity was evaluated. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 2.9 (range, 1-4) years, the estimated 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates of vaccinated subjects were 82% (95% CI, 54%-94%) and 88% (95% CI, 59%-97%), respectively. Although vaccination only had a modest impact on recovering T cell numbers, CD8+ T cells from vaccinated patients consistently reacted against autologous tumor, but not alloantigen-bearing recipient cells with increased secretion of the effector cytokine IFN-gamma, unlike T cells from nonvaccinated CLL patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Further analysis confirmed that 17% (range, 13%-33%) of CD8+ T cell clones isolated from 4 vaccinated patients by limiting dilution of bulk tumor-reactive T cells solely reacted against CLL-associated antigens. CONCLUSION: Our studies suggest that autologous tumor cell vaccination is an effective strategy to advance long-term leukemia control following allo-HSCT.

RECENT FINDINGS: Vitamin D has now been convincingly shown both in vitro and in preclinical animal models to alter the differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of cancer cells. Whether vitamin D prevents cancer in humans or limits cancer progression, however, remain open questions. Epidemiologic and observational data relating circulating 25(OH)D levels and cancer risk suggest an inverse relationship for most cancers including breast, colorectal, leukemia and lymphoma, and prostate, although for each malignancy there also exist studies that have failed to demonstrate such an inverse relationship.

The aquatic toxicity (test organisms Vibrio fischeri, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lemna minor) and biodegradability tests were carried out. The additional tests with enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) and leukemia rat cells (IPC-81) provided more in-depth evaluation of toxicity. In our comparative hazard assessment protic ILs have EC50 values >100 mg L(-1) in all of the tests performed, except in the case of three representatives toward Lemna minor. They also show good biodegradability rates. The EC50 values for aprotic ILs are various orders of magnitude lower than the ones for protic ILs in most of the tests and they show a lower biodegradability potential.

In this study, we showed that PHII-7 generated equal reactive oxygen species in parental K562 and its counterpart MDR K562/A02 cells. Pre-incubation with thiol antioxidants glutathione or N-acetyl-cysteine(NAC) almost abolished the cytotoxicity of PHII-7.

ATO-resistant clones (cultured for 8-12weeks in the presence of 1, 2.5 and 5muM ATO) were characterized by high viability in the presence of ATO but slower growth rate compared to the parental cells. Morphological and functional characterization of derived ATO-resistant clones revealed that they did not differ fundamentally from parental Jurkat cells in terms of cell size, level of GSH, the lysosomal fluorescence or CD95/Fas surface antigen expression. However, a slight increase in the mitochondrial potential (JC-1 staining) was detected in the clones compared to parental Jurkat cells. Side population analysis (Vybrant DyeCycle Violet staining) in ATO resistant clones did not indicate any enrichment withcancer stem cells. Akt1/2, AktV or wortmannin inhibitors decreased viability of ATO-resistant clones grown in the presence of ATO, with no effect on ATO-treated parental cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that ATO decreased the level of p-Akt in ATO-treated parental cells, while the resistant clones exhibited higher levels of p-Akt immunostaining than parental Jurkat cells. Expression analysis of 84 genes involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway revealed that this pathway was predominantly active in ATO-resistant clones. c-JUN seems to play a key role in the induction of cell death in ATO-treated parental Jurkat cells, as dose-dependent strong up-regulation of JUN was specific for the ATO-treated parental Jurkat cells. On the other hand, changes in expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase C isoforms (PRKCZ,PRKCB and PRKCA) may be responsible for the induction of resistance to ATO. The changes in expression of growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10) observed in ATO-resistant clones suggest a possibility of induction of different mechanisms in development of resistance to ATO depending on the drug concentration and thus involvement of different signaling mediators.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, we extend this observation to demonstrate the selective targeting of corneal lymphatics by HSV-1 in the absence of functional type I interferon (IFN) pathway. Specifically, we examined the impact of HSV-1 replication on angiogenesis using type I IFN receptor deficient (CD118(-/-)) mice. HSV-1-induced lymphatic and blood vessel growth into the cornea proper was time-dependent in immunocompetent animals. In contrast, there was an initial robust growth of lymphatic vessels into the cornea of HSV-1-infected CD118(-/-)mice, but such vessels disappeared by day 5 postinfection. The loss was selective as blood vessel integrity remained intact. Magnetic resonance imaging and confocal microscopy analysis of the draining lymph nodes of CD118(-/-) mice revealed extensive edema and loss of lymphatics compared with wild-type mice. In addition to a loss of lymphatic vessels in CD118(-/-) mice, HSV-1 infection resulted in epithelial thinning associated with geographic lesions and edema within the cornea, which is consistent with a loss of lymphatic vasculature. These results underscore the key role functional type I IFN pathway plays in the maintenance of structural integrity within the cornea in addition to the anti-viral characteristics often ascribed to the type I IFN cytokine family.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

We earlier identified PTPRC (CD45) gene expression as a potential new stratification marker and now analyzed the prognostic relevance of CD45 protein expression. CD45 was measured by flow cytometry in 1065 patients treated according to the ALL-BFM-2000 protocol. The 75(th) percentile was used as cut-off to distinguish a CD45-high from a CD45-low group. As mean CD45 expression was significantly higher in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia than in B-cell-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P<0.0001), the analysis was performed separately in both groups. In B-cell-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia we observed a significant association of a high CD45 expression with older age, high initial white blood cell count, ETV6/RUNX1 negativity, absence of high hyperdiploidy (P<0.0001), MLL/AF4 positivity (P=0.002), BCR/ABL1 positivity (P=0.007), prednisone poor response (P=0.002) and minimal residual disease (P<0.0001). In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia we observed a significant association with initial white blood cell count (P=0.0003), prednisone poor response (P=0.01), and minimal residual disease (P=0.02). Compared to CD45-low patients, CD45-high patients had a lower event-free survival rate (B-cell-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia: 72 +/- 3% versus 86 +/- 1%, P<0.0001; T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia: 60 +/- 8% versus 78 +/- 4%, P=0.02), which was mainly attributable to a higher cumulative relapse incidence (B-cell-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia: 22 +/- 3% versus 11 +/- 1%, P<0.0001; T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia: 31 +/- 8% versus 11 +/- 3%, P=0.003) and kept its significance in multivariate analysis considering sex, age, initial white blood cell count, and minimal residual disease in B-cell-precursor- and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and additionally presence of ETV6/RUNX1, MLL/AF4 and BCR/ABL1 rearrangements in B-cell-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P=0.002 and P=0.025, respectively).

However, its role on the IL-1beta inflammatory cytokine production has not been studied. IL-1beta production is strictly regulated both at transcriptional and posttranslational levels through the activity of Nlrp3 inflammasome. In this study we aimed to determine the effect of Aloe vera on the molecular mechanisms of Nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1beta production in LPS-activated human THP-1 cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. Our results show that Aloe vera significantly reduced IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta cytokine production in a dose dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was substantially more pronounced in the primary cells. We found that Aloe vera inhibited the expression of pro-IL-1beta, Nlrp3, caspase-1 as well as that of the P2X7 receptor in the LPS-induced primary macrophages. Furthermore, LPS-induced activation of signaling pathways like NF-kappaB, p38, JNK and ERK were inhibited by Aloe vera in these cells. Altogether, we show for the first time that Aloe vera-mediated strong reduction of IL-1beta appears to be the consequence of the reduced expression of both pro-IL-1beta as well as Nlrp3 inflammasome components via suppressing specific signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, we show that the expression of the ATP sensor P2X7 receptor is also downregulated by Aloe vera that could also contribute to the attenuated IL-1beta cytokine secretion. These results may provide a new therapeutic approach to regulate inflammasome-mediated responses.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The PHRF1 gene resides within the tumor suppressor locus 11p15.5, which displays frequent loss in a wide variety of malignancies, including breast cancer. Remarkably, we found that the PHRF1 gene is deleted or silenced in a high proportion of human breast cancer samples and cancer cell lines. Reconstitution of PHRF1 into deficient cells impeded their propensity to form tumors in vivo, most likely because of the reemergence of TGF-beta responsiveness. These findings unveil a paradigm behind inactivation of the cPML tumor suppressor network in human malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It has been proposed that the multiple breakage events occur at a single point in time. Here we introduce the term anachromosome to describe an abnormal chromosome produced by chromothripsis. We report two cases of acute myeloid leukemia matching the description of chromothripsis that illustrate different aspects of this phenomenon from a cytogenetic perspective. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses, including multicolor FISH and FISH for repeat elements that are not present on microarrays and that are resistant to sequencing, helped interpret the rearrangements but did not reveal their level of complexity. The anachromosomes conformed to the normal constraints of chromosome structure by including segments that provide two telomeres and a centromere. In patient samples, there are mixtures of cells with and without deletions. The deletion B allele frequencies for heterozygous loci in a mixture of cells with and without the deletions create a distinctive array pattern that is consistent with all the deletions in the anachromosomes having occurred concurrently. This evidence supporting the single-event hypothesis for chromothripsis has not previously been highlighted, to our knowledge. In the context of exploring mechanisms for chromosome shattering, we discuss a possible connection between chromosome pulverization and fragile sites. Understanding chromothripsis in the context of chromosome biology will help us identify its causes and consequences.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Evaluation of the quantity and function of HCMV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses after HSCT may play a crucial role in the prevention of HCMV reactivation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanism of HCMV-specific T-cell immune responses after HSCT in HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells. STUDY DESIGN: HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells were quantified using human leucocyte antigen (HLA) pentamer staining and functionally analysed by interferon-gamma-enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-gamma-ELISPOT) assay with a pp65495-503 peptide in recipients four years after HSCT. RESULTS: The absolute number of pp65495-503-specific CD8+ T cells did not differ significantly (p>0.05) between samples with antigenaemia and those without antigenaemia given a mean of 54.5/mul and 40.5/mul, respectively, in 21 HLA-A* 0201 patients after HSCT. The level of pp65495-503-specific CD8+ T cells>20/mul of peripheral blood was maintained 90 days after transplantation. There was a significant difference in the spot count of IFN-gamma-secreting T cells between samples with antigenaemia (mean, 507/2.5x10(5)PBMCs) and those without antigenaemia (mean, 216/2.5x10(5)PBMCs; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: pp65495-503-specific CD8+ T cells may not be sufficient to control HCMV reactivation in recipients after HSCT. However, the combination of pentamer and IFN-gamma-ELISPOT assays may be valuable for evaluating HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells. Further studies on HCMV-specific T-cell immune responses continue to be performed for the prevention of persistent HCMV reactivation.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, the impact of intrauterine administration of PBMCs on embryo implantation, pregnancy rate and the underlying mechanisms will be investigated. METHODS: Pregnant mice were randomly divided into three groups, including control group; embryo implantation dysfunction (EID) group; EID with PBMCs group. Uterine horns were excised to determine the number of pregnant mice and implantation sites on the Day 7.5 postcoitum. The expression levels of LIF and VEGF during the implantation window were detected with immunohistochemistry and Real Time-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Embryo implantation dysfunction model group showed a significant decrease in pregnancy rate, implantation sites and the expression of both the endometrial LIF and VEGF during the implantation window. EID with PBMCs group showed a higher pregnancy rate and endometrial LIF and VEGF expression compared to EID group.

Cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirates of multiple lymph nodes and a bone-marrow aspirate revealed the presence of a monomorphic population of small lymphocytes similar to those observed in the peripheral blood, suggesting a leukemic small cell lymphoma (SCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). As the lymphadenomegaly and peripheral blood lymphocytosis were present simultaneously, the distinction between these 2 conditions was not possible. Immunophenotyping by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry of the lymphoid cells in peripheral blood determined a T-cell phenotype. As the horse was clinically stable, no treatment was initiated, but regular examinations were undertaken. A CBC repeated 120 days after the diagnosis showed a marked lymphocytosis (157.6 x 10(3)/muL) with no evidence of anemia or other cytopenias. The horse was euthanized 194 days after the initial diagnosis. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of submandibular lymph nodes and bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis of leukemic SCL or CLL, and a T-cell phenotype. SCL and CLL are rare in horses; previous immunohistochemical studies determined that the T-cell phenotype is predominant.

Triticuside A inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) in a dose-dependent manner but barely showed cytotoxicity to the normal human fibroblasts. Triticuside A-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a significant decrease of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins and by an increase of cleavage of caspases-3, -7, -9, and PARP. Triticuside A also suppressed the level of phospho-Akt and its downstream targets, mTOR and P70 S6 kinase. LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, significantly enhanced the Triticuside A-induced apoptosis. Moreover LY294002 not only downregulated the level of phospho-Akt but also enhanced the inhibition of Mcl-1 expression when combined with Triticuside A. Our results demonstrate for the first time the specific apoptogenic activity of Triticuside A in tumor cells and involvement of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

METHOD: This was an institution based review of data from the Medical Records Department, Department of Haematology and Cancer Registry of the Histopathology Department of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital between January 1998 and December 2011. The aim was to study the spectrum of Haematologic malignancies and the survival pattern of adult lymphomas in this region and to compare our findings to studies reported elsewhere. RESULTS: The Haematologic malignancies represented 6.05% of all cancer cases seen and 0.31% of hospital admissions. Among the Haematologic malignancies, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL) was the most frequent, constituting 51.3% while others include: Hodgkins Lymphoma (HL), 26.7% Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), 5.5%, Acute Myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), 4.2% Multiple Myeloma (MM), 4.2% Acute Lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 3.8%, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), 3.4% Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), 0.4% and Chronic Myelofibrosis 0.4%. Haematologic malignancies are more common in younger age group and also more common in males than females. Lymphomas are particularly common in young adults and the incidence tends to fall after 70 years. Similarly, the characteristic bimodal age incidence for HL found in western world has not been seen in this study. The histological subtypes for both NHL and HL are similar to the pattern reported elsewhere. Default rate was high and we found a strong association between cycles of chemotherapy given and survival in lymphoma patients. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that Haematologic malignancies are not uncommon in our environment.

Nevertheless, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is still recommended as the first-line curative treatment. To date, no study has investigated the prognostic factors and outcomes of unrelated bone marrow transplantation (u-BMT) for Ph+ALL following pre-transplant treatment with a TKI-containing regimen. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 15 transplantations of 14 patients with Ph+ALL pre-treated with a TKI-containing regimen at our institute. The 14 patients comprised 11 males and 3 females, with a median age of 50 years (range: 19-64). We performed univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors that contributed to overall survival (OS) or leukemia-free survival (LFS). RESULTS: Three-year OS of the patients with molecular complete remission (MCR) and with non-MCR at transplantation were 89% and 40% (p = 0.006), respectively, and three-year LFS rates were 79% and 0% (p = 0.001), respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that first hematological complete remission (HCR1) and MCR at transplant were significantly related to better OS and LFS. Multivariate analysis showed that MCR at transplant was significantly associated with better OS and LFS.

Cases diagnosed as spontaneous intramural hematoma have been assessed in our clinic. METHODS: The cases, which were diagnosed as spontaneous intramural hematoma in the gastrointestinal tract (SIHGT) following anamnesis, physical examination, biochemical, radiological and endoscopic findings from July 2008 to July 2012, have been assessed retrospectively. RESULTS: Seven out of 13 cases were women and the mean age was 65.1 years (34 to 82 years). The most frequent complaint on admission was abdominal pain. The most frequent location of SIHGT was the ileum (n = 8). Oral anticoagulant use was the most common cause of etiology (n = 12). In 10 cases, International normalized ratio values were higher than treatment range (2 to 3, where mechanical valve replacement was 2.5 to 3.5) and mean value was 7.6 (1.70 to 23.13). While 12 cases were discharged without problems with medical treatment, one case with acute myeloid leukemia died in the intensive care unit following cerebrovascular attack. CONCLUSION: Spontaneus bleeding and hematomas that may arise in connection with bleeding diathesis may be fatal in cases with long-term oral anticoagulant treatment and insufficient follow-up. In management of these cases, it may be necessary to arrange conservative follow up and/or initialize low molecular weight heparin, and administer vitamin K as well as replace blood products and coagulation factors when indicated.",,"['Kones, Osman', 'Dural, Ahmet Cem', 'Gonenc, Murat', 'Karabulut, Mehmet', 'Akarsu, Cevher', 'Gok, Ilhan', 'Bozkurt, M Abdussamet', 'Ilhan, Mehmet', 'Alis, Halil']","['Kones O', 'Dural AC', 'Gonenc M', 'Karabulut M', 'Akarsu C', 'Gok I', 'Bozkurt MA', 'Ilhan M', 'Alis H']","['Department of General Surgery, Bakirkoy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130725,Korea (South),J Korean Surg Soc,Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,101564795,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticoagulants', 'Gastrointestinal tract', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Tomography']",2013/08/03 06:00,2013/08/03 06:01,['2013/08/03 06:00'],"['2012/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2013/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4174/jkss.2013.85.2.58 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Surg Soc. 2013 Aug;85(2):58-62. doi: 10.4174/jkss.2013.85.2.58.

This interaction is essential for leukemogenesis and thus is a promising drug target. However, wild-type MLL1 plays a critical role in sustaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); therefore, disruption of an essential MLL1 cofactor would be expected to obliterate normal hematopoiesis. Here we show that rather than working together as a complex, menin and MLL1 regulate distinct pathways during normal hematopoiesis, particularly in HSCs and B cells. We demonstrate the lack of genetic interaction between menin and MLL1 in steady-state or regenerative hematopoiesis and in B-cell differentiation despite the fact that MLL1 is critical for these processes. In B cells, menin- or MLL1-regulated genes can be classified into 3 categories: (1) a relatively small group of coregulated genes including previously described targets Hoxa9 and Meis1 but also Mecom and Eya1, and much larger groups of (2) exclusively menin-regulated and (3) exclusively MLL1-regulated genes. Our results highlight the large degree of independence of these 2 proteins and demonstrate that menin is not a requisite cofactor for MLL1 during normal hematopoiesis. Furthermore, our data support the development of menin-MLL1-disrupting drugs as safe and selective leukemia targeting agents.",,"['Li, Bin E', 'Gan, Tao', 'Meyerson, Matthew', 'Rabbitts, Terence H', 'Ernst, Patricia']","['Li BE', 'Gan T', 'Meyerson M', 'Rabbitts TH', 'Ernst P']","['Department of Genetics and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130801,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2013/08/03 06:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2013/08/03 06:00'],"['2013/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)43142-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-03-486647 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Sep 19;122(12):2039-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-486647.

Given that protein kinase Ctheta (PKCtheta), in cooperation with PKCalpha, is essential for T-cell signaling and function, we have evaluated PKCtheta and PKCalpha as potential therapeutic targets in allogeneic HCT using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. We found that the ability of PKCalpha(-/-)/theta(-/-) donor T cells to induce GVHD was further reduced compared with PKCtheta(-/-) T cells in relation with the relevance of both isoforms to allogeneic donor T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and migration to GVHD target organs. Treatment with a specific inhibitor for both PKCtheta and PKCalpha impaired donor T-cell proliferation, migration, and chemokine/cytokine production and significantly decreased GVHD in myeloablative preclinical murine models of allogeneic HCT. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of PKCtheta and PKCalpha spared T-cell cytotoxic function and GVL effects. Our findings indicate that PKCalpha and theta contribute to T-cell activation with overlapping functions essential for GVHD induction while less critical to the GVL effect.

Several genome-wide microarray studies showed major implication of proapoptotic Bim in mediating corticosteroid-related resistance in leukemia cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated Bim gene polymorphisms and their association with childhood ALL outcome, and the mechanism underlying the observed finding. RESULTS: Lower overall survival (OS) was associated with Bim C29201T located in Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain (P = 0.01). An association remained significant in multivariate model (P = 0.007), was more apparent in high-risk patients (P = 0.004) and patients treated with dexamethasone (P = 0.009), and was subsequently confirmed in the replication patient cohort (P = 0.03). RNA analysis revealed that C29201T affects generation of gamma isoforms (gamma1) that lack proapoptotic BH3 domain. The phenotypic effect was minor suggesting the influence of additional factors that may act in conjunction with Bim genotype. Combined analysis with Mcl gene polymorphism (G-486T) revealed profound reduction in OS in individuals with both risk genotypes (P < 0.0005 in discovery and P = 0.002 in replication cohort) and particularly in high-risk patients (P </= 0.008).

In contrast to the rapid CL and wide tissue distribution of non-liposomal VCR, VSLI circulates in plasma for a prolonged period of time, with a slow CL of 345 mL/h and relatively small Vd of 3,570 mL. This facilitates enhanced and prolonged tumor-tissue delivery of VCR. The maximum tolerated dose of VSLI, 2.25 mg/m(2) once per week without a dose cap, enables individual and cumulative VCR exposure unachievable with non-liposomal VCR at its labeled dose of 1.4 mg/m(2) . VSLI is associated with a dose-dependent peripheral neurotoxicity albeit at doses that are two to three times that of standard VCR. VCR dose intensification with VSLI correlated with an increased probability of overall response and a strong trend towards increased complete response in adults with relapsed and/or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Overall, VSLI improves the therapeutic index by facilitating increased dose intensification while maintaining a predictable and manageable safety profile.","['(c) 2013, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.']","['Silverman, Jeffrey A', 'Reynolds, Laurie', 'Deitcher, Steven R']","['Silverman JA', 'Reynolds L', 'Deitcher SR']","['Talon Therapeutics, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20130817,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Injections', 'Liposomes', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['clinical pharmacology (CPH)', 'drug delivery (DEL)', 'oncology (ONC)', 'pharmacodynamics (PDY)', 'pharmacokinectics & drug metabolism (PDM)']",2013/08/03 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2013/08/03 06:00'],"['2013/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcph.155 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2013 Nov;53(11):1139-45. doi: 10.1002/jcph.155.

Bendamustine, a novel agent with both alkylating and purine-analog properties, was approved in the USA for use in CLL in 2008. Since then, clinical data on its adverse events are accumulating. IHA related to bendamustine was seldom described and is thus reported and reviewed. METHODS: We assessed five cases of CLL patients complicated by IHA, out of 31 treated with bendamustine for a relapse of their disease. Also reviewed are previous case reports in the literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Bendamustine-related IHA is more common than suspected (16 %). No such cases were found in non-CLL patients. Personal history of fludarabine-triggered AIHA may be a risk factor for this complication (recorded in 4/5 patients, 80 %). The mechanism is thought to be related to the loss of T cell regulatory control as described for other agents.

An increase in the proportion of recipient cells after transplantation is strongly associated with relapse in chronic myeloid leukemia. However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) the significance of increasing mixed chimerism (MC) as a predictive marker for relapse is less clear. Several mutations frequently found in AML have been employed for minimal residual disease detection and relapse prediction. Therefore, a combined analysis of hematopoietic chimerism and of the molecular aberrations found in AML could be used to improve MC characterization. We developed a multiplex PCR for use in the simultaneous detection of hematopoietic chimerism and mutations in nucleophosmin (NPM1) and fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). A total of 303 samples from 20 AML patients were analyzed after HSCT. The microsatellite markers used for hematopoietic chimerism detection were D1S80, D7S1517, D4S2366, THO1, and SE33. A total of 149 samples from 18 patients showed MC with a mean detection time of 9.7 months. From the 18 patients with MC, in 6 of the patients, no FLT3-ITD or NPM1 mutation was found at any time point tested, and these patients remained in complete hematological remission. In 12 patients with MC, FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations were found, and these patients showed signs of hematological relapse. Our combined analysis of NPM1/FLT3-ITD mutations and hematopoietic chimerism improved the characterization of patients with MC after HSCT. The present approach may be further expanded by combining additional mutations found in AML with hematopoietic chimerism detection.",,"['Waterhouse, Miguel', 'Bertz, Hartmut', 'Finke, Juergen']","['Waterhouse M', 'Bertz H', 'Finke J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Hugstetter Str. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany, miguel.waterhouse@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20130802,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Allografts', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', '*Mutation', '*Nuclear Proteins/blood/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Transplantation Chimera/blood/genetics', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/blood/genetics']",,,2013/08/03 06:00,2014/03/19 06:00,['2013/08/03 06:00'],"['2013/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1858-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2014 Feb;93(2):293-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1858-2.

High levels of Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins are considered primarily responsible for inhibiting apoptosis in CLL cells. While several approaches were considered to selectively inhibit Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins, the discovery that gossypol binds and antagonizes anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 family proteins was a major breakthrough in identifying specific Bcl-2 antagonists. The concept of mimicking BH3 domain emphasized the importance of Bcl-2 family-targeted therapy that can modulate the function of anti-apoptotic proteins. Although parent compound gossypol did not sustain in the clinic, its structural modifications led to the development of additional analogues that demonstrated improved efficacy and reduced toxicity in preclinical and clinical investigations. Proof of concept of this hypothesis was demonstrated by structure based BH3 mimetic ABT-737 that has shown greater cytotoxicity towards CLL cells both in pre-clinical models and clinical trials. Its oral compound ABT-263 has demonstrated the substantial susceptibility of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells through Bcl-2 inhibition. Collectively, results of a Phase I Study of Navitoclax (ABT-263) in patients with relapsed or refractory disease warrants Bcl-2 as a valid therapeutic target in CLL.

METHODS: We compared the etiology, predisposing factors and outcomes of invasive mould infection in patients treated for acute myeloid leukemia before and after implementation of voriconazole prophylaxis in a pediatric cancer center. RESULTS: We observed no difference in the number of invasive mould infection between groups. However, isolated organisms were markedly different, with a shift from aspergillosis to phaeohyphomycosis after the implementation of voriconazole prophylaxis. Survival at 90 days was improved in patients receiving voriconazole prophylaxis (P = 0.05). We did not identify a significant increase in the incidence of zygomycosis associated with routine use of voriconazole prophylaxis.

Glucocorticoids are known to induce a cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in T-lymphoma cells. We could demonstrate that the cell cycle arrest induced by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) clearly precedes apoptosis in human CEM T-ALL and murine S49.1 T-lymphoma cells. Cyclin D3 is strongly downregulated, whereas the CDK inhibitor p27 (Kip1) (p27) is strongly upregulated in response to dexamethasone in these cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of p27 as well as overexpression of its negative regulator Skp2 revealed the critical function of p27 in the Dex-induced G 1 arrest of CEM cells. Our studies indicate that several mechanisms contribute to the increase of p27 protein in our T-lymphoma cell lines. We found a significant upregulation of p27 mRNA in S49.1 and CEM cells. In addition, Dex treatment activated the mouse p27 promotor in reporter gene experiments, indicating a transcriptional regulation. However, the relatively moderate induction of p27 mRNA levels by Dex did not explain the strong increase of p27 protein in CEM and S49.1 cells. We found clear evidence for a posttranslational mechanism responsible for the robust increase in p27 protein. Dex treatment of S49.1 and CEM cells increases the half-life of p27 protein, which indicates that decreased protein degradation is the primary mechanism of p27 induction by glucocorticoids. Interestingly, we found that Dex treatment decreased the protein and mRNA levels of the negative regulator of p27 protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Skp2. We conclude that the cell cycle inhibitor p27 and its negative regulator Skp2 are key players in the glucocorticoid-induced growth suppression of T-lymphoma cells and should be considered as potential drug targets to improve therapies of T-cell malignancies.",,"['Kullmann, Michael K', 'Grubbauer, Claudia', 'Goetsch, Katrin', 'Jakel, Heidelinde', 'Podmirseg, Silvio R', 'Trockenbacher, Alexander', 'Ploner, Christian', 'Cato, Andrew C B', 'Weiss, Carsten', 'Kofler, Reinhard', 'Hengst, Ludger']","['Kullmann MK', 'Grubbauer C', 'Goetsch K', 'Jakel H', 'Podmirseg SR', 'Trockenbacher A', 'Ploner C', 'Cato AC', 'Weiss C', 'Kofler R', 'Hengst L']","['Division of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria. michael.kullmann@i-med.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130709,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D3/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Luciferases', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Skp2', 'T-ALL', 'cell cycle control', 'dexamethasone', 'glucocorticoid', 'lymphoma', 'p27Kip1', 'proliferation']",2013/08/03 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2013/08/03 06:00'],"['2013/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['25622 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.25622 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2013 Aug 15;12(16):2625-35. doi: 10.4161/cc.25622.

MAIN METHODS: Cell viability, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DPPH radical-scavenging activity, beta-hexosaminidase release, production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and phosphorylation of Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were determined by MTT assay, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay, DPPH radical-scavenging assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Ph1 and BioA dose-dependently inhibited the formation of ROS and the release of beta-hexosaminidase from the RBL-2H3 cells and also showed DPPH radical-scavenging activity. Ph1 and BioA suppressed the antigen-induced phosphorylation of the downstream signaling intermediates, including MAPK and Akt, which are critical for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and also significantly attenuated the production of IgE-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-alpha. SIGNIFICANCE: Phloretin and biochanin A attenuate the degranulation and allergic cytokine production through inhibition of intracellular ROS production and the phosphorylation of Akt and the MAPKs, such as ERK1/2, p38, and JNK.

METHODS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to determine the expression of PTEN and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) as well as the effects of CDA-II on them. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) was used to identify the methylation patterns of PTEN and the effects of CDA-II on them. RESULTS: PTEN was completely methylated in high-risk MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformed from MDS. High expressions of DNMTs proteins, especially DNMT3b protein were found in high-risk MDS and AML cells transformed from MDS. PTEN expression level was increased from 0.02 +/- 0.01 at control group to 0.23 +/- 0.11, 0.54 +/- 0.11 and 0.92 +/- 0.13 after treatment with CDA-II at 2, 4 and 8 mg/ml (P<0.01). If the cells were treated with CDA-II at 4 mg/ml for 12, 24 and 48 hours, PTEN expression level was up- regulated to 0.15 +/- 0.06, 0.52 +/- 0.12 and 0.89 +/- 0.13, which were significantly higher than that of control group 0.02 +/- 0.01 (P<0.01). CDA-II could significantly down-regulate the expression of DNMTs in MUTZ-1 cells in a dose-(r=0.999, 0.992, 0.995, P<0.01) and time-dependent (r=0.989, 0.981, 0.985, P<0.05) manner, which led to the demethylation of PTEN.

METHODS: The clinical data of 25 AL patients, including 14 cases for induction chemotherapy, 8 for consolidation chemotherapy and 3 for reinduction therapy, which were treated with HD- DNR (DNR dosage of 90 mg/m(2)x 3 d) between June 2010 and August 2012 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed, the adverse reaction of chemotherapy, especially cardiac toxicity and therapeutic effect were evaluated. RESULTS: Most of the adverse reactions were mild, including cardiac toxicity, and no patient discontinued therapy because of HD-DNR related toxicities. Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions occurred only in the infection (56%) and diarrhea (12%). Withdrawal or dose reduction due to strong adverse reactions was not observed in all patients. Adverse reactions of infections (92%), lower ejection fraction(52.6%), diarrhea (48%), nausea (36%), vomiting (36%), dental ulcer (36%) and myocardial ischemia (32%) were relatively more common. The median time of neutrophil count reached to >/= 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet >/= 20 x 10(9)/L were both 21 days(ranged 9-31 and 9-38 days). Nine patients were complicated with infections before chemotherapy and 14 after chemotherapy, mainly occurred in gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. Gastrointestinal, liver and kidney toxicity was slight. The cardiac ejection decreased in 10 cases, but only 1 reached grade 2 without clinical symptoms. Of the 14 AL patients for induction chemotherapy, 13 achieved hematological complete remission. Eight patients received HD-DNR as consolidation chemotherapy remained complete remission, while 3 refractory/relapsed patients remained non-remission. CONCLUSION: The adverse reaction of HD-DNR based chemotherapy for AL treatment was mild, no obvious cardiac adverse reaction occurred.

The clinical characteristics, the event-free survival (EFS), the overall survival (OS) and the prognostic analysis were evaluated. RESULTS: (1) Of the 103 patients, 62 were boys and 41 girls, with a median age of 12.3 years old. According to immunophenotyping, 90 (87.4% ) of 103 patients were diagnosed as B-ALL and 13 (12.6%) as T-ALL. According to risk factor, 65 (63.1%) were in intermediate risk group (MR-ALL) and 38 (36.9%) in high risk group (HR-ALL). Central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) happened in 4 (3.9%) patients at diagnosis. Of the 89 patients received chromosome test, 58 (65.2%) obtained the test results, including 21(36.2%) with aberrational chromosomes and 37 (63.8%) with normal karyotype. Of 81 patients received molecular biological test, 16 (19.8%) were positive for fusion gene. (2) After induction therapy, 97 (94.2%) obtained complete remission (CR). Twenty-eight patients relapsed with a median time of 11.9 months (ranged 2.9-57.8 months), and 38 (36.9%) patients died during the treatment. As of September 30, 2012, the median follow-up was 47 months (ranged 0.4-92.6 months). The 5-year EFS and 5-year OS of ALL patients were (60.2 +/- 4.8)% and(64.1 +/- 4.7)%. The 5-year EFS of MR-ALL and HR-ALL were (73.8 +/- 5.5)% and (31.6 +/- 8.3)% (P<0.01), the 5-year OS of MR- ALL and HR-ALL were (78.5 +/- 5.1)% and (35.9 +/- 8.0)% (P<0.01), respectively. (3) Cox proportion hazard regression model analysis indicated that age of 14-18 years old and BCR- ABL translocation or t(9;22) were independent risk prognostic factor for 5-year EFS.

METHODS: The complete data of 23 patients in our department from December 2009 to December 2010 were collected. Their blood ammonia levels, transaminase, serum albumin and blood coagulation function before, during and after the L-Asp application were assayed. RESULTS: (1) All patients had elevated blood ammonia level after the L- Asp application. This occurred 2 days after the beginning of treatment and the median time to reach peak level (ranged from 194 to 446 mumol/L, with a median value of 300 mumol/L) was 4 days. It returned to normal level after a median time of 5 days (ranged 3-7 days) with drug withdrawal. Of the 23 patients studied, 3 developed hepatic encephalopathy. (2) All patients appeared lower blood fibrinogen, 10 cases (43.5%) with lower fibrinogen only, while 13 cases (56.5%) with both prolonged APTT and lower fibrinogen. The lowest level of fibrinogen was detected at 1 week after drug application. Of the 23 patients, 14 (60.9%) had mild lower blood fibrinogen (1-2 g/L), and 9 (39.1%) had significantly lower fibrinogen (0-1 g/L). (3) Six cases (26.1%) had slightly elevated level of transaminase (<2 times the upper limits of normal), 8 (34.8%) appeared hypoalbuminemia. CONCLUSION: As the incidence of elevated blood ammonia levels was high in the application of L-Asp, the level of blood ammonia should be closely monitored to avoid the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy, especially in elderly patients and patients with previous liver disease or long-term heavy drinking. L-Asp can also lead to low fibrinogen level, hypoalbuminemia and abnormal transaminase.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics, relevant examination data, diagnosis methods and follow-up data about 44 leukemia cases complicated with active TB from January 2006 to December 2011 in our single center. RESULTS: The prevalence of leukemia complicated with active TB was 1.70% (pulmonary TB 1.35%, extra-pulmonary TB 0.35%) and no statistically significant difference was found between each subgroup of acute and chronic leukemia groups (P>0.05). Most of the patients were men, with a male to female ratio of 2.14:1, the median age of 40 years old (range 16 to 78), presenting as atypical clinical manifestations, such as high fever, cough, and so on. Eighteen patients (40.9%) were diagnosed with definitely etiological evidence while the other 26 patients (59.1%) were diagnosed clinically. The extra-pulmonary TB group had a higher purified protein derivative (PPD) test positive rate than that of the pulmonary TB group (88.9% vs 42.9%, P=0.020). The chest CT and T-cell spot of tuberculosis test (T-SPOT.TB) were helpful tools for diagnosis. The potential risk factors included age, sex, nutritional status, neutropenia, decreased cellular immunity, type and course of leukemia, etc. The significant differences in age, gender, administration route of immunosuppressive drugs were found between neutropenic and non-neutropenic groups (P<0.05). The efficacy of first-line anti-tuberculosis therapy was 83.7% and the total course to cure TB was around 12 months. Four patients were dead due to pulmonary TB with a 9.1% attributable mortality. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of leukemia complicated with active TB is higher than the general population in our single center.

METHODS: Mutation analysis of the entire coding region of CEBPA gene in 206 de novo AML patients was performed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequence analysis and fragment length analysis. RESULTS: Of 206 AML patients, 31 (15%) had CEBPA gene mutations, including 23 with double mutations (duCEBPA) and 8 with single mutation (siCEBPA). CEBPA gene mutations presented mainly in M2 subtype or intermediate risk patients. As compared with those with wild type CEBPA gene, patients with mutated CEBPA gene were of higher white blood cell counts [20.92(0.86-351.43)x 10(9)//L vs 8.17(0.47-295.2) x 10(9)/L, P=0.003], higher hemoglobin levels [97.5(51-128) g/L vs 80.5(13-153) g/L, P=0.015] and lower platelet counts [27.5(5-81)x 10(9)//L vs 44(3-548)x 10(9)/L, P=0.004]. Patients with CEBPA gene mutation had higher complete remission (CR) rate than those with wild type (P=0.009). While co-existing of NPM1 and siCEBPA mutations was observed in M5 subtype (2/8, 25%), NPM1 gene mutation was not present in any patients with duCEBPA mutation (0/23, 0%). Dynamic tracking analysis showed that CEBPA mutations disappeared at CR, and the same mutations re-appeared at relapse. When compared to sequence analysis, the coincidence rate of CEBPA mutations detected by fragment length analysis was 100% (54/54). CONCLUSION: CEBPA gene mutation is a recurring genetic change in AML patients and has a certain correlation with clinical and laboratory features.

Significant progress has been made in the past 2 decades to improve our understanding of NK cell biology. Here we review recent discoveries, including a better comprehension of the ""education"" of NK cells to achieve functional competence during their maturation and the discovery of ""memory"" responses by NK cells, suggesting that they might also contribute to adaptive immunity. The improved understanding of NK cell biology has forged greater awareness that these cells play integral early roles in immune responses. In addition, several promising clinical therapies have been used to exploit NK cell functions in treating patients with cancer. As our molecular understanding improves, these and future immunotherapies should continue to provide promising strategies to exploit the unique functions of NK cells to treat cancer, infections, and other pathologic conditions.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Deregulation of apoptosis is one of the important features of AML and to understand the molecular mechanism underlying apoptosis and its contribution to tumor progression, this study aimed to evaluate anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein expression in AML and correlate with FLT3 parameters for their role in prognosis of disease.Bcl2 and FLT3 protein expression was quantified by flow cytometry on leukemic blasts in total 174 de novo AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and aplastic anemia patients. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), Tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) point mutations and quantification of mRNA level was carried out using PCR and RT-PCR methods. The incidence of Bcl2 positivity was 71% in AML patients. Bcl2 positivity was significantly associated with CD34+ and CD117+ AML. Bcl2 positivity tended to be associated with reduced DFS while Bcl2 positivity with FLT3 protein positivity was significantly associated with reduced DFS. In multivariate analysis, Bcl2+ and combined Bcl2+/FLT3 protein+ along with high WBC count emerged as poor prognostic factors for reduced DFS and high blast count for predicting reduced OS.

Diagnostic clonal chromosomal abnormalities provide important prognostic information and are among the most important factors in predicting initial response to chemotherapy, duration of remission and overall survival. METHODS: This study analyzed chromosomal abnormalities in bone marrow aspirates of 50 children diagnosed with acute myeloid leuckemia (AML). RESULTS: The culture success rate was 94%, clonal chromosomal abnormalities constituted 62% and recurrent chromosomal abnormalities were 56%. In the favorable prognostic category, there were 51.6% of cases with t(8;21)(q22;q22), 16.1% had t(15;17)(q22;q21), and a total of 12.9% had chromosome 16 rearrangement. The adverse risk category showed a low frequency of t(9;11)(p22;q13); t(1;22)(p13;q13); inv(3)( q21q26); add 4(q35) and ring chromosome. According to fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) results in 16 cytogenetically normal patients, there were no CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion genes observed in chromosome 16 rearrangements. DISCUSSION: Larger studies of this kind may provide more information about chromosome 16 rearrangements in cytogenetically normal patients. The present analysis suggests that both age and cytogenetics are important strategies for risk stratification (outcome).

Compelling evidence indicates that more modern, antigen-specific immunotherapeutic approaches are also feasible and hold strong potential to be clinically effective. Amongst these, particularly promising is the use of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with antigens or direct application of in vitro transcribed RNA encoding for leukemia-associated antigens, since this approach allows to circumvent HLA-restriction of the leukemia-associated T cell epitopes that have been eventually identified. Combining these strategies with monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1, may help to obtain even stronger immune responses and better clinical results.

The interruption of imatinib treatment is often followed by clinical relapse, suggesting a failure in the killing of residual leukaemic stem cells. There is need to identify alternative selective molecular targets for this disease and develop more effective therapeutic approaches. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is an epigenetic process that greatly diversifies the repertoire of the transcriptome. AS orchestrates interactions between various types of proteins and between proteins and nucleic acids. Changes caused by individual splicing events in the cells are small, however, ""splicing programs"" typically react to these individual changes with considerable effects in cell proliferation, cell survival, and apoptosis. Current evidence suggests a pivotal role of AS in leukemias, particularly in myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL). From these studies and studies in other malignances, it is clear that splicing abnormalities play a significant role in malignant transformation. Evaluation of AS events in CML can be used to identify novel disease markers and drugsensitive targets to overcome the limits of the small molecule inhibitors currently used for treating patients with CML.

ATM is a principal DNA damage response gene and biallelic ATM alterations lead to ATM functional loss and chemoresistance. The introduction of new therapies, such as intensive chemoimmunotherapy and inhibition of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, has changed clinical responses for the majority of CLL tumors including those with 11q deletion, but it remains to be determined whether these strategies can prevent clonal evolution of tumors with biallelic ATM alterations. In this review we discuss ATM function and the consequences of its loss during CLL pathogenesis, differences in clinical behavior of tumors with monoallelic and biallelic ATM alterations, and we outline possible approaches for targeting the ATM null CLL phenotype.",,"['Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Skowronska, Anna']","['Stankovic T', 'Skowronska A']","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham , Birmingham , UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130912,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Jacobsen Distal 11q Deletion Syndrome/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['11q deletion', 'ATM mutations', 'CLL', 'prognosis']",2013/08/03 06:00,2015/07/16 06:00,['2013/08/03 06:00'],"['2013/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2013.829919 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2014 Jun;55(6):1227-39. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2013.829919.

To clarify the effect of MTR A2756G on the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a meta-analysis of all relevant studies was performed. The fixed effects model showed that the 2756A allele was associated with a decreased risk of childhood ALL compared with the G allele (ORA vs. G = 0.872; 95% CI 0.782-0.974; p = 0.015, I(2) = 46.9%). Additionally, when comparing subjects with ALL and controls with AA vs. AG or AA vs. AG + GG (dominant model), significant differences were found in the fixed effects model (ORAA vs. AG = 0.869; 95% CI 0.760-0.994; p = 0.040, I(2) = 26.4%; ORAA vs. AG+ GG = 0.858; 95% CI 0.754-0.976; p = 0.020, I(2) = 39.6%). In a subgroup analysis in a population with the same background, individuals with the AA genotype had a reduced risk of developing ALL compared to individuals with the AG genotype.

DISCUSSION: Leukemia is caused by malignant hematopoietic stem cells and precursors. Important molecules and signals are involved in interactions between leukemic cells and their microenvironment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in expression regulation of oncogenes, transcription factors, signaling molecules and in eventual fate of the cell.

23905201,,Publisher,,,,,2010,ML309: A potent inhibitor of R132H mutant IDH1 capable of reducing 2-hydroxyglutarate production in U87 MG glioblastoma cells,,,"The emergence of the role of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in cancer resulted from genomic sequencing for 22 glioma genomes that found recurrent mutation of IDH1 on chromosome 2q33. Subsequent sequencing of over 900 tumors revealed recurrent IDH mutations in both IDH1 and IDH2 in up to 70% of secondary gliomas and in ~16-17% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. The mutated residue in IDH1 is most commonly arginine 132, which is most often replaced with either histidine or cysteine. This active site mutation results in loss of activity for metabolism of isocitrate, but confers gain-of-function for the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Herein we describe the quantitative high throughput screening of the R132H mutant IDH1 enzyme and the subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization of the small molecule hit. The resulting probe, ML309, is capable of potent and selective inhibition of mutant IDH1 and effectively lowers cell-based production of 2-HG in a U87MG mutant glioblastoma cell line. We hope that this probe leads to important studies into the role of IDH1 as an oncogene, 2HG as an oncometabolite, and can potentially provide opportunities to discover much needed therapies for glioma and AML patients in the future.",,"['Davis, Mindy', 'Pragani, Rajan', 'Popovici-Muller, Janeta', 'Gross, Stefan', 'Thorne, Natasha', 'Salituro, Frank', 'Fantin, Valeria', 'Straley, Kimberly', 'Su, Michael', 'Dang, Lenny', 'Simeonov, Anton', 'Shen, Min', 'Boxer, Matthew B.']","['Davis M', 'Pragani R', 'Popovici-Muller J', 'Gross S', 'Thorne N', 'Salituro F', 'Fantin V', 'Straley K', 'Su M', 'Dang L', 'Simeonov A', 'Shen M', 'Boxer MB']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,,2013/08/02 06:00,2013/08/02 06:00,,,['NBK153220 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20130802,['20130508'],['20120416'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Probe Reports from the NIH Molecular Libraries Program'],['2013/08/02 06:00']

METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 100 non-electronic records of patients with Ph(+) chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib mesylate. The study period was from January 2001 to January2011. Data were analyzed by Chi-Square and Correspondence analysis using the Statistical Analysis System software package. RESULTS: At the beginning of treatment 41% of patients were in advanced stages of the disease. The unavailability of the drug (44.8%) and myelotoxicity (25.7%) were the most frequent reasons for interruption. The adherence rate was < 90% in 47% of the cases.

The mechanism of chemoresistance is still poorly understood. Recently, more and more evidence showed microRNAs (miRNAs) modulated many key molecules and pathways involved in chemotherapy. microRNA-106a (miR-106a) has been implicated in many cancers, but its role in ovarian cancer and drug resistance still remains unexplored. This study was to investigate whether miR-106a mediated resistance of the ovarian cancer cell line A2780 to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (DDP). The different levels of miR-106a in A2780 cells and their resistant variant A2780/DDP cells were identified by using real-time PCR. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to analyze the effect of miR-106a on cisplatin resistance of these paired cells. Real-time PCR, Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay were applied to explore whether Mcl-1 was a target of miR-106a. As compared to A2780 cells, the expression of miR-106a was down-regulated in the cisplatin resistant cell line A2780/DDP. Moreover, knockdown of miR-106a dramatically decreased antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induced by cisplatin in A2780 cells, while overexpression of miR-106a significantly increased antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induced by cisplatin in A2780/DDP cells. Furthermore, miR-106a inhibited cell survival and cisplatin resistance through downregulating the expression of Mcl-1. Mcl-1 was a direct target of miR-106a. These results suggest that miR-106a may provide a novel mechanism for understanding cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer by modulating Mcl-1.",,"['Rao, Yu-Mei', 'Shi, Hui-Rong', 'Ji, Mei', 'Chen, Cai-Hong']","['Rao YM', 'Shi HR', 'Ji M', 'Chen CH']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, China. raoyumei01@sina.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, China.', 'Center of Reproductive Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450052, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130801,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Ofatumumab (OFA, trade name Arzerra) is a fully human CD20-specific antibody that is active against CD20-positive B-cell lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. In order to further enhance the anticancer effect of OFA, anti-CD20 OFA has been conjugated with highly cytotoxic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) through a cathepsin-B-cleavable valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linkage to form OFA-vcMMAE and the anti-tumor activity of OFA-vcMMAE against CD20-positive B lymphoma cells are then evaluated in vitro and in vivo. As a result, conjugation of OFA with MMAE has kept the initial effector functional activities of OFA such as binding affinity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) as well as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, the conjugation of MMAE significantly improved the cytotoxic activity of OFA against CD20-positive cells (i.e., Raji, Daudi and WIL2-S cells) but not against CD20-negative K562 cells. On the other hand, OFA-vcMMAE was modulated from the CD20-positive cell surface and then entered the lysosomes by receptor-mediated endocytosis, underwent proteolytic degradation and released active drug MMAE to induce apoptotic cell death through a caspase-3-like protease-dependent pathway. Surprisingly, OFA-vcMMAE completely inhibited the growth of CD20-positive Daudi and Ramos lymphoma xenografts in vivo, and exhibited greater anti-tumor activity than unconjugated OFA, suggesting that the anti-tumor activity of anti-CD20 antibody can be enhanced by conjugation with MMAE.

FeLV-945, the predominant isolate associated with non-T-cell disease in a natural cohort, is a member of FeLV subgroup A but differs in sequence from the FeLV-A prototype, FeLV-A/61E, in the surface glycoprotein (SU) and long terminal repeat (LTR). Substitution of the FeLV-945 LTR into FeLV-A/61E resulted in pathogenesis indistinguishable from that of FeLV-A/61E, namely, thymic lymphoma of T-cell origin. In contrast, substitution of both FeLV-945 LTR and SU into FeLV-A/61E resulted in multicentric lymphoma of non-T-cell origin. These results implicated the FeLV-945 SU as a determinant of pathogenic spectrum. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that FeLV-945 SU can act in the absence of other unique sequence elements of FeLV-945 to determine the disease spectrum. Substitution of FeLV-A/61E SU with that of FeLV-945 altered the clinical presentation and resulted in tumors that demonstrated expression of CD45R in the presence or absence of CD3. Despite the evident expression of CD45R, a typical B-cell marker, T-cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) gene rearrangement indicated a T-cell origin.

This study also presents a structural comparison of MERS-CoV RBD with other coronavirus RBDs, successfully positioning MERS-CoV on the landscape of coronavirus evolution and providing insights into receptor binding by MERS-CoV. Furthermore, we found that MERS-CoV RBD functions as an effective entry inhibitor of MERS-CoV. The identified MERS-CoV RBD may also serve as a potential candidate for MERS-CoV subunit vaccines.

Many studies have shown that tumor-initiating cells exhibit a chemotherapeutic tolerance characteristic. However, whether the MDR cells possess tumor-initiating cells properties and its underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we utilized a well-established MDR cell line K562/A02 enriched by doxorubicin from K562 cells to determine if the K562/A02 cells possess tumor-initiating properties and investigated its potential molecular mechanisms. We observed that the expressions of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, all of which are well-characterized stem cell markers, in K562/A02 cells were elevated in comparison to parental K562 cells; in addition, we found that K562/A02 cells exhibited more potent in vitro and in vivo tumor-initiating properties, as revealed by sphere assay, self-renewal assay, soft agar assay, and animal studies. Furthermore, our data suggest that snail and twist1, two well known transcriptional factors for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, may be potentially involved in the acquisition of tumor-initiating properties of K562/A02 cells.

METHODS: Cases of leukaemia, lymphoma and central nervous system (CNS) tumours were derived from the national TYA cancer register (1996-2005). Incidence rates (IR) and trends were assessed using Poisson regression. Seasonality of diagnosis and birth was assessed using Poisson and logistic regression respectively with cosine functions of varying periods. RESULTS: There were 6251 cases diagnosed with leukaemia (n = 1299), lymphoma (n = 3070) and CNS tumours (n = 1882), the overall IR was 92 (95% CI 89-96) per 1,000,000 15-24 year olds per year.There was significant evidence of seasonality around the time of diagnosis for Hodgkin's lymphoma (P < 0.001) with a peak in February, and for 'other CNS tumours' (P = 0.010) with peaks in December and June. Birth peaks for those with 'other Gliomas' (Gliomas other than Astrocytoma and Ependymoma) were observed in May and November (P = 0.015).

Using DNA microarrays, we recently identified several genes specifically deregulated in T- and B-leukemias induced by this virus. RESULTS: In the present study, probsets associated with T-CD8+ leukemias were analyzed and we validated the expression profile of the Parm-1 gene. PARM-1 is a member of the mucin family. We showed that human PARM-1 is an intact secreted protein accumulating predominantly, such as murine PARM-1, at the Golgi and in the early and late endosomes. PARM-1 colocalization with alpha-tubulin suggests that its trafficking within the cell involves the microtubule cytoskeleton. Also, the protein co-localizes with caveolin-1 which probably mediates its internalization. Transient transfection of both mouse and human Parm-1 cDNAs conferred anchorage- and serum-independent growth and enhanced cell proliferation. Moreover, deletion mutants of human PARM-1 without either extracellular or cytoplasmic portions seem to retain the ability to induce anchorage-independent growth of NIH/3T3 cells. In addition, PARM-1 increases ERK1/2, but more importantly AKT and STAT3 phosphorylation.

Cox proportion hazards regression: hazard ratio(HR) = 0.265, 95%CI: 0.025-2.761, P = 0.267. Among 6 patients with recurrence and(or) metastasis, 5 had mitotic count > 5/50 HPF. Cox proportion hazards regression (HR = 0.059, 95%CI: 0.004 - 0.976, P = 0.048) showed that IM can improve the progression free survival of mitotic count > 5/50 HPF group versus mitotic count < 5/50 HPF. The most common IM-related side effects were edema, nausea, abdominal discomfort, leukemia, etc. Most of them were Grade 1-2. CONCLUSIONS: Intermediate risk GST has a low rate of recurrence or metastasis. And 1-year IM treatment may improve the prognosis of the patients with mitotic counts > 5/50 HPF.

We have identified an unusual cluster of deletions at 13q14.2-13q21.33 in an 80-year-old father of a monozygotic twin pair discordant for schizophrenia, who developed chronic leukemia (CLL) at age 69. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The breakpoints for individual deletions in this cluster was identified by Affymetrix Human Array 6.0 screening. RESULTS: The deleted segments harbours a number of genes, most associated with cancer as well as a high concentration of LINEs, SINEs and related repeats. The derived chromosome represents an intra-chromosomal re-arrangement that quickly overtook blood progenitor cells probably before age 69 as a cause of CLL. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the role of ongoing de novo changes at susceptible sites, such as repeat rich regions, in the human genome.

The mechanism by which AML mediates this complication is unknown but one widely accepted explanation is that AML depletes the BM of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through displacement. We sought to investigate how AML affects hematopoiesis by quantifying residual normal hematopoietic subpopulations in the BM of immunodeficient mice transplanted with human AML cells with a range of genetic lesions. The numbers of normal mouse HSCs were preserved whereas normal progenitors and other downstream hematopoietic cells were reduced following transplantation of primary AMLs, findings consistent with a differentiation block at the HSC-progenitor transition, rather than displacement. Once removed from the leukemic environment, residual normal hematopoietic cells differentiated normally and outcompeted steady-state hematopoietic cells, indicating that this effect is reversible. We confirmed the clinical significance of this by ex vivo analysis of normal hematopoietic subpopulations from BM of 16 patients with AML. This analysis demonstrated that the numbers of normal CD34(+)CD38(-) stem-progenitor cells were similar in the BM of AML patients and controls, whereas normal CD34(+)CD38(+) progenitors were reduced. Residual normal CD34(+) cells from patients with AML were enriched in long-term culture, initiating cells and repopulating cells compared with controls. In conclusion the data do not support the idea that BM failure in AML is due to HSC depletion.

It is characterized by a malignant clone of B cells in the bone marrow, blood and secondary lymphoid tissues. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small, noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of target messenger RNAs at the posttranscriptional level. Previous studies have suggested that miRNAs are extensively involved in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Aberrant expression of certain miRNAs has been observed in CLL. Associations between miRNAs and chromosomal abnormalities suggest that miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of CLL. Moreover, miRNAs may be used as novel biomarkers for the prognosis of CLL.

In the present study, pre-immunization with asialoglycophorin A (containing the CD176 oligosaccharide chains) was able to significantly improve the survival time of mice carrying CD176+ leukemia as compared to the control mice without the immunization. Furthermore, the passive transfer of CD176 antiserum which reacted only with the tumor-associated CD176 in cancer cells, was able to effectively prolong the survival time of CD176+ leukemia mice. In particular, the CD176 antiserum treatment could inhibit the growth and spreading of CD176+ leukemic cells in bone marrow, spleen, liver, and lung as evidenced by histopathological examination. CD176 antiserum could induce the apoptosis of CD176+ leukemic cells in vivo in a manner as previously observed in vitro. The data provided strong evidence that both CD176 antigen-based active immunotherapy and CD176 antibody-based passive immunotherapy lead to a therapeutic response in CD176+ leukemia mice.

Nonetheless, mistakes can happen, leading to the generation of aberrant rearrangements, such as Tcra/d-Igh inter-locus translocations that are a hallmark of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) deficiency. Current evidence indicates that these translocations arise from the persistence of unrepaired breaks converging at different stages of thymocyte differentiation. Here we show that a defect in feedback control of RAG2 activity gives rise to bi-locus breaks and damage on Tcra/d and Igh in the same T cell at the same developmental stage, which provides a direct mechanism for generating these inter-locus rearrangements. Both the RAG2 C-terminus and ATM prevent bi-locus RAG-mediated cleavage through modulation of three-dimensional conformation (higher-order loops) and nuclear organization of the two loci.

We found a significantly increased thickness of the muscularis propria in cats with lymphoma and IBD compared with healthy cats. The mean thickness of the muscularis propria in cats with lymphoma or IBD was twice the thickness of that of healthy cats, and was the major contributor to significant overall bowel wall thickening in the duodenum and jejunum. A muscularis to submucosa ratio >1 is indicative of an abnormal bowel segment. Colic lymph nodes in cats with lymphoma were increased in size compared with healthy cats. In cats with gastrointestinal lymphoma and histologic transmural infiltration of the small intestines, colic or jejunal lymph nodes were rounded, increased in size and hypoechoic.",,"['Daniaux, Lise A', 'Laurenson, Michele P', 'Marks, Stanley L', 'Moore, Peter F', 'Taylor, Sandra L', 'Chen, Rachel X', 'Zwingenberger, Allison L']","['Daniaux LA', 'Laurenson MP', 'Marks SL', 'Moore PF', 'Taylor SL', 'Chen RX', 'Zwingenberger AL']","['1William R Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130730,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary', 'Intestine, Small/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Ultrasonography']",,,2013/08/01 06:00,2014/09/13 06:00,['2013/08/01 06:00'],"['2013/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1098612X13498596 [pii]', '10.1177/1098612X13498596 [doi]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2014 Feb;16(2):89-98. doi: 10.1177/1098612X13498596.

Through interactions with the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins activate genes critical for blocking differentiation, such as HOXA9. Here we investigate whether the MLL-PAFc interaction can be exploited therapeutically using both genetic and biochemical approaches. We tested the genetic requirement of the PAFc in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using a conditional allele of the PAFc subunit, Cdc73. We show that the PAFc is indiscriminately necessary for the proliferation of AML cells through the epigenetic regulation of proleukemogenic target genes, such as MEIS1 and Bcl2. To investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting the MLL-PAFc interaction, we engineered a dominant negative fragment of MLL capable of binding to the PAFc. Disruption of the MLL-PAFc interaction selectively inhibits the proliferation of MLL leukemic cells without affecting cells transformed by an unrelated E2A-HLF fusion protein. Using in vivo hematopoietic reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that disruption of the MLL-PAFc does not alter normal hematopoietic stem cell function. Together, our data show a selective growth inhibition of MLL-associated leukemic cells and tolerance of normal hematopoiesis to disruption of the MLL-PAFc interaction establishing the MLL-PAFc interaction as an attractive therapeutic target.",,"['Muntean, Andrew G', 'Chen, Wei', 'Jones, Morgan', 'Granowicz, Eric M', 'Maillard, Ivan', 'Hess, Jay L']","['Muntean AG', 'Chen W', 'Jones M', 'Granowicz EM', 'Maillard I', 'Hess JL']","['Department of Pathology, Department of Medicine;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130730,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2013/08/01 06:00,2013/11/14 06:00,['2013/08/01 06:00'],"['2013/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)52948-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-02-486977 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Sep 12;122(11):1914-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-02-486977.

We investigated the perspectives of parents of children with leukaemia on the role of paediatric oncologists in such discussion. METHODS: Qualitative study comprising 33 audio-recorded parent-oncologist consultations and semi-structured interviews with 67 parents during the year following diagnosis. RESULTS: Consultations soon after the diagnosis were largely devoid of overt discussion of parental emotion. Interviewed parents did not describe a need for such discussion. They spoke of being comforted by oncologists' clinical focus, by the biomedical information they provided and by their calmness and constancy. When we explicitly asked parents 1 year later about the oncologists' role in emotional support, they overwhelmingly told us that they did not want to discuss their feelings with oncologists. They wanted to preserve the oncologists' focus on their child's clinical care, deprecated anything that diverted from this and spoke of the value of boundaries in the parent-oncologist relationship. CONCLUSION: Parents were usually comforted by oncologists, but this was not achieved in the way suggested by communication guidance.

Recently a number of clinical investigations are being undertaken to assess the potential therapeutic application of various anti-angiogenic agents. Many of these angiogenesis inhibitors are directed against the functions of endothelial cells, which are considered as the building blocks of blood vessels. Similarly, roots of a traditional medicinal plant, Eurycoma longifolia, can be used as an alternative treatment to prevent and treat the angiogenesis-related diseases. In the present study, antiangiogenic potential of partially purified quassinoid-rich fraction (TAF273) of E. longifolia root extract was evaluated using ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis models and the anti-angiogenic efficacy of TAF273 was investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). TAF273 caused significant suppression in sprouting of microvessels in rat aorta with IC50 11.5mug/ml. TAF273 (50mug/ml) showed remarkable inhibition (63.13%) of neovascularization in chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryo. Tumor histology also revealed marked reduction in extent of vascularization. In vitro, TAF273 significantly inhibited the major angiogenesis steps such as proliferation, migration and differentiation of HUVECs. Phytochemical analysis revealed high content of quassinoids in TAF273. Specially, HPLC characterization showed that TAF273 is enriched with eurycomanone, 13alpha(21)-epoxyeurycomanone and eurycomanol. These results demonstrated that the antiangiogenic activity of TAF273 may be due to its inhibitory effect on endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration which could be attributed to the high content of quassinoids in E. longifolia.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Al-Salahi, Omar Saeed Ali', 'Kit-Lam, Chan', 'Majid, Amin Malik Shah Abdul', 'Al-Suede, Fouad Saleih R', 'Mohammed Saghir, Sultan Ayesh', 'Abdullah, Wan Zaidah', 'Ahamed, Mohamed B Khadeer', 'Yusoff, Narazah Mohd']","['Al-Salahi OS', 'Kit-Lam C', 'Majid AM', 'Al-Suede FS', 'Mohammed Saghir SA', 'Abdullah WZ', 'Ahamed MB', 'Yusoff NM']","['Advanced Medical and Dental Institute (AMDI), Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), 13200 Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130727,United States,Microvasc Res,Microvascular research,0165035,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chorioallantoic Membrane/blood supply/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelial Cells/*drug effects', '*Eurycoma', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Quassins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Time Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2013/08/01 06:00,2014/07/25 06:00,['2013/08/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0026-2862(13)00109-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mvr.2013.07.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Microvasc Res. 2013 Nov;90:30-9. doi: 10.1016/j.mvr.2013.07.007.

The aim of this study was to investigate the function of the amino-terminal 476 residue fragment (p52) of VacA and the possible molecular mechanisms responsible for its induction of proinflammatory cytokines secretion and apoptosis. Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was used as an in vitro model to study proinflammatory cytokines secretion and apoptosis induced by transfection of a recombinant plasmid encoding the amino-terminal 476 residue fragment (p52) of VacA. The results showed that VacA p52 overexpression induced the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species in THP-1 cells in a time-dependent manner.

These enzymes alter the acetylation of several proteins, including histones and transcription factors, as well as several other proteins directly involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Valproic acid (VPA) is a HDAC inhibitor that has been investigated in several clinical AML studies, usually in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for treatment of patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy, for example older patients, and many of these patients have relapsed or primary resistant leukemia. The toxicity of VPA in these patients is low and complete hematological remission lasting for several months has been reported for a few patients (<5% of included patients), but increased peripheral blood platelet counts are seen for 30 to 40% of patients and may last for up to 1 to 2 years. We review the biological effects of VPA on human AML cells, the results from clinical studies of VPA in the treatment of AML and the evidence for combining VPA with new targeted therapy. However, it should be emphasized that VPA has not been investigated in randomized clinical studies. Despite this lack of randomized studies, we conclude that disease-stabilizing treatment including VPA should be considered especially in unfit patients, because the possibility of improving normal blood values has been documented in several studies and the risk of clinically relevant toxicity is minimal.",,"['Fredly, Hanne', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Fredly H', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, N-5021, Bergen, Norway. hanne.fredly@med.uib.no.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130730,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,,,,,2013/08/01 06:00,2013/08/01 06:01,['2013/08/01 06:00'],"['2013/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/01 06:01 [medline]']","['1868-7083-5-12 [pii]', '10.1186/1868-7083-5-12 [doi]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2013 Jul 30;5(1):12. doi: 10.1186/1868-7083-5-12.,1,,PMC3733883,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variant t(11;17) translocation produces two fusion proteins, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PLZF-RARalpha) and RARalpha-PLZF, both of which participate in leukemia development. Here we provide evidence that the activity of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), a master regulator of granulocytic differentiation, is severely impaired in leukemic promyelocytes with the t(11;17) translocation compared with those associated with the t(15;17) translocation. We show that RARalpha-PLZF inhibits myeloid cell differentiation through interactions with C/EBPalpha tethered to DNA, using ChIP and DNA capture assays. Furthermore, RARalpha-PLZF recruits HDAC1 and causes histone H3 deacetylation at C/EBPalpha target loci, thereby decreasing the expression of C/EBPalpha target genes. In line with these results, HDAC inhibitors restore in part C/EBPalpha target gene expression. These findings provide molecular evidence for a mechanism through which RARalpha-PLZF acts as a modifier oncogene that subverts differentiation in the granulocytic lineage by associating with C/EBPalpha and inhibiting its activity.",,"['Girard, Nathalie', 'Tremblay, Mathieu', 'Humbert, Magali', 'Grondin, Benoit', 'Haman, Andre', 'Labrecque, Jean', 'Chen, Bing', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Girard N', 'Tremblay M', 'Humbert M', 'Grondin B', 'Haman A', 'Labrecque J', 'Chen B', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ', 'Hoang T']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Molecular Biology Program, and Department of Pharmacology, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada H3C 3J7.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130729,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'granulocyte differentiation', 'histone modification', 'protein interaction', 'transcription inhibition']",2013/07/31 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/07/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1310067110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1310067110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Aug 13;110(33):13522-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1310067110.

More than a decade after the successful launching of IM in first-line treatment of CP-CML and the subsequent introduction of second-generation TKIs in this setting, the question of the possibility of TKI cessation in a specific subset of patients has emerged. Side-effects of TKIs, along with some patients' wish to abandon the drugs and the rising financial burden upon healthcare systems, have led to the dilemma whether IM can be safely withdrawn after achieving deep molecular remissions and which patients are suitable for this discontinuation. We examined the data of our patients with CML in search of potential canditates for cessation of TKI therapy and identified their characteristics. We also performed a thorough review of the relevant literature. Eight out of fifty patients were discriminated on grounds of sustained complete molecular response (CMR) exceeding 12 months, most of them with a low or intermediate Sokal score at diagnosis.

In this trial, we compared the antileukemic activity of standard induction and consolidation therapy with or without the addition of the kinase inhibitor sorafenib in elderly patients with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients received standard cytarabine and daunorubicin induction (7+3 regimen) and up to two cycles of intermediate-dose cytarabine consolidation. Two hundred one patients were equally randomly assigned to receive either sorafenib or placebo between the chemotherapy cycles and subsequently for up to 1 year after the beginning of therapy. The primary objective was to test for an improvement in event-free survival (EFS). Overall survival (OS), complete remission (CR) rate, tolerability, and several predefined subgroup analyses were among the secondary objectives. RESULTS: Age, sex, CR and early death (ED) probability, and prognostic factors were balanced between both study arms. Treatment in the sorafenib arm did not result in significant improvement in EFS or OS. This was also true for subgroup analyses, including the subgroup positive for FLT3 internal tandem duplications. Results of induction therapy were worse in the sorafenib arm, with higher treatment-related mortality and lower CR rates. More adverse effects occurred during induction therapy in the sorafenib arm, and patients in this arm received less consolidation chemotherapy as a result of higher induction toxicity.

Its main physiologic expression occurs in the placenta, where it participates in the maternal tolerance toward the fetus. HLA-G expression was found in embryonic tissues, in adult immune privileged organs, and in cells of the hematopoietic lineage. It is expressed in various types of primary solid (melanoma, head and neck, lung, urogenital, gastrointestinal, and breast cancers) and hematologic malignancies (acute leukemia, lymphomas) and metastases. HLA-G ectopic expression is observed in cancer, suggesting that its expression is one strategy used by tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. In this review, we will focus on HLA-G expression in cancers and its association with the prognosis. We will highlight the underlying molecular mechanisms of impaired HLA-G expression, the immune tolerant function of HLA-G in tumors, and the potential diagnostic use of membrane-bound and soluble HLA-G as a biomarker to identify tumors and to monitor disease stage.

Moreover, the SNPs located in the 3' UTR of the IRF4 gene have been linked to a down-regulation of IRF4. However, whether a low level of IRF4 is critical for CLL development remains unclear. New Zealand Black (NZB) mice are a naturally occurring, late-onset mouse model of CLL. To examine the role of a reduced level of IRF4 in CLL development, we generated, through breeding, IRF4 heterozygous mutant mice in the NZB background (NZB IRF4(+/-)). Our results show that CLL development is accelerated dramatically in the NZB IRF4(+/-) mice. The average onset of CLL in NZB mice is 12 months, but CLL cells can be detected in NZB IRF4(+/-) mice at 3 months of age. By 5 months of age, 80% of NZB IRF4(+/-) mice developed CLL. CLL cells are derived from B1 cells in mice. Interestingly, NZB IRF4(+/-) B1 cells exhibit prolonged survival, accelerated self-renewal, and defects in differentiation. Although NZB IRF4(+/-) CLL cells are resistant to apoptosis, high levels of IRF4 inhibit their survival. High levels of IRF4 also reduce the survival of MEC-1 human CLL cells. Our analysis further reveals that high levels of IRF4 suppress Akt activity and can do so without the IRF4 DNA binding domain. Thus, our findings reveal a causal relationship between a low level of IRF4 and the development of CLL and establish IRF4 as a novel regulator in the pathogenesis of CLL.",,"['Ma, Shibin', 'Shukla, Vipul', 'Fang, Leilei', 'Gould, Karen A', 'Joshi, Shantaram S', 'Lu, Runqing']","['Ma S', 'Shukla V', 'Fang L', 'Gould KA', 'Joshi SS', 'Lu R']","['From the Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130729,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Heterozygote', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Spleen/cytology']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'IRF', 'IRF4', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocyte', 'NZB', 'SNP', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cell Biology']",2013/07/31 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2013/07/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)49047-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.475913 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Sep 13;288(37):26430-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.475913.

ZAP-70 overexpression is considered a surrogate marker of a B-CLL cell subset. To test whether the differential biological characteristics of these patients also include the T helper population, we studied naive, non-terminated memory (NTEM), terminated memory (TEM) and central memory (CM) cells and cytokine expression by CD4 T lymphocytes from ZAP-70(+) and ZAP-70(-) B-CLL patients. METHODS: Expression of CD3, CD8, CD45RA, CD27, and CD28 antigens and intracytoplasmic cytokine production (IFNgamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and TNFalpha) were assessed simultaneously by nine-color flow-cytometry in peripheral blood lymphocytes from B-CLL patients. B cell ZAP-70 expression in B-CLL cells was also analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared to ZAP-70(-) B-CLL patients, ZAP-70(+) B-CLL patients showed 1) significant reduction in the naive T helper subset and expansion of NTEM and TEM subsets, 2) a decrease in the percentage of activated CD4 T lymphocytes expressing IFNgamma, TNFalpha and IL-2, and 3) an increase in the percentage of CD4 T lymphocytes expressing IL-4 or IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, in early stage B-CLL patients, ZAP-70 upregulation is associated with distinct patterns of activation/differentiation stage subset distribution and of cytokine expression in CD4 T lymphocytes.

RESULTS: Normal CD114 acquisition occurred on early blasts, peaked on promyelocytes, and decreased on granulocytes. Forty percent of CD34+ blasts expressed CD114 and one-third were early blasts. In myelodysplastic syndromes, altered CD114 distribution was more informative than density changes. In CML, CD114 density was significantly decreased on early blasts and expression was essentially limited to late blasts.

Moreover, we show in both wild-type C57BL/6 mice and in downstream of tyrosine kinase-1 transgenic mice, a mouse model with increased numbers of gammadelta NKT cells, that CD28-mediated regulation of thymic IL-4(+) NKT cells promotes the differentiation of eomesodermin(+) CD44(high) innate-like CD8(+) T cells.

Recently genetic constitution has proven to be important for apoptosis-induction responding to DNA damage. Regarding the host-specific manner of responses against DNA-damage in animal model, we have reported that infection with Friend leukemia virus (FLV) enhances the DNA damage-induced apoptosis in hematopoietic cells derived from C3H but DBA/2 mice. Furthermore, p53 or ATM knockout mice of C3H background and DNA-PK-deficient C3H SCID mice did not show the enhanced apoptosis by FLV. Recently, we could show that this host-specific apoptosis was mediated by the kinase activity of DNA-PK in association with FLV env-coding protein, gp70. Interestingly, two host proteins, acinus and MCM2, were also associated with DNA-PK and gp70 and were host-specifically overexpressed in C3H-derived cells. Our data suggest that gp70 enhances cellular DNA damage-induced signaling in association with host-specific cellular proteins, including acinus and MCM2, resulting in the activation of DNA-PK to phosphorylate P53. By introducing gp70/acinus/MCM2-associated pathways into tumor cells, cancer therapy with DNA damage-inducing agents might become much more effective. Our aim is to develop a novel form of targeted therapy that can be combined with other treatment modalities, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, using the host-specific regulatory mechanisms of apoptotic enhancement.",,"['Kurata, Morito', 'Abe, Shinya', 'Suzuki, Shiho', 'Li, Na', 'Ohnishi, Iichiro', 'Hasegawa, Maki', 'Yamamoto, Kouhei', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu']","['Kurata M', 'Abe S', 'Suzuki S', 'Li N', 'Ohnishi I', 'Hasegawa M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110704,Japan,J Med Dent Sci,Journal of medical and dental sciences,9717112,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",,,2011/01/01 00:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2013/07/31 06:00'],"['2011/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,J Med Dent Sci. 2011 Jul 4;58(2):85-8.,2,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Mcm2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Prkdc protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The correlation between rapid engraftment of neutrophils, platelets, and donor stem cells doses, as well as other recipient and donor clinical factors, was analyzed. In univariate analysis, factors correlated with neutrophil engraftment (>/=0.5 x 10(9)/L) by day 12 were achievement of complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy (CR1) before hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and high numbers of CD34+ cells, CD3+ T cells, and CD3+/CD4+ T cells.

The proliferation of MM cells may be suppressed by modifying the hematopoietic microenvironment (HME). We have previously isolated human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs) and observed that hUCBDSCs suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in KM3 cells. To examine the mechanism by which hUCBDSCs drive the inhibition of MM, KM3 cells were co-cultured with hUCBDSCs. METHODS: Interleukin (IL)-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) expression levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of membrane IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl-XL as well as the location of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) were assessed by laser confocal microscopy. The expression profiles of mIL-6R and ICAM-1 were also more precisely examined by flow cytometry, and Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and inhibitor kappa B expression levels were analyzed by western blot. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6R, ICAM-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: The protein expression levels of both sIL-6R and mIL-6R were reduced in culture conditions when KM3 cells were co-cultured with hUCBDSCs; moreover, the mRNA expression levels of IL-6R were also reduced. Nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit was inhibited in KM3 cells by co-culture with hUCBDSCs. Moreover, hUCBDSCs inhibited NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity, thereby resulting in the downregulation of NF-kappaB-regulated proteins. CONCLUSION: hUCBDSCs can suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in KM3 cells by both downregulating IL-6R expression and inhibiting NF-kappaB activity.",,"['Gao, Li', 'Zhang, Cheng', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Gao, Lei', 'Hao, Lei', 'Chen, Xing-Hua']","['Gao L', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang X', 'Gao L', 'Hao L', 'Chen XH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20131125,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic microenvironment', 'Human umbilical cord blood-derived cells', 'Interleukin-6', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Nuclear factor-kappa B']",2013/07/31 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2013/07/31 06:00'],"['2013/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['hem185 [pii]', '10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000107 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Apr;19(3):148-57. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000107.

Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial translocation of cofilin appears necessary for the regulation of apoptosis. RESULTS: We report that allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) potently induces mitochondria injury and apoptosis. These events were accompanied by a loss of polymerized filamentous actin (F-actin) and increase in unpolymerized globular actin (G-actin). AITC also induces dephosphorylation of cofilin through activation of PP1 and PP2A. Only dephosphorylated cofilin binds to G-actin and translocates to mitochondria during AITC-mediated apoptosis. Mechanistic study revealed that interruption of ROCK1/PTEN/PI3K signaling pathway plays a critical role in AITC-mediated dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and apoptosis. Our in vivo study also showed that AITC-mediated inhibition of tumor growth of mouse leukemia xenograft model is in association with dephosphorylation of cofilin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a model in which induction of apoptosis by AITC stems primarily from activation of ROCK1 and PTEN, and inactivation of PI3K, leading in turn to activation of PP1 and PP2A, resulting in dephosphorylation of cofilin, which binds to G-actin and translocates to mitochondria, culminating in the dysfunction of mitochondria, release of cytochrome c and apoptosis.",,"['Li, Guo-bing', 'Cheng, Qi', 'Liu, Lei', 'Zhou, Ting', 'Shan, Chang-yu', 'Hu, Xiao-ye', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Liu, E-hu', 'Li, Ping', 'Gao, Ning']","['Li GB', 'Cheng Q', 'Liu L', 'Zhou T', 'Shan CY', 'Hu XY', 'Zhou J', 'Liu EH', 'Li P', 'Gao N']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, 3rd Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130729,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cofilin 1/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'rho-Associated Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2014/02/22 06:00,['2013/07/31 06:00'],"['2013/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1478-811X-11-50 [pii]', '10.1186/1478-811X-11-50 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2013 Jul 29;11:50. doi: 10.1186/1478-811X-11-50.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CFL1 protein, human)', '0 (Cofilin 1)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'BN34FX42G3 (allyl isothiocyanate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ROCK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",PMC3734051,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A detailed understanding of the genetic alterations and gene expression changes that contribute to its pathogenesis is important to improve prognostication, disease monitoring, and therapy. In this context, leukemia-associated misexpression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been studied, but no coherent picture has emerged yet, thus warranting further investigations. METHODS: The expression of 636 human miRNAs was compared between samples from 52 patients with AML and 13 healthy individuals by highly specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) based microarray technology. The levels of individual mature miRNAs and of primary miRNAs (pri-miRs) were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT) PCR. Transfections and infections of human cell lines were performed using standard procedures. RESULTS: 64 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between AML and controls. Further studies on the clustered miRNAs 221 and 222, already known to act as oncogenes in other tumor types, revealed a deficiency of human myeloid cell lines to process vector derived precursor transcripts. Moreover, endogenous pri-miR-221/222 was overexpressed to a substantially higher extent than its mature products in most primary AML samples, indicating that its transcription was enhanced, but processing was rate limiting, in these cells. Comparison of samples from the times of diagnosis, remission, and relapse of AML demonstrated that pri-miR-221/222 levels faithfully reflected the stage of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of some miRNAs is strongly regulated at the posttranscriptional level in AML. Pri-miR-221/222 represents a novel molecular marker and putative oncogene in this disease.",,"['Rommer, Anna', 'Steinleitner, Katarina', 'Hackl, Hubert', 'Schneckenleithner, Christine', 'Engelmann, Maria', 'Scheideler, Marcel', 'Vlatkovic, Irena', 'Kralovics, Robert', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Valent, Peter', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Wieser, Rotraud']","['Rommer A', 'Steinleitner K', 'Hackl H', 'Schneckenleithner C', 'Engelmann M', 'Scheideler M', 'Vlatkovic I', 'Kralovics R', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Valent P', 'Sill H', 'Wieser R']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130729,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/31 06:00'],"['2013/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-13-364 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-13-364 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2013 Jul 29;13:364. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-364.,,"['0 (MIRN221 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN222 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",PMC3733744,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are resistant to GC-induced apoptosis, which leads to the inefficiency of GCs in the treatment of type I interferon-related autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, compounds promoting pDC apoptosis may be helpful for improving the efficacy of GCs. In this study, we performed screening to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in TLR-inhibited GC-induced pDC apoptosis and found an array of miRNAs that may regulate pDC apoptosis. Among those demonstrating altered expression, 6 miRNAs were inhibited in TLR-activated pDCs. Bioinformatics analysis and functional studies indicated that miR-29b and miR-29c were 2 key miRNAs involved in TLR-inhibited GC-induced pDC apoptosis. Furthermore, both of these miRNAs promoted pDC apoptosis by directly targeting Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in human primary pDCs.

To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship between MTHFD1 polymorphisms and cancer risk, the present meta-analysis was carried out. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comprehensive search was conducted to determine all the eligible studies about MTHFD1 polymorphisms and cancer risk. Combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association between the MTHFD1 polymorphisms and cancer risk. We investigated by meta-analysis the effects of 2 polymorphisms in MTHFD1: G1958A (17 studies, 12348 cases, 44132 controls) and G401A (20 studies, 8446 cases, 14020 controls). The overall results indicated no major influence of these 2 polymorphisms on cancer risk. For G1958A, a decreased cancer risk was found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/Asians (the dominant: OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58-0.94, P = 0.01; allelic: OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65-0.99, P = 0.04) and other cancers (recessive: OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66-0.96, P = 0.02). For G401A, the data showed that MTHFD1 G401A polymorphism was associated with a decreased colon cancer risk under dominant model (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80-0.99, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MTHFD1 G1958A polymorphism might be associated with a decreased risk of ALL and other cancers. Meanwhile, the MTHFD1 G401A might play a protective role in the development of colon cancer. Large-scale and well-designed case-control studies are necessary to validate the risk identified in the present meta-analysis.",,"['Zhang, Hongtuan', 'Ma, Hui', 'Li, Liang', 'Zhang, Zhihong', 'Xu, Yong']","['Zhang H', 'Ma H', 'Li L', 'Zhang Z', 'Xu Y']","['National Key Clinical Specialty of Urology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin Key Institute of Urology, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130719,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (NADP)/*genetics', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Publication Bias']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2014/03/04 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0069366 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-12250 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2013 Jul 19;8(7):e69366. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0069366.

In this study, low levels of expression of miR-196b were detected in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Bisulfite genomic sequencing PCR and methylation-specific PCR were used to examine the methylation status of the CpG islands in the miR-196b promoter in K562 cells, patients with leukemia and healthy individuals. The CpG islands showed more methylation in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia compared with healthy individuals (P<0.05), which indicated that low expression of miR-196b may be associated with an increase in the methylation of CpG islands. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system demonstrated that BCR-ABL1 and HOXA9 are the target genes of miR-196b, which was consistent with predictions from bioinformatics software analyses. Further examination of cell function indicated that miR-196b acts to reduce BCR-ABL1 and HOXA9 protein levels, decrease cell proliferation rate and retard the cell cycle. A low level of expression of miR-196b can cause up-regulation of BCR-ABL1 and HOXA9 expression, which leads to the development of chronic myeloid leukemia.

TiO2 nanoparticles were found to be non-toxic whereas ZnO nanoparticles caused dose-dependent cell death. Subsequently, global gene expression profiling was performed to identify transcriptional response underlying the cytotoxicity caused by ZnO nanoparticles. Analysis was done with doses 1 microg/ml and 10 microg/ml after 6 and 24 h of exposure. Interestingly, 2703 genes were significantly differentially expressed in HMDM upon exposure to 10 microg/ml ZnO nanoparticles, while in MDDCs only 12 genes were affected. In Jurkat cells, 980 genes were differentially expressed. It is noteworthy that only the gene expression of metallothioneins was upregulated in all the three cell types and a notable proportion of the genes were regulated in a cell type-specific manner. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the top biological processes disturbed in HMDM and Jurkat cells were regulating cell death and growth. In addition, genes controlling immune system development were affected. Using a panel of modified ZnO nanoparticles, we obtained an additional support that the cellular response to ZnO nanoparticles is largely dependent on particle dissolution and show that the ligand used to modify ZnO nanoparticles modulates Zn(2+) leaching.

Chronic arsenic poisoning affects millions of people worldwide and is associated with increased risk of many diseases including arthrosclerosis, diabetes and cancer. In this study, we explored genome level global responses to high and low levels of arsenic exposure in Caenorhabditis elegans using Affymetrix expression microarrays. This experimental design allows us to do microarray analysis of dose-response relationships of global gene expression patterns. High dose (0.03%) exposure caused stronger global gene expression changes in comparison with low dose (0.003%) exposure, suggesting a positive dose-response correlation. Biological processes such as oxidative stress, and iron metabolism, which were previously reported to be involved in arsenic toxicity studies using cultured cells, experimental animals, and humans, were found to be affected in C. elegans. We performed genome-wide gene expression comparisons between our microarray data and publicly available C. elegans microarray datasets of cadmium, and sediment exposure samples of German rivers Rhine and Elbe. Bioinformatics analysis of arsenic-responsive regulatory networks were done using FastMEDUSA program. FastMEDUSA analysis identified cancer-related genes, particularly genes associated with leukemia, such as dnj-11, which encodes a protein orthologous to the mammalian ZRF1/MIDA1/MPP11/DNAJC2 family of ribosome-associated molecular chaperones.

The most common chromosomal abnormalities in CLL, using conventional and molecular cytogenetics, are trisomy 12, del(13)(q14), del(11)(q22-23), del(17)(p13), and del(6)(q21). Whereas the prognostic marker such as IGHV mutational status remains stable during course of the diseases, chromosomal aberrations may be acquired over time. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, and biological significance of clonal evolution (CE) using conventional and molecular cytogenetics and its relationship with prognostic markers such as CD38, ZAP70, and the mutational status of IGHV and NOTCH1. One hundred and forty-three untreated CLL patients were included in the study. The median time interval between analyses was 32 months (range 6-156 months). Forty-seven patients (33%) had CE as evidenced by detection of new cytogenetic abnormalities during follow-up. CE was not correlated with high expression of ZAP70, unmutated IGHV genes or NOTCH1 mutations. Multivariate analysis revealed that CE and IGHV mutation status had a significant impact on TFS. The combination of conventional and molecular cytogenetics increased the detection of CE, this phenomenon probably being a reflection of genomic instability and conferring a more aggressive clinical course.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lopez, Cristina', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Costa, Dolors', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Navarro, Alba', 'Cazorla, Maite', 'Gomez, Candida', 'Arias, Amparo', 'Munoz, Concha', 'Cabezas, Sandra', 'Baumann, Tycho', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Pereira, Arturo', 'Cobo, Francesc', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Campo, Elias', 'Carrio, Ana']","['Lopez C', 'Delgado J', 'Costa D', 'Villamor N', 'Navarro A', 'Cazorla M', 'Gomez C', 'Arias A', 'Munoz C', 'Cabezas S', 'Baumann T', 'Rozman M', 'Aymerich M', 'Colomer D', 'Pereira A', 'Cobo F', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Campo E', 'Carrio A']","[""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130726,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Clonal Evolution', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', '*Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Mutation', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22087 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2013 Oct;52(10):920-7. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22087.

MicroRNAs (miR), vital to many cell functions, act posttranscriptionally to decrease the expression of target mRNAs. MLL-AF4 acute lymphocytic leukemia exhibits both myeloid and B-cell surface markers, suggesting that the transformed cells are B-cell myeloid progenitor cells. Through gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that microRNA 126 (miR-126) drives B-cell myeloid biphenotypic leukemia differentiation toward B cells without changing expression of E2A immunoglobulin enhancer-binding factor E12/E47 (E2A), early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1), or paired box protein 5, which are critical transcription factors in B-lymphopoiesis. Similar induction of B-cell differentiation by miR-126 was observed in normal hematopoietic cells in vitro and in vivo in uncommitted murine c-Kit(+)Sca1(+)Lineage(-) cells, with insulin regulatory subunit-1 acting as a target of miR-126. Importantly, in EBF1-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells, which fail to differentiate into B cells, miR-126 significantly up-regulated B220, and induced the expression of B-cell genes, including recombination activating genes-1/2 and CD79a/b. These data suggest that miR-126 can at least partly rescue B-cell development independently of EBF1. These experiments show that miR-126 regulates myeloid vs. B-cell fate through an alternative machinery, establishing the critical role of miRNAs in the lineage specification of multipotent mammalian cells.",,"['Okuyama, Kazuki', 'Ikawa, Tomokatsu', 'Gentner, Bernhard', 'Hozumi, Katsuto', 'Harnprasopwat, Ratanakanit', 'Lu, Jun', 'Yamashita, Riu', 'Ha, Daon', 'Toyoshima, Takae', 'Chanda, Bidisha', 'Kawamata, Toyotaka', 'Yokoyama, Kazuaki', 'Wang, Shusheng', 'Ando, Kiyoshi', 'Lodish, Harvey F', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Kawamoto, Hiroshi', 'Kotani, Ai']","['Okuyama K', 'Ikawa T', 'Gentner B', 'Hozumi K', 'Harnprasopwat R', 'Lu J', 'Yamashita R', 'Ha D', 'Toyoshima T', 'Chanda B', 'Kawamata T', 'Yokoyama K', 'Wang S', 'Ando K', 'Lodish HF', 'Tojo A', 'Kawamoto H', 'Kotani A']","['Division of Hematological Malignancy, Regenerative Medical Science, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa 259-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130726,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics/immunology', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Luciferases', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 3/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['cell fate decision', 'lymphopoiesis']",2013/07/31 06:00,2013/11/12 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1220710110 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1220710110 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Aug 13;110(33):13410-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1220710110.

We aimed to determine whether chemotherapy affects white matter (WM). METHODS: Using brain diffusion tensor imaging, we evaluated 17 patients (15 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; 9 male, 8 female; age, 1.6-13 years) before and after chemotherapy. We measured the quantitative values of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at the regions of interest (ROIs) such as periventricular WM, corona radiata, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and corpus callosum. We assessed sensorimotor and callosal tracts by tractography. RESULTS: Reduction in FA and increase in ADC were significant at the ROIs of the left and right anterior periventricular WM and corona radiata and at the tract passing through the genu. A significant reduction in FA with a nonsignificant increase in ADC was seen at the ROI of the genu and at the tracts passing through the body and isthmus. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy in children with hematological malignancies predominantly affects the frontal WM.

The cumulative incidence of ovarian recovery, while treating relapse and death without ovarian recovery as competing risks, was 68.8 % at 2 years after transplantation in the total population, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two institutions (p = 0.85). Age and the history of previous chemotherapy did not affect the incidence of ovarian recovery. Two patients from each center had a relapse of leukemia.

However, the impact of PI-9 on granzyme-B-induced apoptosis in tumour cells remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of constitutive PI-9 expression in leukaemia cell lines on the activity of granzyme B and apoptosis induction. PI-9 negative (lymphoblastic Jurkat cells; myeloblastic U937 cells) and PI-9-expressing cell lines (myeloblastic K562 cells, EBV-transformed LCL-1 and LCL-2 B-cells, lymphoblastic Daudi cells, AML-R cells f leukaemia and the U937 subclone U937PI-9(+)). For accurate granzyme B activity determination a quantitative substrate (Ac-IEPD-pNA) cleavage assay was established and caspase-3 activation measured for apoptosis assessment. Cells were treated with a cytotoxic granule isolate that has previously been shown to induce apoptosis through granzyme B signalling. We found a robust correlation between constitutive PI-9 expression levels and the suppression of granzyme B activity. Further, inhibition of granzyme B translated into reduced caspase-3 activation. We conclude, suppression of granzyme B initiated apoptosis in PI-9-expressing cells could contribute to immune evasion and the measurement of granzyme B activity with our assay might be a useful predictive marker in immune-therapeutic approaches against cancer.",,"['Fritsch, Kristina', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Grullich, Carsten']","['Fritsch K', 'Finke J', 'Grullich C']","['Dpt. of Hematology and Oncology, Albert Ludwigs-University Medical Center Freiburg, Hugstetter Str. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130728,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Caspase 3/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Serpins/*biosynthesis', 'U937 Cells']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2014/01/07 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-013-1846-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Dec;92(12):1603-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-013-1846-6.

This review will focus on advancements made within the past 1-2 years in targeted therapy for this disease.

Moxetumomab pasudotox in phase I testing was recently reported to be associated with an overall response rate of 86 % and a complete remission (CR) rate of 46 % in 28 patients with relapsed and refractory HCL. Many of the CRs are without minimal residual disease (MRD). Severe or dose limiting toxicity was not observed on this trial, but a completely reversible and largely asymptomatic form of grade 2 hemolytic uremic syndrome occurred in two patients during retreatment. This agent has commenced phase III multicenter testing to validate its phase I results. An extensive number of studies have documented the V600E mutation in nearly all HCL patients, but not in similar hematologic malignancies.

In univariate analyses, 1p22 and 1p32 appeared as negative prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS): 1p22: 19.8 months vs 33.6 months (P<0.001) and 1p32: 14.4 months vs 33.6 months (P<0.001); and overall survival (OS): 1p22: 44.2 months vs 96.8 months (P=0.002) and 1p32: 26.7 months vs 96.8 months (P<0.001). In multivariate analyses, 1p22 and 1p32 deletions still appear as independent negative prognostic factors for PFS and OS. In conclusion, our data show that 1p22 and 1p32 deletions are major negative prognostic factors for PFS and OS for patients with MM. We thus suggest that 1p32 deletion should be tested for all patients at diagnosis.",,"['Hebraud, B', 'Leleu, X', 'Lauwers-Cances, V', 'Roussel, M', 'Caillot, D', 'Marit, G', 'Karlin, L', 'Hulin, C', 'Gentil, C', 'Guilhot, F', 'Garderet, L', 'Lamy, T', 'Brechignac, S', 'Pegourie, B', 'Jaubert, J', 'Dib, M', 'Stoppa, A-M', 'Sebban, C', 'Fohrer, C', 'Fontan, J', 'Fruchart, C', 'Macro, M', 'Orsini-Piocelle, F', 'Lepeu, G', 'Sohn, C', 'Corre, J', 'Facon, T', 'Moreau, P', 'Attal, M', 'Avet-Loiseau, H']","['Hebraud B', 'Leleu X', 'Lauwers-Cances V', 'Roussel M', 'Caillot D', 'Marit G', 'Karlin L', 'Hulin C', 'Gentil C', 'Guilhot F', 'Garderet L', 'Lamy T', 'Brechignac S', 'Pegourie B', 'Jaubert J', 'Dib M', 'Stoppa AM', 'Sebban C', 'Fohrer C', 'Fontan J', 'Fruchart C', 'Macro M', 'Orsini-Piocelle F', 'Lepeu G', 'Sohn C', 'Corre J', 'Facon T', 'Moreau P', 'Attal M', 'Avet-Loiseau H']","['Unite de Genomique du Myelome, University Hospital, CRCT, INSERM U 1037, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, CHRU, Lille, France.', ""Service d'Epidemiologie, CHU Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Dijon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Nancy, France.', ""Service d'Epidemiologie, CHU Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'CIC Inserm 0802, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Poitiers, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Rennes, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, St-Etienne, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Angers, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmette, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Besancon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Francois Baclesse, Caen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Caen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Departmental Hospital, Annecy, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Departmental Hospital, Avignon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Departmental Hospital, Toulon, France.', 'Unite de Genomique du Myelome, University Hospital, CRCT, INSERM U 1037, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, CHRU, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Nantes, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Unite de Genomique du Myelome, University Hospital, CRCT, INSERM U 1037, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130729,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013225 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.225 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Mar;28(3):675-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.225.

The prognosis of B-pre ALL has improved in pediatric patients, but the outcome is much less successful in adults. Constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) network is a feature of B-pre ALL, where it strongly influences cell growth and survival. RAD001, a selective mTORC1 inhibitor, has been shown to be cytotoxic against many types of cancer including hematological malignancies. To investigate whether mTORC1 could represent a target in the therapy of B-pre ALL, we treated cell lines and adult patient primary cells with RAD001. We documented that RAD001 decreased cell viability, induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and caused apoptosis in B-pre ALL cell lines. Autophagy was also induced, which was important for the RAD001 cytotoxic effect, as downregulation of Beclin-1 reduced drug cytotoxicity. RAD001 strongly synergized with the novel allosteric Akt inhibitor MK-2206 in both cell lines and patient samples. Similar results were obtained with the combination CCI-779 plus GSK 690693. These findings point out that mTORC1 inhibitors, either as a single agent or in combination with Akt inhibitors, could represent a potential therapeutic innovative strategy in B-pre ALL.",,"['Neri, L M', 'Cani, A', 'Martelli, A M', 'Simioni, C', 'Junghanss, C', 'Tabellini, G', 'Ricci, F', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Pagliaro, P', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Capitani, S']","['Neri LM', 'Cani A', 'Martelli AM', 'Simioni C', 'Junghanss C', 'Tabellini G', 'Ricci F', 'Tazzari PL', 'Pagliaro P', 'McCubrey JA', 'Capitani S']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', '1] Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy [2] Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'University of Rostock, Division of Medicine, Department of Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Medicine, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Immunohematology and Transfusion Center, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Immunohematology and Transfusion Center, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Immunohematology and Transfusion Center, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130729,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Everolimus', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxadiazoles/pharmacology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2013/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2013226 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2013.226 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Apr;28(4):739-48. doi: 10.1038/leu.2013.226.

The purpose of this study was to assess cancer patients' decision-making preferences during follow-up care, the role of trust and self-efficacy, and the effect of preferences on health outcomes. METHODS: Six hundred twenty-three bladder, leukemia, and colorectal cancer survivors were recruited to the Assessment of Patient Experiences of Cancer Care study between April 2003 and November 2004. Respondents were asked about their follow-up care experiences, including decision-making preferences, trust in physicians, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and health appraisal. Unadjusted mean scores of trust and self-efficacy measures by decision preference group were examined. Multinomial logistic and linear regressions were conducted to examine predictors of decision-making preferences and the impact of decision-making preferences on HRQOL and health appraisal. RESULTS: While the majority of patients preferred shared decision-making (61.0 %), 16.1 % preferred to control their decisions and 22.1 % preferred physician control over decisions. Compared to the other groups, patients preferring physician control had greater trust in their physician (p < 0.001), similar self-efficacy for engaging in the decision-making process, and lower self-efficacy for taking responsibility over decisions (p < 0.001). There were no notable differences between decision-making groups on outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Patients who prefer physicians to control decisions are as confident about participating in the decision-making process and experience similar health outcomes as those preferring greater decisional control. Physicians need to tailor their communication behavior to encourage participation and trust among all patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Findings from this study provide unique insights into the decision-making preferences of cancer patients during receipt of follow-up care, which remains an understudied phase of cancer care delivery. Results underscore the need for approaches to decision-making and patient engagement to become more nuanced and to encourage patients to participate in decision-making in ways they are most comfortable. Furthermore, physicians and health care professionals should foster environments that promote trust and clear communication regardless of patient decision-making styles.",,"['Chawla, Neetu', 'Arora, Neeraj K']","['Chawla N', 'Arora NK']","['Outcomes Research Branch, Applied Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, 3E450, Rockville, MD, 20850, USA, neetu.chawla@nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130727,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology/*therapy', 'Patient Participation/psychology/statistics & numerical data', '*Patient Preference/psychology/statistics & numerical data', ""Physician's Role/psychology"", '*Physician-Patient Relations', '*Self Efficacy', '*Trust/psychology']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2014/07/19 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-013-0298-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2013 Dec;7(4):592-601. doi: 10.1007/s11764-013-0298-2.

Sequencing technologies provide only an overview of the aggregate of numerous cells. Computational approaches to de-mix a collective signal composed of the aberrations of a mixed cell population of a tumor sample into its individual components are not available. We propose an evolutionary framework for deconvolving data from a single genome-wide experiment to infer the composition, abundance and evolutionary paths of the underlying cell subpopulations of a tumor. We have developed an algorithm (TrAp) for solving this mixture problem. In silico analyses show that TrAp correctly deconvolves mixed subpopulations when the number of subpopulations and the measurement errors are moderate. We demonstrate the applicability of the method using tumor karyotypes and somatic hypermutation data sets. We applied TrAp to Exome-Seq experiment of a renal cell carcinoma tumor sample and compared the mutational profile of the inferred subpopulations to the mutational profiles of single cells of the same tumor. Finally, we deconvolve sequencing data from eight acute myeloid leukemia patients and three distinct metastases of one melanoma patient to exhibit the evolutionary relationships of their subpopulations.",,"['Strino, Francesco', 'Parisi, Fabio', 'Micsinai, Mariann', 'Kluger, Yuval']","['Strino F', 'Parisi F', 'Micsinai M', 'Kluger Y']","['Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA, NYU Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics, New York University Langone Medical Center, 227 East 30th Street, New York, NY 10016, USA and Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130727,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Biopsy', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Melanoma/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2013/11/14 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['gkt641 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkt641 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Sep;41(17):e165. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt641.

METHODS: A panel of human rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells stably expressing myristoylation (Myr)-tagged one of class I PI3K p110 subunits was established. PI3K activity was analyzed by measuring phosphorylated Akt with Western blotting, and isoform-specific PI3K activities were validated with PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors. The growth of prostate cancer PC-3 cells and B cell type leukemia Raji cells was determined using SRB assay and CCK-8 assay, respectively. RESULTS: The phosphorylation of Akt in Rh30-Myr-p110alpha, beta, gamma, delta cells was preferentially inhibited by PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors A66 (PI3Kalpha), TGX221 (PI3Kbeta), AS604850 (PI3Kgamma) and CAL-101 (PI3Kdelta), respectively. A newly obtained PI3K inhibitor WJD008 (10 mumol/L) completely abrogated Akt phosphorylation by all the isoforms of class I PI3Ks, thus acted as a pan-PI3K inhibitor. In prostate cancer PC-3 cells, the PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors were much less potent than WJD008 in suppression of the proliferation. In B cell type leukemia Raji cells, inhibition of PI3Kdelta alone or all the isoforms of class I PI3Ks displayed similar potency against the cell proliferation, whereas selective inhibition of individual PI3Kalpha/beta/gamma isoforms resulted in negligible activity. CONCLUSION: Rh30-Myr-p110alpha, beta, gamma, delta cells are a useful cell model to identify the selectivity of PI3K inhibitors. Pan-PI3K inhibitors are suitable for treating PC-3 cells, whereas selective PI3Kdelta inhibitor is sufficient to block Raji cell growth. The biased dependency on PI3K isoforms for tumor cell growth rationalizes the use of PI3K inhibitors with different selectivity for cancer therapy.",,"['Wang, Xiang', 'Li, Jia-peng', 'Yang, Yan', 'Ding, Jian', 'Meng, Ling-hua']","['Wang X', 'Li JP', 'Yang Y', 'Ding J', 'Meng LH']","['Division of Anti-Tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130729,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2014/07/16 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2013/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['aps201381 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2013.81 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2013 Sep;34(9):1201-7. doi: 10.1038/aps.2013.81.

LfcinB also binds to and selectively kills human cancer cells via a mechanism that involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and caspase activation. The antimicrobial core of LfcinB consists of only six amino acids (RRWQWR), referred to in this study as LfcinB6. Although free LfcinB6 is devoid of cytotoxic activity against cancer cells, we show here that adding a cell-penetrating hepta-arginine sequence via a glycine-glycine linker to LfcinB6 generates a peptide (MPLfcinB6) that is selectively cytotoxic for human T-leukemia and B-lymphoma cells. Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran uptake by MPLfcinB6-treated cancer cells revealed extensive damage to the cell membrane, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. MPLfcinB6-induced cytotoxicity was also associated with sequential ROS production and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization; however, neither ROS nor caspase activation caused by the loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity was essential for peptide-mediated cell death. We conclude that MPLfcinB6 selectively kills human T-leukemia and B-lymphoma cells by causing extensive and irreparable damage to the cell membrane.",['(c) 2013.'],"['Hilchie, Ashley L', 'Vale, Rachel', 'Zemlak, Tyler S', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Hilchie AL', 'Vale R', 'Zemlak TS', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, P.O.

DC.,527-32,10.1016/j.jep.2013.07.011 [doi] S0378-8741(13)00500-X [pii],"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Smilax riparia A. DC., known as ""Niu-Wei-Cai"" in China, is distributed through the south and middle of China. The roots and rhizomes of Smilax riparia have been used not only as traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) for the treatment of bronchitis, lumbago of renal asthenia, traumatic injury, asthenia edema, and cancer but also as edible wild herbs in some areas of China. AIM OF THE STUDY: To identify the phytochemicals in the roots and rhizomes of Smilax riparia and to investigate their antioxidant activities and cytotoxicities toward several tumor cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four fractions and five phenylpropanoid glycosides were obtained from roots and rhizomes of Smilax riparia under bioassay-guided screenings. The structures of five compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and compared with published data. We evaluated their antioxidant activities and their cytotoxicities on five cancer cell lines: human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), human hepatocellular carcinoma (SMMC-7721), human lung cancer (A-549), human breast cancer (MCF-7), and human colon cancer (SW480). RESULTS: Of the five glycosides, one new compound (3, smilaside P) was isolated from an EtOAc fraction. Compound 1 was cytotoxic toward HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, and SW480 (IC50 2.70, 3.80, 11.91, 3.79, and 3.93 muM, respectively). Moreover, compounds 1-3 showed moderate scavenging activities against the 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical (IC50 339.58, 330.66, 314.49 muM, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Five phenylpropanoid glycosides were reported for the first time from this TCM. Each was studied, as observed here for the first time, in the cytotoxic experiments toward HL-60, SMMC-7721, and SW480 cell lines. Compound 1, bearing three feruloyl groups and three acetyl groups, had the greatest cytotoxicity toward the five tumor cell lines. Compounds 1-3 showed moderate antioxidant activities. All results reflect that compounds 1-3 are cytotoxic for a wide variety of cancer cell lines of differing tissue origins and that the cytotoxicities of these compounds may be related to their antioxidant activities.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We have documented that osteoclasts secrete chemotactic agents to recruit osteoblast lineage cells, contributing to coupling. Bone formation subsequent to bone resorption becomes uncoupled with aging, resulting in significant bone loss. During bone resorption, osteoclasts release and activate transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) from the bone matrix; thus, elevated bone resorption increases the level of active TGF-beta in the local environment during aging. In this study, we examined the influences of TGF-beta1 on the ability of osteoclasts to recruit osteoblasts. TGF-beta1 increased osteoclast expression of the chemokine CXCL16 to promote osteoblast migration. TGF-beta1 also directly stimulated osteoblast migration; however, this direct response was blocked by conditioned medium from TGF-beta1-treated osteoclasts due to the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the medium. CXCL16 and LIF expression was dependent on TGF-beta1 activation of Smad2 and Smad3. These results establish that TGF-beta1 induces CXCL16 and LIF production in osteoclasts, which modulate recruitment of osteoblasts to restore the bone lost during the resorptive phase of bone turnover.",['(c) 2013.

GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2/GATE-16, but not GABARAP, were significantly downregulated in particular AML subtypes compared to normal granulocytes. Moreover, the expression of GABARAPL1 and GATE-16 was significantly induced during ATRA-induced neutrophil differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (APL).

Here we report that a possible alternative to DCs are IDO expressing dermal fibroblasts (DFs), which are easier to isolate and sustain in culture compared to DCs. When mouse splenocytes were co-cultured with IDO expressing DFs, a significant increase in frequency and the number of Tregs was found compared to those of control group (13.16%+/-1.8 vs. 5.53%+/-1.2, p<0.05). Despite observing a higher total number of dead CD4(+) cells in the IDO group, there was a more abundant live CD4(+)CD25(+) subpopulation in this group. Further analysis reveales that these CD4(+) CD25(+) cells have the capacity to expand in the presence of IDO expressing DFs. Greater number of CTLA-4(+) cells and high expression of TGF-beta and IL-10 were found in CD4(+) cells of the IDO group compared to those of the controls. This finding confirmed a suppressive functionality of the expanded Tregs. Furthermore, CD4(+) CD25(+) cells isolated from the IDO group showed an alloantigen specific suppressive effect in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. These results confirm that IDO expressing dermal fibroblasts can expand a population of suppressive antigen specific Tregs. In conclusion, IDO expressing dermal fibroblasts have the capacity to stimulate the expansion of a subset of Tregs which can be used to generate antigen-specific immune tolerance.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Following a prolonged mitotic arrest, cells either die in mitosis via apoptosis, or exit mitosis without dividing and survive, a process known as slippage. What dictates the balance between these two fates is unclear, but recent advances highlight the importance of the pro-survival Bcl2 family, with Mcl1 degradation emerging as a key determinant of mitotic cell fate. Here we review these advances, with a view towards identifying how the balance between apoptosis and slippage can be tipped in favour of death.

It has been found that Gata1 gene knockdown heterozygous female (Gata1(G1.05/+)) mice spontaneously develop erythroblastic leukemias. In this study, we have generated a novel Gata1 knockdown erythroblastic cell line, designated GAK14, from the leukemia cells in the Gata1(G1.05/+) mice. Although GAK14 cells maintain immature phenotype on OP9 stromal cells in the presence of erythropoietin and stem cell factor, the cells produce Gr-1-, Mac1-, B220-, CD3e- or CD49b-positive hematopoietic cells when co-cultured with DAS104-8 feeder cells. However, GAK14 cells did not produce erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, perhaps due to the absence of GATA1. Indeed, GAK14 cells became capable of differentiating into mature erythroid cells when complemented with full-length GATA1 and co-cultured with fetal liver-derived FLS5 stromal cells. This differentiation potential was impaired when GATA1 lacking the N-terminal domain was complemented. The N-terminal domain is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of transient abnormal myelopoiesis and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia related to Down syndrome. These results thus showed that GAK14 cells will serve as a powerful tool for dissecting domain function of GATA1 and that the GATA1 N-terminal domain is essential for the erythroid differentiation of GAK14 cells.","['(c) 2013 The Authors Genes to Cells (c) 2013 by the Molecular Biology Society of', 'Japan and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.']","['Mukai, Harumi Y', 'Suzuki, Mikiko', 'Nagano, Masumi', ""Ohmori, Shin'ya"", 'Otsuki, Akihito', 'Tsuchida, Kouhei', 'Moriguchi, Takashi', 'Ohneda, Kinuko', 'Shimizu, Ritsuko', 'Ohneda, Osamu', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki']","['Mukai HY', 'Suzuki M', 'Nagano M', 'Ohmori S', 'Otsuki A', 'Tsuchida K', 'Moriguchi T', 'Ohneda K', 'Shimizu R', 'Ohneda O', 'Yamamoto M']","['Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, 305-8577, Japan; Department of Medical Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, 980-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130725,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,IM,"['Amino Acids/*genetics', 'Animals', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/*physiology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocyte Progenitor Cells/physiology', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",,,2013/07/31 06:00,2014/03/07 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/gtc.12084 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Cells. 2013 Oct;18(10):886-98. doi: 10.1111/gtc.12084.

In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the frequent opportunistic fungal infections remain an important cause of mortality and morbidity in these highly immunocompromised patients. METHODS: We analyzed 154 patients after allogeneic HSCT for acute leukemia for TLR4 gene variants 1063A/G (D299G) and 1363C/T (T399I) with their respective donors, and correlated the results with the incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) infection after transplant. RESULTS: Probable and proven IA in recipients was significantly increased if either recipients or donors exhibited one of the two TLR4 gene variants. In addition, recipients with TLR gene variants and IA showed a delayed T cell and NKT cell immune reconstitution after transplant. Increased susceptibility for IA was not associated with an increased rate of death-in-remission or decreased estimate for overall survival. CONCLUSION: These findings reinforce the importance of genetic variants in innate immunity and IA among the recipients of allogeneic HSCT.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],"['Koldehoff, M', 'Beelen, D W', 'Elmaagacli, A H']","['Koldehoff M', 'Beelen DW', 'Elmaagacli AH']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, Medical School of University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130725,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aspergillosis/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Aspergillus/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['HSCT', 'SNP', 'TLR4', 'allogeneic transplantation', 'invasive aspergillosis']",2013/07/31 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2013/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12115 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2013 Oct;15(5):533-9. doi: 10.1111/tid.12115.

The variability in an objective measure of cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak )) across performance in operable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients enrolled in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial was compared. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 392 NSCLC patients underwent an incremental cardiopulmonary cycling exercise test to symptom limitation with expired gas analysis to determine VO2peak . Performance status (PS) was assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) tool. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in VO2peak across increasing ECOG categories (P < 0.0001). However, there was a large range in VO2peak for any given ECOG category with overlap between categories (ECOG 0: 5.0-31.5 mL/kg/min; ECOG 1: 4.3-24.8 mL/kg/min; ECOG 2: 8.9-21.9 mL/kg/min; ECOG 3; 3.3-11.7 mL/kg/min).

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is often inadequate to detect myocardial disease induced by chemotherapy. Tissue Doppler and bidimensional-strain imaging could detect LV myocardial dysfunction earlier than LVEF. In drug-induced cardiotoxicity, torsional and longitudinal LV deformations [LV twist (LVtw), radial strain (GRS), global longitudinal strain (GLS)] are damaged. We assessed whether a new index, GLSxLVtw, could predict future anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography, troponin, and natriuretic peptide determination were prospectively performed in 74 patients before and after 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks of anthracycline treatment. These patients were treated for breast cancer, Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukaemia, or osteosarcoma. At 6 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, isovolumic relaxation time, systolic mitral annular velocity, LVGLS, LVGRS, LV apical rotation, LVtw, and GLSxLVtw deteriorated, and troponin levels became elevated (all p < 0.05 by ANOVA) before LVEF decreased. The receiver operating characteristic curves identified early deterioration of GLSxLVtw as the best predictor of later cardiotoxicity (area under curve = 0.93), followed by GLS (0.84) and LV apical rotation (0.81) deterioration. In conclusion, early change in the GLSxLVtw index seems to be a good predictor of future development of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.",,"['Mornos, Cristian', 'Petrescu, Lucian']","['Mornos C', 'Petrescu L']","['Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Pta.

In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity and mechanisms of cell death induced by the delta isoform-specific phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, GS-1101, in combination with the HDI, panobinostat (LBH589) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA).

Combined treatment resulted in a synergistic inhibition of proliferation and showed synergistic effect on apoptotic induction in all tested cell lines and primary NHL and CLL cells. This study indicates that interference with PI3K signalling dramatically increases HDI-mediated apoptosis in malignant haematopoietic cells, possibly through both AKT-dependent or AKT- independent mechanisms. Moreover, the increase in HDI-related apoptosis observed in PI3K inhibitor-treated cells appears to be related to the disruption of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway.

The CBC findings included a mildly increased PCV, and severe leukocytosis due to high numbers of atypical cells interpreted to be blasts. The blasts were medium-sized cells with round to pleomorphic nuclei, slightly clumped chromatin, indistinct nucleoli, and scant moderate-to-dark blue cytoplasm with occasional red-to-purple cytoplasmic granulation. Cytochemical and immunohistochemical staining indicated that the neoplastic cells were positive for CD3 and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase (ANBE), leading to the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoid leukemia. Histology of tissues collected at necropsy showed multifocal infiltrations of neoplastic round cells in the liver, spleen, kidneys, testicles, pancreas, thyroid, duodenum, bone marrow, epicardium, and myocardium.

Although 90% of patients are now long-term survivors, the remaining 10% have poor outcome predominantly due to drug resistance. In this study, we carried out genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis on diagnostic bone marrow samples to determine miRNA expression profiles associated with poor outcome in ALL. A reduced expression of MIR335 was identified as the most significant miRNA abnormality associated with poor outcome. It is well known that glucocorticoid (GC) resistance is one of the major reasons contributing to poor outcome. We show that exogenous expression of MIR335 in ALL cells increases sensitization to prednisolone-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, we demonstrate that MAPK1 is a novel target of MIR335, and that MEK/ERK inhibitor treatment enhanced prednisolone-induced cell death through the activation of BIM (BCL2L11). These results provide a possible underlying molecular mechanism to explain the association between reduced MIR335 with poor clinical outcome, and suggest that approaches to re-introduce MIR335 expression or override MAPK1 activity may offer promising therapeutic strategies in the treatment of ALL.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Yan, Junli', 'Jiang, Nan', 'Huang, Gaofeng', 'Tay, Jim L-S', 'Lin, Baohong', 'Bi, Chonglei', 'Koh, Grace S', 'Li, Zhenhua', 'Tan, Joy', 'Chung, Tae-Hoon', 'Lu, Yi', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Kham, Shirley K Y', 'Yeoh, Allen E J', 'Chng, Wee-Joo']","['Yan J', 'Jiang N', 'Huang G', 'Tay JL', 'Lin B', 'Bi C', 'Koh GS', 'Li Z', 'Tan J', 'Chung TH', 'Lu Y', 'Ariffin H', 'Kham SK', 'Yeoh AE', 'Chng WJ']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore City, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130725,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",['NOTNLM'],"['MAPK1', 'MIR335', 'clinical outcome', 'paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'prednisolone']",2013/07/31 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2013/07/30 06:00'],"['2013/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12489 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Oct;163(1):93-103. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12489.

This single-centre, single-dose, randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of a single oral dose of ponatinib (45-mg tablet) under fasting conditions and following consumption of high- and low-fat meals by healthy subjects. METHODS: Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the six possible treatment sequences, each evaluating three ponatinib 45-mg treatments: administered under fasting conditions; administered after a high-fat meal; or administered after a standardized low-fat meal. The high-fat meal derived approximately 50% of its total caloric content from fat, with approximately 150, 250 and 500-600 calories derived from protein, carbohydrates and fat, respectively (total of approximately 900-1000 calories). The standardized low-fat meal derived no more than 20% of total caloric content from fat, with approximately 56, 428 and 63 calories derived from protein, carbohydrates and fat, respectively (total of approximately 547 calories). During each of the three treatment periods, blood samples were collected predose and at 13 time points over the 96-h post-dose interval. Plasma concentrations of ponatinib were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Mixed-model analyses of variance (anova) were performed on natural log-transformed PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-infinity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Geometric mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values for the fasted, low-fat and high-fat regimens were 54.7, 51.6 and 51.5 ng/mL, respectively. Geometric mean area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-infinity) values for the fasted, low-fat and high-fat regimens were 1273, 1244 and 1392 h x ng/mL, respectively. All limits of the 90% CIs of the estimated geometric mean ratios for Cmax and all AUC comparisons fell within the 80%-125% margins. These results indicate that consumption of a high- or low-fat meal within 30 min prior to administration of ponatinib had no effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ponatinib. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Food does not affect the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ponatinib. These data demonstrate that ponatinib may be administered with or without food.","['(c) 2013 The Authors.

Quality of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is being increasingly associated with the outcome of persistent HTLV-1 infection. In this respect, a patient cohort (from HTLV-1 endemic region) consisting of seronegative controls (controls), asymptomatic carriers (ACs), and patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) or HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) was analyzed for CD8(+) T cells polyfunctionality in response to the viral antigen Tax. RESULTS: Compared to ACs, ATL and HAM/TSP patients had lower frequency and polyfunctionality of CTLs in response to Tax suggesting dysfunction of CD8(+) T cells in these individuals. As an underlying mechanism, programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor was found to be highly unregulated in Tax-responsive as well as total CD8(+) T cells from ATL and HAM/TSP but not from ACs and directly correlated with the lack of polyfunctionality in these individuals. Further, PD-1 expression showed a direct whereas MIP-1alpha expression had an indirect correlation with the proviral load providing new insights about the immunopathogenesis of HTLV-associated diseases. Additionally, we identified key cytokine signatures defining the immune activation status of clinical samples by the luminex assay. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings suggest that reconstitution of fully functional CTLs, stimulation of MIP-1alpha expression, and/or blockade of the PD-1 pathway are potential approaches for immunotherapy / therapeutic vaccine against HTLV-mediated diseases.",,"['Manuel, Sharron L', 'Sehgal, Mohit', 'Connolly, John', 'Makedonas, George', 'Khan, Zafar K', 'Gardner, Jay', 'Betts, Michael R', 'Jain, Pooja']","['Manuel SL', 'Sehgal M', 'Connolly J', 'Makedonas G', 'Khan ZK', 'Gardner J', 'Betts MR', 'Jain P']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130726,Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asymptomatic Diseases', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Chemokine CCL3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/growth & development/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Viral Load', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/07/28 06:00,2014/04/24 06:00,['2013/07/27 06:00'],"['2013/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10875-013-9918-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 2013 Oct;33(7):1223-39. doi: 10.1007/s10875-013-9918-x.

Genetic variations or mutations occurring in the miR gene region may affect the property of miRs through altering miR expression and/or maturation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible relationship between two miRs polymorphisms, hsa-miR-146a (rs2910164 G>C) and hsa-miR-499 (rs3746444 T>C), and the susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a sample of Iranian population. This case-control study was performed on 75 children diagnosed with ALL and 115 age- and sex-matched children with no history of cancer of any type (as the control group). Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction was applied for genotyping the variants. We found that the rs2910164 G>C variant of hsa-miR-146a significantly increased the risk of ALL (CC vs. GG, OR = 4.24, 95% CI = 1.52-11.87, P = 0.006; GC vs. GG, OR = 3.55, 95% CI = 1.41-8.93, P = 0.007; C vs. T, OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.13-2.67, P = 0.012).

For example, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) displays disproportionate sex ratios with a large male excess. However, the underlying genetics for these disparities are poorly understood, and gender differences for specific cytogenetic abnormalities have not been carefully investigated. We sought to provide an initial characterization of gender representation in genetic abnormalities in CLL by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We confirm the well known skewed male-tofemale (M/F sex ratio) of ~1.5 in our CLL study population, but also determine the genotypic M/F sex ratio values corresponding to specific FISH DNA probes. Genetic changes in CLL detectable by four FISH probes were statistically compared with respect to gender. Initial FISH evaluations of 4698 CLL patients were retrospectively examined and new findings of the genotypic M/F sex ratios for these probes are reported. This study represents the largest CLL survey conducted in the United States using FISH probes. The CLL database demonstrated that FISH abnormalities (trisomy 12, 13q14.3 deletion and 17p13.1 deletion) probes had skewed M/F ratios of ~1.5. Also, by statistical analysis it was shown that ATM gene loss (11q22.3q23.1 deletion) solely or with other abnormalities was considerably higher in males with an M/F ratio of 2.5 and significantly different from M/F ratios of 1.0 or 1.5. We hypothesize that interactions involving these autosomal abnormalities (trisomy 12, and deletions of 11q22.3, 13q14.3, and 17p13.1), and the sex chromosomes may provide the genetic basis for the altered phenotypic M/F ratio in CLL.",,"['Cantu, Eduardo S', 'McGill, John R', 'Stephenson, Christine F', 'Hoffmann, Heidi M', 'Tang, Lihua', 'Yan, Jim', 'Glassman, Armand B']","['Cantu ES', 'McGill JR', 'Stephenson CF', 'Hoffmann HM', 'Tang L', 'Yan J', 'Glassman AB']","['Integrated Oncology, LabCorp Specialty Testing Group , Phoenix, AZ.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130211,Italy,Hematol Rep,Hematology reports,101556723,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'FISH', 'sex ratios']",2013/07/28 06:00,2013/07/28 06:01,['2013/07/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2013/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4081/hr.2013.e4 [doi]'],epublish,Hematol Rep. 2013 Feb 11;5(1):13-7. doi: 10.4081/hr.2013.e4.

In the current study, we examined the chemo-sensitizing activity of a mixture of nanodiamond (ND) and nanoplatinum (NP) solution known as DPV576, against multidrug-resistant (MDR) human myeloid leukemia (HL60/AR) and MDR-sensitive cells (HL60). Cancer cells were cultured with different concentrations of daunorubicin (DNR) (1 x 10 (-9)-1 x 10 (-6) M) in the presence of selected concentrations of DPV576 (2.5%-10% v/v). Cancer cell survival was determined by MTT assay, drug accumulation by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and holes and structural changes by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Co-treatment of HL60/AR cells with DNR plus DPV576 resulted in the reduction of the IC50 to 1/4th.

On the basis of its involvement in CML pathogenesis, we hypothesized that KIT may govern responses of CML cells to imatinib. To test this, we assessed the growth of primary CML progenitor cells under conditions of sole BCR-ABL1, sole KIT, and dual BCR-ABL1/KIT inhibition. Sole BCR-ABL1 inhibition suppressed mature CML progenitor cells, but these effects were largely abolished by stem cell factor (SCF) and maximal suppression required dual BCR-ABL1/KIT inhibition. In contrast, KIT inhibition did not add to the effects of BCR-ABL1 inhibition in primitive progenitors, represented by CD34(+)38(-) cells. Long-term culture-initiating cell assays on murine stroma revealed profound depletion of primitive CML cells by sole BCR-ABL1 inhibition despite the presence of SCF, suggesting that primitive CML cells are unable to use SCF as a survival factor upon BCR-ABL1 inhibition. In CD34(+)38(+) cells, SCF strongly induced pAKT(S473) in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner, which was further enhanced by inhibition of BCR-ABL1 and associated with increased colony survival. In contrast, pAKT(S473) levels remained low in CD34(+)38(-) cells cultured under the same conditions. Consistent with reduced response to SCF, KIT surface expression was significantly lower on CD34(+)38(-) compared with CD34(+)38(+) CML cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the differential effects of SCF on mature and primitive CML progenitor cells.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],"['Corbin, Amie S', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Gu, Zhimin', 'Kraft, Ira L', 'Eiring, Anna M', 'Khorashad, Jamshid S', 'Pomicter, Anthony D', 'Zhang, Tian Y', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Corbin AS', ""O'Hare T"", 'Gu Z', 'Kraft IL', 'Eiring AM', 'Khorashad JS', 'Pomicter AD', 'Zhang TY', 'Eide CA', 'Manley PW', 'Cortes JE', 'Druker BJ', 'Deininger MW']","[""Authors' Affiliations: OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland; Huntsman Cancer Institute; Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland; and Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130725,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2013/07/28 06:00,2013/11/15 06:00,['2013/07/27 06:00'],"['2013/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-13-1318 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1318 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Sep 15;73(18):5775-86. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1318.

It is essential for maintenance of the normal colon crypt and has been implicated in colorectal cancer oncogenesis. Downregulation of the Notch pathway through gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) has been shown to induce apoptosis and enhance response to chemotherapy in a variety of malignancies. In this study, we analyzed the effect of MRK-003 (Merck), a potent inhibitor of gamma-secretase, on oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in colon cancer. Unexpectedly, gamma-secretase inhibition reduced oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis while GSI treatment alone was shown to have no effect on growth or apoptosis. We determined that the underlying mechanism of action involved an increase in protein levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Mcl-1 and/or Bcl-xL which resulted in reduced Bax and Bak activation. Blocking of Mcl-1 and/or Bcl-xL through siRNA or the small molecule inhibitor obatoclax restored the apoptotic potential of cells treated with both oxaliplatin and MRK-003. Moreover, obatoclax synergized with MRK-003 alone to induce apoptosis.

METHODS: This Phase I study was undertaken to define the toxicity and the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of the combination in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients with cytologic or histologic proof of unresectable solid tumors were treated with escalating doses of sorafenib (twice daily) and bortezomib (days 1, 4, 8 and 11 intravenously) with 21-day cycles. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (7 males, median age 65, range 24-74), with renal (3), lung (3), pancreas (2), and breast, adrenal gland, melanoma, spindle cell tumor, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma (1 each) were enrolled. All patients are off treatment, 10 due to disease progression. DLT was seen in two patients (one grade 3 abdominal pain and grade 4 lipase elevation; one with grade 3 vomiting) at sorafenib 200 mg twice daily and bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2), establishing the MTD. No grade 4 hematologic or grade 5 toxicities were seen. One patient with renal cell cancer had a partial response and 5 patients attained stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of sorafenib and bortezomib was tolerated well. The recommended phase 2 doses are sorafenib 200 mg twice daily continuously with bortezomib 1 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, 11 (21 day cycles).

Ablation of ITK subverts Th2 immunity, thereby potentiating Th1-based immune responses. While small-molecule ITK inhibitors have been identified, none have demonstrated clinical utility. Ibrutinib is a confirmed irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) with outstanding clinical activity and tolerability in B-cell malignancies. Significant homology between BTK and ITK alongside in silico docking studies support ibrutinib as an immunomodulatory inhibitor of both ITK and BTK. Our comprehensive molecular and phenotypic analysis confirms ITK as an irreversible T-cell target of ibrutinib. Using ibrutinib clinical trial samples along with well-characterized neoplastic (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), parasitic infection (Leishmania major), and infectious disease (Listeria monocytogenes) models, we establish ibrutinib as a clinically relevant and physiologically potent ITK inhibitor with broad therapeutic utility.

PURPOSE: . To identify methodological issues on utility measurements in children, we performed a systematic review on utilities measured with a single instrument, the Health Utilities Index (HUI), in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The secondary goal was to facilitate future cost-utility analyses without the need for time-consuming assessments. Data Sources. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to June 2012. Studies had to report on utility scores in pediatric ALL, either on or after treatment, to be included. RESULTS: . Fifteen studies were included. Most studies had methodological shortcomings, which mainly concerned STUDY DESIGN: and definition and representativeness of the study group. Utility scores were dependent on treatment variables, and there generally was an improvement in HRQL as treatment or survivorship advanced. In general, proxy-respondents were less reliable for subjective phenomena than for observable conditions. HUI2 and HUI3 scores were not interchangeable. Limitations. Studies may have been missed because no validated search method for utility studies exists, due to language bias or the exclusion of non-peer-reviewed papers. CONCLUSIONS: . Most studies in this review were methodologically suboptimal. Future developments should focus on including developmentally appropriate items for the whole pediatric age group. Adding disease-specific domains may enhance the sensitivity and responsiveness of instruments. Efforts should be undertaken to elicit valuation of health states from older children and teenagers as much as possible.

Among the different pharmacoepidemiological approaches assessing this risk, analysis of reports to pharmacovigilance (PV) system is uncommon. OBJECTIVES: To review cancers registered as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the French Pharmacovigilance Database (FPVDB). METHODS: This study was based on spontaneous reports of ADRs submitted to the French PV system. All cases of cancers reported in the FPVDB between 1995 and 2006 were reviewed. Cases with transgenerational effects, cases from patients with an history of primary cancer and cancers associated with antineoplastic drugs were excluded. Drugs were classified according ATC classification. Results. Out of 207 000 notifications, 414 cases of cancer (998 citations of drugs) were identified. Report s increased from 19 cases in 1995 to 70 in 2006. Patients' age ranged from 2 to 95 years. Gender was equally distributed. Most frequently reported cancers were lymphomas (22.7%), b asal or squamous cell carcinomas (16.4%) and leukemias (13.8%). Immunosuppressants (37.6%) were ranked in the first position followed by corticosteroids (9.3%). Potential drug-cancer associations, previously described in the literature (immunosuppressants, hydroxycarbamide, mitoxantrone, cyproterone and hormone replacement therapy) were found in the database. Other potential drug-cancer associations (leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after exposition to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors or interferon) were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer notifications in a PV database, although usually considered as poorly generalizable to the general population, appears to be useful in the surveillance of cancer risk associated to drugs. It allows both confirmation of already known data and detection of new signals. Combination of present data with pharmacoepidemiological studies and collaborations with cancer registries would allow better identification of these risk signals.",['(c) 2013 Societe Francaise de Pharmacologie et de Therapeutique.'],"['Durrieu, Genevieve', 'Mazau, Benjamin', 'Jegu, Jeremi', 'Lapeyre-Mestre, Maryse', 'Delord, Jean-Pierre', 'Montastruc, Jean-Louis']","['Durrieu G', 'Mazau B', 'Jegu J', 'Lapeyre-Mestre M', 'Delord JP', 'Montastruc JL']","['Hopitaux Universitaires de Toulouse, France. genevieve.durrieu@univ-tlse3.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130726,France,Therapie,Therapie,0420544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-HIV Agents/adverse effects', 'Antirheumatic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis B Vaccines/adverse effects', 'Hormones/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Pharmacovigilance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2013/07/28 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2013/07/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2515/therapie/2013023 [doi]', 'th132095 [pii]']",ppublish,Therapie. 2013 May-Jun;68(3):149-54. doi: 10.2515/therapie/2013023.

Similarly, this pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple B-cell malignancies. Genetic and pharmacological approaches have established an important role for the Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase isoform p110delta (PI3Kdelta) in coupling the BCR and other BCRs to B-cell survival, migration, and activation. In the past few years, several small-molecule inhibitory drugs that target PI3Kdelta, Btk, and Syk have been developed and shown to have efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of several types of B-cell malignancies. Emerging preclinical data have also shown a critical role of BCR signaling in the activation and function of self-reactive B cells that contribute to autoimmune diseases. Because BCR signaling plays a major role in both B-cell-mediated autoimmune inflammation and B-cell malignancies, inhibition of this pathway may represent a promising new strategy for treating these diseases.

Despite the advances in supportive care and the introduction of less intensive chemotherapy regimens, the overall outcome for this population remains poor. More importantly, the decision making process for choosing the appropriate treatment for individual patients, based on their comorbidities and the biological features of their disease, continues to be challenging for treating physicians. Currently, a significant number of elderly patients with AML do not receive treatment above and beyond supportive care; several studies have suggested that patients who receive any therapy have a better outcome than patients who receive palliation alone. Furthermore, the development of novel, targeted and less intensive therapies is providing new options suitable for older patients with multiple comorbidities and with high risk disease features.

Due to the expression pattern of CD19 throughout the B-cell lineage, and on most B-cell malignancies, it became a preferred target for the development of experimental therapeutic agents during the first years of the monoclonal antibodies era. Successful preclinical experiments led to the first generation of clinical trials, based predominantly on toxin/anti-CD19 murine immunoconjugates. These, however, mostly failed due to poor biochemical design of the reagents, and the generation of human anti-murine antibodies. Modern anti-CD19 reagents are based on humanized anti-CD19 antibodies designed to attract components of the immune system, predominantly T-cells, to eliminate CD19+ target cells. These include, for example, modified anti-CD19 antibodies, and bispecific anti-CD19/CD3 antibodies. One of the most attractive approaches to target malignant B-cells is based on the introduction of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) into patient derived T-cells. CARs are composed of extracellular recognition sequences derived from anti-CD19 antibodies, and intracellular signaling components that can foster T-cell activation. The novel anti-B-cell therapeutics have shown promising clinical effects against various B-cell malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), although expected side effects (e.g. significant immunosuppression) were also recorded.

Complete remission and minimal residual disease (MRD) rates were similar in both groups. Median TFI was shorter (95 vs. 144 months) in the pentostatin group, although the difference was not significant (p = 0.476). MRD+ patients had shorter TFI than MRD- patients (97 months vs. not reached, p < 0.049). A hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL predicted for a shorter TFI only in the pentostatin group.

One of the most severe complications of SSc involves the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Endothelial cell injury precedes the development of fibrosis, and is believed to be an initiating event. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the role of endothelial cells in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, using a well-established bleomycin (BLM) model of pulmonary fibrosis. Endothelial cells were isolated by cell sorting, and the analysis of gene expression was performed with quantitative RT-PCR. Endothelial injury was induced between the first and second week, as shown by the elevated expression of the vascular injury markers matrix metallopeptidase-12 and von Willebrand factor. After injury, endothelial activation was indicated by the up-regulation of selectins, CCL chemokines, and inflammatory mediators, including complement anaphylatoxin receptors (C3aR and C5aR), oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor. The endothelial cell overexpression of fibrotic mediators, including connective tissue growth factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, osteopontin, fibronectin, and fibroblast specific protein-1, was observed in the second and fourth weeks.

Here we show that leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), a RhoA-specific RGS-RhoGEF, is required for abscission, the final stage of cytokinesis, in which the intercellular membrane is cleaved between daughter cells. LARG colocalizes with alpha-tubulin at the spindle poles before localizing to the central spindle. During cytokinesis, LARG is condensed in the midbody, where it colocalizes with RhoA. HeLa cells depleted of LARG display apoptosis during cytokinesis with unresolved intercellular bridges, and rescue experiments show that expression of small interfering RNA-resistant LARG prevents this apoptosis. Moreover, live cell imaging of LARG-depleted cells reveals greatly delayed fission kinetics in abscission in which a population of cells with persistent bridges undergoes apoptosis; however, the delayed fission kinetics is rescued by Aurora-B inhibition. The formation of a Flemming body and thinning of microtubules in the intercellular bridge of cells depleted of LARG is consistent with a defect in late cytokinesis, just before the abscission event. In contrast to studies of other RhoGEFs, particularly Ect2 and GEF-H1, LARG depletion does not result in cytokinetic furrow regression nor does it affect internal mitotic timing. These results show that LARG is a novel and temporally distinct RhoGEF required for completion of abscission.",,"['Martz, Matthew K', 'Grabocka, Elda', 'Beeharry, Neil', 'Yen, Timothy J', 'Wedegaertner, Philip B']","['Martz MK', 'Grabocka E', 'Beeharry N', 'Yen TJ', 'Wedegaertner PB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107 Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20130724,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Aurora Kinase B/metabolism', '*Cytokinesis', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mitosis', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,,2013/07/26 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['mbc.E12-07-0533 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.E12-07-0533 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2013 Sep;24(18):2785-94. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E12-07-0533.

LIF function is thought to be mediated by its binding to LIF receptor (LIFR) and recruitment of coreceptor GP130 (glycoprotein 130), and this receptor complex then activates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/3. However, the importance of LIFR and GP130 acting via STAT3 in implantation remains uncertain, because constitutive inactivation of Lifr, Gp130, or Stat3 shows embryonic lethality in mice. To address this issue, we generated mice with conditional deletion of uterine Gp130 or Stat3 and show that both GP130 and STAT3 are critical for uterine receptivity and implantation. Implantation failure in these deleted mice is associated with higher uterine estrogenic responses prior to the time of implantation. These heightened estrogenic responses are not due to changes in ovarian hormone levels or expression of their nuclear receptors.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between prediagnostic plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and lymphoid cancer risk. DESIGN: We conducted a study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort of 1127 lymphoma cases and 1127 matched controls with a mean follow-up time of 7.1 y. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted incidence rate ratios of lymphoma risk in relation to plasma 25(OH)D. Season-standardized and season-specific 25(OH)D quartiles were used. We also analyzed 25(OH)D as a continuous variable and used predefined cutoffs. RESULTS: No statistically significant association between plasma 25(OH)D and overall lymphoid cancer risk was observed. A positive association for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma was noted only in those with a diagnosis made during the first 2 y of follow-up (P-heterogeneity = 0.03), which suggests the possibility of reverse causality. Further analysis restricted to participants with >/=2 y of follow-up time showed a significant association between 25(OH)D and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 161): adjusted incidence rate ratios were 0.40 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.90; P-trend = 0.05) and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.76; P-trend = 0.03) for the top compared with the bottom season-standardized and season-specific quartiles, respectively. Data on dietary vitamin D intake provided further support for the observed association (incidence rate ratio: 0.33; 95% CI = 0.12, 0.89; P-trend = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a protective role of high 25(OH)D concentration in lymphoid cancers overall. However, they suggest that higher concentrations of 25(OH)D are associated with a reduced risk of CLL.",,"['Luczynska, Anna', 'Kaaks, Rudolf', 'Rohrmann, Sabine', 'Becker, Susen', 'Linseisen, Jakob', 'Buijsse, Brian', 'Overvad, Kim', 'Trichopoulou, Antonia', 'Valanou, Elisavet', 'Barmpitsioti, Antonia', 'Masala, Giovanna', 'Agnoli, Claudia', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Panico, Salvatore', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita, H Bas', 'van Duijnhoven, Franzel J B', 'Peeters, Petra H M', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Weiderpass, Elisabete', 'Brustad, Magritt', 'Skeie, Guri', 'Gonzalez, Carlos A', 'Jakszyn, Paula', 'Quiros, J Ramon', 'Sanchez, Maria-Jose', 'Huerta, Jose Maria', 'Ardanaz, Eva', 'Melin, Beatrice', 'Johansson, Ann Sofie', 'Almquist, Martin', 'Malm, Johan', 'Khaw, Kay-Tee', 'Wareham, Nick', 'Travis, Ruth C', 'Fedirko, Veronika', 'Romieu, Isabelle', 'Jenab, Mazda', 'Gallo, Valentina', 'Riboli, Elio', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Nieters, Alexandra']","['Luczynska A', 'Kaaks R', 'Rohrmann S', 'Becker S', 'Linseisen J', 'Buijsse B', 'Overvad K', 'Trichopoulou A', 'Valanou E', 'Barmpitsioti A', 'Masala G', 'Agnoli C', 'Tumino R', 'Panico S', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita HB', 'van Duijnhoven FJ', 'Peeters PH', 'Vermeulen R', 'Weiderpass E', 'Brustad M', 'Skeie G', 'Gonzalez CA', 'Jakszyn P', 'Quiros JR', 'Sanchez MJ', 'Huerta JM', 'Ardanaz E', 'Melin B', 'Johansson AS', 'Almquist M', 'Malm J', 'Khaw KT', 'Wareham N', 'Travis RC', 'Fedirko V', 'Romieu I', 'Jenab M', 'Gallo V', 'Riboli E', 'Vineis P', 'Nieters A']","['Centre of Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center Freiburg and University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130724,United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma/blood/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood/therapeutic use']",,,2013/07/26 06:00,2013/10/26 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ajcn.112.054676 [pii]', '10.3945/ajcn.112.054676 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 2013 Sep;98(3):827-38. doi: 10.3945/ajcn.112.054676.

METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort in which we measured antibodies to EBV antigens [immunoglobulin G (IgG) to viral capsid antigen (VCA), nuclear antigen (EBNA1), and early antigen-diffuse (EA-D)] and EBV DNA load in prediagnostic samples of 491 B-cell NHL cases and 491 controls. RESULTS: We found no association with established EBV infection, based on seropositivity for VCA. Seropositivity for EBNA1 was associated with decreased risk of B-cell NHL, overall [OR = 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3-0.8] and for each of the histologic subtypes examined. Increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and related subtypes was observed with higher levels of EBV DNA and antibody to EA-D, both markers reflective of reactivation. These associations were strongest for cases with the shortest time interval between blood draw and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In balance, these results do not provide strong evidence of EBV playing a causal role in B-cell NHL in general population women. The associations we observed may reflect increased risk of NHL with underlying immune impairment or could be due to reverse causation. IMPACT: Further characterization of the subtype-specific association with CLL is warranted. Exclusion of cases with preclinical disease markers (such as monoclonal B-lymphocytosis for CLL) may help rule out reverse causation in future studies.",,"['De Roos, Anneclaire J', 'Martinez-Maza, Otoniel', 'Jerome, Keith R', 'Mirick, Dana K', 'Kopecky, Kenneth J', 'Madeleine, Margaret M', 'Magpantay, Larry', 'Edlefsen, Kerstin L', 'Lacroix, Andrea Z']","['De Roos AJ', 'Martinez-Maza O', 'Jerome KR', 'Mirick DK', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Madeleine MM', 'Magpantay L', 'Edlefsen KL', 'Lacroix AZ']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Drexel University School of Public Health, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Division of Public Health Sciences and Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; Departments of Obstetrics & Gynecology, and Microbiology, Immunology & Molecular Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center; UCLA AIDS Institute; and Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, California.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130724,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*epidemiology/virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies']",,,2013/07/26 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-13-0240 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0240 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2013 Oct;22(10):1747-55. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0240.

Infections in these patients mainly occur during neutropenic periods, and may be caused by Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The patients at highest risk of serious infections include those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and those undergoing myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This is a review with the main aim of making a critical appraisal of the literature, and summarising what is currently known and can be recommended. The most significant studies support the use of floroquinolones (mainly ciprofloxacin) as the most rational approach to treat pediatric patients with probably long-lasting neutropenia, although trimetoprim-sulphametoxazole and amoxicillin/clavulanate may theoretically be valid alternatives. No prophylaxis seems to be needed for children with cancer without severe neutropenia. However, a global evaluation of the studies of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with cancer indicates that there are not enough data to prepare definite guidelines for its use or avoidance in pediatric oncology, and so further studies are needed. It is not only important to define the best antibiotic regimens for the children in whom such prophylaxis is useful, but also to identify precisely those who do not need it. This would avoid the antibiotic misuse that probably occurs at the moment because many low-risk children with cancer are treated. As prophylaxis against infections requires long-term adherence to an antibiotic regimen, the attitudes and beliefs of stakeholders need to be fully considered.",,"['Cecinati, V', 'Principi, N', 'Brescia, L', 'Esposito, S']","['Cecinati V', 'Principi N', 'Brescia L', 'Esposito S']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Hematology, Santo Spirito Hospital, Pescara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130726,Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Neoplasms/*complications']",,,2013/07/26 06:00,2014/09/04 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2013/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10096-013-1932-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2014 Jan;33(1):1-6. doi: 10.1007/s10096-013-1932-7.

Here we show that COP1 is a ubiquitin ligase for the tumor suppressor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPalpha) and promotes its degradation in vivo, thereby blocking myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic cells for tumorigenesis. In this process, mammalian homolog of Tribbles, Trib1, which contains a COP1-binding motif, is essential for down-regulation of C/EBPalpha expression. Murine bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that coexpression of COP1 accelerates development of acute myeloid leukemia induced by Trib1, which pathologically resembles that of p42C/EBPalpha-deficient mice. Interestingly, coexpression of ligase activity-deficient COP1 mutant abrogated Trib1-induced leukemogenesis. These results indicate that COP1 and Trib1 act as an oncoprotein complex functioning upstream of C/EBPalpha, and its ligase activity is crucial for leukemogenesis.",,"['Yoshida, Akihiro', 'Kato, Jun-Ya', 'Nakamae, Ikuko', 'Yoneda-Kato, Noriko']","['Yoshida A', 'Kato JY', 'Nakamae I', 'Yoneda-Kato N']","['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130724,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",,,2013/07/26 06:00,2013/10/30 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)53514-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-12-476101 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Sep 5;122(10):1750-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-12-476101.

HIV has remained undetectable more than 6 years after discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. However, this approach cannot be readily generalized because of the low prevalence of the CCR5-Delta32 allele and the need for a very close human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match between adult donors and recipients, as when bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants are performed. In contrast, cord blood (CB) transplants require less stringent HLA matching. CB units are being screened to develop an inventory of cryopreserved homozygous CCR5-Delta32 units available for HCT.

HIP1R regulates internalization of cell surface receptors via endocytosis, a process relevant to many therapeutic strategies including CD20 targeting with rituximab. In this study, we characterized HIP1R expression patterns, investigated a mechanism of transcriptional regulation and its clinical relevance in DLBCL patients treated with immunochemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone, R-CHOP). HIP1R was preferentially expressed in germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL (P<0.0001) and inversely correlated with the activated B-cell-like DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL) associated transcription factor, Forkhead box P1 (FOXP1). HIP1R was confirmed as a direct FOXP1 target gene in ABC-DLBCL by FOXP1-targeted silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation.

We found that infection of astrocytes with the neuropathogenic retrovirus ts1, a mutant of Moloney murine leukemia retrovirus, upregulated ROS at low levels during the early phase of infection. This upregulation of intracellular ROS with downregulation of NADPH levels during the early phase of ts1 infection was a separate event from the upregulation of ROS during the late phase while ts1-mediated cell death occurred. The treatment of apocynin, a potential inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (NOX), inhibited establishment of the ts1 virus in the host cell. These results suggested that ROS generated as a consequence of the activation of NOX may play an important role in the early events of the virus life cycle leading to the establishment of the virus in the host cell. The in vitro results were further supported by an in vivo experiment which showed that the treatment of apocynin decreased viral titre in the ts1-infected mouse brain and increased the lifespan of infected mice. This study provides the first in vitro and in vivo evidence on a mechanism for how ROS are involved in ts1 retrovirus infection and ts1-mediated neurodegenerative disease. Our findings focusing on the early phase of the ts1 retrovirus life cycle could provide a better understanding of retroviral life cycle, which may offer specific therapeutic targets for suppressing viral replication and alleviating neurodegenerative symptoms in a mouse model.",,"['Kim, Soo Jin', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Kim SJ', 'Wong PKY']","['Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130724,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism/*virology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2013/07/26 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.055228-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2013 Oct;94(Pt 10):2309-2317. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.055228-0.

In the present study, two natural recombinant avian leukosis viruses (rALVs) (LC110515-5 and LC110803-5) carrying a subgroup C gp85 gene, a subgroup E gp37 gene, and a subgroup J 3'UTR and 3'LTR were isolated from two different lines of layer flocks, Black-bone silky fowl (BSF) and commercial layer chicken, that suffered from myeloid leukosis. Although tumours were not observed in rALV-infected individual chickens, other non-neoplastic inflammatory lesions were evident. The two rALVs were cultured on DF-1 cells and identified by PCR, immunofluorescence assay and gene sequencing. The gp85 nucleotide sequence in the two isolates displayed a high identity (>95 %) with that of the gp85 gene in ALV-C, but the identity was less than 90 % with ALV-A/B/D/E and only 51 % with ALV-J. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences confirmed that the two isolates were recombinant between ALV-C, ALV-E and ALV-J. Subgroup C ALV is rarely found in field cases. This report is the first to provide evidence that ALV-C has recombined with ALV-E and ALV-J in two different chicken lines.

METHODS: As part of the California Childhood Leukemia Study, we collected dust samples from 6 residences occupied by smokeless tobacco users, 6 residences occupied by active smokers, and 20 tobacco-free residences. Children's potential for exposure to tobacco constituents was assessed using nicotine concentrations in vacuum dust measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Median nicotine concentrations for residences with smokeless tobacco users were significantly greater than median nicotine concentrations for tobacco-free homes and similar to median nicotine concentrations in homes of active smokers. Using generalized estimating equations derived from a multivariable marginal model to adjust for a history of parental smoking, income, residence construction date, and mother's age and race/ethnicity, we found nicotine levels from homes of smokeless tobacco users to be 21-fold higher than nicotine levels from tobacco-free homes. Based on mass balance equations, we hypothesize that nicotine is transferred to floors in homes of smokeless tobacco users primarily as a constituent of tobacco that is spilled or expectorated. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we conclude that children living with smokeless tobacco users may be exposed to nicotine and other constituents of tobacco via contact with contaminated dust and household surfaces.",,"['Whitehead, Todd P', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Park, June-Soo', 'Does, Monique', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Rappaport, Stephen M']","['Whitehead TP', 'Metayer C', 'Park JS', 'Does M', 'Buffler PA', 'Rappaport SM']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20130724,England,Nicotine Tob Res,Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,9815751,IM,"['Air Pollution, Indoor/*analysis', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dust/*analysis', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nicotine/*analysis', 'Parents', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tobacco, Smokeless/*adverse effects']",,,2013/07/26 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2013/07/26 06:00'],"['2013/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ntt096 [pii]', '10.1093/ntr/ntt096 [doi]']",ppublish,Nicotine Tob Res. 2013 Dec;15(12):2045-52. doi: 10.1093/ntr/ntt096.
