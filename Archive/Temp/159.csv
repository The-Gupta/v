By 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends assay and DNA sequencing from mouse tissues and 7-15-day stage embryos, mRFC transcripts with four unique 5' noncoding exons, designated mRFC-a,-b,-c, and -d, were identified mapping over 6300 bp. The 5' noncoding exons were characterized by multiple transcription starts and, for form b, two alternate splice forms. mRFC transcript forms were measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR in mouse tissues and embryos and in L1210 leukemia and BNL CL.2 liver cell lines. The highest mRFC levels were detected in kidney and brain. mRFC-b and -c were the major transcript forms, with low levels of mRFC-a and -d. The 5'-flanking regions for exons a-d each exhibited promoter activity in reporter gene assays. mRFC transcripts and individual noncoding exons were measured in small intestine and kidney from mice fed folate-deficient or -replete diets. Mice fed the folate-deficient diet exhibited a significant (13.8-fold) increase in total mRFC transcripts and protein in the small intestine, reflecting increases in each of the mRFC-b, -c, and -d forms. Only minor changes in mRFC transcript levels or distributions were detected for kidney. Levels of folate-binding protein alpha were also increased in both small intestine and kidney in folate-deficient mice (91- and 2-fold, respectively). Multidrug resistance-associated proteins 1 and 3 were, likewise, elevated in intestine from folate-deficient mice (53- and 168-fold, respectively); however, there were no significant changes in kidney. Our results document the existence of four unique noncoding exons and promoters for mRFC and demonstrate a facile induction of mRNAs for mRFC and multidrug resistance-associated proteins 1 and 3 in intestine in response to changes in dietary folate intake.","['Liu, Mingjun', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Cabelof, Diane C', 'Aboukameel, Amro', 'Heydari, Ahmad R', 'Mohammad, Ramzi', 'Matherly, Larry H']","['Liu M', 'Ge Y', 'Cabelof DC', 'Aboukameel A', 'Heydari AR', 'Mohammad R', 'Matherly LH']","['Experimental and Clinical Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Waynes State University School of Medicine, 110 E.

There have been a large number of occupational studies over several decades, particularly on cancer, cardiovascular disease, adverse reproductive outcome, and cataract, in relation to RF exposure. More recently, there have been studies of residential exposure, mainly from radio and television transmitters, and especially focusing on leukemia. There have also been studies of mobile telephone users, particularly on brain tumors and less often on other cancers and on symptoms. Results of these studies to date give no consistent or convincing evidence of a causal relation between RF exposure and any adverse health effect. On the other hand, the studies have too many deficiencies to rule out an association. A key concern across all studies is the quality of assessment of RF exposure. Despite the ubiquity of new technologies using RFs, little is known about population exposure from RF sources and even less about the relative importance of different sources. Other cautions are that mobile phone studies to date have been able to address only relatively short lag periods, that almost no data are available on the consequences of childhood exposure, and that published data largely concentrate on a small number of outcomes, especially brain tumor and leukemia.","['Ahlbom, Anders', 'Green, Adele', 'Kheifets, Leeka', 'Savitz, David', 'Swerdlow, Anthony']","['Ahlbom A', 'Green A', 'Kheifets L', 'Savitz D', 'Swerdlow A']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. anders.ahlbom@imm.ki.se']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology', 'Cell Phone', 'Child', '*Environmental Exposure', '*Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects', 'Research Design', 'Risk Assessment']",2004/12/08 09:00,2005/03/03 09:00,['2004/12/08 09:00'],"['2004/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.7306 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2004 Dec;112(17):1741-54. doi: 10.1289/ehp.7306.,"['ICNIRP (International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) Standing', 'Committee on Epidemiology']","['Environ Health Perspect. 2005 Mar;113(3):A151; author reply A151-2.

Mice were treated with CDDP, 2 mg/kg i.p. twice a week nine times. During the last week some of the mice were also injected with LIF, 2 mug/kg s.c. every other day for a total of four injections. Development of neuropathy was evaluated with changes in tail flick latency and sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV). At the end of the treatment period dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were microscopically examined. Some of the DRGs were explanted into extracellular matrix, covered with culture medium and incubated for 3 days. During and at the end of the incubation, cellular migration and axonal outgrowth from the DRGs were quantified. LIF proved effective in reversing the increase in tail flick latency (p<0.05) and improving the reduction in NCV induced by CDDP. CDDP led to smaller nuclear and somatic size in neurons, while with LIF, the latter was restored to control values (p<0.01). No apoptotic nucleus was observed among DRG neurons while very few and moderate numbers detected among satellite and Schwann cells, respectively. With LIF, none of the cells had apoptosis. CDDP caused a decrease in the number of migrating cells and in the length of outgrowing axons while LIF treatment restored both capacities (p<0.05) In conclusion, in CDDP-induced neuropathy, LIF was found to be effective in correcting some functional and morphological deteriorations related with major involvement of Schwann cells.","['Ozturk, G', 'Erdogan, E', 'Anlar, O', 'Kosem, M', 'Taspinar, M']","['Ozturk G', 'Erdogan E', 'Anlar O', 'Kosem M', 'Taspinar M']","['Department of Physiology, Neuroscience Research Unit, Medical School, Yuzuncu Yil University, Fizyoloji ABD, 65200 Van, Turkey. drgurkan@yyu.edu.tr']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Axons/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cisplatin/*adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Female', 'Ganglia, Spinal/metabolism', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Neurons/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Schwann Cells/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2004/12/08 09:00,2005/06/07 09:00,['2004/12/08 09:00'],"['2003/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(04)00283-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2004.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2005 Jan 7;29(1):31-41. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2004.09.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not known whether the observed risk for adiposity in these patients is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity and whether the insulin sensitivity is affected by GH replacement therapy. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Eleven patients with GHD (median age 29 years), previously given prophylactic CRT for ALL, and 11 sex-, age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls were investigated with bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and analysis of serum leptin, serum free fatty acids (FFA) and serum insulin. Insulin sensitivity was measured by a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique (IS-clamp). Moreover, the effects of 12 months of individually titrated GH treatment (median dose 0.5 mg/day) on these parameters were investigated. RESULTS: At baseline, the patients had lower fat free mass (FFM) (P = 0.003), higher percentage fat mass (FM) (P = 0.05), serum insulin (P = 0.02) and serum leptin/kg FM (P = 0.01) than controls. The patients had a tendency towards impaired IS-clamp (P = 0.06), which disappeared after correction for body composition (IS-clamp/kg FFM; P > 0.5). In the patients, time since CRT was positively correlated with percentage FM (r = 0.70, P = 0.02), and there was an independent negative association between serum FFA and IS-clamp (P = 0.05). Twelve months of GH treatment increased serum IGF-I (P = 0.003) and FFM (P = 0.02) and decreased percentage FM (P = 0.03), but no significant changes were seen in serum leptin/kg FM, serum FFA, FFA-clamp, serum insulin or IS-clamp (all, P > or = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Young adult survivors of childhood ALL with GHD had increased fat mass, hyperleptinaemia and impaired insulin sensitivity, which could be a consequence of radiation-induced impairment of GH secretion or mediated by other hypothalamic dysfunctions, such as leptin resistance or other unknown factors, affected by CRT. Twelve months of individualized GH replacement therapy led to positive effects on body composition, but the hyperleptinaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and the impaired insulin sensitivity remained unchanged.","['Bulow, Birgitta', 'Link, Katarina', 'Ahren, Bo', 'Nilsson, Ann-Sofie', 'Erfurth, Eva Marie']","['Bulow B', 'Link K', 'Ahren B', 'Nilsson AS', 'Erfurth EM']","['Department of Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Leptin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/blood', 'Female', 'Glucose', 'Growth Hormone/*deficiency/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Leptin/*blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Survivors']",2004/12/08 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2004/12/08 09:00'],"['2004/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEN2149 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2265.2004.02149.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2004 Dec;61(6):683-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.2004.02149.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietary exposure to benzopyrones is quite significant, as these compounds are found in vegetables, fruit, seeds, nuts, coffee, tea and wine. It is estimated that the average western diet contains approximately 1 g/day of mixed benzopyrones. It is, therefore, not difficult to see why extensive research into their pharmacological and therapeutic properties is underway over many years. Coumarin is a natural substance that has shown anti-tumour activity in vivo, with the effect believed to be due to its metabolites (e.g. 7-hydroxycoumarin). This review is based on recent studies of coumarins and coumarin related compounds. Therefore, the focus will be on these relevant compounds and their therapeutic importance. A recent study has shown that 7-hydroxycoumarin inhibits the release of Cyclin D1, which is overexpressed in many types of cancer. This knowledge may lead to its use in cancer therapy. Esculetin inhibits growth and cell cycle progression by inducing arrest of the G(1) phase in HL-60 leukaemia cells, resulting from the inhibition of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. Recent studies investigating the potential of flavonoids as therapeutic agents have suggested they may have use in various therapeutic settings ranging from leukaemia treatment to the treatment of patients with HIV. Genistein is a well-known isoflavone and is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Studies have indicated that genistein elicits inhibitory effects on cell growth of various carcinoma cell-lines and may be a potential candidate for cancer therapy. In our research, we have investigated the effects of coumarins and coumarin-related compounds on a panel of cell-lines. The most recent work involves two cell-lines, MCF-7 a breast carcinoma and A549 a lung carcinoma. Microtitre assays were performed along with real-time analysis of cell viability using a biosensor called the Cytosensor microphysiometer. These studies suggest that both genistein and esculetin exerted the most potent inhibitory effect on cell growth in comparison to the other two compounds.","['Lacy, Aoife', ""O'Kennedy, Richard""]","['Lacy A', ""O'Kennedy R""]","['Applied Biochemistry Group, School of Biotechnology, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,['0 (Coumarins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Coumarins/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/12/08 09:00,2004/12/28 09:00,['2004/12/08 09:00'],"['2004/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1381612043382693 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2004;10(30):3797-811. doi: 10.2174/1381612043382693.,,,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genomic sequences as well as cDNA, large transcriptional regulatory sequences for cell type-specific expression, or multiple transgenes can be inserted in a modular fashion. HSV-1 amplicon vectors deliver DNA efficiently into the cell nucleus as an extrachromosomal, non-replicating circular concatenate, which is rapidly diluted, at least in dividing cells. Consequently, transgene expression is lost within days to weeks in dividing cells, but may be retained for months in non-dividing cells. In contrast, vectors based on Epstein-Barr virus, adeno-associated virus, or retroviruses can mediate long-term transgene expression, as vector DNA is retained by episomal replication or chromosomal integration. Hybrid amplicons use genetic elements from HSV-1 that allow replication and packaging of the vector DNA into HSV-1 virions, thereby conserving the large transgene capacity of HSV-1, and genetic elements from other viruses that confer genetic stability to the vector DNA within transduced cells. Additional strategies to sustain genetic material in infected cells include the incorporation of recombinases from different bacteriophages or transposable elements of the Tc1/mariner family in the amplicon vector. Moreover, modification of the HSV-1 virion itself offers a myriad of possibilities to improve gene delivery by targeting specific cell populations or transporting foreign proteins, such as Cre recombinase or the adeno-associated virus Rep protein, which can control the fate and expression of the therapeutic transgene.","['Oehmig, Angelika', 'Fraefel, Cornel', 'Breakefield, Xandra O', 'Ackermann, Mathias']","['Oehmig A', 'Fraefel C', 'Breakefield XO', 'Ackermann M']","['Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Gene Ther,Current gene therapy,101125446,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dependovirus/*genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics/physiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/physiology', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Replicon', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Virus Integration', 'Virus Latency', 'Virus Replication']",2004/12/08 09:00,2005/04/01 09:00,['2004/12/08 09:00'],"['2004/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1566523043346129 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Gene Ther. 2004 Dec;4(4):385-408. doi: 10.2174/1566523043346129.,,,210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The field has undergone substantial technical and conceptual evolution during the past 2 decades, and its role has expanded to new arenas, such as monitoring disease activities and detecting alterations in genes that are known to have a significant impact on disease outcome. OBJECTIVE: To review the advances in molecular diagnostics on lymphoid malignancies, including recent developments that may facilitate the development of mechanism-based diagnosis for individualized therapy. DESIGN: The development of molecular diagnostics in lymphoid malignancies is briefly reviewed with emphasis on the recent use of gene expression profiling for identifying important diagnostic and prognostic signatures. RESULTS: Genome-scale investigations are becoming technically feasible and have provided promising results in the identification of new disease entities and new, molecularly defined prognosticators. This development can potentially revolutionize diagnostic medicine in the near future. As new genes or genetic pathways that affect the clinical and biologic behavior of tumors are defined and can be readily assayed, molecular diagnostics will be expected to provide this relevant information. Ideally, therapy will be based on this information, delivering the most appropriate treatment with the least toxicity.

The phosphorylated triphosphate, cytosine arabinoside triphosphate, competes with deoxycytosine triphosphate as a substrate for incorporation into DNA. Once incorporated into DNA, it inhibits DNA polymerase and topoisomerase I and modifies the tertiary structure of DNA. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the substitution of Ara-C for cytosine in double-stranded oligonucleotides that contain 4 specific transcription factor binding sites (TATA, GATA, C/EBP, and AP-2alpha) alters transcription factor binding to their respective DNA binding elements. DESIGN: Transcription factors were obtained from nuclear extracts from human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. [32P]-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides that contained 1 or 2 specific transcription factor binding sites with or without Ara-C substitution for cytosine were used to assess transcription factor binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: The substitution of Ara-C for cytosine within and outside the transcription factor binding element (AP-2alpha, C/EBP), outside the binding element only (GATA, TATA), or within the binding element only (AP-2alpha) all result in a reduction in transcription factor binding to their respective DNA binding element. CONCLUSION: The reduction of the binding capacity of transcription factors with their respective DNA binding elements may depend on structural changes within oligonucleotides induced by Ara-C incorporation. This altered binding capacity of transcription factors to their DNA binding elements may represent one mechanism for Ara-C cytotoxicity secondary to inhibition of transcription of new messenger RNAs and, subsequently, translation of new proteins.","['Zhang, Ximbo', 'Kiechle, Frederick L']","['Zhang X', 'Kiechle FL']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Mich 48073, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (TATA-Box Binding Protein)', '0 (TFAP2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/drug effects/genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cytosine/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/genetics', 'TATA-Box Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/12/08 09:00,2005/05/21 09:00,['2004/12/08 09:00'],"['2004/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['AS3283 [pii]', '10.5858/2004-128-1364-CASDTF [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2004 Dec;128(12):1364-71. doi: 10.5858/2004-128-1364-CASDTF.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, the authors demonstrated that low apoptotic activity was correlated with the progression of HM to GTN, and they hypothesized that some apoptosis-related genes may determine this progression. METHODS: The differential expression of apoptotic genes in HMs that subsequently developed into GTN was compared with the same expression in HMs that spontaneously regressed using a human apoptosis array; then, the expression was evaluated with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry using 54 clinical samples from patients with HMs who had follow-up data available. RESULTS: Using an apoptosis array, greater expression of Mcl-1, which is an antiapoptotic gene, was detected in HMs that subsequently developed into GTN. It was confirmed that the levels of Mcl-1 RNA expression (P = 0.017) and Mcl-1 protein expression (P < 0.001) in HMs that developed into persistent disease and required chemotherapy were significantly greater compared with the levels in HMs that regressed. Moreover, Mcl-1 immunoreactivity, which was detected predominantly in cytotrophoblasts, was correlated with the apoptotic index, as assessed with M30 cytoDeath immunohistochemistry, which is a good indicator of apoptotic events in the early-stage disease. CONCLUSIONS: The current results demonstrated that Mcl-1, as identified by a cyclic DNA array, may play a role in the pathogenesis of HMs and may have potential as a useful marker for predicting the clinical behavior of HMs.","['Fong, Pui-Yee', 'Xue, Wei-Cheng', 'Ngan, Hextan Y S', 'Chan, Kelvin Y K', 'Khoo, Ui-Soon', 'Tsao, Siu-Wah', 'Chiu, Pui-Man', 'Man, Lai-Shan', 'Cheung, Annie N Y']","['Fong PY', 'Xue WC', 'Ngan HY', 'Chan KY', 'Khoo US', 'Tsao SW', 'Chiu PM', 'Man LS', 'Cheung AN']","['Department of Pathology, Hong Kong Jockey Club Clinical Research Centre, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gestational Trophoblastic Disease/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydatidiform Mole/genetics/*pathology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Logistic Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology']",2004/12/04 09:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20767 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Jan 15;103(2):268-76. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20767.,,,,,['(c) 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A search of published articles in Medline (PubMed) and abstracts from professional meetings was performed. An electronic database search of patients with CLL at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) determined the incidence of Richter syndrome (RS) in patients with CLL between 1992 and 2002. RS occurs in approximately 5% of patients with CLL. The large cells of RS may arise through transformation of the original CLL clone or represent a new neoplasm. RS may be triggered by viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus. Trisomy 12 and chromosome 11 abnormalities are more frequent in patients with RS than in the overall population of patients with CLL. Multiple genetic defects, such as mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, p16INK4A, and p21, loss of p27 expression, deletion of retinoblastoma, increased copy number of C-MYC, and decreased expression of the A-MYB gene, have been described. These abnormalities may cause CLL cells to proliferate and-by facilitating the acquisition of new genetic abnormalities-to transform into RS cells. Therapeutic strategies include intensive chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and stem cell transplantation. The response rates range from 5% to 43% (complete response, 5-38%), and the median survival duration ranges from 5 months to 8 months. In conclusion, RS may be triggered by viral infections or by genetic defects. Current treatments are aggressive, but prognosis is poor.

Evidence accumulated over the recent years has indicated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway as one of the major factors implicated in cancer resistance to conventional therapies. Indeed, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt axis regulates the expression and/or function of many anti-apoptotic proteins which strongly contributes to cancer cell survival. As a result, small molecules designed to specifically target key components of this signaling network are now being developed for clinical use as single therapeutic agents and/or in combination with other forms of therapy to overcome resistance. Initially, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway has been mainly investigated in solid tumors. Recently, however, this network has also been recognized as an important therapeutic target in human leukemias. Specific inhibition of this signalling pathway may be a valid approach to treat these diseases and increase the efficacy of standard types of therapy.","['Martelli, A M', 'Tabellini, G', 'Bortul, R', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Cappellini, A', 'Billi, A M', 'Cocco, L']","['Martelli AM', 'Tabellini G', 'Bortul R', 'Tazzari PL', 'Cappellini A', 'Billi AM', 'Cocco L']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Sezione di Anatomia Umana, Cell signalling Laboratory, Universita di Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy. amartell@biocfarm.unibo.it""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/physiology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2004/12/04 09:00,2005/04/27 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-20.239 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2005 Jan;20(1):239-52. doi: 10.14670/HH-20.239.,,,144,,,,10.14670/HH-20.239 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,

Prevention of this serious complication is therefore a high priority. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of early vancomycin administration on rates and outcomes of VSB. METHODS: We analyzed the effect of early vancomycin on the incidence of VSB in a cohort of 430 consecutive HSCTs performed during the period of 1 January 1998 to 30 September 2002. The primary end point was time to diagnosis of VSB. Early vancomycin was defined as >or=2 doses of vancomycin between days -7 through +7 after HSCT or diagnosis of VSB, whichever occurred first. Risk factors for VSB were identified in univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The incidence of VSB in the cohort was 7.4%. The incidence of VSB in patients who did not receive early vancomycin was 24.8%, compared with 0.3% in patients who did (P<.001). Additional risk factors were female sex, conditioning with total body irradiation, and diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The attributable mortality rate for VSB in our cohort was 21%. Early vancomycin was associated with decreased VSB (hazard ratio, 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.003-0.19) after controlling for age, sex, underlying disease, and transplantation variables.

However, long-term GC treatment is associated with severe side effects. To increase the ratio of wanted and unwanted GC effects, is, therefore, a desirable goal, which could be achieved by either developing new ""dissociating"" GC or by combining conventional GC therapy with substances that selectively interfere with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function. Vitamin B6 was previously shown to inhibit GR transactivation in non-immune cells. In the present study, we tested whether vitamin B6 would also interfere with GR function in immune cells and/or with transrepression in non-immune cells. Normal human lymphocytes and Jurkat T lymphoma cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs under the control of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promoter, respectively. Cells were stimulated with phorbol ester, ionomycin, and different concentrations of dexamethasone, either in the absence (a vitamin B6-free medium was especially prepared for this study) or presence of vitamin B6. Both promoters were strongly induced in response to phorbol ester and ionomycin. Dexamethasone inhibited this effect in a dose-dependent manner both in the presence and absence of vitamin B6. Similar results were obtained at the protein level (IL-2- and LIF-specific ELISAs). Induction of a glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-driven promoter construct by dexamethasone in lymphoid cells was only marginally reduced by vitamin B6. In contrast, GR-mediated transactivation was strongly inhibited by vitamin B6 in HeLa cells, while GR-mediated transrepression of a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter construct was not affected. Our data indicate that vitamin B6 does not interfere with GC action in immune cells (wanted GC effects) while selectively inhibiting GR-dependent transactivation in non-immune cells (unwanted GC effects). Combination of GC treatment with supraphysiological doses of vitamin B6 may, thus, reduce the side effects of this type of immunosuppressive therapy, provided that the observed effects can be reproduced at subtoxic vitamin B6 concentrations in vivo.","['Bamberger, C M', 'Else, T', 'Ellebrecht, I', 'Milde-Langosch, K', 'Pankoke, D', 'Beil, F U', 'Bamberger, A-M']","['Bamberger CM', 'Else T', 'Ellebrecht I', 'Milde-Langosch K', 'Pankoke D', 'Beil FU', 'Bamberger AM']","['Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. bamberger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes,"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",9505926,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8059-24-3 (Vitamin B 6)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cytokines/blood', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Vitamin B 6/*pharmacology']",2004/12/04 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-830405 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes. 2004 Nov;112(10):595-600. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-830405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that the Janus kinase TYK2 serves an opposite function. Mice deficient in TYK2 developed Abelson-induced B lymphoid leukemia/lymphoma as well as TEL-JAK2-induced T lymphoid leukemia with a higher incidence and shortened latency compared with WT controls. The cell-autonomous properties of Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed (A-MuLV-transformed) TYK2(-/-) cells were unaltered, but the high susceptibility of TYK2(-/-) mice resulted from an impaired tumor surveillance, and accordingly, TYK2(-/-) A-MuLV-induced lymphomas were easily rejected after transplantation into WT hosts. The increased rate of leukemia/lymphoma formation was linked to a decreased in vitro cytotoxic capacity of TYK2(-/-) NK and NKT cells toward tumor-derived cells. RAG2/TYK2 double-knockout mice succumbed to A-MuLV-induced leukemia/lymphoma faster than RAG2(-/-)TYK2(+/-) mice. This defines NK cells as key players in tumor surveillance in Abelson-induced malignancies. Our observations provide compelling evidence that TYK2 is an important regulator of lymphoid tumor surveillance.","['Stoiber, Dagmar', 'Kovacic, Boris', 'Schuster, Christian', 'Schellack, Carola', 'Karaghiosoff, Marina', 'Kreibich, Rita', 'Weisz, Eva', 'Artwohl, Michaela', 'Kleine, Olaf C', 'Muller, Mathias', 'Baumgartner-Parzer, Sabina', 'Ghysdael, Jacques', 'Freissmuth, Michael', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Stoiber D', 'Kovacic B', 'Schuster C', 'Schellack C', 'Karaghiosoff M', 'Kreibich R', 'Weisz E', 'Artwohl M', 'Kleine OC', 'Muller M', 'Baumgartner-Parzer S', 'Ghysdael J', 'Freissmuth M', 'Sexl V']","['Department of Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Liver/cytology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'TYK2 Kinase']",2004/12/04 09:00,2005/02/09 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI22315 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2004 Dec;114(11):1650-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI22315.,,,,PMC529282,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, clinical and hematopathologic findings partially overlap. This has raised questions as to whether these are indeed separate, definable entities. To determine the potential importance of bone marrow biopsy supplemented by immunohistochemistry in distinguishing between these two conditions, we studied 17 bone marrow biopsies of well-characterized cases of acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis (six cases) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (11 cases). We compared blast frequency, reticulin content, CD34 expression, and the degree of megakaryocytic differentiation of the blast cells in these two conditions. Our results demonstrate important differences. Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis is characterized by a multilineage myeloid proliferation with a less numerous population of blasts than acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (P<0.01). In the former condition, blasts are always positive with CD34, while in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia they express CD34 in 60% of the cases. The blasts in acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis only rarely express megakaryocytic antigens. By contrast, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia has a significantly higher proportion of blasts expressing megakaryocytic antigens (P<0.01 with CD42b). Our results confirm that histology supplemented by immunohistochemistry permits the distinction of these conditions in routinely processed bone marrow biopsies.","['Orazi, Attilio', ""O'Malley, Dennis P"", 'Jiang, Jiazhong', 'Vance, Gail H', 'Thomas, Janice', 'Czader, Magdalena', 'Fang, Wei', 'An, Caroline', 'Banks, Peter M']","['Orazi A', ""O'Malley DP"", 'Jiang J', 'Vance GH', 'Thomas J', 'Czader M', 'Fang W', 'An C', 'Banks PM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202-5200, USA. aorazi@iupui.edu']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/metabolism/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",2004/12/04 09:00,2005/06/25 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['3800348 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.3800348 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2005 May;18(5):603-14. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800348.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of RIT with alpha emitters is attractive because of the high linear energy transfer (LET) and short path length, allowing higher tumour cell kill and lower toxicity to healthy tissues. AIM: To assess the binding of rituximab to samples of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), and to evaluate the induction of apoptosis by conventional therapies as well as with Bi conjugated to rituximab. METHOD: 213Bi was eluted from a 225Ac generator and conjugated to CD20 antibody (rituximab) with CHX-A''-DTPA as chelator. Binding assays with 213Bi-rituximab were correlated to antibody binding capacity obtained by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was scored by flow cytometric analyses of the cells stained with annexin V-FITC and 7-amino-actinomycin D. RESULTS: Binding of 213Bi-rituximab was significantly lower for B-CLL compared to SLVL samples (12+/-3 and 42+/-10 213Bi atoms per cell, respectively, at 370 kBq.ml(-1)). The induction of apoptosis did not differ significantly between the two groups (B-CLL and SLVL) after external gamma irradiation or treatment with methylprednisolone and fludarabine (17+/-12% and 18+/-11%; 23+/-14% and 21+/-12%; 9+/-9% and 11+/-8%, respectively; all results expressed as percentages of all cells). Rituximab conjugated or not to 213Bi induced significantly more apoptosis in SLVL (42+/-19% and 42+/-17%) compared to B-CLL samples (27+/-12% and 6+/-8%). CONCLUSION: Binding assays confirm that SLVL samples present more CD20 antigens compared to B-CLL samples. Conventional therapies such as fludarabine, methylprednisolone or external gamma irradiation induce similar responses in the two populations but SLVL samples present higher sensitivity towards 213Bi-rituximab. These data are in favour of alpha-RIT in SLVL patients.","['Vandenbulcke, Katia', 'Thierens, Hubert', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Janssens, Ann', 'de Gelder, Virginie', 'Bacher, Klaus', 'Philippe, Jan', 'De Vos, Filip', 'Dierckx, Rudi', 'Apostolidis, Christos', 'Morgenstern, Alfred', 'Slegers, Guido']","['Vandenbulcke K', 'Thierens H', 'Offner F', 'Janssens A', 'de Gelder V', 'Bacher K', 'Philippe J', 'De Vos F', 'Dierckx R', 'Apostolidis C', 'Morgenstern A', 'Slegers G']","['Department of Radiopharmacy, Ghent University, Belgium.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",IM,"['Alpha Particles/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Bismuth/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/methods', 'Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/12/04 09:00,2005/03/23 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['00006231-200411000-00011 [pii]', '10.1097/00006231-200411000-00011 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 2004 Nov;25(11):1131-6. doi: 10.1097/00006231-200411000-00011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the differential toxicity of 123I-MIBG towards neuroblastoma cells and cells of haematopoietic lineage has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To compare the toxic effects of 123I-MIBG on SK-N-SH and SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cells and on cells of haematopoietic lineage, specifically HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cells and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) from human adult donors. METHODS: The antiproliferative effects of exchange-labelled or no carrier added (n.c.a.) 123I-MIBG, unlabelled MIBG or the trimethylsilylbenzylguanidine (MTBG) precursor used to prepare n.c.a. 123I-MIBG against SK-N-SH or SK-N-BE(2) cells or HL-60 cells were evaluated using a cell proliferation assay. The toxicity of 123I-MIBG towards SK-N-SH cells or BMSCs from healthy adult human donors was studied using a clonogenic assay. RESULTS: 123I-MIBG was strongly growth inhibitory to SK-N-SH or SK-N-BE(2) cells at concentrations (IC50 185-370 mBq.ml(-1); IC90 740 mBq.ml(-1)) that were sparing to HL-60 cells. Treatment of SK-N-SH cells with 74 mBq of 123I-MIBG decreased colony formation by >90%, whereas colonies from all three populations of stem cells were formed at amounts up to 370 mBq. It was discovered that the MTBG precursor was non-specifically toxic towards both SK-N-SH cells and HL-60 cells, suggesting the need to purify n.c.a. 123I-MIBG for clinical use. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that 123I-MIBG is a promising novel radiotherapeutic agent for neuroblastoma. For the first time, we report that the MTBG precursor used to prepare n.c.a. 123I-MIBG was toxic towards neuroblastoma cells as well as to HL-60 cells, representing cells of the haematopoietic lineage, suggesting the need for purification.","['He, Ying', 'Das, Bikul', 'Baruchel, Sylvain', 'Kumar, Piyush', 'Wiebe, Leonard', 'Reilly, Raymond M']","['He Y', 'Das B', 'Baruchel S', 'Kumar P', 'Wiebe L', 'Reilly RM']","['Division of Nuclear Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/*pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/12/04 09:00,2005/03/23 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['00006231-200411000-00010 [pii]', '10.1097/00006231-200411000-00010 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 2004 Nov;25(11):1125-30. doi: 10.1097/00006231-200411000-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seven hundred and eighty nine children (< 15 years old) diagnosed with ALL in the province of Quebec between 1980 and 2000 were recruited for study. A similar number of population based controls matched to cases (1:1) by sex and age were chosen from family allowance or health insurance files. Information was gathered via telephone interview with the subjects' parents. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Risk of childhood ALL was significantly increased in the offspring of mothers who reported using any medication (adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0-1.6) or any teratogenic medication (OR(adj) = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9) during pregnancy. Among specific medication categories, only central nervous system depressants were associated with a significantly increased risk, although elevated odd ratios were found for anti-epileptics, immunosuppressants, oral contraceptives, and illicit drugs. Risk associated with use of teratogenic medications was higher with increased dose and in children diagnosed before two years of age.

The Lif knockout female mice are infertile because of uterine defects that affect embryo implantation, but pregnancy can be rescued in these mice by injections of LIF on D4 of pregnancy. Many of the specific actions of LIF in the uterus are unknown, especially with regard to uterine cell biology. Leukocytes, such as macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and eosinophils, are present in the pregnant uterus and are thought to be beneficial, because alterations in their proportions can adversely affect pregnancy. Immunocytochemistry and cell counting were used to compare the distributions and dynamics of leukocyte subpopulations in wild-type and Lif knockout mice. The percentage of macrophages was reduced by more than half in the Lif knockout mice on D3 of pregnancy, and their distribution was disrupted, suggesting that LIF is a chemokine for these cells. The NK cells were detected as early as D3 of pregnancy, but the Lif knockout mice had double the percentage of NK cells compared to wild-type mice at this time, indicating that LIF restricts the migration of NK cells to the uterus. The Lif knockout mice also had significantly higher percentages of eosinophils in the outer stroma on D3, and in the midstroma on D4, of pregnancy, suggesting that LIF also may restrict eosinophil migration to the uterus. These alterations of the uterine leukocyte subpopulations in Lif knockout mice may disrupt pregnancy and contribute to failure of implantation.","['Schofield, Gemma', 'Kimber, Susan J']","['Schofield G', 'Kimber SJ']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041201,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Eosinophils/cytology/immunology', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Interleukin-6', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Macrophages/cytology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Uterus/*cytology/*immunology']",2004/12/04 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['biolreprod.104.034876 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.104.034876 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2005 Apr;72(4):872-8. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.104.034876.

However, it is important to recognise that health care possesses a number of characteristics that set it apart from other hazardous domains. These include the diversity of activity and equipment, a high degree of uncertainty, the vulnerability of patients, and a one to one or few to one mode of delivery. Those in direct contact with patients, particularly nurses and junior doctors, often have little opportunity to reform the system's defences. It is argued that some organisational accident sequences could be thwarted at the last minute if those on the frontline had acquired some degree of error wisdom.

The expression of the 28-kDa protein in normal lymphohematopoietic tissues was restricted to B cells and plasma cells and clearly differed from that expected for IRTA1 (selectively expressed by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] marginal zone B cells). Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE)/mass-spectrometry analysis identified the 28-kDa protein as human tumor protein D52 (TPD52), whose expression had been previously described only in normal and neoplastic epithelia. Specific B28p reactivity with TPD52 was confirmed by immunostaining/immunoblotting of TPD52-transfected cells. TPD52 expression pattern in normal and neoplastic B cells was unique. In fact, unlike other B-cell molecules (paired box 5 [PAX5], CD19, CD79a, CD20, CD22), which are down-regulated during differentiation from B cells to plasma cells, TPD52 expression reached its maximum levels at the plasma cell stage. In the Thiel myeloma cell line, TPD52 bound to annexin VI in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, suggesting that these molecules may act in concert to regulate secretory processes in plasma cells, similarly to what was observed in pancreatic acinar cells.

Overexpression of FAS , BCL2L12 and caspase-3 was observed after treatment of HL-60 cells for 3 or 6 h with carboplatin, while their expression was decreased after a 12-h treatment, demonstrating that these genes may take part in the early stages of apoptosis. Overexpression of the same genes was also observed after 6 h of treatment with doxorubicin (concomitantly with DNA laddering).

Animal and tissue culture studies have shown that Tpl2/Cot is involved in interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production by T-cells contributing to T-cell proliferation. In the present report we examined a series of 12 adult patients with various T-cell malignancies, all with predominant leukemic expression in the periphery, for the expression of Tpl2/Cot oncogene in order to determine a possible involvement of Tpl2/Cot in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms. RESULTS: Our results showed that Tpl2/Cot was overexpressed in all four patients with Large Granular Lymphocyte proliferative disorders (LGL-PDs) but in none of the remaining eight patients with other T-cell neoplasias. Interestingly, three of the LGL-PD patients displayed neutropenia, one in association with sarcoidosis. Serum TNF-alpha levels were increased in all Tpl2/Cot overexpressing patients while serum IL-2 was undetectable in all subjects studied. Genomic DNA analysis revealed no DNA amplification at the Tpl2/Cot locus in any of the samples analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Tpl2/Cot, a gene extensively studied in animal and tissue culture T-cell models may be also involved in the development of human LGL-PD and may have a role in the pathogenesis of immune manifestations associated with these diseases. This is the first report implicating Tpl2/Cot in human T-cell neoplasias and provides a novel molecular event in the development of LGL-PDs.","['Christoforidou, Anna V', 'Papadaki, Helen A', 'Margioris, Andrew N', 'Eliopoulos, George D', 'Tsatsanis, Christos']","['Christoforidou AV', 'Papadaki HA', 'Margioris AN', 'Eliopoulos GD', 'Tsatsanis C']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry-Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Crete and University Hospital of Heraklion, 71110 Heraklion, Crete, Greece. christoforidou@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041203,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K8 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/blood', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",2004/12/04 09:00,2005/11/11 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['1476-4598-3-34 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-3-34 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2004 Dec 3;3(1):34. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-3-34.,,,,PMC539294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the human neutrophil elastase gene (ELA2), causing increased intracellular concentration of this serine protease, inhibits neutrophil differentiation in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Since the clinical symptoms of agranulocytosis and SCN are similar, we hypothesized that it may origin from a common genetic variation in ELA2 or that sulphasalazine may affect human neutrophil elastase activity and protein expression. METHODS: We screened for genetic differences in ELA2 in DNA from 36 patients who had suffered from sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis, and compared them with 72 patients treated with sulphasalazine without blood reactions. We also performed in vitro studies of the blood cell lines HL60 and U937 after sulphasalazine exposure with respect to cell survival index, neutrophil elastase protein expression and activity. RESULTS: None of the mutations in ELA2, which previously have been reported to be associated with SCN, was found in this material. Protein expression of human neutrophil elastase in lymphoma U937 cells was not affected by treatment with concentrations equivalent to therapeutic doses. Cell survival of lymphoma U937 and promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells was not affected in this concentration range, but exhibited a decreased proliferative capacity with higher sulphasalazine concentrations. Interestingly the promyelocytic cells were more sensitive to sulphasalazine than the lymphoma cell line. CONCLUSION: Neutrophil elastase expression and ELA2 mutations do, however, not seem to be involved in the etilogy of sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis. Why sulphasalazine is more toxic to promyelocytes than to lymphocytes remains to be explained.","['Jacobson, Annica', 'Melhus, Hakan', 'Wadelius, Mia']","['Jacobson A', 'Melhus H', 'Wadelius M']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala University Hospital S- 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.

Glut1, the major vertebrate glucose transporter, has been shown to be the HTLV Env receptor. While it is well established that the extracellular surface component (SU) of the HTLV envelope glycoprotein (Env) harbors all of the determinants of interaction with the receptor, identification of SU subdomains that are necessary and sufficient for interaction with the receptor, as well as critical amino acids therein, remain to be precisely defined. Although highly divergent in the rest of their genomes, HTLV and murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env appear to be related and based on homologous motifs between the HTLV and MLV SU, we derived chimeric HTLV/MLV Env and soluble HTLV-1 and -2 truncated amino terminal SU subdomains. RESULTS: Using these SU constructs, we found that the 183 and 178 amino terminal residues of the HTLV-1 and -2 Env, respectively, were sufficient to efficiently bind target cells of different species. Binding resulted from bona fide interaction with the HTLV receptor as isolated SU subdomains specifically interfered with HTLV Env-mediated binding, cell fusion, and cell-free as well as cell-to-cell infection. Therefore, the HTLV receptor-binding domain (RBD) lies in the amino terminus of the SU, immediately upstream of a central immunodominant proline rich region (Env residues 180 to 205), that we show to be dispensible for receptor-binding and interference. Moreover, we identified a highly conserved tyrosine residue at position 114 of HTLV-1 Env, Tyr114, as critical for receptor-binding and subsequent interference to cell-to-cell fusion and infection. Finally, we observed that residues in the vicinity of Tyr114 have lesser impact on receptor binding and had various efficiency in interference to post-binding events. CONCLUSIONS: The first 160 residues of the HTLV-1 and -2 mature cleaved SU fold as autonomous domains that contain all the determinants required for binding the HTLV receptor.","['Kim, Felix J', 'Manel, Nicolas', 'Garrido, Edith N', 'Valle, Carine', 'Sitbon, Marc', 'Battini, Jean-Luc']","['Kim FJ', 'Manel N', 'Garrido EN', 'Valle C', 'Sitbon M', 'Battini JL']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), CNRS-UMR5535, IFR122 1919 Rte de Mende, F-34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France. kimf@mskcc.org']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041202,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (HTLV-I receptor)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Fusion', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Protein Folding', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*physiology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*physiology']",2004/12/04 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/12/04 09:00'],"['2004/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-1-41 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-1-41 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 Dec 2;1:41. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-41.,,,,PMC539286,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations result in constitutive activation of FLT3 tyrosine kinase activity. The consequences of this activation are an increase in total phosphotyrosine content, persistent downstream signaling, and ultimately transformation of hematopoietic cells to factor-independent growth. The Src homology (SH)2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 is involved in the down-regulation of a broad range of growth factor and cytokine-driven signaling cascades. Loss-of-function or deficiency of SHP-1 activity results in a hyperproliferative response of myelomonocytic cell populations to growth factor stimulation. In this study, we examined the possible role of SHP-1 in regulating FLT3 signaling. We found that transformation of TF-1 cells with FLT3/ITD mutations suppressed the activity of SHP-1 by approximately 3-fold. Suppression was caused by decreased SHP-1 protein expression, as analyzed at both the protein and RNA levels. In contrast, protein levels of SHP-2, a phosphatase that plays a stimulatory role in signaling through a variety of receptors, did not change significantly in FLT3 mutant cells. Suppressed SHP-1 protein levels in TF-1/ITD cells were partially overcome after cells were exposed to CEP-701, a selective FLT3 inhibitor. SHP-1 protein levels also increased in naturally occurring FLT3/ITD expressing AML cell lines and in primary FLT3/ITD AML samples after CEP-701 treatment. Furthermore, a small but reproducible growth/survival advantage was observed in both TF-1 and TF-1/ITD cells when SHP-1 expression was knocked down by RNAi. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence that suppression of SHP-1 by FLT3/ITD signaling may be another mechanism contributing to the transformation by FLT3/ITD mutations.","['Chen, Peili', 'Levis, Mark', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Kim, Kyu-Tae', 'Allebach, Jeffrey', 'Small, Donald']","['Chen P', 'Levis M', 'Brown P', 'Kim KT', 'Allebach J', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21231-1000, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA 90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 91177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041201,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (pervanadate)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Vanadates/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/12/03 09:00,2005/04/19 09:00,['2004/12/03 09:00'],"['2004/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)63034-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M411974200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Feb 18;280(7):5361-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M411974200.

In HTLV, this is accomplished through the expression of the viral Rex, which recognizes a specific response element on the incompletely spliced mRNAs, stabilizes them, inhibits their splicing, and utilizes the CRM1-dependent cellular pathway for transporting them from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Rex itself is regulated by phosphorylation, which implies that proper activation of the protein in response to certain cellular cues is an important tool for the virus to ensure that specific viral gene expression is allowed only when the host cell can provide the best conditions for virion production. Having such a critical role in HTLV life cycle, Rex is indispensable for efficient viral replication, infection and spread. Indeed, Rex is considered to regulate the switch between the latent and productive phases of the HTLV life cycle. Without a functional Rex, the virus would still produce regulatory and some accessory gene products; however, structural and enzymatic post-transcriptional gene expression would be severely repressed, essentially leading to non-productive viral replication. More detailed understanding of the exact molecular mechanism of action of Rex will thus allow for better design of therapeutic drugs against Rex function and ultimately HTLV replication. Herein we summarize the progress made towards understanding Rex function and its role in the HTLV life cycle.","['Younis, Ihab', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Younis I', 'Green PL']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA77556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-069003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",20050101,United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Response Elements', 'Virus Replication']",2004/12/03 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2004/12/03 09:00'],"['2004/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1539 [pii]', '10.2741/1539 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci. 2005 Jan 1;10:431-45. doi: 10.2741/1539.

A favorable outcome of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has recently been described in these patients whereas the prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) is similar to that in other children. The main cause of morbidity and mortality in children with Down syndrome are complications related to chemotherapy, leading to numerous modifications in treatment protocols. OBJECTIVES: To characterize acute leukemias in children with Down syndrome in our center and determine their clinical outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2002, 214 children were diagnosed with acute leukemia at the Nino Jesus Hospital (40 with AML and 174 with ALL). Of these, eight children (3.8 %) had Down syndrome. AML (2/40) represented 5 % of myeloid leukemias and ALL (6/174) represented 3.4 % of lymphoblastic leukemias. The most frequent complication was hematologic toxicity due to chemotherapy, causing a high incidence of infections: pneumonia (5/8) and bacteriemia (5/8). In all patients, these complications led to treatment interruption or dose reduction. Two children died from treatment-related toxicity. Of these, one with AML developed fulminant sepsis due to Candida infection and the other, diagnosed with high risk ALL, died from multiorgan failure after high doses of methotrexate and ARA-C. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Down syndrome diagnosed with acute leukemia show a higher incidence of treatment-related complications, which affects their prognosis. Consequently, individualized treatment of these children in qualified units is essential.","['Fernandez-Plaza, S', 'Sevilla, J', 'Contra, T', 'Martin, N', 'Madero, L']","['Fernandez-Plaza S', 'Sevilla J', 'Contra T', 'Martin N', 'Madero L']","['Seccion de Oncohematologia, Servicio de Pediatria, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain. jsevilla.hnjs@salud.madrid.org']",['spa'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/mortality/therapy']",2004/12/03 09:00,2005/03/11 09:00,['2004/12/03 09:00'],"['2004/12/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['13069185 [pii]', '10.1016/s1695-4033(04)78438-6 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2004 Dec;61(6):515-9. doi: 10.1016/s1695-4033(04)78438-6.,,,,,,,,Leucemia aguda en pacientes con sindrome de Down.,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells differentiation was demonstrated by morphology and NBT reduction assay. The expression of CD11b and CD33, cell cycle and apoptosis induced by these drugs were measured by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: The proliferative inhibition rate of the combination of Tan II A with ATRA was much higher. The differentiated cells accounted for over 90 percent, among them the band forms and neutrophils constituted more than 65 percent. NBT reduction and CD11b expression were much higher, and expression of CD33 was lower than that of Tan II A or ATRA alone (P<0.01).

The cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor regulates the differentiation and growth of embryonic and adult heart tissue. This study examined the effects of gene transfer of leukemia inhibitory factor in infarcted rat hearts. METHODS: Lewis rats underwent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and direct injection of adenovirus encoding leukemia inhibitory factor (n = 10) or null transgene as control (n = 10) into the myocardium bordering the ischemic area. A sham operation group (n = 10) underwent thoracotomy without ligation. After 6 weeks, the following parameters were evaluated: cardiac function with a pressure-volume conductance catheter, left ventricular geometry and architecture by histologic methods; myocardial fibrosis by Masson trichrome staining, apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidal transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay, and cardiomyocyte size by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Rats with overexpression of leukemia inhibitory factor had more preserved myocardium and less fibrosis in both the infarct and its border zone. The border zone in leukemia inhibitory factor-treated animals contained fewer apoptotic nuclei (1.6% +/- 0.1% vs 3.3% +/- 0.2%, P < .05) than that in control animals and demonstrated cardiomyocytes with larger cross-sectional areas (910 +/- 60 microm 2 vs 480 +/- 30 microm 2 , P < .05). Leukemia inhibitory factor-treated animals had increased left ventricular wall thickness (2.1 +/- 0.1 mm vs 1.8 +/- 0.1 mm, P < .05) and less dilation of the left ventricular cavity (237 +/- 22 microL vs 301 +/- 16 microL, P < .05). They also had improved cardiac function, as measured by maximum change in pressure over time (3950 +/- 360 mm Hg/s vs 2750 +/- 230 mm Hg/s, P < .05) and the slopes of the maximum change in pressure over time-end-diastolic volume relationship (68 +/- 5 mm Hg/[s . microL] vs 46 +/- 6 mm Hg/[s . microL], P < .05) and the preload recruitable stroke work relationship (89 +/- 10 mm Hg vs 44 +/- 4 mm Hg, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial gene transfer of leukemia inhibitory factor preserved cardiac tissue, geometry, and function after myocardial infarction in rats.","['Berry, Mark F', 'Pirolli, Timothy J', 'Jayasankar, Vasant', 'Morine, Kevin J', 'Moise, Mireille A', 'Fisher, Omar', 'Gardner, Timothy J', 'Patterson, Paul H', 'Woo, Y Joseph']","['Berry MF', 'Pirolli TJ', 'Jayasankar V', 'Morine KJ', 'Moise MA', 'Fisher O', 'Gardner TJ', 'Patterson PH', 'Woo YJ']","['Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 6 Silverstein Pavilion, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],,"['HL 007843/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 072812-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Heart Rupture, Post-Infarction/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Heart Ventricles/pathology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Ventricular Pressure']",2004/12/02 09:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/12/02 09:00'],"['2004/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022522304010803 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.06.046 [doi]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2004 Dec;128(6):866-75. doi: 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.06.046.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of the gene expression profiles of human acute myeloid leukemia samples has allowed their classification based on the presence of translocations and French-American-British subtypes, but it is not yet clear whether their molecular signatures reflect the initiating mutations or mutations acquired during progression. To begin to address this question, we examined the expression profiles of normal murine promyelocyte-enriched samples, nontransformed murine promyelocytes expressing human promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion gene, and primary acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. The expression profile of nontransformed cells expressing PML-RARalpha was remarkably similar to that of wild-type promyelocytes. In contrast, the expression profiles of fully transformed cells from three acute promyelocytic leukemia model systems were all different, suggesting that the expression signature of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells reflects the genetic changes that contributed to progression. To further evaluate these progression events, we compared two high-penetrance acute promyelocytic leukemia models that both commonly acquire an interstitial deletion of chromosome 2 during progression. The two models exhibited distinct gene expression profiles, suggesting that the dominant molecular signatures of murine acute promyelocytic leukemia can be influenced by several independent progression events.","['Walter, Matthew J', 'Park, John S', 'Lau, Steven K M', 'Li, Xia', 'Lane, Andrew A', 'Nagarajan, Rakesh', 'Shannon, William D', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Walter MJ', 'Park JS', 'Lau SK', 'Li X', 'Lane AA', 'Nagarajan R', 'Shannon WD', 'Ley TJ']","['Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Campus Box 8007, 660 South Euclid Ave., St. Louis, MO 63110-1093, USA.']",['eng'],,"['P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Penetrance']",2004/12/02 09:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/12/02 09:00'],"['2004/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/24/10882 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.24.24.10882-10893.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Dec;24(24):10882-93. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.24.10882-10893.2004.,,,,PMC533966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that GATA-1 gene knockdown female (GATA-1.05/X) mice frequently develop a hematopoietic disorder resembling myelodysplastic syndrome that is characterized by the accumulation of progenitors expressing low levels of GATA-1. In this study, we demonstrate that GATA-1.05/X mice suffer from two distinct types of acute leukemia, an early-onset c-Kit-positive nonlymphoid leukemia and a late-onset B-lymphocytic leukemia. Since GATA-1 is an X chromosome gene, two types of hematopoietic cells reside within heterozygous GATA-1 knockdown mice, bearing either an active wild-type GATA-1 allele or an active mutant GATA-1.05 allele. In the hematopoietic progenitors with the latter allele, low-level GATA-1 expression is sufficient to support survival and proliferation but not differentiation, leading to the accumulation of progenitors that are easily targeted by oncogenic stimuli. Since such leukemia has not been observed in GATA-1-null/X mutant mice, we conclude that the residual GATA-1 activity in the knockdown mice contributes to the development of the malignancy.

We investigated the frequency and prognostic significance of der(9) deletions among 352 patients with CML treated with imatinib mesylate at our institution, in whom a deletion status of der(9) was determined. Thirty-three patients (9%; 95% CI 0.07, 0.13) (30 in chronic phase, 3 in accelerated phase) had der(9) deletions. The rates of major (82% vs 79%, P = 0.82) and complete cytogenetic response (76% vs 66%, P = .33) with imatinib mesylate therapy were similar in patients with and without der(9) deletions, respectively.

Despite its clinical significance, the molecular basis of glucocorticoid resistance in lymphoid malignancies is still poorly understood. We have recently developed a highly clinically relevant experimental model of childhood ALL, in which primary childhood ALL biopsies were established as xenografts in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. The in vivo and in vitro responses of a panel of these xenografts to the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, reflected the outcome of the patients from whom they were derived. In this report we show that glucocorticoid resistance in B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL xenografts was not due to down-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nor to defective ligand binding of the GR. Moreover, dexamethasone-induced GR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was comparable in all xenografts. However, glucocorticoid resistance was associated with profoundly attenuated induction of the BH3-only proapoptotic protein, Bim, when xenograft cells were exposed to dexamethasone. These results show that dexamethasone resistance in BCP ALL xenografts occurs downstream of ligand-induced nuclear translocation of the GR, but upstream of Bim induction.","['Bachmann, Petra S', 'Gorman, Rosemary', 'Mackenzie, Karen L', 'Lutze-Mann, Louise', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Bachmann PS', 'Gorman R', 'Mackenzie KL', 'Lutze-Mann L', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, PO Box 81, High Street, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia.""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041130,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2004/12/02 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2004/12/02 09:00'],"['2004/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45760-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-05-2023 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 15;105(6):2519-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-05-2023.

However, little is known regarding its potential immunoregulatory effects. Here, we investigate the effect of imatinib on T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of human T cells. Following stimulation with the anti-CD3 antibody 12F6, proliferation of activated T cells was almost completely inhibited by 10 microM imatinib. Furthermore, antigen-triggered expansion of CD8+ T cells in response to immunodominant cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) peptides was significantly reduced. Up-regulation of the activation markers CD25 and CD69 in response to TCR cross-linking was suppressed by imatinib at a mean inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) of 5.4 microM and 7.3 microM, respectively; interleukin 2 (IL-2) production was also impaired. Analysis of the TCR-induced signaling cascade showed that imatinib substantially reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP70 and LAT in response to activation through the TCR. Sequence comparisons of all 90 tyrosine kinase genes in the human genome for homology in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket identified LCK, which is required for ZAP70 activation, as a likely target for imatinib. The IC50 for LCK inhibition by imatinib was 0.6 microM to 0.8 microM in an in vitro tyrosine kinase assay. In summary, imatinib can interfere with T-cell activation in vitro, and its impact on the frequency of opportunistic infections and graft-versus-host or graft-versus-leukemia reactions after transplantation should be investigated in clinical trials.","['Seggewiss, Ruth', 'Lore, Karin', 'Greiner, Elisabeth', 'Magnusson, Magnus K', 'Price, David A', 'Douek, Daniel C', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Seggewiss R', 'Lore K', 'Greiner E', 'Magnusson MK', 'Price DA', 'Douek DC', 'Dunbar CE', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the Immunology Laboratory, NIH/DHHS, Bldg 10, CRC, Rm 4-5140, 10 Center Dr, MSC 1202, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041130,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (IL2 protein, human)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (LAT protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Benzamides', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genome, Human/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects/immunology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/immunology']",2004/12/02 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2004/12/02 09:00'],"['2004/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45754-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-07-2527 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 15;105(6):2473-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2527.

The median DFS was 1.1 years (95% CI, 0.9-1.7 years) for patients receiving HiDAC and 1.0 year (95% CI, 0.9-1.3 years) for those receiving multiagent chemotherapy. Cytogenetics was the only pretreatment characteristic prognostic for DFS, but there was no evidence of a differential treatment effect within cytogenetic risk groups.

One of these pathways is intracellular and the other is a cell-extrinsic, autocrine/paracrine pathway mediated by the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/JAK/STAT pathway. Here, we show that IFI16 is a necessary and sufficient downstream effector for LIF effects in MTC cells, specifically required for the LIF/JAK/STAT pathway-induced growth inhibition in these cells. IFI16 was induced by Raf or LIF. Dominant-negative STAT3 could block the induction, indicating that Raf can induce IFI16 only via the cell-extrinsic pathway. Knock-down of IFI16 using siRNA abrogated LIF-induced changes in cellular levels of E2F1, cyclin D1, and p21WAF/CIP1, and cell cycle arrest. In addition, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of IFI16 was sufficient to induce growth arrest. In contrast to its essential role for LIF-mediated growth arrest, IFI16 was not required for differentiation induced by LIF. Knock-down of IFI16 could not block changes in differentiation markers of the MTC cells, including calcitonin, RET, and cell morphology. Our study identifies IFI16 as an essential growth-specific effector of the cell-extrinsic growth inhibitory pathway of Ras/Raf signaling in MTC cells.","['Kim, Eun-Joo', 'Park, Jong-In', 'Nelkin, Barry D']","['Kim EJ', 'Park JI', 'Nelkin BD']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],,['R01-CA85567/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041130,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '148998-64-5 (IFI16 protein, human)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Calcitonin/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Medullary/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2004/12/02 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2004/12/02 09:00'],"['2004/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)76144-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M410542200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Feb 11;280(6):4913-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M410542200.

Structure-activity relationship showed that at least two hydroxylations in positions 3, 5, and 7 of the A ring were needed to induce apoptosis, whereas hydroxylation in 3' and/or 4' of the B ring enhanced proapoptotic activity. At lower concentrations, these compounds were also able to sensitize these cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Regarding the mechanisms, galangin, luteolin, chrysin, and quercetin induced apoptosis in a way that required the activation of caspases 3 and 8, but not caspase 9.

Here, we show that GDNF-induced differentiation in the MPC 862L cell line is mediated by the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Neurite outgrowth, increased expression of growth-associated protein 43, and decreased incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were induced by treatment with GDNF, H-RasV12, or a constitutively active MEK2. GDNF also induces leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) via the MEK/ERK pathway, and LIF itself can elicit these differentiative changes via a cell-extrinsic autocrine/paracrine pathway. Treatment with anti-LIF neutralizing antibody depleted the differentiative activity of the conditioned medium from cells stimulated for MEK/ERK signaling, while recombinant LIF could induce differentiation in MPC cells, indicating that LIF is the sole factor with differentiative activity. LIF could activate MEK1/2 and STAT3, but LIF-induced differentiation was blocked only by the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor U0126, indicating that the MEK/ERK pathway is necessary for LIF action in MPC cells. Our findings suggest that LIF may be utilized for signaling mediated by GDNF and may be important in the pathobiology of neuroendocrine tumors.","['Park, Jong-In', 'Powers, James F', 'Tischler, Arthur S', 'Strock, Christopher J', 'Ball, Douglas W', 'Nelkin, Barry D']","['Park JI', 'Powers JF', 'Tischler AS', 'Strock CJ', 'Ball DW', 'Nelkin BD']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA. jpark15@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],,"['R01-CA85567/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-NS37685/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Gdnf protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (protein kinase modulator)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'GAP-43 Protein', 'Genes, ras/physiology', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Neurites', 'Neurofibromin 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Pheochromocytoma/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/12/02 09:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2004/12/02 09:00'],"['2004/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(04)00552-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.09.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2005 Feb 1;303(1):79-88. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.09.028.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort mortality study on 311 men who worked between January 1, 1951 and December 31, 1968 in a Caprolactam plant in the Netherlands. In the production of Caprolactam (the Nylon 6 monomer) pure benzene is used as an extracting agent and the workers at this plant have been exposed to substantial concentrations of benzene. The cohort was followed for mortality until January 1, 2001. The total mortality was below the expected number, which was mainly caused by a deficit of cardiovascular disease mortality. RESULTS: In the total group, there was one death from leukemia, compared with an expected number of 1.17. Despite the substantial exposures to benzene (on average 159 ppm-years per person) there was no indication for increased leukemia mortality within the cohort. We have applied earlier quantitative risk assessments to our cohort and conclude that some of these assessments overestimate the risk observed in our cohort of Caprolactam workers.","['Swaen, Gerard M H', 'Scheffers, Theo', 'de Cock, Johan', 'Slangen, Jos', 'Drooge, Hinkelien']","['Swaen GM', 'Scheffers T', 'de Cock J', 'Slangen J', 'Drooge H']","['Department of Epidemiology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. g.swaen@epid.unimaas.nl']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,"['6879X594Z8 (Caprolactam)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Caprolactam', 'Cause of Death', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Assessment']",2004/12/02 09:00,2005/03/19 09:00,['2004/12/02 09:00'],"['2003/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1047-2797(04)00077-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annepidem.2004.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2005 Jan;15(1):21-8. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2004.03.007.,,['Ann Epidemiol. 2005 Nov;15(10):735; author reply 736.

Two 4-anilinoquinazolines with Lavendustin A subunit (10a,b) were synthesized and examined for their EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity as well as their antiproliferative properties on variant human cancer cell lines. Both compounds maintained their EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity at the 10-7 M level and led to significant growth inhibition in certain leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, renal cancer and breast cancer cell lines with GI50 values at the 10-6 M level. There could not be observed any notable difference between 10a and 10b regarding to their antiproliferative activity. Interestingly, we observed the high tendency of 10a and 10b to include certain solvents, e.g. water, DMF, DMSO, which may be due to the remarkable number of hydrogen accepting/donating groups in 10a and b. An X-ray analysis of 10a including water and DMF illustrates a possible hydrogen bond pattern and could serve as information for preferred receptor (e.g. EGFR tyrosine kinase) binding sites. Finally, we aimed for irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The p-quinone derivatives 11a and 11b, which contain a Michael acceptor position according to the irreversible inhibitor CI-1033, could be derived from the p-hydroquinone derivatives 10a or 10b, respectively, by oxidation.

They have frequently been regarded as optimal targets for gene silencing approaches, as these single abnormalities may directly initiate or maintain the malignant process. Since the ground-breaking discovery that double-stranded RNA molecules 21 - 23 nucleotides in length, named small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are able to elicit gene-specific inhibition also in mammalian cells, the interest of the scientific community has rapidly been drawn to the potential of these siRNAs for targeting oncogenic fusion genes in leukaemic cells. There has been a flurry of reports describing overexpressed or mutated genes that may also serve as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention by RNA silencing methods. Although this approach seems to be relatively straightforward, many problems remain to be solved before siRNAs may become clinically implemented as 'leukaemia drugs'. Difficulties in delivering siRNAs into the leukaemic cell, inefficient target mRNA cleavage, prolonged protein half-life in cancer cells, nonspecific side effects caused by targeting other genes than those originally thought, immunological reactions of the host organism against the siRNAs, such as interferon responses, or even acquired resistance mechanisms, such as escape mutants, should be overcome. This paper reviews the current knowledge regarding the use of siRNAs, either chemically synthesised or intracellular-generated via specialised expression constructs, in order to suppress the falsely activated oncogenes in haematopoietic malignancies.","['Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Heidenreich, Olaf']","['Borkhardt A', 'Heidenreich O']","['Dr von Haunersches Kinderspital der Universitat Munchen, Abteilung Onkologie und Hamatologie, Germany.

Several studies and meta-analyses have addressed the clinical applications of CSFs to treat or prevent neutropenia. Guidelines have been developed to foster the appropriate use of CSFs. This article reviews the nature and use of the CSFs, and summarises the critical studies and guidelines. A historical perspective briefly describes the discovery, synthesis and clinical use of CSFs. The major biological and pharmacological characteristics are highlighted. The clinical applications of the CSFs are reviewed, including primary FN prophylaxis, secondary FN prophylaxis, treatment of FN, support of dose-dense chemotherapy regimens, use in leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, utility in stem cell transplantation, and use in elderly and paediatric patients. Finally, clinical efficacy data, as well as the economic impact of the CSFs, are discussed.","['Komrokji, Rami S', 'Lyman, Gary H']","['Komrokji RS', 'Lyman GH']","['University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Department of Medicine and the James P.

RR is considered to be an excellent target for cancer chemotherapy. In the present study we investigated the antineoplastic effects of Amidox alone and in combination with Arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. In growth inhibition experiments Amidox yielded an IC50 of 30 microM, colony formation was inhibited at an IC50 of 20 microM as determined by a soft agar assay. Exposure of the cells to 75 and 100 microM Amidox for 24 hours was shown to significantly decrease intracellular dCTP, dGTP and dATP pools, whereas dTTP concentration increased, as determined by HPLC. The combination of Amidox with Ara-C yielded more than additive cytotoxic effects both in growth inhibition assays and in soft agar assays. We could show that--after preincubating the cells with 75 and 100 microM Amidox and subsequent exposure to Ara-C--intracellular Ara-CTP levels increased by 576% and 1143%, respectively. In conclusion, Amidox might offer an additional option for the treatment of leukemia and thus be further investigated in vitro and in vivo.","['Bauer, W', 'Horvath, Z', 'Hochtl, T', 'Saiko, P', 'Karl, D', 'Fritzer-Szekeres, M', 'Szekeres, T']","['Bauer W', 'Horvath Z', 'Hochtl T', 'Saiko P', 'Karl D', 'Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Szekeres T']","['Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratorydiagnostics, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oximes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '9002-18-0 (Agar)', '95933-72-5 (Amidox)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Agar/chemistry', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/chemistry', '*Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Oximes/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Time Factors']",2004/12/02 09:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/12/02 09:00'],"['2004/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/NCN-200027766 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2004 Oct;23(8-9):1541-4. doi: 10.1081/NCN-200027766.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was transient hepatotoxicity. In a phase II study, 62 patients with acute leukemias received clofarabine at the MTD over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Twenty patients (32%) achieved complete response (CR), 1 had a partial response (PR), and 9 had a CR but without platelet recovery (CRp), for an overall response rate of 48%. Pharmacokinetic studies in the phase I trial revealed marked heterogeneity in peak levels of clofarabine among patients at the end of infusion, however; there was a linear, dose dependent increase in clofarabine concentration in the plasma. Pharmacodynamically, at the MTD, DNA synthesis was inhibited by more than 80% at the end of infusion. In phase II studies, the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of clofarabine triphosphate accumulation and clinical response at the MTD was explored, revealing an accumulation advantage of the cytotoxic triphosphate in leukemia cells of responders. The circulating leukemia blasts of patients who respond to clofarabine therapy exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile.

Although current treatment results in long term survival in over 70% of cases there is evidence that as many as 50% could have been cured using a less complex regimen with a lower incidence of long term side effects. In previous studies it has been found that thiopurines given as part of continuing therapy are key agents in preventing relapse. However, optimal administration during continuing therapy is often not achieved. Variation in the level of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity appears to be a major molecular determinant of the extent of thiopurine metabolism. TPMT activity shows a trimodal distribution pattern. A lack of activity is found in approximately one in 300 Caucasians; approximately 11% have intermediate activity and the remaining 89% high activity. Congenital loss of activity is associated with grossly elevated levels of active drug and profound myelosuppression on exposure to thiopurines. This loss of activity has been attributed to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TPMT gene. The frequency of SNPs is related to ethnicity, with the most common in Caucasians being TPMT*3A which is characterized by a G to A transition at position 460 with a substitution of alanine for tyrosine at amino acid 154 (A154Y) and a transition of A to G at nucleotide 719 resulting in a change of tyrosine to cysteine at position 240 (Y240C). Polymorphisms have also been identified within the 5' flanking promoter region of the TPMT gene due to a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR*3-*8). An overview of the polymorphisms identified to date, their implication on the metabolism of the thiopurine drugs and therapeutic importance will be discussed.","['Coulthard, S A', 'Matheson, E C', 'Hall, A G', 'Hogarth, L A']","['Coulthard SA', 'Matheson EC', 'Hall AG', 'Hogarth LA']","['University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. s.a.coulthard@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/chemistry', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azathioprine/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tyrosine/chemistry']",2004/12/02 09:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/12/02 09:00'],"['2004/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/NCN-200027637 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2004 Oct;23(8-9):1385-91. doi: 10.1081/NCN-200027637.,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altered transport over the cell membrane is a mechanism of resistance to gemcitabine. To facilitate accumulation, the fatty acid derivative CP-4125 was synthesized. Since, the fatty acid is acylated at the site of action of dCDA, a decreased deamination was expected. CP-4125 was equally active as gemcitabine in a panel of rodent and human cell lines and in human melanoma xenografts bearing mice. In contrast to gemcitabine, CP-4125 was not deaminated but inhibited deamination of deoxycytidine and gemcitabine.

We also describe the detection of chromosomal abnormalities and methods on the horizon, such as gene expression profiling, to identify diagnostically useful oncogenes. Finally, we review the emerging concept of transitional neoplastic states, in which reactive lymphocytes transform to neoplastic lymphocytes in the presence of continued antigenic stimulation, such as that caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori. The existence of transitional neoplastic states underscores the need for an array of molecular diagnostic tools that would improve our ability to characterize lymphocyte populations in human and animal patients and enhance early detection of neoplastic lymphocytes such that eradication of the infectious or inflammatory stimulus could lead to cure.","['Avery, Paul R', 'Avery, Anne C']","['Avery PR', 'Avery AC']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/veterinary', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods/veterinary', 'Inflammation/diagnosis/veterinary', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/immunology/veterinary', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/*etiology/veterinary', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/veterinary']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1939-165x.2004.tb00374.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2004;33(4):196-207. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165x.2004.tb00374.x.,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell isolation and purification studies targeted T cells, as a model for low abundance cells (about 1:10,000 cells), with more dilute cells as the ultimate goal. T cells were successfully separated on-chip from human blood and from reconstituted blood samples. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the captured cells was used to characterize the efficiency of T cell capture in a variety of flow path designs. Employing many (4-8), 50 microm deep narrow channels, with the same overall cross section as a single, 3 mm wide channel, was much more effective in structuring dense enough magnetic bead beds to trap cells in a flowing stream. The use of 8-multiple bifurcated flow paths increased capture efficiencies from approximately 20 up to 37%, when compared to a straight 8-way split design, indicating the value of ensuring uniform flow distribution into each channel in a flow manifold for effective cell capture.

The strong proliferation inhibitions, which were in a time-dependent manner for HL-60 and Raji cells infected by Adp27, were indicated by cell growth curve and MTT assay. After 72 h infection of HL-60 and Raji cells by Adp27, the Annexin V+/PI- apoptotic cell rates were 46.9 and 35.7% respectively, which were significantly increased compared with control group (4.7 and 5.6% respectively). The typical DNA ladder bands were detectable in HL-60 and Raji cells after 48 h of Adp27 infection. CONCLUSION: The infection of HL-60 and Raji cells by means of adenoviral vector-mediated p27 gene could evidently inhibit cellular proliferation and promote cell apoptosis, which would provide experimental evidence for gene therapy of leukemia/lymphoma using adenovirus-mediated p27 gene approach.","['Wang, Qinhong', 'Zhang, Min', 'Fang, Huahua', 'Nie, Xiaoxuan', 'Gao, Li', 'Liu, Yan', 'Xie, Yanghui', 'Xie, Yi']","['Wang Q', 'Zhang M', 'Fang H', 'Nie X', 'Gao L', 'Liu Y', 'Xie Y', 'Xie Y']","['Department of Hematology, HuaShan Hospital, Medical Center of FuDan University, FuDan University, Shanghai, China. qinhong_wang@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],,,"['Duplicate Publication', 'Journal Article']",,England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/methods', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/04/12 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['6200557 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.thj.6200557 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(6):519-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200557.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to elucidate the functional relevance of Daxx in malignant myelocytes, the erythroleukemia cell line HEL was stably transfected with a Daxx-expressing vector or with the respective Daxx-negative control vector. Assessing the molecular consequences of ectopic Daxx-expression, we present evidence that Daxx downregulates p53. Moreover, we demonstrate that Daxx overexpressing myelocytes downregulate the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax, while expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 is not influenced. Furthermore, expression of Daxx diminishes expression levels of the initiator-procaspase-8 and -10, and the executioner procaspase-7, whereas the procaspase-3, -6 and -9 remain unaltered. The altered protein levels of the caspases in Daxx overexpressing myelocytes are accompanied by a decrease of expression levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) cIAP-1, -2 and survivin. Despite the described impact of Daxx expression on major molecules of the apoptotic cascade, expression of Daxx in neoplastic myelocytes does not impact on the rate of proliferation. Upon a proapoptotic stimulus such as serum withdrawal Daxx is unable to maintain its influence on expression levels of p53, Bax, IAPs and the procaspase-8, -10 and -7.","['Boehrer, Simone', 'Nowak, Daniel', 'Schaaf, Simone', 'Bergmann, Marion', 'Brieger, Angela', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Mitrou, Paris S', 'Weidmann, Eckhart', 'Chow, Kai Uwe']","['Boehrer S', 'Nowak D', 'Schaaf S', 'Bergmann M', 'Brieger A', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Weidmann E', 'Chow KU']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 10)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.63 (CASP10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 10', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Precursors/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/04/12 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['6200547 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.thj.6200547 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(6):513-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200547.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genes encoding isoenzymes M1 and T1 are polymorphic in humans and the phenotypic absence of enzyme activity (null genotype) may have an effect on the risk of chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL). Our purpose was to examine whether the GSTM1 and GSTT1 homozygous null genotypes altered the risk of CLL. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 27 patients with CLL and 147 cancer-free controls; both groups originated from a defined population (residents of the Ioannina region, northwestern Greece) and were similar with regard to mean age, race and sex; GSTM1 and GSTT1 were simultaneously analyzed by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and Fisher's exact test was used for comparisons between the two groups. A significantly increased incidence of the GSTM1 null genotype was found in the group of patients compared to the controls (74.07 versus 34.69%, P = 0.0002). Additionally, the incidence of the GSTT1 null genotype was comparable in patients and controls (25.92 versus 10.20%, P = 0.05). The frequency of the combined GSTM1 null/T1 null genotype was significantly different between patients and controls (14.81 versus 2.04%, P = 0.012).

METHODS: The frozen blast cells from 29 patients were thawed and submitted to the optimized protocol. RESULTS: All cases of AML-M7 and AML-M I exhibited integrated light emission greater than 73(10(2) mV x s), which was the arbitrary cutoff point set for the discrimination between AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (mean + 3 x s.d. of ALL samples, n = 10). In addition, five out of seven cases of AML-MO showed results above the cutoff point. CONCLUSION: This highly sensitive enhanced chemiluminescent technique may be applied to discriminate between ALL and AML-M7 or AML-MI cases, and most AML-M0 cases.

We screened 92 adults with de novo AML for the protein expression of various IAPs, Bcl-2 family members and the proform of Caspase-3 using quantitative immunoblot and flow cytometry. XIAP expression correlated with myelomonocytic French-American-British (FAB) subtypes M4/M5 (P < 0.05) and expression of monocytic markers (CD 14, CD 36; P < 0.05; CD 4, HLA-DR; P < 0.01) in AML blasts. In addition, XIAP was overexpressed in normal monocytes but undetectable in granulocytes. In AML, XIAP expression was significantly lower in patients with favorable than intermediate or poor cytogenetics (n = 74; P < 0.05). In total, 62 of the examined patients were treated according to the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG) 92 protocol.

In a randomised prospective study, we examined the busulphan versus hydroxyurea influence on time to blast crisis and on survival. When we opened our study in 1984, the clinical benefit of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was not well known; to follow up the long-time outcome of this treatment was therefore of great interest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Previously untreated CML patients were randomly started on either hydroxyurea (30 mg/kg/day) or busulphan (0.1 mg/kg/day). The end points of the study were overall survival and time to blast crisis. A total of 26 patients subsequently underwent BMT. RESULTS: A total of 179 patients were randomised, 90 of hydroxyurea, and 89 to busulphan treatment. There was no significant difference in survival between hydroxyurea- and busulphan-treated patients (P = 0.46); median survival was 3.5 and 3.2 years, respectively. In all, 85 of the patients were subsequently diagnosed with blast crisis, 41 in the busulphan and 44 in the hydroxyurea group. There was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.91). The 26 patients who were allotransplanted survived significantly longer than those who were not transplanted (P = 0.0001). The 5-year-survival rates were 50 and 22% and the 10-year-survival rates were 46 and 2%, respectively. The median survival was 4.7 years for the transplanted and 3.3 years for the nontransplanted patients. CONCLUSION: We did not find any difference between hydroxyurea and busulphan treatment, either in overall survival or in blast crisis-free survival; transplanted patients survived significantly longer than nontransplanted patients.","['Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Ahlgren, Tomas', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Carlsson, Karin', 'Gahrton, Gosta', 'Hast, Robert', 'Lofvenberg, Eva', 'Linder, Olle', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Malm, Claes', 'Paul, Christer', 'Rodjer, Stig', 'Turesson, Ingemar', 'Uden, Ann-Mari', 'Wahlin, Anders', 'Killander, Andreas', 'Wadman, Bengt', 'Westin, Jan', 'Vikrot, Olle', 'Zettervall, Olle', 'Oberg, Gunnar']","['Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Simonsson B', 'Ahlgren T', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Carlsson K', 'Gahrton G', 'Hast R', 'Lofvenberg E', 'Linder O', 'Ljungman P', 'Malm C', 'Paul C', 'Rodjer S', 'Turesson I', 'Uden AM', 'Wahlin A', 'Killander A', 'Wadman B', 'Westin J', 'Vikrot O', 'Zettervall O', 'Oberg G']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. ulla.olsson.stromberg@medicin.uas.lul.se']",['eng'],,,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,"['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/04/12 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['6200552 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.thj.6200552 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(6):462-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200552.,['Swedish CML Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cell-replete SCT was performed from HLA-identical sibling donors. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis consisted of 7 additional days of T10B9 and delayed onset of cyclosporine (ie, on day +4 or +5). Twenty-six high-risk hematologic malignancy patients were entered onto this study. All 24 patients who survived longer than 8 days engrafted, although 1 patient experienced late graft failure.

In conclusion, single-agent chemotherapy conditioning with T10B9 produced durable engraftment and long-term survival in some patients who would not have qualified for a traditional allo-SCT.","['Thompson, John S', 'Pomeroy, Claire', 'Kryscio, Richard J', 'Brown, Stephen A', 'Reece, Donna', 'Kramer, Rita', 'Howard, Dianna S', 'VanZant, Gary', 'Humphries, Suzanne', 'Phillips, Gordon']","['Thompson JS', 'Pomeroy C', 'Kryscio RJ', 'Brown SA', 'Reece D', 'Kramer R', 'Howard DS', 'VanZant G', 'Humphries S', 'Phillips G']","['Division of Allergy and Immunology, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40502, USA. jsthom1@ukyk.edu']",['eng'],,['R03 CA 83634/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (alpha-beta T cell receptor antibody T10B9)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/05/12 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879104004884 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2004 Dec;10(12):858-66. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.09.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The impact on post-translational farnesylation was assessed in 42 patients with refractory hematologic malignancies and bone marrow involvement. Tipifarnib was taken orally for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. For cycle 1, patients were randomly assigned to one of four dose levels: 100 mg bid, 200 mg bid, 300 mg bid, and 600 mg bid. In cycle 1, peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells were analyzed for inhibition of HDJ2 prenylation by Western blot analysis at baseline and on day 21. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were assessable for analysis of HDJ2 prenylation before and after therapy. Inhibition of farnesylation was noted at all dose levels, although the highest level of inhibition was noted at the 300-mg-bid dose. The inhibition of farnesylation in the peripheral blood correlated with the inhibition in the bone marrow (r = 0.62). Of the 26 patients assessable for clinical activity after cycle 1, three patients had a significant decrease in total blasts count (acute myeloid leukemia in two patients, and chronic myelogenous leukemia in one patient). The inhibition of farnesylation was greater in the three responders than the nonresponders (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Farnesylation as measured by HDJ2 analysis was inhibited at all dose levels administered. Clinical activity may correlate with the degree of farnesylation inhibition, rather than dose of tipifarnib, and escalation beyond 300 mg bid might not result in additional clinical activity.","['Zimmerman, Todd M', 'Harlin, Helena', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi M', 'Berk, Seth', 'Sprague, Evie', 'Karrison, Theodore', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Gajewski, Thomas F']","['Zimmerman TM', 'Harlin H', 'Odenike OM', 'Berk S', 'Sprague E', 'Karrison T', 'Stock W', 'Larson RA', 'Ratain MJ', 'Gajewski TF']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. tzimmerm@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],,"['K23 CA-87044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA-14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA-69852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Quinolones)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Biological Availability', 'Blotting, Western', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Quinolones/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Risk Assessment', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/23/4764 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2004.03.200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Dec 1;22(23):4816-22. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.03.200.,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jan 1;23(1):248'],,,,,,,,,,

The present study tests the hypothesis that the psychostimulant methylphenidate (MPH) improves cognitive and social functioning among these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on 83 long-term survivors of ALL and BT identified as having attentional deficits on behavioral testing and parent or teacher report, and problems with academic achievement. The 47 male and 36 female patients ranged from 0.6 to 14.3 years (median, 5.4 years) of age at diagnosis and 6.7 to 17.9 years (median, 11.9 years) of age at participation. The patients (40 ALL, 43 BT) participated in a randomized, double-blind, 3-week home cross-over trial of placebo (bid), low-dose MPH (0.3 mg/kg; maximum dose, 10 mg bid), and moderate-dose MPH (0.6 mg/kg; maximum dose, 20 mg bid). The primary end points were weekly teacher and parent reports on the Conners' Rating Scales and Social Skills Rating System. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, significant improvement with MPH was reported by teachers and parents on the Conners' Rating Scales and by teachers on the Social Skills Rating System. However, no consistent advantage of moderate dose over low dose was observed. Of those participating, 66 (79.5%) of the 83 patients continued on best clinical management. CONCLUSION: Treatment with MPH can at least temporarily reduce some attentional and social deficits among survivors of childhood ALL and BT. Long-term follow-up will reveal those subsets of patients who are more likely to benefit from MPH.","['Mulhern, Raymond K', 'Khan, Raja B', 'Kaplan, Stuart', 'Helton, Susan', 'Christensen, Robbin', 'Bonner, Melanie', 'Brown, Ronald', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Wu, Sengjie', 'Gururangan, Sridharan', 'Reddick, Wilburn E']","['Mulhern RK', 'Khan RB', 'Kaplan S', 'Helton S', 'Christensen R', 'Bonner M', 'Brown R', 'Xiong X', 'Wu S', 'Gururangan S', 'Reddick WE']","[""Division of Behavioral Medicine, Department of Hematology/Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. raymond.mulhern@stjude.org""]",['eng'],,"['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA78957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA81445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Central Nervous System Stimulants)', '207ZZ9QZ49 (Methylphenidate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylphenidate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Probability', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survivors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/23/4743 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2004.04.128 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Dec 1;22(23):4795-803. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.04.128.,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jan 1;23(1):248'],,,,,,,,,,

We have evaluated by multiparameter flow cytometry the expression of apoptosis- (APO2.7, bcl-2, and bax) and MDR-related proteins [P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance protein (MRP), and lung resistance protein (LRP)] specifically on bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells, and their major CD32-/dim and CD32+ subsets, in de novo AML (n=90), high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (n=9), and low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (n=21) patients at diagnosis, and compared with normal BM CD34+ cells (n=6). CD34+ myeloid cells from AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients displayed higher expression of bcl-2 (P <0.0001) and lower reactivity for APO2.7 (P=0.002) compared with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and normal controls. Similar results applied to the two predefined CD34+ myeloid cell subsets. No significant differences were found in the expression of P-gp, MRP, and LRP between low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients and normal BM, but decreased expression of MRP (P <0.03) in AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and P-gp (P=0.008) in high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes were detected. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients were clustered next to normal BM samples, whereas high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes were clustered together and mixed with the de novo AML patients. In summary, increased resistance to chemotherapy of CD34+ cells from both AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes would be explained more appropriately in terms of an increased antiapoptotic phenotype rather than a MDR phenotype. In low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes abnormally high apoptotic rates would be restricted to the CD34- cell compartments.","['Suarez, Lilia', 'Vidriales, Maria-Belen', 'Garcia-Larana, Jose', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Moreno, Maria-Jose', 'Lopez, Antonio', 'Barrena, Susana', 'Martinez, Rafael', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Palomera, Luis', 'Lavilla, Esperanza', 'Lopez-Berges, Ma Consuelo', 'de Santiago, Maria', 'de Equiza, M Encarnacion Perez', 'Miguel, Jesus F San', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Suarez L', 'Vidriales MB', 'Garcia-Larana J', 'Sanz G', 'Moreno MJ', 'Lopez A', 'Barrena S', 'Martinez R', 'Tormo M', 'Palomera L', 'Lavilla E', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'de Santiago M', 'de Equiza ME', 'Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (major vault protein)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Risk', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/22/7599 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0598 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Nov 15;10(22):7599-606. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0598.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two common MTHFR polymorphisms, C677T and A1298C, are associated with reduced enzyme activity. We evaluated the association of these polymorphisms with risk of relapse and bcr-abl mRNA transcript detection among 336 Caucasian patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Data on the transplant course and folate-related exposures were abstracted from medical records. MTHFR C677T and A1298C genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism and TaqMan assays. Qualitative bcr-abl mRNA testing was conducted using a two-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association between MTHFR genotypes and time to relapse and bcr-abl mRNA detection. RESULTS: A statistically significant decreased risk of relapse was observed in patients with the variant A1298C genotype [1298AC, hazard ratio (HR)=0.48 and 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.26-0.88; 1298CC, HR=0.28 and 95% CI=0.09-0.84; P-trend <0.01). For the joint C677T/A1298C genotype, variant genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of relapse when compared with the wild-type 677CC/1298AA genotype. This risk was lowest for the 677CC/1298CC genotype (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08-0.72). MTHFR genotypes were not associated with bcr-abl transcript detection. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that individuals with the 677CC/1298AA genotype are at higher risk of relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation and that the balance of intracellular folate metabolites available for nucleotide synthesis (regulated by the relative activity of the MTHFR enzyme) may affect the progression from bcr-abl positivity to clinical relapse.","['Robien, Kim', 'Ulrich, Cornelia M', 'Bigler, Jeannette', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Gooley, Ted', 'Bruemmer, Barbara', 'Potter, John D', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Robien K', 'Ulrich CM', 'Bigler J', 'Yasui Y', 'Gooley T', 'Bruemmer B', 'Potter JD', 'Radich JP']","['Cancer Prevention Program, Public Health Sciences Division and Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],,"['R25 CA94880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA80416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', '*Genotype', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/22/7592 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1057 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Nov 15;10(22):7592-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1057.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the defucosylated chimeric anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) monoclonal antibody, KM2760, to develop a novel immunotherapy for this refractory tumor. In the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy adult donors, KM2760 induced CCR4-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CCR4-positive ATLL cell lines and primary tumor cells obtained from ATLL patients. We next examined the KM2760-induced ADCC against primary ATLL cells in an autologous setting. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by autologous effector cells was generally lower than that mediated by allogeneic control effector cells. However, a robust ADCC activity was induced in some cases, which was comparable with that mediated by allogeneic effector cells. It suggests that the ATLL patients' PBMCs retain substantial ADCC-effector function, although the optimal conditions for maximal effect have not yet been determined. In addition, we also found a high expression of FoxP3 mRNA and protein, a hallmark of regulatory T cells, in ATLL cells, indicating the possibility that ATLL cells originated from regulatory T cells. KM2760 reduced FoxP3 mRNA expression in normal PBMCs along with CCR4 mRNA by lysis of CCR4+ T cells in vitro. Our data suggest not only that the CCR4 molecule could be a suitable target for the novel antibody-based therapy for patients with ATLL but also that KM2760 may induce effective tumor immunity by reducing the number of regulatory T cells.","['Ishida, Takashi', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Akatsuka, Yoshiki', 'Ishii, Toshihiko', 'Miyazaki, Mikinori', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Okada, Noriko', 'Fujita, Teizo', 'Shitara, Kenya', 'Akinaga, Shiro', 'Takahashi, Toshitada', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Ishida T', 'Iida S', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Ishii T', 'Miyazaki M', 'Komatsu H', 'Inagaki H', 'Okada N', 'Fujita T', 'Shitara K', 'Akinaga S', 'Takahashi T', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine & Molecular Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FCGR3A protein, human)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/22/7529 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0983 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Nov 15;10(22):7529-39. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0983.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription deregulation due to chromosomal translocation is a common theme in hematopoietic neoplasms. AML1-ETO, which is a fusion protein generated by the 8;21 translocation that is commonly associated with the development of acute myeloid leukemia, fuses the AML1 runx family DNA-binding transcription factor to the ETO corepressor that associates with histone deacetylase complexes. Analyses have demonstrated that AML1-ETO blocks AML1 function and requires additional mutagenic events to promote leukemia. Here, we report that the loss of the molecular events of AML1-ETO C-terminal NCoR/SMRT-interacting domain transforms AML1-ETO into a potent leukemogenic protein. Contrary to full-length AML1-ETO, the truncated form promotes in vitro growth and does not obstruct the cell-cycle machinery. These observations suggest a previously uncharacterized mechanism of tumorigenesis, in which secondary mutation(s) in molecular events disrupting the function of a domain of the oncogene promote the development of malignancy.","['Yan, Ming', 'Burel, Sebastien A', 'Peterson, Luke F', 'Kanbe, Eiki', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Boyapati, Anita', 'Hines, Robert', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Yan M', 'Burel SA', 'Peterson LF', 'Kanbe E', 'Iwasaki H', 'Boyapati A', 'Hines R', 'Akashi K', 'Zhang DE']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],,"['P01 CA072009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041129,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Ncor2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/02/05 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['0406702101 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0406702101 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Dec 7;101(49):17186-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0406702101.

Cross-linking of FcepsilonRI-bound IgE with multivalent antigen initiates the activation of mast cells and basophils, resulting in the degranulation from these cells. We have recently identified a novel inhibitory receptor, myeloid-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor (MAIR)-I, which is expressed on mast cells as well as other myeloid cell lineages. Co-ligation of FcepsilonRI and MAIR-I inhibits IgE-mediated degranulation from mast cells. However, MAIR-I-mediated signaling pathways involved in the inhibition remain undetermined.

We have previously reported the acquisition of a complete IgG2 deficiency in a leukemia patient after bone marrow transplantation. Southern blot analysis showed a deletion including the Cgamma2 and Cgamma4 genes on one chromosome in the donor, suggesting that the remaining Cgamma2 gene allele was silent. In the patient and his two IgG2 deficient brothers, the silent Cgamma2 gene showed both germ-line transcription and switch recombination and no structural defects were found in the intronic promoter or the switch region of the gene. However, an A-->G transition in the fourth nucleotide in the 5' portion of intron 1 was identified. Transfection of artificial constructs into the human B cell lines demonstrated that this A-->G transition inactivated the normal splice site, and instead, a cryptic splice site in the CH1 exon was used in RNA post-transcriptional processing, leading to a 16 bp deletion of the gamma2 CH1 exon. This aberrantly spliced RNA that is mostly derived from germ-line transcription in vivo was also detected in both homozygous and heterozygous individuals carrying this mutation.

We evaluated diffusion-weighted (DW) and conventional MR images in children with ALL and acute MTX-induced neurotoxicity, with clinical correlation. METHODS: Five patients aged 12-15 years underwent fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2-weighted fast spin-echo and gradient-echo, T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced spin-echo, and DW imaging within 24 hours of symptom onset. Records were reviewed for the temporal relationship to MTX administration, strokelike symptoms, and neurologic outcome. RESULTS: Six strokelike events were temporally related to intrathecal MTX given 6-11 days before symptom onset. FLAIR images showed abnormal hyperintensity in the callosal splenium in one patient but were otherwise normal. Diffusion abnormalities were frontoparietal in three events and frontal in one; nonfluent aphasia was seen in all. Bilateral frontoparietal diffusion abnormalities were associated with bilateral upper-extremity weakness, right-sided hemiparesis, or left-sided hemiparesis (one patient each); one patient had mild facial droop. Unilateral precentral subcortical diffusion abnormality was associated with contralateral motor deficit and ipsilateral upper-extremity sensory loss. Strokelike symptoms resolved rapidly and were not associated with other signs of encephalopathy. Subsequent intrathecal MTX administration was not associated with recurrence in four patients. CONCLUSION: Diffusion abnormalities in acute MTX neurotoxicity indicated cerebral dysfunction but not necessarily overt structural injury to the cerebrum. Subsequent demyelination or gliosis could not be predicted on the basis of diffusion abnormalities. A single strokelike episode with diffusion abnormalities should not necessarily prompt modification of potentially curative chemotherapeutic regimens.","['Rollins, Nancy', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Bash, Robert', 'Booth, Timothy']","['Rollins N', 'Winick N', 'Bash R', 'Booth T']","[""Department of Pediatric Radiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Children's Medical Center of Dallas, 1935 Motor St., Dallas, TX 75235, USA.""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

Despite overall structural similarity, differences exist in the backbone dynamic properties of the CA N-terminal domain. Since studies with other retroviruses suggest that the beta-hairpin is critical for formation of a CA-CA interface, we investigated the functional role of the human T cell leukemia virus beta-hairpin by disrupting the salt bridge between Pro(1) and Asp(54) that stabilizes the beta-hairpin. NMR (15)N relaxation data were used to characterize the backbone dynamics of the D54A mutant in the context of the N-terminal domains, compared with the wild-type counterpart. Moreover, the effect of the mutation on proteolytic processing and release of virus-like particles (VLPs) from human cells in culture was determined. Conformational and dynamic changes resulting from the mutation were detected by NMR spectroscopy. The mutation also altered the conformation of mature CA in cells and VLPs, as reflected by differential antibody recognition of the wild-type and mutated CA proteins. In contrast, the mutation did not detectably affect antibody recognition of the CA protein precursor or release of VLPs assembled by the precursor, consistent with the fact that the hairpin cannot form in the precursor molecule. The particle morphology and size were not detectably affected. The results indicate that the beta-hairpin contributes to the overall structure of the mature CA protein and suggest that differences in the backbone dynamics of the beta-hairpin contribute to mature CA structure, possibly introducing flexibility into interface formation during proteolytic maturation.","['Bouamr, Fadila', 'Cornilescu, Claudia C', 'Goff, Stephen P', 'Tjandra, Nico', 'Carter, Carol A']","['Bouamr F', 'Cornilescu CC', 'Goff SP', 'Tjandra N', 'Carter CA']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['GM 48294/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI 42848/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041129,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)']",IM,"['Capsid Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Pliability', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Solutions']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)62795-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M408119200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Feb 25;280(8):6792-801. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M408119200.

To identify molecules that bind noncovalently to SUMO-1, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening with a SUMO-1 mutant that cannot be conjugated to target proteins as the bait. This screening resulted in the isolation of cDNAs encoding the b isoform of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDGb). A deletion mutant of TDGb (TDGb(Delta11)) that lacks a region shown to be required for noncovalent binding of SUMO-1 was also found not to be susceptible to SUMO-1 conjugation at an adjacent lysine residue, suggesting that such binding is required for covalent modification. In contrast, another mutant of TDGb (TDGb(KR)) in which the lysine residue targeted for SUMO-1 conjugation is replaced with arginine retained the ability to bind SUMO-1 non-covalently. TDGb was shown to interact with the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in vitro as well as to colocalize with this protein to nuclear bodies in transfected cells. TDGb(KR) also colocalized with PML, whereas TDGb(Delta11) did not, indicating that the noncovalent SUMO-1 binding activity of TDGb is required for colocalization with PML. Furthermore, SUMO-1 modification of TDGb and PML enhanced the interaction between the two proteins.

Retinoids act through two types of receptors - retinoic acid receptors (RAR alpha, RAR beta and RAR gamma) and retinoid X receptors (RXR alpha, RXR beta and RXR gamma) - which themselves act as ligand-dependent transcription factors. Retinoids are of special interest in cancer research owing to their antiproliferative and cancer-preventative properties. They have been used successfully to cure acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) and can suppress carcinogenesis in a variety of tissue types (e.g. skin, lung, breast and oral cancers). Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to elucidating the molecular and cellular networks that are induced by retinoids, and this has recently yielded novel insights into how retinoids can both prevent and combat cancer.","['Clarke, Nicole', 'Germain, Pierre', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich']","['Clarke N', 'Germain P', 'Altucci L', 'Gronemeyer H']","['Department of Cell Biology and Signal Transduction, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC)/CNRS/INSERM/ULP, BP 163, 67404 Illkirch Cedex, C.

It is known, however, that the visceral endoderm differentiates in early EBs and expresses these hepatocyte-related genes. Thus, it remains unclear whether ES cells are capable of differentiating into hepatocytes derived from definitive endoderm in vitro. In the present study, yolk sac tissues isolated from the foetal mouse were found to express many hepatocyte-related genes. Among the hepatocyte-related genes examined, cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7a1) was identified as a liver-specific gene that was not expressed in the yolk sac. Cyp7a1 was induced in developing EBs, and hepatic differentiation was preferentially observed in the developing EBs in attached culture as compared to those in suspension culture. Leukaemia inhibitory factor permitted the differentiation of visceral endoderm, but inhibited the expression of gastrulation-related genes and the hepatic differentiation in cultured EBs. ES cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the Cyp7a1 enhancer/promoter showed that cultured EBs contained GFP-positive epithelial-like cells. These results demonstrate that ES cells can differentiate in vitro into hepatocytes derived from definitive endoderm.","['Asahina, Kinji', 'Fujimori, Hiroaki', 'Shimizu-Saito, Keiko', 'Kumashiro, Yuji', 'Okamura, Kentaro', 'Tanaka, Yujiro', 'Teramoto, Kenichi', 'Arii, Shigeki', 'Teraoka, Hirobumi']","['Asahina K', 'Fujimori H', 'Shimizu-Saito K', 'Kumashiro Y', 'Okamura K', 'Tanaka Y', 'Teramoto K', 'Arii S', 'Teraoka H']","['Department of Pathological Biochemistry, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 101-0062, Japan. asahina.pbc@mri.tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (Albumins)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', 'EC 1.14.14.23 (Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 1.14.14.23 (Cyp7a1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Albumins/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Hepatocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Liver/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/genetics/metabolism']",2004/12/01 09:00,2005/08/16 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['GTC809 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2443.2004.00809.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2004 Dec;9(12):1297-308. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2004.00809.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KCVB2 cells are 8-fold resistant to the selecting agent, vinblastine, but also exhibit significant resistance to other vinca alkaloids, including 14-fold resistance to vinorelbine, as well as 6-fold cross-resistance to paclitaxel. Doubling time and morphology were similar to the parental K562 cells. Rt-PCR analysis revealed no alterations in the expression of the mdr1 and MRP genes. Intracellular vinblastine accumulation was unchanged. Disruption of the mitotic spindles and multiple mitotic asters occurred in both cell lines but required higher concentrations of vinblastine in KCVB2 cells than in K562 cells. Significant differences were observed in the tubulin content of KCVB2 cells: reduction of total tubulin content, increased polymerized fraction of total tubulin, and overexpression of class III beta-tubulin which is expressed at very low levels in the parental K562 cells. K562 cells transfected with murine class III beta-tubulin did not display the resistance pattern observed in KCVB2 cells. Revertants of KCVB2 manifested reversion to parental drug sensitivity, an increase in total tubulin level, and a decrease in polymerized tubulin. In conclusion, the KCVB2 cell line displays a novel mechanism of resistance to both depolymerizing and stabilizing microtubule-targeted cytotoxins which does not involve altered cellular drug accumulation, but corresponds to alterations in the total tubulin content and polymerization status, and may involve an effect on microtubule dynamics.","['Dumontet, Charles', 'Jaffrezou, Jean-Pierre', 'Tsuchiya, Etsuko', 'Duran, George E', 'Chen, Kevin Gang', 'Derry, W Brent', 'Wilson, Leslie', 'Jordan, Mary Ann', 'Sikic, Branimir I']","['Dumontet C', 'Jaffrezou JP', 'Tsuchiya E', 'Duran GE', 'Chen KG', 'Derry WB', 'Wilson L', 'Jordan MA', 'Sikic BI']","['Department of Medicine, Divisions of Oncology and Clinical Pharmacology, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA-52168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Microtubules/*drug effects/genetics', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tubulin/analysis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Vinblastine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",2004/12/01 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/12/01 09:00'],"['2004/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2004 May;91(5):E81-112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with CML were treated by HSCT, including 8 patients treated with autologous transplantation in vivo and vitro purging minimal residual disease (MRD), 39 with related donor allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT), and 10 with unrelated donor allo-HSCT. For the conditioning regimen, total-body irradiation with cyclophosphamide (CTX) was given in 32 patients, modified BuCY protocol (hydroxyurea, busulfan, Ara-C, CTX) in 24 patients, and MACC protocol (melphalan, Ara-C, CTX and lomustine) in one patient. Cyclosporine (CsA) and methotrexate (MTX) were used in patients with related donor allo-HSCT, and the combination of CsA, MTX , mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in unrelated donor all-HSCT to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis model was used to estimate the overall survival and the disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years after transplantation. RESULTS: In 8 patients with autologous transplantation, 7 obtained partial or complete cytogenetic remission (CR) within 3 months after transplantation and one died of transplantation-related complication. In 49 patients with allo-HSCT transplantation, all patients obtained CR except for two patients, one of whom failed to obtain CR and the other died of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. The incidence of infection and veno-occlusive disease during transplantation was 33.3% and 7.0%, respectively. The incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis and cytomegalovirus interstitial pneumonia after transplantation was 22.8% and 8.8%, respectively. Veno-occlusive disease, hemorrhagic cystitis or cytomegalovirus interstitial pneumonia did not occur in patients with autologous transplantation. The incidence of acute GVHD was 41.0% and 48.6%, and that of chronic GVHD 40.0% and 42.9% in patients with related and unrelated transplantation, respectively. The rate of relapse was 57.1% and 12.8%, with DFS at 5 years of 25.0% and 61.7%, respectively, in patients with autologous and related donor transplantation. The DFS at 5 years was 70.7% and 34.1%, respectively, in patients with chronic/accelerated phases and blast crisis be fore trans plantation. CONCLUSION: allo-HSCT can produce a higher clinical cure rate in CML patients in chronic phase CsA+MTX+MMF+ ATG protocol is more effective for prevention and alleviation of acute GVHD in patients with unrelated donor transplantation. Autologous transplantation with bone marrow purging helps prolong the patients' survival and even obtain clinical cure of CML.","['Liu, Qi-fa', 'Fan, Zhi-ping', 'Sun, Jing', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Liu, Xiao-li', 'Xu, Dan', 'Xu, Bing', 'Feng, Ru', 'Meng, Fan-yi', 'Zhou, Shu-yun']","['Liu QF', 'Fan ZP', 'Sun J', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu XL', 'Xu D', 'Xu B', 'Feng R', 'Meng FY', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. liuqifa@fimmun.com']",['chi'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao,Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,9426110,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2004/11/30 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2004/11/30 09:00'],"['2004/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao. 2004 Nov;24(11):1227-9, 1241.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that annexin II, a coreceptor for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen (PLG), is overexpressed on the surface of promyelocytes, leading to an increased fibrinolytic potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined the level of annexin II cell surface and mRNA expression in a range of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines. The evidence that annexin II levels are higher in APL would lend support to the hypothesis that the bleeding disorder seen in APL is caused by hyperfibrinolysis. RESULTS: Cell surface annexin II was found to be expressed at higher levels on NB4 (promyelocytic) cells than on either KG1a (early myeloid) or HL60 (myelocytic) cells. However, even higher levels were found on U937 and MM6 (histo-monocytic) and HEL (erythroid) cells (p<0.01). MM6 cells showed a threefold increase in annexin II mRNA compared to any of the other cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not fully support the concept of the coagulopathy associated with APL being caused by hyperfibrinolysis alone. Further investigations are required to identify the significance of annexin II expression and regulation in leukaemia.","['Olwill, Shane A', 'McGlynn, Hugh', 'Gilmore, William S', 'Alexander, H Denis']","['Olwill SA', 'McGlynn H', 'Gilmore WS', 'Alexander HD']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulster, Coleraine BT52 1SA Northern Ireland, UK. shane.olwill@fusionantibodies.com']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (ANXA2 protein, human)', '0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Annexin A2/analysis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fibrinolysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis']",2004/11/30 09:00,2005/05/06 09:00,['2004/11/30 09:00'],"['2004/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2004/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-3848(04)00416-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.thromres.2004.07.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2005;115(1-2):109-14. doi: 10.1016/j.thromres.2004.07.014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No systematic study on the incidence and prognostic impact of venous thromboembolism in acute leukemia has been performed as yet. We retrospectively evaluated the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism before chemotherapy in 719 patients (371 males and 348 females, median age of 57.4 years), diagnosed with acute leukemia [534 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 185 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia]. Furthermore, the relationship of venous thromboembolism to clinical and laboratory parameters and its impact on prognosis was assessed. Fifteen patients (2.09%) had venous thromboembolism (objectively confirmed in 13 patients) in close temporal relationship to the onset of acute leukemia. The incidence of venous thromboembolism was the same in acute myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemia. In five patients, pulmonary embolism was documented. Venous thromboembolism occurred in all subtypes of acute leukemia, but was most common in promyelocytic leukemia. All but one patient were treated with anticoagulants. No patient died from treatment-related bleedings or venous thromboembolism. Overall, survival, disease-free survival, and remission duration did not differ between the patient groups with and without venous thromboembolism. In contrast to solid tumors, venous thromboembolism before or at diagnosis of acute leukemia is not associated with poor prognosis.","['Ziegler, Sophie', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Knobl, Paul', 'Lehr, Stephan', 'Weltermann, Ansgar', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Valent, Peter', 'Lechner, Klaus']","['Ziegler S', 'Sperr WR', 'Knobl P', 'Lehr S', 'Weltermann A', 'Jager U', 'Valent P', 'Lechner K']","['Division of Haematology and Haemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. sophie.ziegler@akh-wien.ac.at']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thromboembolism/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Venous Thrombosis/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality']",2004/11/30 09:00,2005/05/06 09:00,['2004/11/30 09:00'],"['2004/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2004/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-3848(04)00418-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.thromres.2004.07.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2005;115(1-2):59-64. doi: 10.1016/j.thromres.2004.07.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular pathways that mediate the antiretroviral activity of CTL are still elusive. Here we explore the protective role of the two main cytolytic pathways of CTL, that is, granule exocytosis and Fas/Fas ligand (FasL), in acute and persistent Friend retrovirus (FV) infection of mice. For this purpose, we have used mutant mouse strains with targeted gene defects in one or more components of the two cytolytic pathways including perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B, Fas, and FasL. The important function of CTL in resistance of C57BL/6 (B6) mice to FV is emphasized by the finding that depletion of CD8+ T-cells prior to virus infection resulted in severe splenomegaly and high viral loads in blood and spleen tissue. Analysis of primary FV infection in knockout mice revealed that acute infection was readily controlled in the absence of functional Fas. Most notably in the presence of Fas/FasL each of the three effector molecules of the exocytosis pathway (i.e., perforin, granzyme A, and granzyme B) was capable on its own to mediate suppression of virus replication and protection from leukemia. However, triple knockout mice lacking perforin and the two granzymes were fully susceptible to FV-induced leukemia. In contrast to acute infection the Fas/FasL pathway was mandatory for effective control of FV replication during persistent infection. These findings suggest novel pathways of CTL-mediated viral defense and contribute towards a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CTL activity in retroviral infections.","['Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Balkow, Sandra', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Schepers, Koen', 'Simon, Markus M', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Zelinskyy G', 'Balkow S', 'Schimmer S', 'Schepers K', 'Simon MM', 'Dittmer U']","['Institut fur Virologie des Universitatsklinikums Essen, Universitat Duisburg-Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/growth & development/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Granzymes', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Spleen/virology', 'Splenomegaly', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Viral Load', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*immunology']",2004/11/30 09:00,2005/01/12 09:00,['2004/11/30 09:00'],"['2004/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(04)00575-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2004.08.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Dec 20;330(2):365-74. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.08.040.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current model proposes that the combination of the loss of Ikaros activity and the gain of constitutive Notch activity disrupts the normal balance between repression and activation at common regulatory elements. Furthermore, the model is extended to suggest that multiple transcription factors coordinate transcriptional repression and activation through these common regulatory elements.

We compared the effects of aspirin (ASA) and the ortho, meta, and para positional isomers of NO-donating aspirin (NO-ASA) on cell growth and beta-catenin expression in human Jurkat T leukemic cells. Cell growth inhibition was strong: IC(50) for p-, o-, and m- were 20+/-1.6 (mean+/-SEM), 15+/-1.5, and 200+/-12 microM, respectively, in contrast to that of ASA (3200+/-375 microM). The para isomer of NO-ASA degraded beta-catenin in a dose- and time-dependent manner coinciding with increasing expression of activated caspase-3. The caspase inhibitor ZVAD blocked beta-catenin cleavage by p-NO-ASA and partially reversed cell growth inhibition by p-NO-ASA but not that by ASA. A denitrated analog of p-NO-ASA did not degrade beta-catenin indicating the importance of the NO-donating moiety. Our findings suggest that NO-ASA merits further study as an agent against leukemia.","['Nath, Niharika', 'Labaze, Georges', 'Rigas, Basil', 'Kashfi, Khosrow']","['Nath N', 'Labaze G', 'Rigas B', 'Kashfi K']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, City University of New York Medical School, New York, NY 10031, USA.']",['eng'],,['R01 A92423/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Nitric Oxide Donors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nitric Oxide Donors/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin']",2004/11/30 09:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/11/30 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(04)02564-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.11.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Jan 7;326(1):93-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.11.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of myosin light chain (MLC) kinase was negligible in UT-7/TPO cells, while Rho-kinase and protein kinase C (PKC) were detected. Thrombin stimulated both monophosphorylation at Ser19 and diphosphorylation at Thr18 and Ser19 of 20 kDa MLC, as well as phosphorylation of myosin-binding subunit (MBS) and PKC-potentiated inhibitory phosphoprotein of myosin phosphatase (CPI). The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 [(+)-(R)-trans-(1-aminoethyl)-N-(4-phynidyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide dihydrochloride, monohydrade] strongly inhibited thrombin-induced shape change, MBS phosphorylation, and mono- and diphosphorylation of MLC. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X (2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-maleimide) partially inhibited thrombin-induced shape change and MLC diphosphorylation even at the concentration that completely inhibited thrombin-induced CPI phosphorylation. In shape-changed UT-7/TPO cells induced by thrombin, phosphorylated MBS and CPI were colocalized with diphosphorylated MLC at pseudopods, whereas monophosphorylated MLC was mainly located in the cortical region. The accumulation of diphosphorylated MLC was blocked by preincubation with either Y-27632 or GF109203X. These results suggest that Rho-kinase is responsible for the induction of MLC phosphorylation in thrombin-induced shape change of UT-7/TPO cells and that myosin phosphatase inactivation through Rho-kinase-MBS and PKC-CPI pathways could be necessary for enhancement of MLC diphosphorylation which promote the pseudopod formation.","['Yazaki, Akira', 'Tamaru, Satoshi', 'Sasaki, Yasuharu', 'Komatsu, Nobuo', 'Wada, Hideo', 'Shiku, Hiroshi', 'Nishikawa, Masakatsu']","['Yazaki A', 'Tamaru S', 'Sasaki Y', 'Komatsu N', 'Wada H', 'Shiku H', 'Nishikawa M']","['The 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Myosin Light Chains)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.18 (Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.53 (Myosin-Light-Chain Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Shape/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Myosin Light Chains/metabolism', 'Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase/biosynthesis', 'Myosin-Light-Chain Phosphatase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Pseudopodia/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'rho-Associated Kinases']",2004/11/30 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2004/11/30 09:00'],"['2004/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(04)00147-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.07.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2005 Mar;17(3):321-30. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.07.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of an enzyme oligonucleotide assay (EOA) for the confirmation of infection with HTLV-I or HTLV-II. STUDY DESIGN: The sensitivity of the EOA was determined by examining 88 specimens representing diverse geographic-associated genotypes and clinical manifestations. The specificity was determined by testing 40 HTLV-seroindeterminate (PCR-negative) specimens. RESULTS: Of the 52 HTLV-I-positive specimens tested, 46 (88%) were confirmed positive for HTLV-I by the EOA; these included 25 of 30 (83%) specimens from asymptomatic carriers, 14 of 15 (93%) specimens from patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, and all 7 specimens from patients with adult T-cell leukemia. Similarly, 33 of 36 (92%) HTLV-II-positive specimens were confirmed positive for HTLV-II. None of the specimens were wrongly classified. All specimens tested with distinct geographic-associated genotypes for HTLV-I and -II were detected by EOA. Analysis of seroindeterminate specimens, all of which were previously shown to be negative by nested PCR, showed that none of 40 were detected by either the HTLV-I or HTLV-II EOA. CONCLUSIONS: The overall sensitivity of the EOA detection for confirmation of HTLV-I and HTLV-II was 79 of 88 (90%) and the overall specificity was 100%. These findings demonstrate that the EOA provides a simple, standardized assay system for reliable confirmation and typing of HTLV infection.","['Dezzutti, C S', 'Patel, P P', 'Owen, S M', 'Switzer, W M', 'Meshulam, J', 'Lal, R B']","['Dezzutti CS', 'Patel PP', 'Owen SM', 'Switzer WM', 'Meshulam J', 'Lal RB']","['Retrovirus Diseases Branch, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mail Stop G19, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Clin Diagn Virol,Clinical and diagnostic virology,9309653,,,,1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/28 00:00 [received]', '1996/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0928019796002322 [pii]', '10.1016/0928-0197(96)00232-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Diagn Virol. 1996 Aug;6(2-3):103-10. doi: 10.1016/0928-0197(96)00232-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sensitive RT tests should thus detect all such particles. A family of ultrasensitive RT tests, product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assays, have been designed. Accumulated results show that (i) a first version of the PERT assay that uses microtiter/ELISA technology detects RT of only 3-11 retroviral particles, (ii) very different human and animal lenti- and oncoviruses are detected very sensitively, (iii) HIV-1 is detected as sensitively as with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral RNA, and (iv) prevalence of elevated particle-associated RT in plasma of unselected Swiss blood donors was 1.9%. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the RT activity detected in one unselected donor with a chronically elevated level of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase and two selected donors with chronically indeterminate or borderline-positive HIV-1 serology was due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) infection. STUDY DESIGN: Blood samples were tested by PCR for viral DNA and/or RNA of HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, hepatitis B and C virus. Serological tests and virus cultures were also employed. RESULTS: Infection with any of the above agents could not be demonstrated. Virus cultivation in one case of borderline-positive HIV-1 Western blot for more than 5 years yielded a peak of RT production that was repeatedly transmissible to fresh cells. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the presence of an infectious RT-positive agent, probably different from HIV-1/2 or HTLV-1/2, in a healthy individual with chronically borderline-positive HIV-1 serology. The PERT assay may detect retroviruses currently undetectable by other tests. The use of more stringent Western blot interpretation guidelines other than those of CDC or WHO is strongly recommended.","['Schupbach, J', 'Pyra, H', 'Jendis, J', 'Tomasik, Z', 'Boni, J']","['Schupbach J', 'Pyra H', 'Jendis J', 'Tomasik Z', 'Boni J']","['Swiss National Center for Retroviruses, University of Zurich, Gloriastr, 30, CH-8028 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Clin Diagn Virol,Clinical and diagnostic virology,9309653,,,,1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/10 00:00 [received]', '1996/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['092801979600222X [pii]', '10.1016/0928-0197(96)00222-x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Diagn Virol. 1996 May;5(2-3):197-203. doi: 10.1016/0928-0197(96)00222-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A sensitive and specific diagnostic procedure of CMV infection is required. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure has been demonstrated to be more sensitive than conventional virus isolation. However, CMV DNA can be detected in patients with latent or asymptomatic infections by PCR because of its extreme sensitivity. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we used PCR and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect CMV DNA and mRNA in immunocompromised patients and evaluated the value of PCR and RT-PCR for diagnosis of active CMV infection. STUDY DESIGN: We examined thirty immunocompromised children for CMV DNA using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). urine and throat swabs from October 1991 to March 1992. Eighteen of the patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, four had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, two had Wilms' tumor and six were recipients of an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Four patients developed CMV-related clinical symptoms during the observation period: two patients with pneumonia and two patients with hepatitis. RESULTS: CMV DNA was detected in four patients with clinical symptoms and in five patients without evidence of CMV infection. The incidence of CMV DNA was significantly higher in symptomatic patients than asymptomatic patients. CMV mRNA encoding the late antigen was detected by RT-PCR only in patients with clinical symptoms of CMV infection. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that detection of CMV DNA by PCR is of little clinical significance for distinguishing latent form active CMV infection. It is suggested that detection of CMV mRNA by RT-PCR is useful for diagnosis of active CMV infection.","['Nishihara, H', 'Ito, M', 'Matsumoto, N', 'Nakano, T', 'Ihara, T', 'Kamiya, H', 'Sakurai, M']","['Nishihara H', 'Ito M', 'Matsumoto N', 'Nakano T', 'Ihara T', 'Kamiya H', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, 514 Japan.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Clin Diagn Virol,Clinical and diagnostic virology,9309653,,,,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/10 00:00 [received]', '1994/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '1994/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['092801979400024O [pii]', '10.1016/0928-0197(94)00024-o [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Diagn Virol. 1995 Jan;3(1):73-81. doi: 10.1016/0928-0197(94)00024-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HHV-6 has been suggested to be linked to various lymhoproliferative disorders. In vitro studies have demonstrated the oncogenic potential of HHV-6. The role of HHV-6 in human lymphomas needs to be examined. OBJECTIVE: To determine the involvement of HHV-6 in an immunoblastic lymphoma which developed in a bone marrow transplant patient, who had HHV-6 viremia. STUDY DESIGN: Paraffin-embedded lymphoma tissues were examined for the presence of HHV-6 by immunohistochemistry, PCR and in-situ hybridization. This is a case report investigation. RESULTS: An acute myelogenous leukemia patient received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. He developed human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) viremia approximately 6 weeks after transplantation and HHV-6 was concurrently isolated from his bone marrow. Soon afterward, a large cell immunoblastic lymphoma was diagnosed. Complications of this tumor subsequently resulted in the patient's death. Periaortic lymph nodes and tumor cells infiltrating the liver and kidneys showed the presence of HHV-6 by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Southern blot analysis of the PCR amplified DNAs confirmed the presence of transforming pZVH14 DNA sequences of HHV-6 in the tumor tissues. Lymph nodes of 6 immunologically intact individuals were negative for HHV-6 by immunohistochemistry and PCR analysis. Tumor tissues were negative for EBV DNA by in situ hybridization with DNA probes specific for the EBV EBER RNAs.

HTLV-II appears to be more prevalent than HTLV-I in aboriginal populations of the Americas. Recently several clinical cases of HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and a case of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) have been identified in British Columbian Indians. This data suggests that a new endemic area of HTLV-I infection may be present within British Columbian Indian population. However, it has recently been shown that HTLV-II may also be associated with a neurological disease similar to HAM/TSP. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the work reported here was to demonstrate whether HTLV-I, HTLV-II or both were responsible for the diseases seen in the British Columbian Indians. STUDY DESIGN: In this study serological and gene amplification techniques were used to determine whether HTLV-I or HTLV-II was present in four families and three unrelated individuals all from different bands of aboriginal Native Indians in British Columbia. In each family, one member had an HTLV-associated disease, three cases of HAM/TSP and one case of ATL. Of the three individual aboriginal natives unrelated to the four families, two had HAM/TSP while the third was asymptomatic for HTLV-associated diseases. RESULTS: This study demonstrated the presence of HTLV-I in the aboriginal Indians with disease and in some of their family members. HTLV-II was not detected in any of the British Columbian Indians tested in this study.

This study was to investigate the serum level of VEGF in children and adolescent patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: The serum levels of VEGF(sVEGF) in 24 pretreated NHL patients were detected by ELISA. sVEGF in 10 of the 24 patients who received complete response after treatment were also detected by ELISA. RESULTS: The average serum VEGF level was 745.79 ng/L (40.64-3623.09 ng/L)in 24 NHL patients. It was higher than normal [(294.20+/-23.40) ng/L]. sVEGF in 18 of the patients were higher than the standard, while in 6 of the patients were lower than the standard. The average serum VEGF level was 289.54 ng/L (35.11-826.8 ng/L) in 10 of The CR patients, 8 cases of them had a high VEGF level before treatment but a nearly normal level after first CR. And 2 cases of them had normal level during the course. CONCLUSIONS: The serum level of VEGF in NHL patients was higher than normals.

METHODS: VEGF&bFGF and their receptors mRNA expression were detected by RT-PCR; VEGF & bFGF plasma level was analyzed by ELISA. RESULTS: In 107 AML patients, the positive mRNA expression rate of VEGF, KDR and Flt1 was 56.1%, 49.5%, and 2.8%, respectively; for bFGF and FGFR1-4, the positive rate was 21.5%, 35.5%, 9.4%, 35.5% and 23.4%, respectively. VEGF concentration in AML (154.75+/-109.98) pg/ml was significantly higher than that in AML-CR (72.05+/-23.39) pg/ml and the normal control (99.91+/-41.87) pg/ml (P< 0.05). Nevertheless, the level of bFGF had no significant difference among AML, AML-CR and the normal control. VEGF level (124.05+/-76.57) pg/ml in patients, who got complete remission (CR) after 2 cycles of chemotherapy, was remarkably lower than that (211.243+/-169.88) pg/ml in patients without CR (P< 0.05). Furthermore, the higher the concentration of VEGF & bFGF, the shorter the survival was. CONCLUSION: VEGF& bFGF and their receptors mRNA in leukemic patients could be expressed to some degree,and our investigation suggested VEGF &bFGF and their receptors probably be produced by autocrine or paracrin. Abnormally high level of VEGF may be a poor factor for chemotherapy and survival in AML. The prognosis of patients with AML may be improved by treating VEGF and their receptors as therapy targets.","['Wang, Yi', 'Xiao, Zhi-Jian', 'Liu, Peng', 'Peng, Zhi', 'Han, Zhong-Chao']","['Wang Y', 'Xiao ZJ', 'Liu P', 'Peng Z', 'Han ZC']","['State Key Library of Experiment Hematology,Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin, 300020, P.R.China.']",['chi'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/biosynthesis/genetics']",2004/11/30 09:00,2005/08/06 09:00,['2004/11/30 09:00'],"['2004/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X200411s1423 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2004 Nov;23(11 Suppl):1423-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cloning of new isoforms of LIF mRNA.,10,"BACKGROUND: The cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mediates its biological effects through binding to its high affinity receptor made of the low-affinity LIF receptor subunit gp190 (LIF-R) and the gp130 subunit. LIF exerts several important effects in the liver, however, data on liver expression of LIF are scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of LIF and LIF-R in human liver. RESULTS: LIF expression, analyzed by immunohistochemistry, was barely detectable in normal liver but was strong within cirrhotic fibrous septa and was found in spindle-shaped cells compatible with myofibroblasts. Accordingly, cultured human liver myofibroblasts expressed high levels of LIF as shown by ELISA and Northern blot. Biological assay demonstrated that myofibroblast-derived LIF was fully active. RT-PCR showed expression of the LIF-D and M isoforms, and also of low levels of new variants of LIF-D and LIF-M resulting from deletion of exon 2 through alternative splicing. LIF receptor expression was detected mainly as a continuous sinusoidal staining that was enhanced in cirrhotic liver, suggestive of endothelial cell and/or hepatocyte labeling. Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and STAT-3 phosphorylation assays did not provide evidence for LIF receptor expression by myofibroblasts themselves. LIF secretion by cultured myofibroblasts was down regulated by the addition of interleukin-4. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time the expression of LIF in human liver myofibroblasts, as well as of two new isoforms of LIF mRNA. Expression of LIF by myofibroblasts and of its receptor by adjacent cells suggests a potential LIF paracrine loop in human liver that may play a role in the regulation of intra-hepatic inflammation.","['Hisaka, Toru', 'Desmouliere, Alexis', 'Taupin, Jean-Luc', 'Daburon, Sophie', 'Neaud, Veronique', 'Senant, Nathalie', 'Blanc, Jean-Frederic', 'Moreau, Jean-Francois', 'Rosenbaum, Jean']","['Hisaka T', 'Desmouliere A', 'Taupin JL', 'Daburon S', 'Neaud V', 'Senant N', 'Blanc JF', 'Moreau JF', 'Rosenbaum J']","['INSERM, E362, Bordeaux, F-33076 France; Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, F-33076 France. jean.rosenbaum@gref.u-bordeaux2.fr.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20041126,England,Comp Hepatol,Comparative hepatology,101147643,,,,2004/11/30 09:00,2004/11/30 09:01,['2004/11/30 09:00'],"['2004/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/30 09:01 [medline]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1476-5926-3-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-5926-3-10 [doi]']",epublish,Comp Hepatol. 2004 Nov 26;3(1):10. doi: 10.1186/1476-5926-3-10.,,,,PMC538256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agents that can enhance the antigen presenting capabilities of CLL cells might then help to improve the clinical results of immunotherapies. This study investigated the effects of the common gamma chain-binding cytokines, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15, on costimulatory properties of primary CLL cells from 51 patients. IL-2 improved the ability of CLL cells to stimulate T cell proliferation and increased the expression of costimulatory molecules (particularly CD80) in a dose-dependent fashion, especially in CLL cells with weak expression of CD38. CD80 and CD86 induction by IL-2 were positively regulated through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, while CD86 expression was negatively regulated through Janus kinase pathways. However, further activation with protein kinase C agonists was required for IL-2 activated CLL cells to stimulate autologous T cells sufficiently to clear bystander CLL cells from mixed lymphocyte responses. IL-15 had similar effects on the costimulatory properties of CLL cells. These results suggest a role for IL-2, or IL-15, in immunotherapeutic strategies for CLL.","['Spaner, David E', 'Hammond, Caitlin', 'Mena, Jenny', 'Shi, Yonghong']","['Spaner DE', 'Hammond C', 'Mena J', 'Shi Y']","[""Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Research Institute, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Center, Toronto M4N 3M5, Canada. spanerd@srcl.sunnybrook.utoronto.ca""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (IL2RB protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/immunology', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/*immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Active/*methods', 'Interleukin-15/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit', 'Interleukins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism']",2004/11/30 09:00,2005/01/20 09:00,['2004/11/30 09:00'],"['2004/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5240 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05240.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Dec;127(5):531-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05240.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genes were able to protect NIT-1 cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis to varying degrees ranging from no protection to significant protection equivalent to an optimal dose of a chemical caspase inhibitor. The data demonstrate that cFLIP, FADD-DN, and PI-9 are significantly more effective in protecting NIT-1 cells than BcL-2 and ICAM-2.

Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) therapy used in the treatment of osteoradionecrosis is demonstrated effectiveness. Aim of this retrospective analysis was to investigate whether HBO-therapy might lead to subjective as well as objective effects in the treatment of BME and/or AON in paediatric oncology patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 11/1988 and 01/2001 27/291 (9.3 %) patients with ALL or NHL were diagnosed with a BME and/or AON in the Clinic for Paediatric Oncology, Haematology, and Immunology at University of Dusseldorf. 19/27 patients were submitted to HBO-therapy. Patients received average 45 HBO-treatments per patient (min. 13, max. 80 treatments). The affected regions were re-evaluated with MRI for radiological extent of lesions every 3 months. Pain in its intensity and localisation was serially recorded during HBO-therapy as key symptom in 11 of 19 patients. RESULTS: 27 patients (15 females, 12 males; mean age at diagnosis of malignancy 8.2 +/- 4.7 (SD) years, range 7 months to 16 years) presented with 138 lesions. 133/138 lesions were localised in the lower extremities. At diagnosis of BME and/or AON, 78/133 lesions were shown in females and 55/133 lesions in male. Girls < 10 years predominantly presented BME (33 BME vs. 6 AON), girls aged > 10 years predominantly offered AON (28 AON vs. 11 BME). BME was more often exhibited in boys < 10 years (34 BME vs. 10 AON) and rarely in boys > 10 years (4 BME vs. 6 AON). 11 patients treated with HBO-therapy were serially evaluated for pain intensity throughout their HBO-therapy courses by visual analogue scale (VAS) assessment. During the first 15 treatment courses the HBO-therapy a clear-cut reduction of pain was observed. The mean pain score before the first HBO-treatment unit was 2.4 +/- 2.7 (X +/- SD), decreased before the fifth to 1.6 +/- 1.7 and prior to the 35 (th) and 40 (th) HBO treatment to 0. Girls < 10 years treated with HBO showed an increase of BME (31 --> 46) and declining AON numbers (6 --> 2). Girls > 10 years with and without HBO-therapy showed decrease of BME lesions (7 --> 4 vs. 4 --> 0), whereas AON increased in the HBO-treated group (28 --> 29) as well as the non-treated group (0 --> 4). Males < 10 years showed an increase in BME lesion numbers despite HBO intervention (24 --> 26). The AON lesion numbers dropped in parallel (6 --> 3). Male patients not treated with HBO showed constant numbers of BME (11-->11) and a decreased numbers of AON (4 --> 2). All differences are statistically not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents diagnosed with ALL or NHL have a risk for accruement of BME and/or AON irrespective of the age, with an almost exclusive involvement of the lower extremities. Lesions of pedal bones and ankle joints predominantly affect children < 10 years. Lesions of knee and hip joints predominantly affect children > 10 years. In children < 10 years of age we demonstrate declining AON numbers and conversion of AON to BME thereby implicating possible beneficial effect of HBO in such patients. HBO failed to show beneficial effect on BME whether by preventing new lesions or by improving existent lesions in children > 10 years.","['Bernbeck, B', 'Christaras, A', 'Krauth, K', 'Lentrodt, S', 'Strelow, H', 'Schaper, J', 'Janssen, G', 'Modder, U', 'Gobel, U']","['Bernbeck B', 'Christaras A', 'Krauth K', 'Lentrodt S', 'Strelow H', 'Schaper J', 'Janssen G', 'Modder U', 'Gobel U']","['Clinic for Paediatric Oncology, -Haematology and -Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/diagnosis/etiology/surgery/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Edema/diagnosis/etiology/surgery/*therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Hyperbaric Oxygenation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/diagnosis/etiology/surgery/*therapy', 'Pain Measurement', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-832341 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2004 Nov-Dec;216(6):370-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-832341.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To validate the efficacy of CBT in comparison to BMT and PBSCT we performed a single-centre based matched-pair analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2003, 15 paediatric patients with non-malignant and malignant diseases of heterogenous risk underwent CBT. 198 paediatric patients undergoing BMT or PBSCT during the same time and at the same centre were available for selection as appropriate controls for matched-pair analysis. Matching criteria in descending hierarchy were disease, risk status, type of donor, age at HSCT, gender and year of transplantation. 47 % of CB grafts were < or = 4/6 HLA-matched whereas close to 90 % of grafts in the BMT and PBSCT cohorts were completely matched. RESULTS: Neutrophil engraftment was comparable in CB and BM recipients (p = 0.529) while engraftment following PBSCT occurs significantly earlier (p < 0.01). Median time to neutrophil recovery was 20 (range: 13-36), 19 (14-28) and 14 (9-24) days for the CBT, BMT and PBSCT cohort respectively. Of note contrary to the expectation, with regard to a reduced risk of Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) there was no clear advantage in the CBT cohort with a similar overall GvHD rate in all 3 groups. This observation can be attributed to the fact that in the CBT cohort the proportion of patients with an HLA-mismatched donor was higher than in the other cohorts. Rate of death of complications (DOC) was high in CB recipients (40 %), but not statistically different from BM (27 %) and PBSC recipients (13 %). In contrast to the CBT and BMT cohort with only 1 patient dead of disease (DOD), 4 PBSC recipients (31 %) died suffering from a relapse. 2-year event-free survival (EFS) in patients with malignant disease was 38.5 %, 69.2 % and 33.0 % for the CBT, BMT and PBSCT cohort respectively. 5-year overall survival (OS) was 53.3 % in the CBT, 66.4 % in the BMT and 50.9 % in the PBSCT cohort. There was no statistical difference between the cohorts transplanted with CB and BM or PBSC regarding EFS and OS (EFS: p = 0.24 and p = 0.72; OS: p = 0.53 and p = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of < or = 4/6 HLA-matched CB grafts seems to be associated with a higher risk of GvHD, graft rejection and lethal opportunistic infection. With an overall survival of 53 % in our 15 patients this analysis documents that even in high risk patients, CB may be a valid alternate HSC source in children who lack a well-matched donor. This is especially true, if a > 4/6 HLA-matched CB with > 2.0 x 10 (7) total nucleated cells/kg bodyweight is available. Thus, parallel to the search for a BM or PBSC donor, searching for an adequate CB unit should be initiated.","['Schonberger, S', 'Niehues, T', 'Meisel, R', 'Bernbeck, B', 'Laws, H J', 'Kogler, G', 'Enzmann, J', 'Wernet, P', 'Gobel, U', 'Dilloo, D']","['Schonberger S', 'Niehues T', 'Meisel R', 'Bernbeck B', 'Laws HJ', 'Kogler G', 'Enzmann J', 'Wernet P', 'Gobel U', 'Dilloo D']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Haematology and Immunology, University Children's Hospital Dusseldorf, Germany. schoenbs@uni-duesseldorf.de""]",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematologic Diseases/mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-832357 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2004 Nov-Dec;216(6):356-63. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-832357.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disorder is usually affecting adults and is rarely diagnosed in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study we describe 12 children aged 5-16 years in whom ET was presumed. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 59 months (range 10-72). At diagnosis 7 patients had clinical symptoms (syncope, poor concentration, fatigue, abdominal pain and mild bleeding), 5 patients were diagnosed accidentally (operation, allergy, enuresis, pneumonia, routine examination). Median platelet count at diagnosis was 1 325 x 10 (9)/L (range 600-3 050). In 11 cases bone marrow morphology was consistent with ET, one patient had chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis. Cytogenetics were normal in all studied cases. Within 6 months after the initial presentation one patient who was diagnosed accidentally developed thrombosis, another patient had mild bleeding. 8 patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (in addition, 1 patient received hydroxyurea, 2 patients received anagrelide). On last follow-up all patients were alive, none had developed leukemia. 5 patients experienced hematological remission. 2 of these children had not received any therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients had symptoms attributable to ET. The clinical course is heterogeneous with complete normalization of platelets in the absence of cytoreductive therapy in some children. Due to the low incidence of ET in children indications for therapy are unclear and can only be deduced from findings obtained from studies in adults.","['Kratz, C P', 'Abd El-Monheim, A', 'Manke, E M', 'Rister, M', 'Rogge, T', 'Niemeyer, C M']","['Kratz CP', 'Abd El-Monheim A', 'Manke EM', 'Rister M', 'Rogge T', 'Niemeyer CM']","['Zentrum fur Kinderheilkunde und Jugendmedizin, Klinik IV: Padiatrische Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Freiburg. kratz@kikli.ukil.uni-freiburg.de']",['ger'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/therapy', 'Thrombocytosis/diagnosis/therapy', 'Time Factors']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-832356 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2004 Nov-Dec;216(6):349-55. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-832356.,,,,,,,,Retrospektive Analyse des klinischen Verlaufs bei 12 Kindern mit der Verdachtsdiagnose einer essenziellen Thrombozythamie.,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting uncertainty distributions in the relative risk model parameters were used to derive uncertainties in population cancer risks for a current UK population. Because of evidence for irregularities in the low-dose dose response, flexible dose-response models were used, consisting of a linear-quadratic-exponential model, used to model the high-dose part of the dose response, together with piecewise-linear adjustments for the two lowest dose groups. Following an assumed administered dose of 0.001 Sv, lifetime leukaemia radiation-induced incidence risks were estimated to be 1.11 x 10(-2) Sv(-1) (95% Bayesian CI -0.61, 2.38) using this model.

However; it is associated with serious side effects believed to be caused by the Cremophor EL used for its formulation. AIM: To evaluate the cytotoxic activity of a new paclitaxel formulation, Pacliex (developed by Oasmia Pharmaceutical, Uppsala, Sweden), a mixed micelles preparation in which an amphiphilic synthetic derivative of retinoic acid replaced Cremophor EL/ethanol vehicle. METHOD: In this study, three model systems were used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of Pacliex and other paclitaxel preparations. The cytotoxic activities of Pacliex, Taxol and paclitaxel in ethanol were investigated against a panel of ten human tumor cell lines using the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA). Low- and high- proliferating in vitro hollow fiber model of two cell lines, the leukemia CCRF-CEM and the myeloma RPMI 8226/S cell lines, were used to assess the cytotoxic activity of the three formulations. The in vivo hollow fiber model of the two cell lines was used for assessment of Pacliex and Taxol activity. The [3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was utilized to analyze the in vitro and in vivo hollow fiber data. RESULT: Pacliex was somewhat more effective than Taxol in the more sensitive cell lines. The activity of Taxol was more pronounced in the resistant cell lines due to an additive effect of the vehicle used. The three formulations showed similar activity in both the low- and high-proliferating in vitro hollow fiber cultures. The in vivo hollow fiber cytotoxic activity of Pacliex was similar to that of Taxol. Putting all the results together, it was found that all the three formulations had similar in vitro and in vivo activity. CONCLUSION: The three in vitro and in vivo models confirmed the similarity of the cytotoxic activities of Pacliex and Taxol. Considering the above, Pacliex could be an interesting alternative Cremophor EL-free formulation of paclitaxel.","['Hassan, Saadia', 'Dhar, Sumeer', 'Sandstrom, Marie', 'Arsenau, Dzmitry', 'Budnikova, Marina', 'Lokot, Igor', 'Lobanov, Nikolai', 'Karlsson, Mats O', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Lindhagen, Elin']","['Hassan S', 'Dhar S', 'Sandstrom M', 'Arsenau D', 'Budnikova M', 'Lokot I', 'Lobanov N', 'Karlsson MO', 'Larsson R', 'Lindhagen E']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medical Sciences, University Hospital, 751 85, Uppsala, Sweden. sadia.hassan@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20040720,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Pacliex)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Micelles', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/01/19 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0855-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2005 Jan;55(1):47-54. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0855-5.

A prominent feature of B-CLL cells is the high expression of CD23, which is closely related to cell survival and is regulated by Notch2. Since several components of the Notch signaling cascade are tightly regulated by proteasomal degradation, we studied the effect of PI on Notch2 activity and CD23 expression. Exposure of B-CLL cells to PI led to induction of apoptosis, a time- and dose-dependent downregulation of CD23 expression and a decline in DNA binding of transcriptionally active Notch2. In contrast, the transcription factor NF-AT and its putative target gene CD5, which is highly expressed in B-CLL cells, were unaffected. When the late phase of PI-induced apoptosis was arrested by inhibition of caspase 3, the reduction of Notch2 activity was still observed, indicating that reduction of active Notch2 took place already during an earlier phase of apoptosis. Enforced expression of constitutively active Notch2 decreased PI-mediated apoptosis in a human B-cell line. These data indicate that downregulation of CD23 and loss of Notch2 activity are early steps in PI-induced apoptosis of B-CLL lymphocytes and may be part of the full apoptotic response.","['Duechler, M', 'Shehata, M', 'Schwarzmeier, J D', 'Hoelbl, A', 'Hilgarth, M', 'Hubmann, R']","['Duechler M', 'Shehata M', 'Schwarzmeier JD', 'Hoelbl A', 'Hilgarth M', 'Hubmann R']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cytokine Research, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch2', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, IgE/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/02/23 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403592 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403592 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Feb;19(2):260-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403592.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CR rate was 86% in patients older than 60 as compared to 94.5% in younger patients (P=0.0014), due to a higher incidence of early deaths in elderly patients. The 4-year incidence of relapse was 15.6% in adults older than 60 and 23.2% in younger adults although most elderly patients received less intensive consolidation chemotherapy. However, 18.6% of the patients older than 60 years who achieved CR died in CR, mainly from sepsis during consolidation course or maintenance treatment, as compared to 5.7% of younger adults (P<0.001).

Less favorable outcome is mainly due to an increase of early deaths and to toxicity of consolidation treatment, strongly suggesting a beneficial role for less intensive consolidation chemotherapy and possibly introduction of arsenic derivates in the treatment of APL in the elderly.","['Ades, L', 'Chevret, S', 'De Botton, S', 'Thomas, X', 'Dombret, H', 'Beve, B', 'Sanz, M', 'Guerci, A', 'Miguel, J S', 'Dela Serna, J', 'Garo, C', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Reman, O', 'Stamatoulas, A', 'Fey, M', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Sotto, J J', 'Bourhis, J H', 'Parry, A', 'Chomienne, C', 'Degos, L', 'Fenaux, P']","['Ades L', 'Chevret S', 'De Botton S', 'Thomas X', 'Dombret H', 'Beve B', 'Sanz M', 'Guerci A', 'Miguel JS', 'Dela Serna J', 'Garo C', 'Stoppa AM', 'Reman O', 'Stamatoulas A', 'Fey M', 'Cahn JY', 'Sotto JJ', 'Bourhis JH', 'Parry A', 'Chomienne C', 'Degos L', 'Fenaux P']","[""Service d'hematologie clinique/Hopital Avicenne, Paris XIII University, Bobigny, France.""]",['eng'],,,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/02/23 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403597 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403597 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Feb;19(2):230-3. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403597.,['European APL Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deficiency of functional deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) plays an important role in AraC resistance in vitro. We screened 5378 bp sequences of the dCK gene, including all exons and the 5' flanking region, and identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regulatory region (rSNPs) with high allele frequencies. These two rSNPs (-201C>T and -360C>G) formed two major haplotypes. Genotyping with sequencing and MassARRAY system among 122 AML patients showed that those with -360CG/-201CT and -360GG/-201TT compound genotypes (n = 41) displayed a favourable response to chemotherapy whereas those with -360CC/-201CC (n = 81) tended to have a poor response (P = 0.025). Moreover, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that patients with -360CG/-201CT and -360GG/-201TT genotypes expressed higher level of dCK mRNA compared to those with the -360CC/-201CC genotype (P = 0.0034). Luciferase-reporter assay showed that dCK 5' regulatory region bearing -360G/-201T genotype alone had an eight-fold greater transcriptional activation activity compared to that with -360C/-201C genotype, whereas co-transfection of both -360G/-201T and -360C/-201C constructs mimicked the heterozygous genotype, which exhibited a four-fold greater activity compared to that with -360C/-201C. These results indicate that rSNP haplotypes of dCK gene may serve as a genetic marker for predicting drug responsiveness, which will be beneficial in establishing more effective AML chemotherapeutic regimens.","['Shi, Jing-Yi', 'Shi, Zhan-Zhong', 'Zhang, Su-Jiang', 'Zhu, Yong-Mei', 'Gu, Bai-Wei', 'Li, Guo', 'Bai, Xue-Tao', 'Gao, Xiao-Dong', 'Hu, Jiong', 'Jin, Wei', 'Huang, Wei', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan']","['Shi JY', 'Shi ZZ', 'Zhang SJ', 'Zhu YM', 'Gu BW', 'Li G', 'Bai XT', 'Gao XD', 'Hu J', 'Jin W', 'Huang W', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai, PR China.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pharmacogenetics,Pharmacogenetics,9211735,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/04/13 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['00008571-200411000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/00008571-200411000-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenetics. 2004 Nov;14(11):759-68. doi: 10.1097/00008571-200411000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eleven patients (12 eyes) with premacular hemorrhage were enrolled from April 1998 to November 2002. The causes of premacular hemorrhage were proliferative diabetic retinopathy (7 patients, 8 eyes), Valsalva retinopathy (3 patients) and leukemia (1 eye). Krypton laser was used to create a membranotomy on the sloping edge of the premacular hemorrhage. Five eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy were treated with inferior panretinal photocoagulation and laser membranotomy simultaneously. After intravitreal dispersion of premacular blood, fundus examinations were performed in all eyes and fluorescein angiography in 5 patients to evaluate the retinal damage. RESULTS: Vision was improved within 2 weeks after surgery in all eyes with premacular hemorrhage, which received krypton laser membranotomy. No retinal damage was seen at the site of membranotomy. No eye needed vitrectomy postoperatively during the follow-up (mean, 17 months). CONCLUSION: Krypton laser membranotomy appears to be a safe and simple alternative procedure for treating selected cases of premacular hemorrhage. Further trials are necessary to evaluate its benefit.","['Chen, Yung-Jen', 'Kou, Hsi-Kung']","['Chen YJ', 'Kou HK']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. d2767@adm.cgmh.org.tw']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Ophthalmologica,Ophthalmologica.

Currently, three receptors have been identified that transmit signals upon BLyS and APRIL binding and these include B cell maturation antigen, B cell activating factor receptor, and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor. The striking effects of BLyS on normal B cell maintenance and survival and the largely B lineage-restricted pattern of receptor expression, raises the possibility that these TNF family ligands and receptors may be involved not only in B cell autoimmunity, but also in the pathogenesis and maintenance of mature B lineage hematological malignancies. In this article, we will review the spectrum of human B lineage malignancies and discuss current evidence supporting a role for BLyS and APRIL in fueling the growth and survival of specific B cell malignancies.","['Jelinek, Diane F', 'Darce, Jaime R']","['Jelinek DF', 'Darce JR']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Graduate School, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. jelinek.diane@mayo.edu']",['eng'],,['R01 CA105258-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,Switzerland,Curr Dir Autoimmun,Current directions in autoimmunity,101121763,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (BLyS receptor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['B-Cell Activating Factor', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'Models, Immunological', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['82107 [pii]', '10.1159/000082107 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Dir Autoimmun. 2005;8:266-88. doi: 10.1159/000082107.,,,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjogren's syndrome often associate with abnormal B cell function and the production of various autoantibodies. B cell activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) is a B cell survival factor essential for B cell maturation, but also contributes to autoimmunity when overexpressed in mice. In addition, elevated levels of BAFF have been detected in the serum of patients with various rheumatic diseases, suggesting a role for this factor in these pathologies. BAFF has additional functions that may be important in rheumatic diseases. For instance, excess BAFF leads to the expansion of a subset of B cells named marginal zone (MZ) B cells, a cell type able to activate naive T cells. In addition, expansion of the MZ B cell population correlates with certain autoimmune diseases, and these cells have been detected in inflamed tissues in mice and humans. Recently, BAFF was shown to also stimulate T cell activation, an aspect that may also contribute to autoimmunity. Finally, BAFF has emerged as a potent survival factor for B cell lymphomas and as such may be involved in promoting B cell cancers. This result possibly offers an explanation for the occasional lymphoma complication observed in a subset of patients with certain rheumatic diseases, particularly Sjogren's syndrome. New elements about BAFF biology indicate that this factor may be involved in a wider range of pathologies than first anticipated, and inhibitors of this factor are likely to provide attractive new treatments for rheumatic diseases and B cell lymphomas.","['Mackay, Fabienne', 'Sierro, Frederic', 'Grey, Shane T', 'Gordon, Tom P']","['Mackay F', 'Sierro F', 'Grey ST', 'Gordon TP']","['The Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Department of Arthritis and Inflammation, Darlinghurst, Australia. f.mackay@garvan.org.au']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Switzerland,Curr Dir Autoimmun,Current directions in autoimmunity,101121763,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF13C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Tnfrsf13c protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf13 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf13b protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', 'B-Cell Activating Factor', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Models, Immunological', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/immunology', 'Rheumatic Diseases/etiology/*immunology/therapy', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/immunology"", 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['82106 [pii]', '10.1159/000082106 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Dir Autoimmun. 2005;8:243-65. doi: 10.1159/000082106.,,,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We compared outcomes in 682 adults with acute leukemia who received a hematopoietic stem-cell transplant from an unrelated donor: 98 received cord blood and 584 received bone marrow. The transplantations were performed from 1998 through 2002 and reported to Eurocord and the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group. RESULTS: Recipients of cord blood were younger than recipients of bone marrow (median, 24.5 vs. 32 years of age; P<0.001), weighed less (median, 58 vs. 68 kg; P<0.001), and had more advanced disease at the time of transplantation (52 percent vs. 33 percent, P<0.001). All marrow transplants were HLA matched, whereas 94 percent of cord-blood grafts were HLA mismatched (P<0.001). The median number of nucleated cells that were infused was 0.23x10(8) per kilogram of the recipient's body weight for cord blood and 2.9x10(8) per kilogram for bone marrow (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed lower risks of grade II, III, or IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after cord-blood transplantation (relative risk, 0.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.87; P=0.01), but neutrophil recovery was significantly delayed (relative risk, 0.49; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.58; P<0.001). The incidence of chronic GVHD, transplantation-related mortality, relapse rate, and leukemia-free survival were not significantly different in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Cord blood from an unrelated donor is an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for adults with acute leukemia who lack an HLA-matched bone marrow donor.","['Rocha, Vanderson', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Arcese, William', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Jacobsen, Niels', 'Ruutu, Tapani', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Frassoni, Francesco', 'Gluckman, Eliane']","['Rocha V', 'Labopin M', 'Sanz G', 'Arcese W', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Bosi A', 'Jacobsen N', 'Ruutu T', 'de Lima M', 'Finke J', 'Frassoni F', 'Gluckman E']","['Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris and Paris University, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/immunology/transplantation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors']",2004/11/27 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['351/22/2276 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa041469 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2004 Nov 25;351(22):2276-85. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa041469.,"['Acute Leukemia Working Party of European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group', 'Eurocord-Netcord Registry']","['N Engl J Med. 2004 Nov 25;351(22):2255-7.

METHODS: We compared the outcomes of the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from unrelated donors in adults with leukemia who had received cord blood that was mismatched for one HLA antigen (34 patients) or two antigens (116 patients), bone marrow that had one HLA mismatch (83 patients), and HLA-matched bone marrow (367 patients). We used Cox proportional-hazards models to analyze the data. RESULTS: Cord-blood recipients were younger and more likely to have advanced leukemia than were bone marrow recipients, and they received lower doses of nucleated cells. Hematopoietic recovery was slower with transplantation of mismatched bone marrow and cord blood than with matched marrow transplantations. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was more likely to occur after mismatched marrow transplantation, and chronic GVHD was more likely to occur after cord-blood transplantation. The rates of treatment-related mortality, treatment failure, and overall mortality were lowest among patients who received matched marrow transplants. Patients who received mismatched bone marrow transplants and those who received mismatched cord-blood transplants had similar rates of treatment-related mortality (P=0.96), treatment failure (P=0.69), and overall mortality (P=0.62). There were no differences in the rate of recurrence of leukemia among the groups. There were no differences in outcome after cord-blood transplantation between patients with one HLA mismatch and those with two HLA mismatches.

In this study, we postulated that mechanisms directing the recruitment of deacetylases to the BLV 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) could explain the transcriptional repression of viral expression in vivo. Accordingly, we showed that BLV promoter activity was induced by several deacetylase inhibitors (such as trichostatin A [TSA]) in the context of episomal LTR constructs and in the context of an integrated BLV provirus. Moreover, treatment of BLV-infected cells with TSA increased H4 acetylation at the viral promoter, showing a close correlation between the level of histone acetylation and transcriptional activation of the BLV LTR. Among the known cis-regulatory DNA elements located in the 5' LTR, three E box motifs overlapping cyclic AMP responsive elements (CREs) in U3 were shown to be involved in transcriptional repression of BLV basal gene expression. Importantly, the combined mutations of these three E box motifs markedly reduced the inducibility of the BLV promoter by TSA. E boxes are susceptible to recognition by transcriptional repressors such as Max-Mad-mSin3 complexes that repress transcription by recruiting deacetylases. However, our in vitro binding studies failed to reveal the presence of Mad-Max proteins in the BLV LTR E box-specific complexes. Remarkably, TSA increased the occupancy of the CREs by CREB/ATF. Therefore, we postulated that the E box-specific complexes exerted their negative cooperative effect on BLV transcription by steric hindrance with the activators CREB/ATF and/or their transcriptional coactivators possessing acetyltransferase activities. Our results thus suggest that the overlapping CRE and E box elements in the BLV LTR were selected during evolution as a novel strategy for BLV to allow better silencing of viral transcription and to escape from the host immune response.","['Calomme, Claire', 'Dekoninck, Ann', 'Nizet, Severine', 'Adam, Emmanuelle', 'Nguyen, Thi Lien-Anh', 'Van Den Broeke, Anne', 'Willems, Luc', 'Kettmann, Richard', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Van Lint, Carine']","['Calomme C', 'Dekoninck A', 'Nizet S', 'Adam E', 'Nguyen TL', 'Van Den Broeke A', 'Willems L', 'Kettmann R', 'Burny A', 'Van Lint C']","['Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Institut de Biologie et de Medecine Moleculaires (IBMM), Service de Chimie Biologique, Laboratoire de Virologie Moleculaire, Rue des Profs Jeener et Brachet, 12, 6041 Gosselies, Belgium.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Acetylation', 'Activating Transcription Factors', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Sheep', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Latency']",2004/11/27 09:00,2004/12/24 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['78/24/13848 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.78.24.13848-13864.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Dec;78(24):13848-64. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.24.13848-13864.2004.,,,,PMC533944,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These viruses use distinct cell surface proteins as receptors to gain entry into avian cells. Chickens have evolved resistance to infection by the ASLVs. We have identified the mutations responsible for the block to virus entry in chicken lines resistant to infection by subgroup A ASLVs [ASLV(A)]. The tva genetic locus determines the susceptibility of chicken cells to ASLV(A) viruses. In quail, the ASLV(A) susceptibility allele tva(s) encodes two forms of the Tva receptor; these proteins are translated from alternatively spliced mRNAs. The normal cellular function of the Tva receptor is unknown; however, the extracellular domain contains a 40-amino-acid, cysteine-rich region that is homologous to the ligand binding region of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) proteins. The chicken tva(s) cDNAs had not yet been fully characterized; we cloned the chicken tva cDNAs from two lines of subgroup A-susceptible chickens, line H6 and line 0. Two types of chicken tva(s) cDNAs were obtained. These cDNAs encode a longer and shorter form of the Tva receptor homologous to the Tva forms in quail. Two different defects were identified in cDNAs cloned from two different ASLV(A)-resistant inbred chickens, line C and line 7(2). Line C tva(r) contains a single base pair substitution, resulting in a cysteine-to-tryptophan change in the LDLR-like region of Tva. This mutation drastically reduces the binding affinity of Tva(R) for the ASLV(A) envelope glycoproteins. Line 7(2) tva(r2) contains a 4-bp insertion in exon 1 that causes a change in the reading frame, which blocks expression of the Tva receptor.","['Elleder, Daniel', 'Melder, Deborah C', 'Trejbalova, Katerina', 'Svoboda, Jan', 'Federspiel, Mark J']","['Elleder D', 'Melder DC', 'Trejbalova K', 'Svoboda J', 'Federspiel MJ']","['Department of Cellular and Viral Genetics, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague.']",['eng'],"['GENBANK/AY531258', 'GENBANK/AY531259', 'GENBANK/AY531260', 'GENBANK/AY531261', 'GENBANK/AY531262']","['R01 AI048682/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI48682/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Tva receptor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Avian Proteins', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens/*immunology/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Quail', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Avian/immunology/virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2004/11/27 09:00,2004/12/24 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['78/24/13489 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.78.24.13489-13500.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Dec;78(24):13489-500. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.24.13489-13500.2004.,,,,PMC533904,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the first time, ghrelin and GHS-R 1b, a truncated variant of the receptor resulting from alternative splicing, but not GHS-R 1a, mRNAs were detected in the human erythroleukemic cell line HEL. Two antibodies, used for RIA, were directed against octanoylated and total (octanoylated and desoctanoylated) ghrelin, and the recognized epitopes were characterized. Using reverse phase HPLC analysis followed by RIA, we demonstrated that octanoylated and desoctanoylated ghrelins were present in HEL cells and their culture medium, of which more than 90% was octanoylated. The ghrelin levels were not affected after 24 h treatment with sodium butyrate, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or forskolin, but a significant 3-fold increase in desoctanoylated ghrelin was detected in the culture medium after 48 h treatment with sodium butyrate. The antighrelin SB801 and SB969 antisera inhibited HEL cell proliferation by 24% and 39%, respectively, after 72 h. Taken together, these data suggested that endogenous ghrelin stimulated HEL cell proliferation by an autocrine pathway involving an unidentified receptor, distinct from GHS-R1a, and that the HEL cell line represents a unique model to study the octanoylation of ghrelin.","['De Vriese, Carine', 'Gregoire, Francoise', 'De Neef, Philippe', 'Robberecht, Patrick', 'Delporte, Christine']","['De Vriese C', 'Gregoire F', 'De Neef P', 'Robberecht P', 'Delporte C']","['Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Bat G/E, CP 611, 808 route de Lennik, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041124,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Ghrelin)', '0 (Peptide Hormones)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7G33012534 (Sodium Oxybate)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.8 (Butyrylcholinesterase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies/chemistry', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Butyrylcholinesterase/metabolism', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ghrelin', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Hormones/*biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Peptides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sodium Oxybate/chemistry', 'Time Factors']",2004/11/27 09:00,2005/04/05 09:00,['2004/11/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2004-0964 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2004-0964 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2005 Mar;146(3):1514-22. doi: 10.1210/en.2004-0964.

Previous studies indicate the importance of these viral proteins in the ability of the virus to maintain viral loads and persist in an animal model of HTLV-1 infection. Intriguing new studies indicate that p30II is a multifunctional regulator that differentially modulates CREB and Tax-responsive element-mediated transcription through its interaction with CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 and specifically binds and represses tax/rex mRNA nuclear export. A new study characterized the role of p30II in regulation of cellular gene expression using comprehensive human gene arrays. Interestingly, p30II is an overall repressor of cellular gene expression, while selectively favoring the expression of regulatory gene pathways important to T lymphocytes. These new findings suggest that HTLV-1, which is associated with lymphoproliferative diseases, uses p30II to selectively repress cellular and viral gene expression to favor the survival of cellular targets ultimately resulting in leukemogenesis.","['Green, Patrick L']",['Green PL'],"['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. green.466@osu.edu']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20041124,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,['EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CREB-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HTLV-I Infections/*physiopathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Load']",2004/11/26 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/11/26 09:00'],"['2004/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-1-40 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-1-40 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 Nov 24;1:40. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-40.,,,,PMC543446,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the precise mechanism of action is not known, tumors in animals exposed to EO are presumed to result from its genotoxicity. The overall weight of evidence for carcinogenicity from a large body of epidemiological data in the published literature remains limited. There is some evidence for an association between EO exposure and lympho/hematopoietic cancer mortality. Of these cancers, the evidence provided by two large cohorts with the longest follow-up is most consistent for leukemia. Together with what is known about human leukemia and EO at the molecular level, there is a body of evidence that supports a plausible mode of action for EO as a potential leukemogen. Based on a consideration of the mode of action, the events leading from EO exposure to the development of leukemia (and therefore risk) are expected to be proportional to the square of the dose. In support of this hypothesis, a quadratic dose-response model provided the best overall fit to the epidemiology data in the range of observation. Cancer dose-response assessments based on human and animal data are presented using three different assumptions for extrapolating to low doses: (1) risk is linearly proportionate to dose; (2) there is no appreciable risk at low doses (margin-of-exposure or reference dose approach); and (3) risk below the point of departure continues to be proportionate to the square of the dose. The weight of evidence for EO supports the use of a nonlinear assessment. Therefore, exposures to concentrations below 37 microg/m3 are not likely to pose an appreciable risk of leukemia in human populations. However, if quantitative estimates of risk at low doses are desired and the mode of action for EO is considered, these risks are best quantified using the quadratic estimates of cancer potency, which are approximately 3.2- to 32-fold lower, using alternative points of departure, than the linear estimates of cancer potency for EO. An approach is described for linking the selection of an appropriate point of departure to the confidence in the proposed mode of action. Despite high confidence in the proposed mode of action, a small linear component for the dose-response relationship at low concentrations cannot be ruled out conclusively. Accordingly, a unit risk value of 4.5 x 10(-8) (microg/m3)(-1) was derived for EO, with a range of unit risk values of 1.4 x 10(-8) to 1.4 x 10(-7) (microg/m3)(-1) reflecting the uncertainty associated with a theoretical linear term at low concentrations.","['Kirman, C R', 'Sweeney, L M', 'Teta, M J', 'Sielken, R L', 'Valdez-Flores, C', 'Albertini, R J', 'Gargas, M L']","['Kirman CR', 'Sweeney LM', 'Teta MJ', 'Sielken RL', 'Valdez-Flores C', 'Albertini RJ', 'Gargas ML']","['The Sapphire Group, Inc., Cleveland, OH 44122, USA. crk@thesapphiregroup.com']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethylene Oxide/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Rats', 'Risk Assessment']",2004/11/26 09:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/11/26 09:00'],"['2004/11/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['RISK517 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00517.x [doi]']",ppublish,Risk Anal. 2004 Oct;24(5):1165-83. doi: 10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00517.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The database search was finished with the Mascot search engine (http://www.matrixscience.co.uk) using the data processed through MaxEnt3 and MasSeq. RESULTS: The two proteins were not revealed by peptide mass fingerprint using MALDI-TOF-MS, while they were respectively identified as Destrin and Putative protein after the sequence of their trypic peptides were obtained by the nano-ESI-MS/MS techniques.

Distal radial trabecular BMD (difference, -0.080 mg/cm(3); 95% confidence interval, -0.139 to -0.020; P = 0.009), but not total BMD (difference, -0.006 mg/cm(3); confidence interval, -0.051 to 0.039; P = 0.80), was lower in ALL survivors compared with controls.

Single-stranded DNA and RNA aptamers can be used for low resolution imaging of cellular receptors and cytoplasmic proteins by light microscopy (LM). These techniques, however, cannot be applied to the imaging of nuclear antigens as these single-stranded aptamers bind endogenous RNA and DNA with high affinity. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel method for the in situ detection of proteins using double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. To demonstrate this system we have utilized the prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins LacI and TetR as peptide tags to image fusion proteins in situ using dsDNA oligonucleotides encoding either the Lac or Tet operator. Using fluorescent and fluorogold dsDNA oligonucleotides, we localized within the nucleus a TetR-PML fusion protein within promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) bodies by LM and a LacI-SC35 fusion protein within nuclear speckles by correlative light and electron microscopy (LM/EM). Isolation of LacI-SC35 was also accomplished by using biotinylated dsDNA and streptavidin sepharose. The use of dsDNA oligonucleotides should complement existing aptamer in situ detection techniques by allowing the multiple detection and localization of nuclear proteins in situ and at high resolution.","['Dellaire, Graham', 'Nisman, Rozalia', 'Eskiw, Christopher H', 'Bazett-Jones, David P']","['Dellaire G', 'Nisman R', 'Eskiw CH', 'Bazett-Jones DP']","['Programme in Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 1X8.']",['eng'],,,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041123,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', '*Microscopy', 'Microscopy, Energy-Filtering Transmission Electron', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis/*isolation & purification', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*chemistry', 'Operator Regions, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics']",2004/11/25 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['32/20/e165 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gnh164 [doi]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Nov 23;32(20):e165. doi: 10.1093/nar/gnh164.,,,,PMC534643,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation with CD40L+interleukin 4 (IL-4) induces CSR, the presence of AID transcripts, up-regulation of Pax-5a and down-regulation of Pax-5/Delta-Ex8, and Id-2 and prdm-1 transcripts. Pax-5a and Pax-5/Delta-Ex8 are translated into 2 isoforms of the B-cell-specific activator protein (BSAP) and both are able to bind the AID-promoter region. Overall, these results suggest that Pax-5/Delta-Ex8 could play an important role in the control of its own transcription and indirectly in AID expression and CSR.","['Oppezzo, Pablo', 'Dumas, Gerard', 'Lalanne, Ana Ines', 'Payelle-Brogard, Beatrice', 'Magnac, Christian', 'Pritsch, Otto', 'Dighiero, Guillaume', 'Vuillier, Francoise']","['Oppezzo P', 'Dumas G', 'Lalanne AI', 'Payelle-Brogard B', 'Magnac C', 'Pritsch O', 'Dighiero G', 'Vuillier F']","[""Unite d'Immuno-hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, 28 Rue Docteur Roux, 75015 Paris, France. poppezzo@pasteur.fr""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041123,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ID2 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/*immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*immunology/metabolism', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Protein Isoforms/immunology/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion/immunology', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/11/25 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2004/11/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45757-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3644 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 15;105(6):2495-503. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3644.

Substantial evidence supports the hypothesis that the t(14;18) and Bcl-2 overexpression are necessary but not solely responsible for neoplastic transformation and require cooperating genetic derangements for neoplastic transformation to occur. To investigate genes that cooperate with Bcl-2 to influence cellular signaling pathways important for neoplastic transformation, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to determine differential gene expression patterns in CD19+ B cells isolated from Emu-Bcl-2 transgenic mice and wild-type littermate control mice. Fifty-seven genes were induced and 94 genes were repressed by > or =2-fold in Emu-Bcl-2 transgenic mice (P < 0.05). The suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) gene was found to be overexpressed 5-fold in B cells from Emu-Bcl-2 transgenic mice. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in both mouse embryo fibroblast-1 and hematopoietic cell lines resulted in induction of SOCS3 protein, suggesting a Bcl-2-associated mechanism underlying SOCS3 induction. Immunohistochemistry with SOCS3 antisera on tissue from a cohort of patients with de novo follicular lymphoma revealed marked overexpression of SOCS3 protein that, within the follicular center cell region, was limited to neoplastic follicular lymphoma cells and colocalized with Bcl-2 expression in 9 of 12 de novo follicular lymphoma cases examined. In contrast, SOCS3 protein expression was not detected in the follicular center cell region of benign hyperplastic tonsil tissue. These data suggest that Bcl-2 overexpression leads to the induction of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and to the induction of SOCS3, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma.","['Vanasse, Gary J', 'Winn, Robert K', 'Rodov, Sofya', 'Zieske, Arthur W', 'Li, John T', 'Tupper, Joan C', 'Tang, Jingjing', 'Raines, Elaine W', 'Peters, Mette A', 'Yeung, Ka Yee', 'Harlan, John M']","['Vanasse GJ', 'Winn RK', 'Rodov S', 'Zieske AW', 'Li JT', 'Tupper JC', 'Tang J', 'Raines EW', 'Peters MA', 'Yeung KY', 'Harlan JM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, WWW-403, Box 208021, New Haven, CT 06520, USA. gary.vanasse@yale.edu']",['eng'],,"['5U24DK058813-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78254/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Silencing/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Palatine Tonsil/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics']",2004/11/25 09:00,2005/04/01 09:00,['2004/11/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['2/11/620 [pii]'],ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2004 Nov;2(11):620-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A yeast one-hybrid screen showed that a longer isoform of gut-enriched Kruppel-like factor 4 (GKLF) we term GKLFa interacts with the CD11d promoter. Purified GST-GKLFa protein was shown to bind within the -61 to -44 region that overlaps a binding site for the CD11d transcriptional activators Sp1 and transforming growth factor beta-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1). Transfection of GKLF/GKLFa in myeloid cells reduced CD11d promoter activity, whereas, down-regulation of GKLF/GKLFa with small interfering RNAs led to up-regulation of CD11d expression. Differentiation of myeloid cells with phorbol ester led to activation of the CD11d promoter and reduced occupancy of the promoter by GKLF/GKLFa but an increased occupancy by TIEG1 in vivo. Binding of GKLF/GKLFa, Sp1, and TIEG1 to the CD11d promoter in vivo is dependent on their zinc finger DNA binding domains. GKLFa physically associates with the histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1 and 2, and both HDACs are bound to the CD11d promoter in vivo but released after exposure of myeloid cells to phorbol ester suggesting that GKLF/GKLFa recruits HDACs to effect repression.","['Noti, John D', 'Johnson, Andrew K', 'Dillon, Jill D']","['Noti JD', 'Johnson AK', 'Dillon JD']","['Guthrie Foundation for Education and Research, Sayre, Pennsylvania 18840, USA. noti_john@guthrie.org']",['eng'],,['R01 HL63891/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041123,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ITGAD protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD11 Antigens/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha Chains/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Myeloid Cells/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Teratocarcinoma', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/11/25 09:00,2005/03/23 09:00,['2004/11/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)76210-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M412627200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Feb 4;280(5):3449-57. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M412627200.

To determine the role of phosphorylation in BLT1 regulation, we generated mutants of BLT1 in which all of the serine/threonine residues in the C-tail are converted to alanine or to aspartate/glutamate. These mutants expressed in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells bound LTB4 with similar affinity and activated all of the known functional activities of BLT1, albeit at different levels. The conversion of phosphorylation sites to alanine resulted in enhanced G-protein-mediated activities, whereas conversion to aspartate/glutamate resulted in reduced responses and a right shift in dose response, indicating that receptor phosphorylation is a critical regulator of G-protein-mediated pathways. Surprisingly, translocation of beta-arrestin and receptor internalization was completely independent of BLT1 phosphorylation. Real-time analysis of beta-arrestin translocation and receptor internalization using digital fluorescence video microscopy in cells expressing a red fluorescent protein labeled BLT1 and a green fluorescent protein-tagged beta-arrestin confirmed phosphorylation-independent beta-arrestin translocation and internalization of BLT1. In beta-arrestin-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, the BLT1 receptors failed to display endosomal localization upon stimulation. In these cells, co-expression of beta-arrestin-green fluorescent protein with BLT1-red fluorescent protein resulted in co-localization of BLT1 and beta-arrestin upon activation. Thus, receptor phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms regulate G-protein-mediated pathways; however, phosphorylation-independent mechanisms regulate beta-arrestin association and internalization of BLT1.","['Jala, Venkatakrishna R', 'Shao, Wen-Hai', 'Haribabu, Bodduluri']","['Jala VR', 'Shao WH', 'Haribabu B']","['James Graham Brown Cancer Center and The Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Louisville Health Sciences Center, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.']",['eng'],,"['AI-43184/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-52381/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041123,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arrestins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene B4)', '0 (beta-Arrestins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alanine/chemistry', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arrestins/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Leukotriene B4/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'beta-Arrestins', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2004/11/25 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2004/11/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)76140-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M409821200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Feb 11;280(6):4880-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M409821200.

As our knowledge of the molecular basis of FL increases, we strive for an integration between the bench and clinic that yields treatments based on our scientific understanding and biomarkers that allow us to prescribe treatment rationally. In Section I, Dr. Randy Gascoyne describes the histologic, cytogenetic and biologic features of FL that underlie its clinical variability. Key aspects of the pathologic diagnosis of FL that have particular relevance to the clinician are highlighted. A proposed model for follicular lymphomagenesis and diffuse large B cell lymphoma transformation has emerged and continues to evolve as the molecular story unfolds. A biologic basis for clinical outcome in FL also appears to be forthcoming. In Section II, Dr. Jane Winter addresses the complex process of selecting among the many treatment options for patients with FL. Previously a simple matter of deciding between oral or intravenous alkylators, clinicians and patients must now struggle to choose among vastly different approaches ranging from ""watch and wait"" to stem cell transplantation. The introduction of rituximab and radioimmunoconjugates is changing the treatment paradigm, but the optimal approach to integrating these and other new agents remains to be determined. At every decision point, the best approach is always a clinical trial. In Section III, Dr. Koen Van Besien provides a well-documented update on outcomes associated with autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation for FL. The results of trials of autologous stem cell transplantation in first remission and recent data supporting a role for graft purging are discussed. Based on the premise that a graft-versus-lymphoma effect is operative in FL, reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation is the preferred approach in many cases, and recently reported results are summarized. Criteria for patient selection and the optimal role of transplantation in the overall therapeutic plan for the patient with FL are presented.","['Winter, Jane N', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Van Besien, Koen']","['Winter JN', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Van Besien K']","['Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Div. of Hematology/Oncology, Chicago, IL 6061-4538, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

For many years patients with CLL have been viewed as similar, with a long natural history and only marginally effective therapies that rarely yielded complete responses. Recently, several important observations related to the biologic significance of V(H) mutational status and associated ZAP-70 overexpression, disrupted p53 function, and chromosomal aberrations have led to the ability to identify patients at high risk for early disease progression and inferior survival. Concurrent with these investigations, several treatments including the nucleoside analogues, monoclonal antibodies rituximab and alemtuzumab have been introduced. Combination of these therapies in clinical trials has led to high complete and overall response rates when applied as initial therapy for symptomatic CLL. Thus, the complexity of initial risk stratification of CLL and treatment has increased significantly. Furthermore, when these initial therapies do not work, approach of the CLL patient with fludarabine-refractory disease can be quite challenging. This session will describe the natural history of a CLL patient with emphasis on important decision junctures at different time points in the disease. In Section I, Dr. Stephan Stilgenbauer focuses on the discussion that occurs with CLL patients at their initial evaluation. This includes a review of the diagnostic criteria for CLL and prognostic factors utilized to predict the natural history of the disease. The later discussion of risk stratification focuses on molecular and genomic aberrations that predict rapid progression, poor response to therapy, and inferior survival. Ongoing and future efforts examining early intervention strategies in high risk CLL are reviewed. In Section II, Drs. Ian Flinn and Jesus G. Berdeja focus on the discussion of CLL patients when symptomatic disease has developed. This includes an updated review of monotherapy trials with nucleoside analogs and recent trials that have combined these with monoclonal antibodies and/or alternative chemotherapy agents. Appropriate application of more aggressive therapies such as autologous and allogeneic immunotherapy and less aggressive treatments for appropriate CLL patient candidates are discussed. In Section III, Dr. John Byrd focuses on the discussion that occurs with CLL patients whose disease is refractory to fludarabine. The application of genetic risk stratification in choosing therapy for this subset of patients is reviewed. Available data with conventional combination based therapies and monoclonal antibodies are discussed.

With contemporary improved risk assessment, chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and supportive care, approximately 80% of children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 50% of those with myeloid neoplasm can be cured to date. Current emphasis is placed not only on increased cure rate but also on improved quality of life. In Section I, Dr. Ching-Hon Pui describes certain clinical and biologic features that still have prognostic and therapeutic relevance in the context of contemporary treatment programs. He emphasizes that treatment failure in some patients is not due to intrinsic drug resistance of leukemic cells but is rather caused by suboptimal drug dosing due to host compliance, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics. Hence, measurement of minimal residual disease, which accounts for both the genetic (primary and secondary) features of leukemic lymphoblasts and pharmacogenomic variables of the host, is the most reliable prognostic indicator. Finally, he contends that with optimal risk-directed systemic and intrathecal therapy, cranial irradiation may be omitted in all patients, regardless of the presenting features. In Section II, Dr. Martin Schrappe performs detailed analyses of the prognostic impact of presenting age, leukocyte count, sex, immunophenotype, genetic abnormality, early treatment response, and in vitro drug sensitivity/resistance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, based on the large database of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster consortium. He also succinctly summarizes the important treatment components resulting in the improved outcome of children and young adolescents with this disease. He describes the treatment approach that led to the improved outcome of adolescent patients, a finding that may be applied to young adults in the second and third decade of life. Finally, he believes that treatment reduction under well-controlled clinical trials is feasible in a subgroup of patients with excellent early treatment response as evidenced by minimal residual disease measurement during induction and consolidation therapy.

The finding of essentially identical gene expression profiling by DNA microarray in certain specific genetic subtypes of childhood and adult acute myeloid leukemia suggests a shared leukemogenesis. He then describes the principles of treatment as well as the efficacy and toxicity of various forms of postremission therapy, emphasizing the need of tailoring therapy to both the disease and the age of the patient. Early results suggest that minimal residual disease measurement can also improve the risk assessment in acute myeloid leukemia, and that cranial irradiation can be omitted even in those with central-nervous-system leukemia at diagnosis. In Section IV, Dr. Charlotte Niemeyer describes a new classification of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative diseases in childhood, which has greatly facilitated the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The recent discovery of somatic mutations in PTPN11 has improved the understanding of the pathobiology and the diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Together with the findings of mutations in RAS and NF1 in the other patients, she suggests that pathological activation of RAS-dependent pathways plays a central role in the leukemogenesis of this disease. She then describes the various treatment approaches for both juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in the US and Europe, emphasizing the differences between childhood and adult cases for the latter group of diseases. She also raises some controversial issues regarding treatment that will require well-controlled international clinical trials to address.","['Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M']","['Pui CH', 'Schrappe M', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Niemeyer CM']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Only about one-third of those between ages 18-60 who are diagnosed with AML can be cured; disease-free survival is rare and current therapy devastating in older adults. In this chapter, challenges in the management of the adult with AML are discussed, including ongoing questions concerning the optimal choice of induction and postremission therapy such as the rationale for and role of allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation in a variety of settings, the special considerations pertaining to the older patient, and the development of new, so-called targeted therapies. In Section I, Dr. Richard Stone reviews state-of the-art therapy in AML in the era of change from a morphological to a genetically based classification system. Questions being addressed in ongoing randomized cooperative group trials include anthracycline dose during induction, the efficacy of drug-resistance modulators, and the utility of pro-apoptotic agents such as the anti-bcl-2 antisense oligonucloetide. Developmental therapeutics in AML include drug resistance modulation, anti-angiogenic strategies, immunotherapy, and signal transduction-active agents, particularly the farnesyl transferase inhibitors as well as those molecules that inhibit the FLT3 tyrosine kinase, activated via mutation in 30% of patients. In Section II Dr. Margaret O'Donnell discusses the role of stem cell transplantation in AML. Several advances including expanded donor pools, the movement toward peripheral blood stem cell collection, newer immunosuppressive drugs and antifungals, and particularly the advent of nonmyeloablative transplant have made the allogeneic option more viable. The subset-specific role for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support and/or for allogeneic transplant in AML patients in first remission is outlined. Although preconceived notions about the role of transplant abound, the clinical data supporting a risk-adapted approach are covered. Finally, guidance concerning the use of nonmyeloablative or reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation is provided. In Section III Dr. Mikkael Sekeres reviews the approach to the older patient with AML. Unique biological and therapeutic considerations make AML in this age group a vastly different disease than that in younger adults. The outcome data, including the role of specific anthracylines, hematopoietic growth factors, and drug-resistance modulators, are summarized. Communicating with older adults with AML and their families regarding selection of the optimal treatment strategy, often a stark choice between induction chemotherapy and palliative care, is covered.","['Stone, Richard M', ""O'Donnell, Margaret R"", 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Stone RM', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Sekeres MA']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston MA 02115-6084, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

More than one hundred disease alleles have been identified and characterized in cell culture and murine models of leukemia. In some instances, molecularly targeted therapies have been developed based on these insights that are currently in clinical trials, such as small molecule inhibitors of FLT3. In addition, it has recently been appreciated that, as with normal hematopoiesis, there is a hierarchical organization among leukemic cells that includes a rare population of leukemic stem cells that have properties of self-renewal. Understanding the characteristics of these leukemic stem cells may provide new insights into leukemia therapies that target self-renewal pathways. In Section I, Dr. Craig Jordan reviews the data that supports the existence of a ""leukemia stem cell."" He provides an overview of the functional properties of leukemic stem cells, their relationship to hematopoietic stem cells, and the relevance of leukemic stem cells in other human malignancies including solid tumors. He briefly discusses what is known of the pathways that regulate properties of self-renewal. Dr. Gary Gilliland provides an overview of the genetics of adult leukemias in Section II and ongoing genome-wide strategies for discovery of new disease alleles. He describes the clinical and therapeutic implications of these findings and provides examples of bench-to-bedside translation of molecularly targeted therapies for AML, including the use of FLT3 inhibitors. In Section III, Dr. Carolyn Felix reviews recent advances in our understanding of the genetics and therapy of pediatric leukemias. She provides an overview of leukemias that are common in pediatric malignancies but rarely observed in adults, including the TEL-AML1 (ETV6-RUNX1) fusion associated with pediatric B-cell ALL, the OTT-MAL fusion associated with infant megakaryoblastic leukemia, PTPN11 mutations in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and MLL fusion genes in leukemogenesis, among others.","['Gilliland, D Gary', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Felix, Carolyn A']","['Gilliland DG', 'Jordan CT', 'Felix CA']","[""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['CA77683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

New ground-breaking observations have identified the genes responsible for many of the congenital neutropenia syndromes and are also providing new insights into normal neutrophil commitment and differentiation. Acquired neutropenia remains a poorly understood syndrome, although new insights into its pathogenesis are also emerging, especially with regard to subsets of immune neutropenia. In Section I, Dr. Marshall Horwitz reviews the current understanding of the genetic basis, molecular pathology, and approaches to treatment of congenital neutropenia and cyclic hematopoiesis. Mutations in the ELA2 gene, which encodes for neutrophil elastase, cause cyclic hematopoiesis. ELA2 mutations are also the most common cause of congenital neutropenia, where their presence may equate with a more severe clinical course and higher frequency of leukemic progression. Emerging evidence indicates interrelatedness with Hermansky Pudlak syndrome and other disorders of neutrophil and platelet granules. In Section II, Dr. Nancy Berliner presents an overview of the clinical approach to the evaluation and treatment of acquired neutropenia. This includes a review of the pathogenesis of primary and secondary immune neutropenia, drug-induced neutropenia, and non-immune chronic idiopathic neutropenia of adults. Studies used to evaluate patients for potential immune neutropenia are reviewed. Management issues, especially the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), are discussed. In Section III, Dr. Thomas Loughran, Jr., reviews the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. Possible mechanisms of neutropenia are discussed. In particular, discussion focuses on the relationship between LGL leukemia, rheumatoid disease, and Felty's syndrome, and the complex interplay of defects in neutrophil production, distribution, destruction, and apoptosis that underly the development of neutropenia in those syndromes.","['Berliner, Nancy', 'Horwitz, Marshall', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Berliner N', 'Horwitz M', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Yale University School of Medicine, Section of Hematology, New Haven, CT 06510, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

HTLV-1 contains both regulatory and accessory genes in four pX open reading frames. pX ORF-II encodes two proteins, p13II and p30II, which are incompletely defined in the virus life cycle or HTLV-1 pathogenesis. Proviral clones of the virus with pX ORF-II mutations diminish the ability of the virus to maintain viral loads in vivo. Exogenous expression of p30II differentially modulates CREB and Tax-responsive element-mediated transcription through its interaction with CREB-binding protein/p300 and represses tax/rex RNA nuclear export. RESULTS: Herein, we further characterized the role of p30II in regulation of cellular gene expression, using stable p30II expression system employing lentiviral vectors to test cellular gene expression with Affymetrix U133A arrays, representing approximately 33,000 human genes. Reporter assays in Jurkat T cells and RT-PCR in Jurkat and primary CD4+ T-lymphocytes were used to confirm selected gene expression patterns. Our data reveals alterations of interrelated pathways of cell proliferation, T-cell signaling, apoptosis and cell cycle in p30II expressing Jurkat T cells. In all categories, p30II appeared to be an overall repressor of cellular gene expression, while selectively increasing the expression of certain key regulatory genes. CONCLUSIONS: We are the first to demonstrate that p30II, while repressing the expression of many genes, selectively activates key gene pathways involved in T-cell signaling/activation. Collectively, our data suggests that this complex retrovirus, associated with lymphoproliferative diseases, relies upon accessory gene products to modify cellular environment to promote clonal expansion of the virus genome and thus maintain proviral loads in vivo.","['Michael, Bindhu', 'Nair, Amrithraj M', 'Hiraragi, Hajime', 'Shen, Lei', 'Feuer, Gerold', 'Boris-Lawrie, Kathleen', 'Lairmore, Michael D']","['Michael B', 'Nair AM', 'Hiraragi H', 'Shen L', 'Feuer G', 'Boris-Lawrie K', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. bindhu_michael@merck.com']",['eng'],,"['CA-70529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041123,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/virology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/11/25 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/11/25 09:00'],"['2004/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-1-39 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-1-39 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 Nov 23;1:39. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-39.,,,,PMC538277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, the toxicological properties of these dipyridyl isomers in humans and animals are reviewed. Epidemiological studies suggest that cancerous skin lesions in workers involved in the manufacturing of paraquat may be associated with exposure to dipyridyl compounds. Experimental animal studies suggest that dipyridyl isomers may have several toxicological effects. Three of the dipyridyl isomers (the 2,2', 2,4', and 4,4' isomers) appear to be inducers of some metabolic enzymes. The 2,2'-dipyridyl isomer, an iron chelator, appears to influence vasospasm in primate models of stroke. The cytotoxic effects of 2,2'-dipyridyl on several leukemia cell lines have been reported, and a potent teratogenic effect of 2,2'-dipyridyl has been observed in rats. Based on the results of paraquat studies in experimental animal models, it has been proposed that paraquat may have deleterious effects on dopaminergic neurons. These findings support the epidemiological evidence that paraquat exposure may be associated with the development of Parkinson's disease. Studies designed to determine an association between paraquat exposure and Parkinson's disease are complicated by the possibility that metabolic changes may influence the neurotoxicity of paraquat and/or its metabolites. Preliminary unpublished data in mice show that 300-mg/kg doses of 2,2'-dipyridyl are neurotoxic, and 300-mg/kg doses of 2,4'- and 4,4'-dipyridyls are lethal. These results are consistent with earlier studies in Sherman rats using high 2,2'- and 4,4'-dipyridyl doses. New studies are needed to further explore the toxicological properties of dipyridyls and their potential public health impact.","['Li, Shenggang', 'Crooks, Peter A', 'Wei, Xiaochen', 'de Leon, Jose']","['Li S', 'Crooks PA', 'Wei X', 'de Leon J']","['University of Kentucky Mental Health Research Center at Eastern State Hospital, Lexington, Kentucky 40508, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Teratogens)', ""551W113ZEP (2,2'-Dipyridyl)"", 'PLG39H7695 (Paraquat)']",IM,"[""2,2'-Dipyridyl/chemistry/toxicity"", 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/chemistry/toxicity', 'Chelating Agents/chemistry/toxicity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isomerism', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Paraquat/chemistry/toxicity', 'Parkinson Disease, Secondary/chemically induced', 'Pyridines/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Teratogens/chemistry/toxicity']",2004/11/25 09:00,2005/02/25 09:00,['2004/11/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408440490503143 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2004 Sep-Oct;34(5):447-60. doi: 10.1080/10408440490503143.,,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Bone marrow samples were obtained by trephine biopsy from 46 patients with B-cell CLL (B-CLL). Infiltration pattern was diffuse in 20 patients and nondiffuse--i.e., nodular, interstitial or mixed--in the remaining 26 patients. Ten normal bone marrow samples were used as a control group. Studies were carried out by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded bone marrow samples. Angiogenesis was assessed in the zones of highest vascular density (hot spots), visualized by the expression of endothelial antigen CD34 and expressed as a number of microvessels per high-powerfield (hpf) (final magnification, 400x). Proliferative activity was estimated by the expression of nuclear protein Ki-67, cyclin A and mean number of nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). RESULTS: Microvessel density was higher in B-CLL marrow than in normal marrow (30.1 and 16.44 per hpf, respectively) and was higher in the diffuse than nondiffuse pattern (33.6 and 27.5 per hpf, respectively). B-CLL bone marrow also showed higher proliferative activity, as assessed by mean number of AgNORs, than did normal marrow (1.52 and 1.25, respectively) and a higher mean percentage of cyclin A-positive cells (7.5 and 6.8, respectively). In contrast, mean Ki-67 expression was similar in B-CLL and the control group.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a stem cell disorder characterized by an overproduction of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow that eventually spill into circulation, producing lymphocytosis. As with the other acute leukemias, the most common symptoms experienced by patients include fatigue, bleeding, and recurrent infections resulting from the suppression of normal hematopoiesis in the bone marrow by the accumulating blasts. ALL primarily affects children and exhibits the best response to standard chemotherapy as compared to acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML). Further, remission rates are highest among ALL patients, many of whom are experiencing sustained remissions suggesting cure. In light of early treatment successes, researchers began to investigate modifications of standard treatment regimens to accommodate variability in weight, age, and response to therapy among children with ALL. Individualized treatment plans were implemented where some patients received a reduced intensity course of therapy to minimize drug toxicity while others received drug intensification to maximize response. More recently, research efforts have been directed at the elucidation of leukemogenic mechanisms implicated in ALL to identify specific protein mutants that can be used to design drugs tailored to interfere with the activity of these mutant protein targets. Identification of chimeric proteins produced from chromosomal translocations and gene expression profiles from microarray analyses are the primary techniques used to identify the potential therapeutic targets. CONCLUSION: Several reliable prognostic indicators have been identified and are being used to improve therapeutic planning and outcome prediction in ALL patients. Individualized treatment regimens have been developed based on the specific characteristics of each patient to minimize treatment related adverse events and maximize response. Through the use of cytogenetic, molecular, and microarray testing, ALL classification schemes have improved and potential therapeutic targets have been identified. It is anticipated that the next major advance in the treatment of ALL will involve the use of designer therapies developed to specifically interfere with particular molecular abnormalities producing the leukemogenic aberration to the normal signal transduction pathways.","['Randolph, Tim R']",['Randolph TR'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Doisy School of Allied Health Professions, Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center, St Louis, MO 63104-1111, USA.

This new estimator approximates the true variance by a Binomial variance formula, where the proportion parameter is a piecewise non-increasing function of the Kaplan-Meier survival function and its upper bound, as described below. Also, the effective sample size equals the number of subjects not censored prior to that time. In addition, we consider an adjusted hybrid variance estimator that modifies the regular estimator for small sample sizes. We present a simulation study to compare the performance of the regular and adjusted hybrid variance estimators to the Greenwood and Peto variance estimators for small sample sizes. We show that on average these hybrid variance estimators give closer variance estimates to the true values than the traditional variance estimators, and hence confidence intervals constructed with these hybrid variance estimators have more nominal coverage rates. Indeed, the Greenwood and Peto variance estimators can substantially underestimate the true variance in the left and right tails of the survival distribution, even with moderately censored data. Finally, we illustrate the use of these hybrid and traditional variance estimators on a data set from a leukaemia clinical trial.","['Borkowf, Craig B']",['Borkowf CB'],"['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Influenza Branch, Epidemiology Section, Mail Stop A32, 1600 Clifton Road NE, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.

Resistance to imatinib is currently the most important concern of this treatment. One of the main mechanisms of this resistance is overexpression of BCR-ABL. METHODS: In the current study, the authors investigated the correlation between BCR-ABL overexpression and apoptosis in BaF/BCR-ABL and LAMA84 cell lines resistant to imatinib suddenly deprived of the inhibitor, and compared with their sensitive counterpart. RESULTS: Removal of imatinib from culture medium led to a decrease in Bcr-Abl protein expression by Day 5, which was sustained for > or = 3 weeks of imatinib deprivation. Apoptosis was observed after 3 days of imatinib deprivation in resistant lines accompanied by caspase activation, loss of membrane asymmetry (annexin V staining), and alteration of mitochondrial potential (dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DiOC6]). Transient activation of the STAT5/Bcl-xL pathway and Akt kinase activity preceded these responses. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, imatinib removal led to apoptosis of BCR-ABL-overexpressing leukemic cells, a phenomenon that could be exploited to sensitize imatinib-resistant cells to the cytotoxic effect of other drugs.","['Desplat, Vanessa', 'Belloc, Francis', 'Lagarde, Valerie', 'Boyer, Catherine', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Praloran, Vincent', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Desplat V', 'Belloc F', 'Lagarde V', 'Boyer C', 'Melo JV', 'Reiffers J', 'Praloran V', 'Mahon FX']","['Laboratoire Hematopoiese normale et pathologique FRE CNRS 2617, Universite Victor Segalen, Bordeaux Cedex, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Mitochondria', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20758 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Jan 1;103(1):102-10. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20758.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: In a cross-sectional study of 31 children after treatment with the NOPHO ALL-1992 protocol peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, T- and B-cell function in vitro and serum immunoglobulins (Ig) were measured. All patients were examined once, at 1 or at 6 months after cessation of chemotherapy, immediately before vaccination with DT and Hib. RESULTS: Lymphocytes, T-cells, and CD4+ T-cells were low at 6 months after treatment. Naive T-cell subsets were more reduced than memory subsets. In the high risk (HR) ALL group, CD8+ T-cells were reduced at 6 months. NK-cells were low at 1 month, but normal at 6 months; however, the CD3+CD56+ (NKT) subset was reduced at both time points. Total B-cell number was low at 1 month, but normal at 6 months. A relative increase of CD5+ B-cells (B-1 cells) was evident, particularly in the HR group. Antigen-independent T- and B-cell function in vitro were affected at 1 month, but virtually normalized at 6 months. Serum IgM level was decreased at 1 month and IgG3 level was increased at 1 and 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that immune reconstitution after childhood ALL is slower than previously reported and emphasizes the influence of treatment intensity. The most intensively treated patients still have persistent abnormalities in T-, B-, and NK-cell subsets at 6 months post therapy and show a poor response to immunization with T-cell dependent antigens. In the HR group, routine re-immunizations before this time point are of limited benefit, and the effect of repeated vaccinations should be evaluated.","['Ek, Torben', 'Mellander, Lotta', 'Andersson, Bengt', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas']","['Ek T', 'Mellander L', 'Andersson B', 'Abrahamsson J']","['Department of Paediatrics, Goteborg University, Goteborg, Sweden. torben.ek@medfak.gu.se']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Immune System/cytology/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Regeneration', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Time Factors', '*Vaccination']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20255 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 May;44(5):461-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20255.,,,,,"['2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Newborns with DS or trisomy 21 mosaicism may exhibit a particularly unique form of leukemia that historically has been associated with a high rate of spontaneous remission. This transient leukemia (TL) has been shown to be a clonal proliferation of blast cells exhibiting megakaryocytic features. Its true incidence remains to be determined. At presentation, many infants are clinically well with only an incidental finding of abnormal blood counts and circulating blasts in the peripheral blood. However, in approximately 20% of cases, the disease is severe and life-threatening, manifesting as hydrops faetalis, multiple effusions, and liver or multi-organ system failure resulting in death. Of those children who enter a spontaneous remission, 13-33% have been found to develop subsequent acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, usually within the first 3 years of life, which if left untreated is fatal. This unique TL of the DS newborn has been the subject of recent clinical cooperative group trials as well as many biological and genetic research efforts.

Unfortunately, there is less experience with the use of 2-CdA than with FA in patients with CLL in the majority of Western countries. In the last decade we performed several phase II studies and two phase III randomized trials to evaluate the activity and toxicity of 2-CdA in previously treated and untreated patients with CLL. We have also compared the results of Polish studies with the data presented by other investigators. Similarly to FA this agent has been found to be more effective in previously untreated CLL than in patients refractory to or relapsed after conventional therapy with alkylating agents. In different studies the overall response (OR) rate ranged from 70 to 85% and complete response (CR) from 10 to 47%. Higher CR and OR rates in CLL patients treated with 2-CdA and prednisone than with chlorambucil and prednisone were confirmed in our multicenter, randomized study. Subsequently, we performed a multicenter, randomized study comparing 2-CdA alone with a combination of 2-CdA and cyclophosphamide (CC) or cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone (CMC). Our updated results seem to indicate that the CC program used as a first-line therapy in CLL gives higher CR and OR and better elimination of minimal residual disease (MRD) than 2-CdA alone. CC is also less myelotoxic than CMC. More recently, we have undertaken a phase II study to determine the efficacy and toxicity of 2-CdA combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in CLL and other refractory or relapsed indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. The preliminary results seem to be better than in similar patients previously treated in our institution with 2-CdA alone. In conclusion, the studies performed in the last decade in Poland and other countries have shown that 2-CdA used alone or in combination with other agents is, similarly to FA, a highly active and relatively safe agent in previously treated and untreated patients with CLL.","['Robak, Tadeusz']",['Robak T'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, 93-513, Pabianicka 62 str, Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20041119,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Poland', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0974-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Feb;84(2):63-70. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0974-4.

In the present study, the toxicity of Quinifuryl to P388 mouse leukemia cells was compared in the dark and under illumination with visible light (390-500 nm). Illumination of water solutions of Quinifuryl (at concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 9.0 microg/ml) in the presence of P388 cells resulted in its photodecomposition and was accompanied by elevated cytotoxicity. A significant capacity to kill P388 cells was detected at a drug concentration as low as 0.09 microg/ml. The toxic effect detected at this drug concentration under illumination exceeded the effect observed in the dark by more than three times. Moreover, the general toxic effect of Quinifuryl, which included cell proliferation arrest, was nearly 100%. Both dose- and time-dependent toxic effects were measured under illumination. The LC50 value of Quinifuryl during incubation with P388 cells was approximately 0.45 microg/ml under illumination for 60 min and >12 microg/ml in the dark. We have demonstrated that the final products of the Quinifuryl photolysis are not toxic, which means that the short-lived intermediates of Quinifuryl photodecomposition are responsible for the phototoxicity of this compound.

In addition to their ability to recognize sialic acid residues, these Siglecs display two conserved tyrosine-based motifs in their cytoplasmic region similar to those found in inhibitory receptors of the immune system. In the present study, we use the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) model to examine the potential of Siglecs-7 and -9 to function as inhibitory receptors and investigate the molecular basis for this. We first demonstrate that Siglecs-7 and -9 are able to inhibit the FcepsilonRI-mediated serotonin release from RBL cells following co-crosslinking. In addition, we show that under these conditions or after pervanadate treatment, Siglecs-7 and -9 associate with the Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatases (SHP), SHP-1 and SHP-2, both in immunoprecipitation and in fluorescence microscopy experiments using GFP fusion proteins. We then show by site-directed mutagenesis that the membrane-proximal tyrosine motif is essential for the inhibitory function of both Siglec-7 and -9, and is also required for tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases. Finally, mutation of the membrane-proximal motif increased the sialic acid binding activity of Siglecs-7 and -9, raising the possibility that ""inside-out"" signaling may occur to regulate ligand binding.","['Avril, Tony', 'Floyd, Helen', 'Lopez, Frederic', 'Vivier, Eric', 'Crocker, Paul R']","['Avril T', 'Floyd H', 'Lopez F', 'Vivier E', 'Crocker PR']","['Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, The Wellcome Trust Biocentre, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (SIGLEC7 protein, human)', '0 (SIGLEC9 protein, human)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/genetics/immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lectins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Transport', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*physiology', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Serotonin Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['173/11/6841 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.11.6841 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Dec 1;173(11):6841-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.11.6841.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that the AML TSN also significantly delays apoptosis of both resting and stimulated T cells, as judged by reduction in annexin V/propidium iodide staining. In addition, we show that this is not unique to T cells and that AML TSN inhibits apoptosis of peripheral B cells, neutrophils, and monocytes. Furthermore, it also enhances the survival of other AML myeloblasts with lower viability. Investigations into the mechanism demonstrate a reduction in the cleavage of procaspase-3, -8, and -9 and the caspase substrate, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). This may be due to Bcl-2, which is normally down-regulated in CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells, but is maintained in the presence of AML TSN. We conclude that AML cells generate an antiapoptotic microenvironment that favors the survival of malignant cells, but also inhibits apoptosis of other normal hemopoietic cells. Reversal of these immunosuppressive effects and restoration of normal immune responses in patients with AML would improve the success of immunotherapy protocols.","['Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Devereux, Stephen', 'Westwood, Nigel B', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Thomas, N Shaun B', 'Buggins, Andrea G S']","['Milojkovic D', 'Devereux S', 'Westwood NB', 'Mufti GJ', 'Thomas NS', 'Buggins AG']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, Leukaemia Sciences, Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine, Rayne Institute, London, United Kingdom. dragana.milojkovic@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Cell-Free System/physiology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['173/11/6745 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.11.6745 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Dec 1;173(11):6745-52. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.11.6745.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of this information, we cloned a full length cDNA corresponding to a novel member of this family, termed immune receptor expressed by myeloid cells 2 (IREM-2). The gene, located in chromosome 17q25.1, encodes for a protein of 205 aa that contains an extracellular region comprising an Ig-like domain and a transmembrane region with a positively charged amino acid residue (lysine), that predicted its putative association with an adapter molecule. Indeed, the interaction between IREM-2 and DAP-12 was confirmed in transfected COS-7 cells. By generating specific Abs and using bone marrow and PBMCs, we observed that IREM-2 expression appeared to be restricted to mature hemopoietic cells of the monocytic and myeloid dendritic cell lineages. In vitro differentiation to macrophages or immature dendritic cells down-regulated IREM-2 expression. Upon engagement with the specific mAbs, IREM-2 expressed in rat basophilic leukemia cells together with DAP-12, induced NFAT transcriptional activity; moreover, IREM-2 engagement on monocytes induced TNF-alpha production. Taken together, our results indicate that IREM-2 is a novel activating receptor of the Ig-superfamily in the monocytic lineage.","['Aguilar, Helena', 'Alvarez-Errico, Damiana', 'Garcia-Montero, Andres C', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Sayos, Joan', 'Lopez-Botet, Miguel']","['Aguilar H', 'Alvarez-Errico D', 'Garcia-Montero AC', 'Orfao A', 'Sayos J', 'Lopez-Botet M']","['Molecular Immunopathology Unit, Departament de Ciencies Experimentals i de la Salut, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['GENBANK/AF395839'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD300C protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (TYROBP protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/chemistry/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Immunologic/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['173/11/6703 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.11.6703 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Dec 1;173(11):6703-11. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.11.6703.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G-CSF has been used to treat neutropenia in neonates, pediatric cancer patients, and patients undergoing stem cell transplantation. The regulation of transcription factors mediating G-CSF activity has not been well characterized. The goal of this study was to examine the regulation of the ETS binding protein, Friend leukemia integration site 1 (Fli-1), in myeloid cells treated with G-CSF. Fli-1 has oncogenic properties in humans and mice, and plays a role in vascular and hematopoietic cell development. We previously reported that Fli-1 and the serum response factor bind at adjacent sites within the serum response element-1 of the early growth response gene-1 promoter in the murine myeloid leukemic cell line, NFS60. We also identified that Fli-1 DNA binding increased in G-CSF-treated cells compared with untreated cells. To determine whether the change in binding activity is due to increased Fli-1 transcription or protein stability, we examined endogenous Fli-1 expression in G-CSF-treated or -untreated NFS60 cells. Our results demonstrated that levels of Fli-1 protein, but not RNA, were higher in extracts from cells treated with G-CSF. The increase in Fli-1 protein was also dependent on protein synthesis. Finally, we showed that the half-life of Fli-1 is prolonged in G-CSF-treated cells compared with control-treated cells. These results suggest that G-CSF induces stabilization of Fli-1 protein in myeloid cells, thus proposing a novel mechanism by which hematopoietic growth factors regulate transcription factors.","['Mora-Garcia, Patricia', 'Wei, Jolyn', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M']","['Mora-Garcia P', 'Wei J', 'Sakamoto KM']","[""Department of Pediatrics.

The Mll gene encodes a Trithorax-group chromatin regulator that is essential for the development of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during embryogenesis. Like Trithorax, MLL positively regulates clustered homeodomain or Hox genes, yet the role of Hox genes collectively in the development of the mammalian hematopoietic system has been difficult to ascertain because of redundancy among Hox paralogs. Here, we show that in the absence of MLL, early hematopoietic progenitors develop despite reduced expression of HoxA, HoxB, and HoxC genes. However, these progenitors exhibit a marked reduction in their ability to generate hematopoietic colonies, a subsequent process requiring cell division and differentiation. Reactivation of a subset of Hox genes or, remarkably, reexpression of a single Hox gene in Mll-deficient progenitors rescued hematopoietic-colony frequency and growth. In contrast, expression of other MLL target genes such as Pitx2 or expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 failed to rescue hematopoietic-colony frequency. Furthermore, our results highlight a shared function of Hox proteins at this point in the development of the hematopoietic system.","['Ernst, Patricia', 'Mabon, Meghann', 'Davidson, Alan J', 'Zon, Leonard I', 'Korsmeyer, Stanley J']","['Ernst P', 'Mabon M', 'Davidson AJ', 'Zon LI', 'Korsmeyer SJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Homeobox/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/03/01 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(04)00879-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cub.2004.11.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 2004 Nov 23;14(22):2063-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2004.11.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite advances in the characterization of TG2 functions and their impact on cellular processes, the role of TG2 in Human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line is still poorly understood. To understand the biological significance of TG2 during the differentiation of K562 cells, we established and characterized K562 cells that specifically express TG2. Non-transfected K562 cells showed the increase of membrane-bound-TG2 level after 3 days in the response to Hemin and all trans-retinoic acid (tRA), indicating that membrane recruitment of TG2 is occurred during the erythroid differentiation. However, membrane recruitment of TG2 in TG2-transfected cells revealed within earlier time period, compared with that in vector-transfected cells. The ability of membrane-bound-TG2 to be photoaffinity-labeled with [alpha-32P]GTP was also increased in TG2-transfected cells. TG2-transfected cells activated Akt phosphorylation and inactivated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, compared with vector-transfected cells. Furthermore, phosphorylation of CREB, one of the Akt substrates, was increased in TG2-transfected cells and this phenomenon was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of several marker genes related with erythroid lineage in the absence of PI3K specific inhibitor, Wortmannin, indicating that PI3K/Akt signaling pathway also involved in the differentiation of the cell. Finally, as results of benzidine positive staining as well as hemoglobinization analysis, overexpression of TG2 revealed acceleration of the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Taken together, there was no increased TG2 expression level in the response of Hemin/tRA and delayed differentiation in vector transfected cells than in TG2-transfected cells, suggesting that suppression of TG2 expression may retard the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Therefore, our study may give a new insight for another aspect of the development of this disease.","['Kang, Sung-Koo', 'Lee, Ji-Young', 'Chung, Tae-Wook', 'Kim, Cheorl-Ho']","['Kang SK', 'Lee JY', 'Chung TW', 'Kim CH']","['National Research Laboratory for Glycobiology, KMOST and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Oriental Medicine, Dongguk University, Kyungju, Kyungbuk 780-714, Korea.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transglutaminases/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014579304012669 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2004.10.031 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2004 Nov 19;577(3):361-6. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2004.10.031.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation therapy and apoptosis induction are two ways to achieve this goal. Sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF) has been described as an effective tool for cell separation, respecting integrity and viability. Because SdFFF takes advantage of intrinsic properties of eluted cells (size, density, shape), we studied the capacity of SdFFF to monitor specific biophysical modifications that occurred during cellular apoptosis or differentiation induction. Then, we used, as an in vitro cellular model of apoptosis and differentiation, diosgenin dose-dependent induction in the polyvalent human erythroleukemia cell line. Two other chemicals were used: phorbol myristate acetate (differentiation inducer) and staurosporine (apoptosis inducer). Our results demonstrated a correlation between SdFFF elution profile changes and induction of effective biological processes. Thus, after acquisition of a reference profile, SdFFF could be used alone to follow chemically induced biological events, suggesting many different applications such as testing series of molecules, evaluation of new cellular/biological models used in different life science fields, or sorting purified populations with the aim of better understanding mechanisms of induced cellular events.","['Leger, David Yannick', 'Liagre, Bertrand', 'Cardot, Philippe Jean Paul', 'Beneytout, Jean-Louis', 'Battu, Serge']","['Leger DY', 'Liagre B', 'Cardot PJ', 'Beneytout JL', 'Battu S']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie, EA 1085 Biomolecules et cibles cellulaires tumorales, Universite de Limoges, Faculte de Pharmacie, 2 rue du Dr Marcland, 87025 Limoges Cedex, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'K49P2K8WLX (Diosgenin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Diosgenin', '*Fractionation, Field Flow', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/09/20 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-2697(04)00730-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ab.2004.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2004 Dec 15;335(2):267-78. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2004.09.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, molecules of gp51 were removed from polymeric backbone and molecularly imprinted polypyrrole (mPpy) was ready for recognition of gp51 in the aqueous solution. Pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) was applied for label-free detection of gp51 in the samples. Anti-gp51 antibodies and secondary antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were involved as markers for the control of mPpy preparation procedures. Control experiments were also simultaneously performed by spectrophotometrical detection of HRP activity.

AML1-MTG8 acts as a dominant negative effector on normal AML1 protein, a key transcriptional regulator of hematopoietic differentiation, but its precise mechanism is not known. To analyze the function of AML1-MTG8 in leukemic cells and to explore the possibility of AML1-MTG8-targeted therapy, we designed nine small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting a 25-nucleotide region spanning the fusion point of AML1 and MTG8. Two different siRNAs (AM2 and AM4) significantly reduced AML1-MTG8 expression from a transfected reporter plasmid at both the mRNA and protein levels. Both siRNAs did not reduce AML1b expression, but AM2 siRNA showed slightly reducing activity against MTG8b mRNA that is 86% homologous to the corresponded region of AML1-MTG8 mRNA. Moreover, using a cationic lipid reagent, the siRNAs were efficiently introduced into leukemia cell lines with t(8;21), SKNO-1 (30-40%) and Kasumi-1 (60-70%) cells, and reduced specifically the endogenous AML1-MTG8 expression. The siRNAs reduced neither the wild type AML1 in Kasumi-1 cells nor wild type MTG8b in human erythroblastic leukemia (HEL) cells. These results indicated that the two siRNAs are highly specific for the fusion mRNA. The knockdown of AML1-MTG8 in Kasumi-1 cells resulted in the activation of p14(ARF) promoter activity and increased the expression of integrin alphaIIb, whose expression is related to megakaryocytic differentiation. However, the knockdown of AML1-MTG8 in Kasumi-1 cells did not inhibit the cell growth, suggesting that the siRNA-mediated knockdown of AML1-MTG8 is useful for the functional analysis of the gene, but it alone might not be sufficient for gene therapy of the leukemia.","['Kasashima, Katsumi', 'Sakota, Eri', 'Kozu, Tomoko']","['Kasashima K', 'Sakota E', 'Kozu T']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, 818 Komuro, Ina, Saitama 362-0806, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromosomes/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/04/15 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(04)00131-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2004.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2004 Sep-Oct;86(9-10):713-21. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2004.08.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It possesses potent anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, and anti-oxidation properties. The mechanism by which chrysin initiates apoptosis remains poorly understood. In the present report, we investigated the effect of chrysin on the apoptotic pathway in U937 human promonocytic cells. We show that chrysin induces apoptosis in association with the activation of caspase 3 and that Akt signal pathway plays a crucial role in chrysin-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Furthermore, we have shown that inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in U937 cells by the specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 significantly, enhanced apoptosis. Overexpression of a constitutively active Akt (myr-Akt) in U937 cells inhibited the induction of apoptosis, activation of caspase 3, and PLC-gamma1 cleavage by chrysin. Together, these findings suggest that the Akt pathway plays a major role in regulating the apoptotic response of human leukemia cells to chrysin and raise the possibility that combined interruption of chrysin and PI3K/Akt-related pathways may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in hematological malignancies.","['Woo, Kyung Jin', 'Jeong, Yong-Jin', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Woo KJ', 'Jeong YJ', 'Park JW', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 194 DongSan-Dong Jung-Gu, Taegu 700-712, Republic of Korea. kwontk@dsmc.or.kr']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '3CN01F5ZJ5 (chrysin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/01/19 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(04)02240-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.09.225 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Dec 24;325(4):1215-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.09.225.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: By using MTT test, NBT reduction reaction and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, changes in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis were observed in K562, HL-60 and fresh leukemia cells after treated with 5-aza-CdR. The mRNA expressions of DNMTs, p15, p53 and bcl-2 were measured by RT-PCR. The status of p15(INK4B) gene methylation was examined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR). RESULTS: The growth inhibition of K562, HL-60 and fresh leukemia cells displayed a dose and time-dependent manner after treated by 5-aza-CdR. The differentiation-inducing ability on HL-60 cells was obvious at 0.5 micromol/L of 5-aza-CdR. The up-regulation of p15 mRNA and p53 mRNA expression and down-regulation of bcl-2 mRNA expression were obvious as compared with the control, but the DNMTs expression was not significantly different from the control. The methylation status of p15 gene in fresh leukemia cells decreased gradually with increasing concentration of 5-aza-CdR. CONCLUSION: The proliferation of leukemia cells was obviously inhibited by 5-aza-CdR, its mechanism maybe related to the up-regulation of p15 and p53 genes and down-regulation of bcl-2 gene.

Careful preoperative staging is imperative, as is pathologic documentation of the mediastinal nodal contents. Adjuvant postoperative thoracic radiation therapy (RT) clearly has an impact in reducing locoregional recurrence but has no clear impact on survival. The Postoperative RT (PORT) metaanalysis raised concerns about PORT, particularly in stage I/II NSCLC, suggesting it may negatively impact survival. This was not a concern in stage III NSCLC, in which the risk of locoregional recurrence is higher. However, distant recurrence remains the dominant pattern in resected NSCLC, suggesting that the majority of patients with early-stage resected NSCLC harbor occult micrometastatic disease. Historically, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy has been controversial, and its routine use was not supported by the published data, which consisted of a small number of underpowered trials using inadequately delivered, antiquated chemotherapy. More recently, larger trials have been reported with conflicting results. Like adjuvant PORT, chemotherapy combined with RT has not improved survival over PORT alone. The use of adjuvant cisplatin-based therapy did not show a survival advantage in the Adjuvant Lung Project Italy study but did in the International Adjuvant Lung Trial, creating controversy in the routine implementation of adjuvant therapy in all patients. Recently completed randomized trials by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B and the National Cancer Institute of Canada provide convincing evidence of a substantial benefit from adjuvant therapy in well-staged and completely resected stage I/II NSCLC. Currently, the totality of the data supports a discussion with patients with resected NSCLC regarding the potential benefits of adjuvant therapy.","['Socinski, Mark A']",['Socinski MA'],"['Multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology Program, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. socinski@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lung Cancer,Clinical lung cancer,100893225,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality/*therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Pneumonectomy', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/04/13 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-7304(11)70215-7 [pii]', '10.3816/CLC.2004.n.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lung Cancer. 2004 Nov;6(3):162-9. doi: 10.3816/CLC.2004.n.029.,,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we show a cell-cycle-regulatory role of Mcl-1 involving a shortened form of the Mcl-1 polypeptide, primarily localized to the nucleus, which we call snMcl-1. snMcl-1 interacts with the cell-cycle-regulatory protein Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1; also known as cdc2) in the nucleus, and Cdk1 bound to snMcl-1 was found to have a lower kinase activity. The interaction with Cdk1 occurs in the absence of its cyclin partners and is enhanced on treatment of cells with G2/M blocking agents, but not by G1/S blocking. The snMcl-1 polypeptide is present during S and G2 phases and is negligible in G1. Overexpression of human Mcl-1 in a murine myeloid progenitor cell line resulted in a lower rate of proliferation. Furthermore, Mcl-1-overexpressing cells had lower total Cdk1 kinase activity compared with parental cells, in both anti-Cdk1 and anti-cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates. The latter results suggest that binding to snMcl-1 alters the ability of Cdk1 to bind its conventional partner, cyclin B1. Given the important role of Cdk1 in progression through G2 and M phases, it is probable that the inhibition of Cdk1 activity accounts for the inhibitory effect of Mcl-1 on cell growth.","['Jamil, Sarwat', 'Sobouti, Rafat', 'Hojabrpour, Payman', 'Raj, Meera', 'Kast, Juergen', 'Duronio, Vincent']","['Jamil S', 'Sobouti R', 'Hojabrpour P', 'Raj M', 'Kast J', 'Duronio V']","['Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute, Jack Bell Research Centre, 2660 Oak St., Vancouver, BC, Canada V6H 3Z6.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2004/11/24 09:00,2006/04/08 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20041596 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20041596 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 May 1;387(Pt 3):659-67. doi: 10.1042/BJ20041596.,,,,PMC1134995,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1979, Wertheimer and Leeper firstly reported an excess of cancer mortality among children living in homes located near power lines and presumably exposed to elevated magnetic fields. Subsequently, a large number of epidemiological studies investigated the possible association between residential or occupational exposure to ELF-EMF and cancer. Several in vivo and in vitro models have been investigated with the effort to determine a link, if any, between such fields and mutagenesis and to determine the possible mechanism of cancer risk. However, a causal relationship between exposure to ELF-EMF and cancer has been suggested but has not been unequivocally demonstrated. In 1998, following an analysis of the results retrieved in the literature, the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences proposed to apply a ""possible human carcinogen"" category (Group 2B) to ELF-EMF. More recently, in 2002, the same classification for ELF-MF was proposed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In this in vitro approach, to test the genotoxic and/or co-genotoxic potency of ELF-MF, we used the alkaline single-cell microgel-electrophoresis (comet) assay and the cytokinesis block micronucleus test. Co-exposure assays were performed in the presence of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide (4NQO), benzene, 1,4-benzenediol (1,4-BD), or 1,2,4-benzenetriol (1,2,4-BT). An ELF-MF (50 Hz, 5 mT) was obtained by a system composed of capsulated induction coils. ELF-MF alone was unable to cause direct primary DNA damage. Whereas, an increased extent of DNA damage was observed in cells co-exposed to ELF-MF and MNNG, 1,4-BD, or 1,2,4-BT. An opposite trend was observed in cells treated with 4NQO and co-exposed to ELF-MF. Moreover, the frequency of micronucleated cells in ELF-MF-exposed cells was higher than in control cultures. Our findings suggest that the tested ELF-MF (50 Hz, 5 mT) possess genotoxic (micronucleus test) and co-genotoxic (comet assay) capabilities. The possibility that ELF-MF might interfere with the genotoxic activity of xenobiotics has important implications, since human populations are likely to be exposed to a variety of genotoxic agents concomitantly with exposure to this type of physical agent.","['Scassellati Sforzolini, G', 'Moretti, M', 'Villarini, M', 'Fatigoni, C', 'Pasquini, R']","['Scassellati Sforzolini G', 'Moretti M', 'Villarini M', 'Fatigoni C', 'Pasquini R']","['Dipartimento di Igiene e Sanita Pubblica, Universita degli Studi di Perugia.']",['ita'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Ann Ig,Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,9002865,,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Mutagenicity Tests']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/02/23 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Ig. 2004 Jan-Apr;16(1-2):321-40.,,,,,,,,Studi sugli effetti genotossici e/o co-genotossici in cellule esposte in vitro a campi elettromagnetici a frequenza estremamente bassa.,,,,,,,,,,,

It is infrequently associated with other myeloproliferative disorders or chronic myelogenous leukemia. Chloroma of the testis after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is particularly sparsely represented in the literature. It is often incorrectly diagnosed as malignant lymphoma, especially large-cell lymphoma, owing to the similarity of the histologic morphology, scanty eosinophilic myelocytes, and no or overlooked history of leukemia. Although erroneous diagnosis is decreasing with the advent of ancillary studies, the diagnosis of chloroma continues to be a nightmare for pathologists. It is thus suggested that an appropriate panel of marker studies be performed in conjunction with clinical correlation and circumspection to avoid reaching a misleading conclusion and improper treatment of patients. We report an interesting case of a 35-year-old male with a clinical history of chronic myelogenous leukemia post allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and complete molecular remission, who was found to have chloroma of the left testis.","['Hu, Shih-Wen', 'Huang, Shu-Pin', 'Yang, Sheau-Fang', 'Chai, Chee-Yin']","['Hu SW', 'Huang SP', 'Yang SF', 'Chai CY']","['Department of Pathology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,China (Republic : 1949- ),Kaohsiung J Med Sci,The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,100960562,,IM,"['Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Testis/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/surgery', 'Ultrasonography', 'Weight Loss']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1607-551X(09)70250-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S1607-551X(09)70250-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Kaohsiung J Med Sci. 2004 Oct;20(10):506-11. doi: 10.1016/S1607-551X(09)70250-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the up-regulated genes is Reg IV, which is a member of the Reg gene family belonging to calcium dependent lectin (C-type lectin) gene superfamily. We have examined Reg IV potential as a novel marker for the detection of peritoneal micro-metastases of gastric cancer. Reg IV expression was examined in five gastric cancer cell lines established from peritoneal dissemination and compared with myeloid leukemia cell (HL60), methothelial cell lines Met5A and the other gastric cell line established from primary tumor (SNU-1) by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Reg IV was highly overexpressed in 4 gastric cancer cell lines established from peritoneal dissemination, but weakly expressed in other cell lines. According to Reg IV mRNA expression levels in surgically resected specimens, the quantity of Reg IV correlated with wall penetration. Furthermore, Reg IV mRNA expression level in the peritoneal wash from 35 gastric cancer patients was also prone to correlation with wall penetration. These results suggest that Reg IV may be involved in peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancers and Reg IV may be a potential novel marker for peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancers.","['Miyagawa, Kouji', 'Sakakura, Chohei', 'Kin, Shuichi', 'Nakase, Yuenn', 'Fukuda, Kenichirou', 'Hagiwara, Akeo', 'Okazaki, Yasushi', 'Hayashizaki, Yoshihide', 'Yamagishi, Hisakazu']","['Miyagawa K', 'Sakakura C', 'Kin S', 'Nakase Y', 'Fukuda K', 'Hagiwara A', 'Okazaki Y', 'Hayashizaki Y', 'Yamagishi H']","['Dept. of Digestive Surgery, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.']",['jpn'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

However, this condition may pass unrecognized in children without an underlying hemolytic disorder, since the anemia may be of a short duration and self-limiting. The authors report 3 cases of PV B19-induced transient aplastic in different clinical settings--pancytopenia in one child, during induction phase for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the second, and fever with joint pains in the third. Treatment for PV B19-induced transient aplastic crisis is essentially supportive. There may be a dilemma in patients on immunosuppressive therapy, since initially it is difficult to distinguish between chronic pure red cell aplasia (a condition where intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is beneficial) and transient aplastic crisis, where supportive red cell transfusions suffice. The patient with leukemia also recovered spontaneously despite being on steroids. In all the 3 patients, the pure red cell aplasia recovered spontaneously without administration of intravenous gammaglobulins.","['Garewal, G', 'Ahluwalia, J', 'Das, R', 'Marwaha, R K']","['Garewal G', 'Ahluwalia J', 'Das R', 'Marwaha RK']","['Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. haemat@eth.net']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parvoviridae Infections/*complications/diagnosis', '*Parvovirus B19, Human', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*etiology']",2004/11/24 09:00,2005/01/28 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880010490477293 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Sep;21(6):505-11. doi: 10.1080/08880010490477293.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies published since the 1986 IARC Monograph on ""Tobacco smoking"" provide sufficient evidence to establish a causal association between cigarette smoking and cancer of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, stomach, liver, kidney (renal cell carcinoma) and uterine cervix, and for adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and myeloid leukaemia. These sites add to the previously established list of cancers causally associated with cigarette smoking, namely cancer of the lung, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, pancreas, urinary bladder and renal pelvis. Other forms of tobacco smoking, such as cigars, pipes and bidis, also increase risk for cancer, including cancer of the lung and parts of the upper aerodigestive tract. A meta-analysis of over 50 studies on involuntary smoking among never smokers showed a consistent and statistically significant association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer risk. Smoking is currently responsible for a third of all cancer deaths in many Western countries. It has been estimated that every other smoker will be killed by tobacco.","['Sasco, A J', 'Secretan, M B', 'Straif, K']","['Sasco AJ', 'Secretan MB', 'Straif K']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Ireland,Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8800805,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Smoking/*adverse effects/*epidemiology', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects']",2004/11/24 09:00,2004/12/23 09:00,['2004/11/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0169-5002(04)80002-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.07.998 [doi]']",ppublish,Lung Cancer. 2004 Aug;45 Suppl 2:S3-9. doi: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.07.998.,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral infection was not identified as a predisposing condition and was not correlated with either species of Cryptococcus or physical findings. Most cats had signs of nasal cavity infection, which was typically localised for a substantial period before invasion of adjacent structures or dissemination. Male and female dogs were affected equally. A marked preponderance of young, large breed dogs was noted. Border Collies, Boxers, Dalmatians, Dobermann Pinschers, Great Danes and German Shepherds were over-represented. Cryptococcus species involved was not affected by place of domicile. Although nasal cavity involvement was important, the canine cohort had a greater propensity to develop secondary central nervous system involvement and disseminated disease than feline cases. There were no clinical findings in either cats or dogs which could be reliably used to distinguish disease caused by Cryptococcus neoformans variety grubii from disease caused by Cryptococcus gattii.

Previous studies verified an increased incidence of leukemia and myeloma, however other authors haven't verified it. There are reports of nasal, pharyngeal, laryngeal, and lung cancer in service station workers. Our study wants to evaluate the oxidative balance in the fuel workers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 44 subjects with gasoline exposure and 29 control subjects. We determined the blood concentrations of Glutathione reduced and oxidized, Protein sulfhydrylic (PSH) Vitamine E, Vitamine C, Malondialdehyde, Protein oxidized (OX-PROT) and beta carotene. The t test was performed to analyze the differences between the means, the Chi square was used to evaluate the statistical significance of associations between variable categorical (redox index). The Anova test excluded the confusing effect of age, smoke and alcohol habit. RESULTS: The mean age of the workers was 36.6 years, instead the control group was 38. In the workers Glutathione reduced, Vit. E and Beta carotene were lower than in the control subjects, this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The Malondialdehyde concentration was higher in the workers higher than in the control group, but this difference wasn't statistically significant. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated Glutathione, Vit. E, and Beta carotene are useful to verify a reduction of the antioxidant activity. The only marker of the presence of oxidative injury that correlated to work exposure was the malondialdehyde. The redox index was surest marker. The limit of our study is the number of control group, it was little and lower than workers. Conclusively we believe it's useful to continue our studies and, if our results are going to be confirmed, we retain that stress oxidative determination would be verified in occupational medicine using these markers, especially to study exposure of the fuel workers who were investigated less and, in our opinion, would receive more attention.","['Basso, A', 'Elia, G', 'Petrozzi, M T', 'Zefferino, R']","['Basso A', 'Elia G', 'Petrozzi MT', 'Zefferino R']","['DMIMP - Sez.

The use of PGD for combined analysis of mutation and HLA-matching was reported for the first time in 2001. This enables the birth of an unaffected child who can serve as a donor for an affected sibling in need for stem cell transplantation. We report successful cord blood transplantation for a Fanconi anemia patient from his HLA-matched sibling, born after PGD that included mutation analysis for Fanconi anemia and HLA typing.

We investigated the expression of HTLV-I antigens in fresh ATL cells by using both in vitro and in vivo assays. In flow cytometric analysis, we found that 3 of 5 acute-type and six of fifteen chronic-type ATL patients tested showed significant induction of HTLV-I Tax and Gag in their ATL cells in a 1-day culture. Concomitantly with HTLV-I-expression, these ATL cells expressed co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86 and OX40, and showed elevated levels of antigenicity against allogeneic T cells and HTLV-I Tax-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). Representative CTL epitopes restricted by HLA-A2 or A24 were conserved in 4 of 5 acute-type ATL patients tested. Furthermore, spleen T cells from rats, which had been subcutaneously inoculated with formalin-fixed uncultured ATL cells, exhibited a strong interferon gamma-producing helper T cell responses specific for HTLV-I Tax-expressing cells.

Here, we present a case of a patient with CNL carrying t(15;19)(q13;p13.3) who achieved a cytogenetic remission following treatment with imatinib, 400 mg daily.

The patient remains in complete remission with an excellent performance status after 7 months of therapy.

Interaction with Pgp, including activation, inhibition and induction, can lead to altered plasma or brain levels of Pgp substrates. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible interactions of St John's wort extract and most relevant constituents with the transport activity of Pgp. METHODS: We characterized the modulatory potencies in two in vitro assays using calcein-AM, first in VLB cells (a human lymphocytic leukemia cell line expressing Pgp) and second in PBCEC cells (porcine brain capillary endothelial cells). RESULTS: The extract, as well as some of the tested constituents modulate the transport by Pgp in the micromolecular range. Quercetin and hyperforin seem to be most potent. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the possibility of drug interactions at the level of the gastro-intestinal absorption of drugs. Plasma levels of the constituents of St John's wort are very likely too low to interfere with Pgp at the blood-brain-barrier with the possible exception of quercetin.","['Weber, C C', 'Kressmann, S', 'Fricker, G', 'Muller, W E']","['Weber CC', 'Kressmann S', 'Fricker G', 'Muller WE']","['Department of Pharmacology, Biocenter, University of Frankfurt, Marie-Curie-Strasse 9, 60439 Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Pharmacopsychiatry,Pharmacopsychiatry,8402938,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antidepressive Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Terpenes)', '01K63SUP8D (Fluoxetine)', '148504-34-1 (calcein AM)', '1806D8D52K (Amitriptyline)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'DHD7FFG6YS (Phloroglucinol)', 'RM741E34FP (hyperforin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amitriptyline/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Brain/cytology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Endothelial Cells/*drug effects', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Fluoxetine/pharmacology', 'Herb-Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Hypericum/*chemistry', 'Leukemia', 'Models, Biological', 'Phloroglucinol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Quercetin/pharmacology', 'Swine', 'Terpenes/pharmacology']",2004/11/20 09:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/11/20 09:00'],"['2004/11/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-832686 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacopsychiatry. 2004 Nov;37(6):292-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-832686.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular cytogenetic characterization was achieved using appropriate bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) probes in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. In these two cases the fusion gene was detected on the der(8) short arm, resulting from a pericentric chromosome 8 inversion followed by a t(8;21) rearrangement. These results suggest that heterogeneous mechanisms can lead to the generation of the 5'RUNX1/3'CBFA2T1chimeric gene.","['Anelli, L', 'Albano, F', 'Zagaria, A', 'Liso, A', 'Cuneo, A', 'Mancini, M', 'Liso, V', 'Rocchi, M', 'Specchia, G']","['Anelli L', 'Albano F', 'Zagaria A', 'Liso A', 'Cuneo A', 'Mancini M', 'Liso V', 'Rocchi M', 'Specchia G']","['Department of Hematology, University of Foggia, Viale Pinto 1, 71100 Foggia, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041116,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2004/11/20 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2004/11/20 09:00'],"['2004/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0960-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Apr;84(4):245-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0960-x.

Recent studies in cell lines have challenged the notion that retroviruses and retroviral vectors integrate randomly into their host genome. Medical applications using these vectors are aimed at HSCs, and thus large-scale comprehensive analysis of MLV and SIV integration in long-term repopulating HSCs is crucial to help develop improved integrating vectors. We studied integration sites in HSCs of rhesus monkeys that had been transplanted 6 mo to 6 y prior with MLV- or SIV-transduced CD34(+)cells. Unique MLV (491) and SIV (501) insertions were compared to a set of in silico-generated random integration sites. While MLV integrants were located predominantly around transcription start sites, SIV integrants strongly favored transcription units and gene-dense regions of the genome. These integration patterns suggest different mechanisms for integration as well as distinct safety implications for MLV versus SIV vectors.","['Hematti, Peiman', 'Hong, Bum-Kee', 'Ferguson, Cole',

There have been no direct reports on insertional mutagenesis by lentiviral vectors; however, the severe pathogenic nature of their parental virus (HIV-1) is still a major safety concern surrounding these vectors and prevents the progress with their clinical application. We reason that by investigating the host response we shall be able to assess the safety and potential effects of the vectors on targeted cells and understand the interaction between vectors and the host. For this, two major sets of experiments were conducted. Initially, we used cDNA microarray methodology to examine cellular gene profile in human primary umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) after HIV-1-based VSV-G/GFP vector transduction and observed a modest effect of HIV-1-based vectors on HUVECs. The represented functional categories include transcription and translation factors, tumour antigens, complement factors and signal transduction factors. Some of the differentially expressed genes, for example, Clusterin, CD151, Ku antigen and eIF4gamma, could have oncogenic potential. In the second approach, we systematically compared five different viral vectors, that is, HIV-1-based VSV-G/Empty, VSV-G/GFP, VSV-G/puro, Amph/GFP and MLV-based Amph/Laz, for the effects of individual viral components on cellular gene regulation. Our comparative results demonstrated a regulatory function of Gag/Pol proteins on cellular gene expression. The significance of our findings in relation to the safety of HIV-1 vectors and the importance of quality control of vector production will be presented and discussed.","['Zhao, Y', 'Azam, S', 'Thorpe, R']","['Zhao Y', 'Azam S', 'Thorpe R']","['Division of Immunobiology, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Blanche Lane, South Mimms, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire EN6 3QG, UK.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western/methods', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*adverse effects/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'HIV Core Protein p24/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Safety', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods']",2004/11/20 09:00,2005/05/04 09:00,['2004/11/20 09:00'],"['2004/11/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['3302414 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.gt.3302414 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2005 Feb;12(4):311-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3302414.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two major IFIs are systemic candidiasis (including candidemia, chronic disseminated candidiasis and pneumonia) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Recently, the incidence of the latter has been increasing. Three levels of diagnosis are specified in the Japanese guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of IFIs. Proven fungal infections are diagnosed by histological/microbiological evidence of fungi at the site of infection or positive blood culture (fungemia). Clinically documented fungal infections are diagnosed by typical radiological findings such as halo sign on chest CT plus positive serological/molecular evidence of fungi such as Aspergillus galactomannan, beta-glucan or fungal DNA. Possible fungal infections are diagnosed by typical radiological findings or positive serological/molecular evidence of fungi. For patients with high risk such as those undergoing HSCT, antifungal prophylaxis using oral antifungal agents is recommended. For possible fungal infections, empiric therapy with fluconazole (FLCZ) or amphotericin B (AMPH) is recommended. For patients with proven fungal infections or clinically documented fungal infections, targeted therapy is warranted. In case of candidemia, the best choice is FLCZ (400 mg/day) or AMPH (0.5-0.7 mg/kg/day), and for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, a higher dose of AMPH (1.0-1.5 mg/kg/day) is indicated. Micafungin (MCFG), recently licensed in Japan, is an active agent for both Candida and Aspergillus. This drug seems useful for empiric and targeted therapy of IFIs.","['Yoshida, Minoru']",['Yoshida M'],"['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University School of Medicine, 3-8-3 Mizonokuchi, Takatsu-ku, Kawasaki City, Kanagawa 213-8507, Japan.']",['jpn'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Nihon Ishinkin Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Ishinkin Gakkai zasshi = Japanese journal of medical mycology,9425640,"['0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*drug therapy', 'Candidiasis/*drug therapy', 'Echinocandins', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lipopeptides', 'Lipoproteins/therapeutic use', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/drug therapy', 'Micafungin', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Peptides, Cyclic/therapeutic use', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",2004/11/20 09:00,2005/04/23 09:00,['2004/11/20 09:00'],"['2004/11/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3314/jjmm.45.209 [doi]'],ppublish,Nihon Ishinkin Gakkai Zasshi. 2004;45(4):209-15. doi: 10.3314/jjmm.45.209.,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In situations in which it is impossible to enter the dwellings to measure indoor gamma dose rate, as can happen in epidemiological studies and in surveys on randomly selected dwellings, it is important to obtain accurate and precise estimates of the indoor gamma dose rate. In this paper, preliminary results of a validation study of a new method, named IN-OUT, to estimate the indoor gamma dose rate attributable to the building materials are presented. This method, which is still in progress, is based on outdoor measurements, performed close to an external wall of a dwelling, and on a 'room model' elaboration, which takes into account geometrical and structural characteristics of the dwelling. The validation was performed using data--relevant to 91 dwellings, at present--collected in Latium and Campania within the framework of 'SETIL', the Italian epidemiological study on the aetiology of childhood leukaemia, lymphoma and neuroblastoma.","['Bochicchio, Francesco', 'Nuccetelli, Cristina']","['Bochicchio F', 'Nuccetelli C']","['Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,,IM,"['Air Pollution, Indoor/*analysis', '*Algorithms', 'Construction Materials/*analysis', '*Gamma Rays', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Monitoring/*methods', 'Radiometry/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2004/11/20 09:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/11/20 09:00'],"['2004/11/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['111/4/413 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/nch064 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2004;111(4):413-6. doi: 10.1093/rpd/nch064.,['SETIL Working Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report that the postnatal BM contains a mobile pool of cells that express early cardiac lineage markers (Nkx2.5/Csx, GATA-4, and MEF2C). These cells are present in significant amounts in BM harvested from young mice but their abundance decreases with age; in addition, the responsiveness of these cells to gradients of motomorphogens SDF-1, HGF, and LIF changes with age. FACS analysis, combined with analysis of early cardiac markers at the mRNA and protein levels, revealed that cells expressing these markers reside in the nonadherent, nonhematopoietic CXCR4+/Sca-1+/lin-/CD45- mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction in mice and in the CXCR4+/CD34+/AC133+/CD45- BMMNC fraction in humans. These cells are mobilized into the peripheral blood after myocardial infarction and chemoattracted to the infarcted myocardium in an SDF-1-CXCR4-, HGF-c-Met-, and LIF-LIF-R-dependent manner. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the postnatal BM harbors a nonhematopoietic population of cells that express markers for cardiac differentiation. We propose that these potential cardiac progenitors may account for the myocardial regenerative effects of BM.

Cytarabine ocfosfate (YNK01) is an oral precursor of cytarabine that may overcome some of the inconvenience and toxicities associated with subcutaneous cytarabine administration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy with interferon-alpha-2b and YNK01 in patients with newly diagnosed, untreated CML. Forty patients were treated with interferon-alpha-2b (5 MU/m2/day) plus monthly courses of YNK01 (600 mg/day for 10 days) for 1 year. RESULTS: The 6-month complete haematological response rate was 63% and the 1-year major cytogenetic response rate was 30%, with 10% of cytogenetic responses being complete. With a median follow-up of 57 months, the estimated 5-year overall survival was 86% (95% confidence interval 70% to 94%). Treatment tolerability was poor, with toxicity leading to discontinuation of one or both drugs in 60% of cases. The median daily dose of interferon alpha-2b was 7.75 MU and the median dose of YNK01 was 600 mg/day for each 10-day treatment cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Interferon-alpha-2b and YNK01 produce cytogenetic responses comparable to those achieved with interferon-alpha-2b and parenteral cytarabine, although toxicity was excessive. Alternate dosing strategies may enhance the tolerability of YNK01.","['Mollee, P', 'Arthur, C', 'Hughes, T', 'Januszewicz, H', 'Grigg, A', 'Bradstock, K', 'Wolf, M', 'Gibson, J', 'Schwarer, A P', 'Spencer, A', 'Browett, P', 'Hawkins, T', 'Seldon, M', 'Herrmann, R', 'Watson, A', 'Seymour, J F', 'Martin, N', 'Shina, S', 'Low, C', 'Wright, S', 'Rodwell, R', 'Coulston, J', 'Morton, J', 'Blacklock, H', 'Taylor, D', 'Taylor, K M']","['Mollee P', 'Arthur C', 'Hughes T', 'Januszewicz H', 'Grigg A', 'Bradstock K', 'Wolf M', 'Gibson J', 'Schwarer AP', 'Spencer A', 'Browett P', 'Hawkins T', 'Seldon M', 'Herrmann R', 'Watson A', 'Seymour JF', 'Martin N', 'Shina S', 'Low C', 'Wright S', 'Rodwell R', 'Coulston J', 'Morton J', 'Blacklock H', 'Taylor D', 'Taylor KM']","['Haematology Department, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia. peter_mollee@health.qld.gov.au']",['eng'],,,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', ""3I7U8R8NWC (1-arabinofuranosylcytosine-5'-stearylphosphate)"", 'F469818O25 (Cytidine Monophosphate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Cytidine Monophosphate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/11/20 09:00,2005/04/29 09:00,['2004/11/20 09:00'],"['2004/11/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)60904-X [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdh468 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2004 Dec;15(12):1810-5. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdh468.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its constitutive activation has been involved in the pathogenesis of various cancers. In this study, we show that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin strongly inhibits the growth of the most immature acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines through blockade in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Accordingly, 2 downstream effectors of mTOR, 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, are phosphorylated in a rapamycin-sensitive manner in a series of 23 AML cases. Interestingly, the mTOR inhibitor markedly impairs the clonogenic properties of fresh AML cells while sparing normal hematopoietic progenitors. Moreover, rapamycin induces significant clinical responses in 4 of 9 patients with either refractory/relapsed de novo AML or secondary AML. Overall, our data strongly suggest that mTOR is aberrantly regulated in most AML cells and that rapamycin and analogs, by targeting the clonogenic compartment of the leukemic clone, may be used as new compounds in AML therapy.","['Recher, Christian', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Chicanne, Gaetan', 'Dos Santos, Cedric', 'Mas, Veronique Mansat-De', 'Benzaquen, David', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Payrastre, Bernard']","['Recher C', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Demur C', 'Chicanne G', 'Dos Santos C', 'Mas VM', 'Benzaquen D', 'Laurent G', 'Huguet F', 'Payrastre B']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U563, CPTP, Departement d'Oncogenese et signalisation dans les cellules hematopoietiques, IFR30, Toulouse, France. recher.c@chu-toulouse.fr""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041118,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Recurrence', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/11/20 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2004/11/20 09:00'],"['2004/11/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45761-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-06-2494 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 15;105(6):2527-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-06-2494.

To investigate the molecular basis of the selectivity, we determined the solution structure of the C-terminal Bcl-2-like domain of Mcl-1. This domain shares features expected of a prosurvival Bcl-2 protein, having a helical fold centered on a core hydrophobic helix and a surface-exposed hydrophobic groove for binding its cognate partners. A number of residues in the binding groove differentiate Mcl-1 from its homologs, and in contrast to other Bcl-2 homologs, Mcl-1 has a binding groove in a conformation intermediate between the open structures characterized by peptide complexes and the closed state observed in unliganded structures. Mutagenesis of potential binding site residues was used to probe the contributions of groove residues to the binding properties of Mcl-1. Although mutations in Mcl-1 had little impact on binding, a single mutation in the BH3-only ligand Bad enabled it to bind both Mcl-1 and A1 while retaining its binding to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w. Elucidating the selective action of certain BH3-only ligands is required for delineating their mode of action and will aid the search for effective BH3-mimetic drugs.","['Day, Catherine L', 'Chen, Lin', 'Richardson, Sarah J', 'Harrison, Penny J', 'Huang, David C S', 'Hinds, Mark G']","['Day CL', 'Chen L', 'Richardson SJ', 'Harrison PJ', 'Huang DC', 'Hinds MG']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin 9001, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['PDB/1WSX'],,['Journal Article'],20041118,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Ligands', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transfection', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/11/20 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2004/11/20 09:00'],"['2004/11/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)76122-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M411434200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Feb 11;280(6):4738-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M411434200.

Moreover, cDNA encoding for three other splicing forms of IREM-1, named IREM-1 splice variant (Sv)1, Sv2 and Sv3 were cloned by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The gene encoding for IREM-1 contains nine exons, is located on human chromosome 17 (17q25.1) and is homologous to previously identified molecules termed CMRF-35 and IRp60. RT-PCR, northern blot and FACS analysis with specific monoclonal antibodies indicated that IREM-1 is expressed on monocytes, granulocytes, and myeloid leukemia cell lines. Western blot analysis confirmed the recruitment of SHP-1 to IREM-1 and demonstrated that phosphotyrosine residue 205 is the main docking site for this interaction. Finally, cross-linking of IREM-1 results in the inhibition of FcRepsilon-induced activation.

To avoid uncontrolled proliferation, pre-BCR signals transmitted via the adaptor protein SLP-65 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 65 kDa) lead to the down-regulation of pre-BCR expression and to pre-B cell differentiation. Here, we show that, similarly to SLP-65, the adaptor protein LAT (linker for activation of T cells) limits pre-B cell proliferation and reduces the potential of a tumorgenic pre-B cell line to develop leukemia in immune-deficient mice. We further show that the four distal tyrosines are required for LAT activity in pre-B cells. Mutation at Y136 completely abolishes LAT activity, whereas single point-mutations at Y175, Y195 or Y235 impair, but do not block, LAT-induced pre-B cell differentiation. As LAT is also expressed in human pre-B cells, our results suggest that LAT cooperates with SLP-65 to promote the differentiation and control the proliferation of both murine and human pre-B cells.","['Su, Yu-Wen', 'Herzog, Sebastian', 'Lotz, Michael', 'Feldhahn, Niklas', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Jumaa, Hassan']","['Su YW', 'Herzog S', 'Lotz M', 'Feldhahn N', 'Muschen M', 'Jumaa H']","['Institute for Biology III, Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg and Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LAT protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2004/11/19 09:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200425445 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2004 Dec;34(12):3614-22. doi: 10.1002/eji.200425445.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, three structurally different lichen metabolites, protolichesterinic acid (1), lobaric acid (2) and baeomycesic acid (3) were tested for anti-proliferative effects against 12 different human cancer cell lines. All compounds have known in vitro 5-LOX inhibitory activity, and 1 and 2 also inhibit 12-LOX. The activity of the lichen metabolites was compared to that of a specific 5-LOX inhibitor, zileuton (4). The following cancer cell lines were tested: Capan-1, Capan-2 and PANC-1 (all from pancreas), T47-D (breast), PC-3 (prostate), NCI-H1417 (small cell lung), NIH:OVCAR-3 (ovary), AGS (stomach), WiDr (colorectal), HL-60, K-562 and JURKAT (acute promyelocytic, erythro- and T-cell leukemia, respectively). Compound 1 showed the greatest inhibitory effect against all cell lines, with EC50 ranging from 2.4-18.1 microg mL(-1) (7.4-55.8 microM), followed by 2, with EC50 of 15.2 - 65.5 microg mL(-1) (33.2-143.6 microM). The effects of 3 and 4 were of similar orders of magnitude, with EC50 of 28.7 - >80 microg mL(-1) (76.8 - > 213.9 microM) and 12.9 - > 80 microg mL(-1) (50.4 - > 313.7 microM). The dual 5- and 12-LOX inhibitors 1 and to some extent 2 thus exert significant anti-proliferative effects against a variety of human cancer cell lines, while the selective 5-LOX inhibitors 3 and 4 are considerably less active.","['Haraldsdottir, Sigurdis', 'Guolaugsdottir, Erna', 'Ingolfsdottir, Kristin', 'Ogmundsdottir, Helga M']","['Haraldsdottir S', 'Guolaugsdottir E', 'Ingolfsdottir K', 'Ogmundsdottir HM']","['Molecular and Cell Biology Research Laboratory, Icelandic Cancer Society, Reykjavik, Iceland.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Lichens', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2004/11/19 09:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-832657 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2004 Nov;70(11):1098-100. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-832657.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The establishment of cord blood banks worldwide, the increased number of cord blood units frozen, and the shorter time to find a donor, have made it possible to use this source of hematopoietic stem cells to treat more than 2,500 patients. The Eurocord registry was established to study the clinical results of cord blood transplantation and to compare the outcomes of unrelated transplants using either cord blood or bone marrow. Briefly, we have found, in two distinct retrospective analyses of children or adults with acute leukemia given either an unrelated cord blood or bone marrow transplant, that leukemia-free survival and relapse were similar in both types of graft (with adjustment for confounding clinical factors). Cord blood recipients experienced a decreased incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease and delayed hematopoietic recovery compared to bone marrow recipients. To improve the delayed hematopoietic recovery after cord blood transplantation, certain approaches have been investigated such as ex vivo expansion of cord blood cells, double cord blood transplantation and reduced intensity conditioning regimen. We have also attempted to establish some guidelines for cord blood-donor choice based on cord blood cell dose and number of HLA disparities that have been found to be associated with hematopoietic recovery. In conclusion, an unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donor should be simultaneously searched for in cord blood banks and in bone marrow donor registries for patients lacking an HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell donor. The option of performing cord blood transplants should be based on urgency of the transplant, cord blood cell dose and number of HLA disparities.","['Gluckman, Eliane', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Gluckman E', 'Rocha V']","['Hematology-Bone Marrow Transplant Department and Eurocord office, Hospital Saint Louis, 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475 Paris Cedex 10, France. eliane.gluckman@sls.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20040729,Germany,Springer Semin Immunopathol,Springer seminars in immunopathology,7910384,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Blood Banks', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Europe', 'HLA Antigens', 'Hematologic Diseases/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Registries', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement']",2004/11/19 09:00,2005/06/14 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00281-004-0157-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Springer Semin Immunopathol. 2004 Nov;26(1-2):143-54. doi: 10.1007/s00281-004-0157-3.

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (CH-SS)-impregnated central venous catheters (CVCs) to prevent catheter-related colonization and infection in patients with hematological malignancies who were subjected to intensive chemotherapy and suffered from severe and sustained neutropenia. Proven CVC-related bloodstream infection (BSI) was defined as the isolation of the same species from peripheral blood culture and CVC tip (Maki technique). This randomized, prospective clinical trial was carried out in 106 patients and compared catheter-related colonization and BSI using a CH-SS-impregnated CVC (n=51) to a control arm using a standard uncoated triple-lumen CVC (n=55). Patients were treated for acute leukemia (n=89), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=10), and multiple myeloma (n=7). Study groups were balanced regarding to age, sex, underlying diseases, insertion site, and duration of neutropenia. The CVCs were in situ a mean of 14.3+/-8.2 days (mean+/-SD) in the study group versus 16.6+/-9.7 days in the control arm. Catheter-related colonization was observed less frequently in the study group (five vs nine patients; p=0.035). CVC-related BSI were significantly less frequent in the study group (one vs eight patients; p=0.02). In summary, in patients with severe neutropenia, CH-SS-impregnated CVCs yield a significant antibacterial effect resulting in a significantly lower rate of catheter-related colonization as well as CVC-related BSI.","['Jaeger, K', 'Zenz, S', 'Juttner, B', 'Ruschulte, H', 'Kuse, E', 'Heine, J', 'Piepenbrock, S', 'Ganser, A', 'Karthaus, M']","['Jaeger K', 'Zenz S', 'Juttner B', 'Ruschulte H', 'Kuse E', 'Heine J', 'Piepenbrock S', 'Ganser A', 'Karthaus M']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20041110,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['R4KO0DY52L (Chlorhexidine)', 'W46JY43EJR (Silver Sulfadiazine)']",IM,"['Bacteremia/etiology/microbiology', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Catheters, Indwelling/adverse effects', 'Chlorhexidine/*therapeutic use', 'Equipment Contamination/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection Control/*methods', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/microbiology/transmission', 'Serotyping', 'Silver Sulfadiazine/*therapeutic use']",2004/11/19 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0972-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Apr;84(4):258-62. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0972-6.

Although the existence of CSCs in human leukaemia is established, little evidence exists for CSCs in solid tumours, except for breast cancer. Recently, we prospectively isolated a CD133+ cell subpopulation from human brain tumours that exhibited stem cell properties in vitro. However, the true measures of CSCs are their capacity for self renewal and exact recapitulation of the original tumour. Here we report the development of a xenograft assay that identified human brain tumour initiating cells that initiate tumours in vivo. Only the CD133+ brain tumour fraction contains cells that are capable of tumour initiation in NOD-SCID (non-obese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficient) mouse brains. Injection of as few as 100 CD133+ cells produced a tumour that could be serially transplanted and was a phenocopy of the patient's original tumour, whereas injection of 10(5) CD133- cells engrafted but did not cause a tumour. Thus, the identification of brain tumour initiating cells provides insights into human brain tumour pathogenesis, giving strong support for the CSC hypothesis as the basis for many solid tumours, and establishes a previously unidentified cellular target for more effective cancer therapies.","['Singh, Sheila K', 'Hawkins, Cynthia', 'Clarke, Ian D', 'Squire, Jeremy A', 'Bayani, Jane', 'Hide, Takuichiro', 'Henkelman, R Mark', 'Cusimano, Michael D', 'Dirks, Peter B']","['Singh SK', 'Hawkins C', 'Clarke ID', 'Squire JA', 'Bayani J', 'Hide T', 'Henkelman RM', 'Cusimano MD', 'Dirks PB']","['The Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumor Research Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children and University of Toronto, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptides/analysis/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology']",2004/11/19 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature03128 [pii]', '10.1038/nature03128 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2004 Nov 18;432(7015):396-401. doi: 10.1038/nature03128.,,['Nature. 2004 Nov 18;432(7015):281-2.

Current therapy results in event-free survival exceeding 80% for most patients. The development of risk-adapted therapy based on characteristics of the child (age), leukemia (leukocyte count, acquired genetic characteristics) and early response to therapy allows dose intensification for children with higher-risk disease. Much less attention has been given to the role of host variability (pharmacogenetic polymorphism) in determining outcome. This review discusses literature reports in this area and describes some of the challenges facing the field as it moves forward. RECENT FINDINGS: Polymorphisms in many different metabolic pathways have been demonstrated in single gene studies to influence the outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Challenges arise in establishing the generalizability of observations and interpreting complex gene-gene interactions in multigene pathways. Recent studies also illustrate the importance of correlation of clinical associations with biological mechanisms. SUMMARY: Despite significant progress in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, therapy is still unsuccessful in 20% of patients. Further knowledge of and insight into the role of host genetic polymorphisms will improve the results by integrating pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenomic studies in individualizing therapy for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Mehta, Parinda A', 'Davies, Stella M']","['Mehta PA', 'Davies SM']","[""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.

This picture has changed dramatically in the past year with the discovery of frequent mutations involving NOTCH1 in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. RECENT FINDINGS: NOTCH1 point mutations, insertions, and deletions producing aberrant increases in NOTCH1 signaling are frequently present in both childhood and adult T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and are detected in tumors from all major molecular subtypes. These observations are particularly important in the light of experiments using human and murine T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cell lines indicating that NOTCH1 signals are required for sustained growth and, in a subset of lines, survival. This inference is based in part on experiments conducted with small molecule inhibitors of gamma-secretase, a protease required for normal NOTCH signal transduction and the activity of the mutated forms of NOTCH1 found commonly in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. SUMMARY: These findings support a central role for aberrant NOTCH signaling in the pathogenesis of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, and they provide a rationale for trials of NOTCH inhibitors, such as gamma-secretase antagonists, in this aggressive human malignancy.","['Pear, Warren S', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Pear WS', 'Aster JC']","['Abramson Center Cancer Research Institute, Institute for Medicine & Engineering and Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.46 (BACE1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/11/19 09:00,2005/04/01 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['00062752-200411000-00010 [pii]', '10.1097/01.moh.0000143965.90813.70 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2004 Nov;11(6):426-33. doi: 10.1097/01.moh.0000143965.90813.70.,,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the biochemical pathways involved in cell death induced by N3-methyladenine. In the present study, we show that MeOSO(2) (CH(2))(2)-lexitropsin (Me-Lex), a compound generating almost exclusively N3-methyladenine (>99%), provoked a burst of poly(ADP-ribosylation) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in leukemia cells. These events were followed by a marked decrease in nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) expression and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity. Moreover, DNA damage generated by N3-methyladenine induced a marked decrease in telomerase in the cytosol that was accompanied by a transient up-regulation of activity in the nucleus, as a consequence of nuclear translocation of telomerase in response to genotoxic damage. PARP-1 inhibition blocked ADP-ribose polymer formation, preserved mitochondrial membrane integrity, and counteracted the reduction of NF-kappaB activity, thus preventing the appearance of necrosis. On the other hand, because PARP-1 is a component of the base excision repair (BER), the combination of Me-Lex + PARP-1 inhibitor triggered apoptosis as a result of disruption of BER process. In conclusion, the present study provides new insight into the cellular response to N3-adenine-selective methylating agents that can be exploited for the treatment of tumors unresponsive to classical wide-spectrum methylating agents. Moreover, the results underline the central and paradoxical role of PARP-1 in cell death induced by N3-methyladenine: effector of necrosis and coordinator of methylpurine repair.","['Tentori, Lucio', 'Forini, Olindo', 'Fossile, Emanuela', 'Muzi, Alessia', 'Vergati, Matteo', 'Portarena, Ilaria', 'Amici, Carla', 'Gold, Barry', 'Graziani, Grazia']","['Tentori L', 'Forini O', 'Fossile E', 'Muzi A', 'Vergati M', 'Portarena I', 'Amici C', 'Gold B', 'Graziani G']","['Department of Neuroscience, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041117,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*drug effects/*enzymology/genetics', 'DNA/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/physiology', 'Telomerase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2004/11/19 09:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.104.004937 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.104.004937 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2005 Feb;67(2):572-81. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.004937.

A humanized anti-CD33 antibody (Mylotarg) showed a limited response rate in relapsed AML. To discover novel AML antibody targets, we selected a panel of single chain Fv fragments using phage display technology combined with flow cytometry on AML tumor samples. One selected single chain Fv fragment broadly reacted with AML samples and with myeloid cell lineages within peripheral blood. Expression cloning identified the antigen recognized as C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1), a previously undescribed transmembrane glycoprotein. CLL-1 expression was analyzed with a human anti-CLL-1 antibody that was generated from the single chain Fv fragment. CLL-1 is restricted to the hematopoietic lineage, in particular to myeloid cells present in peripheral blood and bone marrow. CLL-1 is absent on uncommitted CD34(+)/CD38(-) or CD34(+)/CD33(-) stem cells and present on subsets of CD34(+)/CD38(+) or CD34(+)/CD33(+) progenitor cells. CLL-1 is not expressed in any other tissue. In contrast, analysis of primary AMLs demonstrated CLL-1 expression in 92% (68 of 74) of the samples. As an AML marker, CLL-1 was able to complement CD33, because 67% (8 of 12) of the CD33(-) AMLs expressed CLL-1. CLL-1 showed variable expression (10-60%) in CD34(+) cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome but was absent in 12 of 13 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The AML reactivity combined with the restricted expression on normal cells identifies CLL-1 as a novel potential target for AML treatment.","['Bakker, Alexander B H', 'van den Oudenrijn, Sonja', 'Bakker, Arjen Q', 'Feller, Nicole', 'van Meijer, Marja', 'Bia, Judith A', 'Jongeneelen, Mandy A C', 'Visser, Therese J', 'Bijl, Nora', 'Geuijen, Cecilia A W', 'Marissen, Wilfred E', 'Radosevic, Katarina', 'Throsby, Mark', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'de Kruif, John', 'Goudsmit, Jaap', 'Kruisbeek, Ada M']","['Bakker AB', 'van den Oudenrijn S', 'Bakker AQ', 'Feller N', 'van Meijer M', 'Bia JA', 'Jongeneelen MA', 'Visser TJ', 'Bijl N', 'Geuijen CA', 'Marissen WE', 'Radosevic K', 'Throsby M', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'de Kruif J', 'Goudsmit J', 'Kruisbeek AM']","['Crucell Holland B.V., Leiden, The Netherlands. l.bakker@crucell.com']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",2004/11/19 09:00,2005/02/25 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/22/8443 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1659 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Nov 15;64(22):8443-50. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1659.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulation of Pim-2 expression has been documented in several human malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Here, we show that the ability of Pim-2 to promote survival of cells is dependent on nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. Pim-2 activates NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression by inducing phosphorylation of the oncogenic serine/threonine kinase Cot, leading to both augmentation of IkappaB kinase activity and a shift in nuclear NF-kappaB from predominantly p50 homodimers to p50/p65 heterodimers. Blockade of NF-kappaB function eliminates Pim-2-mediated survival in both cell lines and primary cells, and both Cot phosphorylation and expression are required for the prosurvival effects of Pim-2. Although Pim-2 cooperates with Myc to promote growth factor-independent cell proliferation, this feature is abrogated by NF-kappaB blockade. The ability of Pim-2 to serve as an oncogene in vivo depends on sustained NF-kappaB activity. Thus, the transcriptional induction of Pim-2 initiates a novel NF-kappaB activation pathway that regulates cell survival.","['Hammerman, Peter S', 'Fox, Casey J', 'Cinalli, Ryan M', 'Xu, Anne', 'Wagner, John D', 'Lindsten, Tullia', 'Thompson, Craig B']","['Hammerman PS', 'Fox CJ', 'Cinalli RM', 'Xu A', 'Wagner JD', 'Lindsten T', 'Thompson CB']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6160, USA.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pim2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology']",2004/11/19 09:00,2005/02/25 09:00,['2004/11/19 09:00'],"['2004/11/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/22/8341 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2284 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Nov 15;64(22):8341-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2284.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major component of the ECM of developing nervous tissue, TN-C was expressed in zones of proliferation, migration and morphogenesis. Examination of TN-C knockout mice showed roles for TN-C in control of OPC proliferation and migration towards zones of myelination [E. Garcion et al. (2001) Development, 128, 2485-2496]. Extending our studies of TN-C effects on OPC development we found that OPCs can endogenously express TN-C protein. This expression covered the whole range of possible TN-C isoforms and could be strongly up-regulated by leukaemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor, cytokines known to modulate OPC proliferation and survival. Comparative analysis of TN-C knockout OPCs with wild-type OPCs reveals an accelerated rate of maturation in the absence of TN-C, with earlier morphological differentiation and precocious expression of myelin basic protein. TN-C knockout OPCs plated on poly-lysine displayed higher levels of apoptosis than wild-type OPCs and there was also an earlier loss of responsiveness to the protective effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), indicating that TN-C has anti-apoptotic effects that may be associated with PDGF signalling. The existence of mechanisms to compensate for the absence of TN-C in the knockout is indicated by the development of oligodendrocytes derived from TN-C knockout neurospheres.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which As(2)O(3) initiates cellular signaling toward cell death are still unclear. In the present study, the effects of As(2)O(3) on NF-kappaB and COX-2 expression in HL-60 cells were investigated. As(2)O(3) suppressed DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB composed of p65/p50 heterodimer through preventing the degradation of IkappaB-alpha and the nuclear translocation of p65 subsequently as well as interrupting the binding of NF-kappaB with their consensus sequences. Inhibitory effect of As(2)O(3) on NF-kappaB DNA activity was dependent upon intracellular glutathione (GSH) and H(2)O(2) level, but not superoxide anion. Futhermore, we found that As(2)O(3) also downregulated the expression of COX-2, which has NF-kappaB binding site on its promoter through repressing the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity.","['Han, Seong-Su', 'Kim, Kihyun', 'Hahm, Eun-Ryeong', 'Park, Chan H', 'Kimler, Bruce F', 'Lee, Sook J', 'Lee, Se-Hoon', 'Kim, Won S', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Park, Keunchil', 'Kim, Jingook', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Lee, Je-Ho', 'Park, Seyeon']","['Han SS', 'Kim K', 'Hahm ER', 'Park CH', 'Kimler BF', 'Lee SJ', 'Lee SH', 'Kim WS', 'Jung CW', 'Park K', 'Kim J', 'Yoon SS', 'Lee JH', 'Park S']","['Samsung Medical Center and Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 135-710, Korea.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'NF-kappa B/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects']",2004/11/18 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2004/11/18 09:00'],"['2004/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20337 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 Mar 1;94(4):695-707. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20337.,,,,,,,,,['J Cell Biochem. 2005 Apr 1;94(5):1068'],,,,,,,,,,

In January 2002, 2 patients with leukemia (Patients 1 and 2) developed pulmonary TB after recent exposure at 3 hospitals (Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital C) and at a residential facility for patients with cancer. Neither was known to have LTBI. Within 1 year, 3 other patients with malignancy and TB disease had been identified at these facilities, prompting an investigation of healthcare facility-associated transmission of M. tuberculosis. METHODS: The authors performed genotypic analysis of the five available M. tuberculosis isolates from patients with malignancies at these facilities, reviewed medical records, interviewed individuals who had identical M. tuberculosis genotypic patterns, and performed tuberculin skin testing (TST) and case finding for possible exposed contacts. RESULTS: Only Patients 1 and 2 had identical genotypic patterns. Neither patient had baseline TST results available. Patient 1 had clinical evidence of infectiousness 3 months before the diagnosis of TB was ascertained. Among employee contacts of Patient 1, TST conversions occurred in 1 of 59 (2%), 2 of 34 (6%), 2 of 32 (6%), and 0 of 8 who were tested at Hospitals A, B, and C and at the residential facility, respectively. Among the others who were exposed to Patient 1, 1 of 31 (3%), 1 of 30 (3%), 0 of 40 (0%), and 12 of 136 (9%) who were tested had positive TSTs at Hospitals A, B, and C and at the residential facility, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed TB diagnosis in 2 patients with leukemia resulted in the transmission of M. tuberculosis to 19 patients and staff at 3 hospitals and a residential facility. Baseline TB screening and earlier clinical recognition of active disease could reduce healthcare facility-associated transmission of M. tuberculosis among patients with malignancy.","['Malone, Joseph L', 'Ijaz, Kashef', 'Lambert, Lauren', 'Rosencrans, Louie', 'Phillips, Lynelle', 'Tomlinson, Victor', 'Arbise, Michael', 'Moolenaar, Ronald L', 'Dworkin, Mark S', 'Simoes, Eduardo J']","['Malone JL', 'Ijaz K', 'Lambert L', 'Rosencrans L', 'Phillips L', 'Tomlinson V', 'Arbise M', 'Moolenaar RL', 'Dworkin MS', 'Simoes EJ']","['Epidemic Intelligence Service-State Branch, Division of Applied Public Health Training, Epidemiology Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. joseph.malone@na.amedd.army.mil']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contact Tracing', '*Cross Infection', 'Female', '*Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Professional-to-Patient', 'Leukemia/complications/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Neoplasms/*complications/microbiology', '*Residential Facilities', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/complications/*transmission']",2004/11/18 09:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/11/18 09:00'],"['2004/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20698 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Dec 15;101(12):2713-21. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20698.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We reviewed the presenting characteristics, initial management, and frequency and type of complications in all children seen at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with previously untreated ALL and an initial leukocyte count >200 x 10(9)/L. RESULTS: A total of 178 children, representing 8% of all children with ALL, had an initial leukocyte count >200 x 10(9)/L; 67 patients had a leukocyte count >400 x 10(9)/L. Sixteen patients (9%) had neurological complications with 12 of these patients experiencing symptoms at presentation. Four patients (2%), all with initial leukocyte counts >400 x 10(9)/L, suffered a CNS hemorrhage. Pulmonary leukostasis occurred in 11 patients (6%). The degree of hyperleukocytosis was significantly predictive of neurological (P = 0.006) and respiratory (P = 0.014) complications. The majority of complications occurred at presentation. Cytoreduction (94 patients) decreased the leukocyte count but delayed initiation of chemotherapy (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Serious leukostasis-related complications are relatively uncommon in childhood ALL and most occur at presentation. Their incidence increases in proportion to the leukocyte count. A large subset of cases can be managed successfully without cytoreduction. Cytoreduction may be considered for patients with leukocyte counts >400 x 10(9)/L or patients who have complications at presentation.","['Lowe, Eric J', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hancock, Michael L', 'Geiger, Terrence L', 'Khan, Raja B', 'Sandlund, John T']","['Lowe EJ', 'Pui CH', 'Hancock ML', 'Geiger TL', 'Khan RB', 'Sandlund JT']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. eric.lowe@stjude.org""]",['eng'],,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Reduction Procedures', 'Leukocytosis/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Leukostasis/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Lung Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Tennessee/epidemiology']",2004/11/18 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2004/11/18 09:00'],"['2004/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20178 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jul;45(1):10-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20178.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of common thrombophilic traits of the East Mediterranean Region, among native Cretan children treated for malignancy. METHODS: Blood samples were consecutively collected from 31 native Cretan children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 19) or other malignancies (n = 12) over 3 years. A molecular diagnosis based on the presence of Factor V Leiden (FVL), as well as on PT G20210A and MTHFR C677T mutation (in 14 patients) using PCR was applied. Patients who had central venous catheters (n = 29) were treated with an intensified thromboprophylaxis protocol that had been previously established in our institution. RESULTS: The prevalence of the FVL mutation was 19.4% (95% CI = 5-32). The allele frequency is estimated at 11.3% (95% CI: 3.5-19.1) which is higher than that reported for the population of the mainland of Greece. The prevalence of the PT G20210A and MTHFR C677T mutation was 14.3 and 71.4%, respectively (corresponding allele frequencies 7.1 and 50%, respectively). Only one patient developed thrombosis, having although no thrombophilic trait. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombophilic traits were relatively common in this group of native Cretan children treated for malignancy.

Aberrant expression or mutation of c-kit has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of many cancers. Studies using imatinib mesylate (STI 571, Gleevec, Novartis, East Hannover, NJ, USA), an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases brc-abl, c-kit, and PDGFR, have shown significant response in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. With the aim of identifying additional groups of tumors that may use the stem cell factor/c-kit pathway and, secondarily, may be responsive to imatinib mesylate treatment, we looked at the expression of c-kit in medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma, a highly invasive primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the cerebellum, is the most common, malignant central nervous system tumor of childhood. Histologic features of medulloblastoma have failed to provide an accurate prediction of the clinical-biological behavior of these tumors. Characterizing the genetic events that play a role in the biology of these tumors may allow for molecular sub-typing and could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This study evaluated c-kit expression and mutational status in 10 medulloblastoma tumor samples. All 10 medulloblastoma tumors expressed c-kit by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and 9 by immunohistochemical analysis. All tumor samples were screened for mutations in exons 9, 11, and 13 of the c-kit gene by direct sequencing. No sequence abnormalities were detected in these exons.

P-glycoprotein 170 (MDR1), a cellular drug efflux pump, is thought to be one of the major causes of MDR. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate in 85 children with ALL the impact of the MDR1 product of the mdr-1 gene on the achievement of complete remission (CR) and outcome. MDR1 protein expression was performed by immunocytochemistry (ICC), and flow cytometry (FC). MDR1 functional activity was performed by a rhodamine (Rhd)-123 efflux test with or without verapamil. All patients enrolled in our study were treated with AIEOP ALL 91-95 protocols. At diagnosis, 40 patients (47%) expressed MDR1 protein at significant levels, and 45 (53%) were MDR1 negative. Forty-three of the latter patients were also negative for MDR1 function, while 34/40 (85%) patients MDR1 positive preserved the function. Rhd-123 efflux was inhibited by the MDR modulator verapamil in 12/40 (30%) patients. After induction treatment, CR was achieved in 77/85 children (90.6%). All patients who did not achieve CR were MDR1 positive. Twenty-nine patients relapsed, 17 (58.6%) of whom were MDR1 positive. The 10-year overall survival (OS) rate, and disease-free survival (DFS) for MDR1 negative patients compared to MDR1 positive patients were 75.7% versus 54.8%, and 67.5% versus 46%, respectively. The 10-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was significantly higher (67.5% versus 36.8%) in the MDR1 negative group compared with the MDR1 positive population (p=0.001).

The LCS decreased significantly from 69.7 to 54.0% when blasts were exposed to G-CSF 21 h prior to incubation with ara-C (p=0.01). In contrast, LCS increased significantly (from 55.6 to 69.0%; p=0.04) after sequential exposure to G-CSF and fludarabine. Exposure to 4 combinations of fludarabine (4 h; 0.14 microM and 0.55 microM) and ara-C (96 h; 0.21 and 0.82 microM) (FLA) resulted in additive cytotoxicity.

Since onconase is currently in phase III clinical trials tested in treatment of mesothelioma, much emphasis has been placed on the mechanism of its anti-tumor activity. Previous studies have shown that onconase-responsive cells become arrested at the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle and also undergo apoptosis. A proposed mechanism for these effects is that the enzymatic activity of onconase targets cellular RNAs, in particular tRNA, with an accompanying inhibition of protein synthesis. In the present study, we have investigated the time- and dose-dependent effects of onconase on growth of Jurkat SN acute T-lymphocytic leukemia cells. Significant suppression of cell proliferation became evident after 72 and 96 h of treatment, and was most pronounced at the highest concentration (10 microg/ml; 8.3x10(-7) M) of onconase. This reduction of cell proliferation, however, was not accompanied by measurable changes in distribution of cells at different phases of the cell cycle, but was paralleled by the induction of apoptosis, as assayed by flow cytometry, and with a modest decrease in the expression of a cell cycle regulatory retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Further biochemical analysis revealed that growth suppression was closely coordinated with a down-regulation in the steady state and subcellular distribution of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor known to be functionally associated with cell survival. The reduction in expression of NF-kappaB by onconase appeared to coincide or even precede growth suppression, suggesting a causal relationship. To further test the hypothesis that cellular localization and expression of NF-kappaB may be critical to cellular response to onconase, we also studied the growth effects of onconase in Jurkat-BalphaM cells, which, unlike the parent SN T cells, contain a stably transfected dominant-negative IkappaB gene. Growth suppression by onconase in BalphaM cells was more pronounced and occurred earlier compared to SN cells, although still did not affect changes in cell cycle phase distribution. Contrary to expectation, however, diminution in NF-kappaB expression by onconase was even more pronounced in BalphaM cells, suggesting that this transcription factor, while presumably prevented from dissociation from its inhibitory protein IkappaB in these cells, is even more efficiently targeted for degradation by onconase. These results implicate NF-kappaB and its turnover as important determinants in the anti-proliferative/apoptotic effects of onconase in acute T-lymphocytic leukemia cells.","['Tsai, Shwu Y', 'Ardelt, Barbara', 'Hsieh, Tze-Chen', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew', 'Shogen, Kuslima', 'Wu, Joseph M']","['Tsai SY', 'Ardelt B', 'Hsieh TC', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Shogen K', 'Wu JM']","['Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.']",['eng'],,"['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028704-26/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Egg Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'ZE15FIT23E (ranpirnase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Egg Proteins', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/*pharmacology']",2004/11/18 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2004/11/18 09:00'],"['2004/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2004 Dec;25(6):1745-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Foam cell formation is a key event in atherogenesis, and apoptosis of these lipid-laden cells may promote plaque destabilization.

We studied the effect of IL-10 on oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-stimulated THP-1 cells and monocyte-derived macrophages from ACS patients and healthy controls using different experimental approaches. Our main findings were: i) IL-10 enhances lipid accumulation in oxLDL-stimulated THP-1 macrophages, at least partly by counteracting oxLDL-induced apoptosis; ii) This antiapoptotic effect of IL-10 involves increased expression of the antiapoptotic genes Bfl-1 and Mcl-1, accompanied by protective effects on mitochondria function; iii) By silencing Bfl-1 and Mcl-1 genes using siRNAs, we were able to abolish this IL-10-mediated effect on lipid accumulation; iv) IL-10 also induced lipid accumulation in oxLDL-stimulated macrophages from patients with ACS, but not in macrophages from healthy controls; v) In ACS patients, this enhancing effect of IL-10 on lipid accumulation was accompanied by enhanced Mcl-1 expression. No such antiapoptotic effect was seen in macrophages from healthy controls.

DESIGN: A cohort study was focused on the fallout of caesium-137 in relation to cancer incidence 1988-1996. SETTING: In northern Sweden, affected by the Chernobyl accident in 1986, 450 parishes were categorised by caesium-137 deposition: < 3 (reference), 3-29, 30-39, 40-59, 60-79, and 80-120 kiloBecquerel/m(2). PARTICIPANTS: All people 0-60 years living in these parishes in 1986 to 1987 were identified and enrolled in a cohort of 1 143 182 persons. In the follow up 22 409 incident cancer cases were retrieved in 1988-1996. A further analysis focused on the secular trend. MAIN RESULTS: Taking age and population density as confounding factors, and lung cancer incidence in 1988-1996 and total cancer incidence in 1986-1987 by municipality as proxy confounders for smoking and time trends, respectively, the adjusted relative risks for the deposition categories were 1.00 (reference < 3 kiloBecquerel/m(2)), 1.05, 1.03, 1.08, 1.10, and 1.21. The excess relative risk was 0.11 per 100 kiloBecquerel/m(2) (95% CI 0.03 to 0.20). Considering the secular trend, directly age standardised cancer incidence rate differences per 100 000 person years between 1988 to 1996 and the reference period 1986-1987, were 30.3 (indicating a time trend in the reference category), 36.8, 42.0, 45.8, 50.1, and 56.4. No clear excess occurred for leukaemia or thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Unless attributable to chance or remaining uncontrolled confounding, a slight exposure related increase in total cancer incidence has occurred in northern Sweden after the Chernobyl accident.","['Tondel, Martin', 'Hjalmarsson, Peter', 'Hardell, Lennart', 'Carlsson, Goran', 'Axelson, Olav']","['Tondel M', 'Hjalmarsson P', 'Hardell L', 'Carlsson G', 'Axelson O']","['Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, 581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.

Thirty-two patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation were prospectively evaluated for bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) after a median period of 12.2 months. Then, 15 of the patients with osteoporosis or rapidly progressing osteopenia (bone loss > 5%/yr) received three monthly doses of 4 mg zoledronic acid iv. Fifteen patients were followed up without treatment, and all 30 patients were reevaluated after 12 months for BMD and bone turnover markers. By using enriched mesenchymal stem cells in the colony-forming units fibroblast (CFU-F) assay, we evaluated the osteogenic stromal lineage. This procedure was performed in both groups of patients at study entry and after 12 months. The average BMD loss was 3.42% at LS and 3.8% at FN during a 1-yr longitudinal evaluation in 32 patients. Subsequently, BMD increased at both LS and FN (9.8 and 6.4%, respectively) in the zoledronic acid-treated cohort. Hydroxyproline excretion decreased, and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase increased significantly, whereas serum osteocalcin increase did not reach the limit of significance. A significant increase in CFU-F growth in vitro was induced by in vivo zoledronic acid administration. In the untreated group, no significant change was observed in bone turnover markers, LS BMD (-2.1%), FN BMD (-2.3%), and CFU-F colony number. In conclusion, short-term zoledronic acid treatment consistently improved both LS and FN BMD in transplanted patients who were at high risk for fast and/or persistent bone loss, partly by increasing the osteogenic progenitors in the stromal cell compartment.","['Tauchmanova, Libuse', 'Ricci, Patrizia', 'Serio, Bianca', 'Lombardi, Gaetano', 'Colao, Annamaria', 'Rotoli, Bruno', 'Selleri, Carmine']","['Tauchmanova L', 'Ricci P', 'Serio B', 'Lombardi G', 'Colao A', 'Rotoli B', 'Selleri C']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Endocrinology, Federico II University of Naples, Via S.

In a prophylactic study with a new agent, fluconazole or itraconazole oral solution represent good choices for the comparator because they are proven better than placebo or oral nonabsorbable antifungal agents in reducing the risk of invasive fungal infections in patients with acute leukemia. Because prophylaxis is most valuable when the risk of infection is high, patients with well-understood risk factors (severe mucosal disruption caused by chemotherapy, impaired cell-mediated immunity caused by steroids or fludarabine, use of a central venous catheter, and colonization by Candida species) should be selected. The end points for antifungal prophylactic trials should focus on proven and probable invasive fungal infections. Superficial and mucosal fungal infections do not represent a primary end point for these studies. Poor compliance should be considered as an interruption of treatment due to side effects and should be included in the criteria for failure. Fungus-related mortality should be evaluated as a failure of prophylaxis, whereas overall mortality may be influenced by many other cofactors.

METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant AC versus AC+T chemotherapy. RT was required if breast-conserving surgery was performed but was elective after mastectomy. Information about RT delivery was retrospectively collected. Cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence (LRR), use of elective RT, and RT delivery were compared between treatment arms. RESULTS: For patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and RT, the 5-year cumulative incidence of isolated LRR was 9.7% in the AC arm and 3.7% in the AC+T arm (P = .04) and of LRR as any component of failure was 12.9% versus 6.1%, respectively (P = .04). Although LRR rates in patients who did not receive postmastectomy RT were lower in the AC+T arm, the difference was not statistically significant. Despite the lack of protocol guidelines, RT use did not differ between arms, nor did RT dose, treatment interruption, or completion. CONCLUSION: Despite the delay to RT during additional chemotherapy, adjuvant AC+T afforded better local control than AC alone in patients treated with breast-conserving therapy. Addition of paclitaxel did not adversely affect delivery or ability to tolerate RT, as indicated by similar rates of completion of timely, full-dose RT between arms.","['Sartor, Carolyn I', 'Peterson, Bercedis L', 'Woolf, Susan', 'Fitzgerald, Thomas J', 'Laurie, Frances', 'Turrisi, Andrew J', 'Bogart, Jeff', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Norton, Larry']","['Sartor CI', 'Peterson BL', 'Woolf S', 'Fitzgerald TJ', 'Laurie F', 'Turrisi AJ', 'Bogart J', 'Henderson IC', 'Norton L']","['Dept of Radiation Oncology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, CB7512, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. csartor@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041115,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'AC protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Elective Surgical Procedures', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mastectomy', 'Mastectomy, Segmental', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage', 'Radiotherapy/methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",2004/11/17 09:00,2005/01/29 09:00,['2004/11/17 09:00'],"['2004/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.12.044 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.12.044 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jan 1;23(1):30-40. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.12.044.

Remarkably, TRAF2DN/Bcl-2 double-transgenic mice contained B cell populations similar to those observed in TRAF2DN mice. However, over time, they developed severe splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, and most animals also developed leukemia, pleural effusion, and, in some cases, ascites associated with monoclonal and oligoclonal B cell neoplasms. The life span of TRAF2DN/Bcl-2 mice was markedly reduced compared with Bcl-2 and TRAF2DN single-transgenics or wild-type littermates. The expanded B cell population of TRAF2DN/Bcl-2 double-transgenic mice was primarily comprised of small/medium-size noncycling B220(M)/IgM(H)/IgD(L)/CD21(L)/CD23(NULL)/CD11b(+)/CD5+ cells that were Bcl-6-negative, consistent with a B-1 phenotype. The cells also expressed high levels of CD54 and other adhesion molecules. In vitro, these B cells showed comparable proliferation rates to those of wild-type counterparts but exhibited markedly increased survival and were resistant to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents and glucocorticoids. Histopathologic features were consistent with mouse small B cell lymphoma progressing to leukemia with many similarities to human chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Given that many human chronic lymphocytic leukemias overexpress TRAF1 and Bcl-2, our findings suggest that cooperation between Bcl-2 and TRAF pathways contributes to the development of this type of leukemia.","['Zapata, Juan M', 'Krajewska, Maryla', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd', 'Choi, Yongwon', 'Reed, John C']","['Zapata JM', 'Krajewska M', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Choi Y', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. jzapata@burnham.org']",['eng'],,"['P01 CA069381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041115,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/metabolism', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Deletion', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology']",2004/11/17 09:00,2004/12/28 09:00,['2004/11/17 09:00'],"['2004/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['0407541101 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0407541101 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Nov 23;101(47):16600-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0407541101.

Transcription of renin genes is subject to complex developmental and tissue-specific regulation. Progress has been made recently in elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in renin gene expression. Using mouse As4.1 cells, which have many features characteristic of the renin-expressing juxtaglomerular cells of kidney, a proximal promoter region (-197 to -50 bp) and an enhancer (-2866 to -2625 bp) have been identified in the mouse renin gene, Ren-1(c), that are critical for its expression. The proximal promoter region contains at least 7 transcription factor-binding sites, including a binding site for the products of Hox, developmental control genes. The enhancer consists of at least 11 transcription factor-binding sites and is responsive to various signal transduction pathways, including cAMP, retinoic acid, endothelin-1, and cytokines, to alter renin mRNA levels. Sequence highly homologous to the mouse enhancer is also found in the human and rat renin genes. How these regulatory regions function in vivo will be the focus of future study.","['Pan, Li', 'Gross, Kenneth W']","['Pan L', 'Gross KW']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263-0001, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA-16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL48459/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",20041115,United States,Hypertension,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",7906255,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Liver X Receptors)', '0 (Orphan Nuclear Receptors)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)']",IM,"['Angiotensin II/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chorion/cytology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Juxtaglomerular Apparatus/cytology/metabolism', 'Kidney Neoplasms/pathology', 'Liver X Receptors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Orphan Nuclear Receptors', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Renin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2004/11/17 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2004/11/17 09:00'],"['2004/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['01.HYP.0000149717.55920.45 [pii]', '10.1161/01.HYP.0000149717.55920.45 [doi]']",ppublish,Hypertension. 2005 Jan;45(1):3-8. doi: 10.1161/01.HYP.0000149717.55920.45.

Cells were Gram-negative, motile, non-sporulating, straight to curved rods with one polar flagellum and had a strictly respiratory metabolism with O(2) as the preferential terminal electron acceptor. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that all strains clustered within the Xanthomonadaceae branch of the Proteobacteria. Isolates AMX 26B(T) and UR374_02 exhibited 100 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and both were related to strain 12-3(T) (99.6 % similarity). The closest relative of all the isolates was Pseudoxanthomonas broegbernensis DSM 12573(T) (similarity 97.1-97.5 %), and they were equidistantly related to Xanthomonas species (95.4-96.6 %), Stenotrophomonas species (95.3-96.1 %) and Pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis ATCC BAA-4040(T) (95.3-95.4 %). Chemotaxonomic and biochemical data (branched-chain cellular fatty acid pattern without C(13 : 0) iso 3-OH, ubiquinone with eight isoprenoid units, limited range of substrates used, ability to reduce nitrite but not nitrate with the production of N(2)O) supported their affiliation to the genus Pseudoxanthomonas. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and/or phenotypic analysis allowed them to be differentiated from the two Pseudoxanthomonas species with validly published names and showed that strain 12-3(T) was genomically and phenotypically distinct from the other two isolates. On the basis of these results, two novel species of the genus Pseudoxanthomonas are proposed: Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana sp. nov., consisting of strains AMX 26B(T) (=ATCC 700993(T)=CIP 106674(T)=JCM 11524(T)) (type strain) and UR374_02 (=DSM 15133), and Pseudoxanthomonas japonensis sp. nov., consisting of strain 12-3(T) (=CCUG 48231(T)=CIP 107388(T)=JCM 11525(T)).

Pre-B and common ALL are frequent, while T-cell lineage ALL is under-represented in elderly populations as compared with younger adults. The frequency of Philadelphia chromosome seems also to increase with age and adversely influences complete remission (CR) and survival rates. Poor performance status, co-morbidity factors and early mortality during intensive induction chemotherapy are the main reasons for poor outcome. Few reports on effectiveness and toxicity of therapeutic regimens involving exclusively elderly patients with ALL have been published and only some of them were prospective studies. Age-adapted approaches with less aggressive chemotherapy have been applied. The overall response ranged from 12 to 85%.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), the major intracellular oxidants, may be a determinant of cellular susceptibility to arsenic. Our previous studies showed that a naphthoquinone and an anthraquinone (emodin) displayed the capability of producing ROS and facilitating arsenic cytotoxicity in both leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. We therefore attempted to test emodin and several other kinds of anthraquinone derivatives on EC/CUHK1, a cell line derived from esophageal carcinoma, and on a nude mouse model, with regard to their effects and mechanisms. Results showed that anthraquinones could produce ROS and sensitize tumor cells to arsenic both in vivo and in vitro. The combination of emodin and arsenic promoted the major apoptotic signaling events, i.e., the collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspases 9 and 3. Meanwhile a combination of emodin and arsenic suppressed the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB and downregulated the expression of a NF-kappaB-specific antiapoptotic protein, survivin. These two aspects could be antagonized by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Therefore anthraquinones exert their effects via a ROS-mediated dual regulation, i.e., the enhancement of proapoptosis and the simultaneous inhibition of antiapoptosis. In vivo study showed that emodin made the EC/CUHK1 cell-derived tumors more sensitive to arsenic trioxide with no additional systemic toxicity and side effects. Taken together, these results suggest an innovative and safe chemotherapeutic strategy that uses natural anthraquinone derivatives as ROS generators to increase the susceptibility of tumor cells to cytotoxic therapeutic agents.","['Yang, Jie', 'Li, Hui', 'Chen, Yu-Ying', 'Wang, Xiao-Jing', 'Shi, Gui-Ying', 'Hu, Qing-Shen', 'Kang, Xun-Lei', 'Lu, Yang', 'Tang, Xue-Ming', 'Guo, Qiang-Su', 'Yi, Jing']","['Yang J', 'Li H', 'Chen YY', 'Wang XJ', 'Shi GY', 'Hu QS', 'Kang XL', 'Lu Y', 'Tang XM', 'Guo QS', 'Yi J']","['Department of Cell Biology, Shanghai Second Medical University, 280 Chongqing Road, Shanghai 200025, China. yijing@shsmu.edu.cn']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Emodin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2004/11/17 09:00,2005/11/04 09:00,['2004/11/17 09:00'],"['2004/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(04)00741-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.09.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2004 Dec 15;37(12):2027-41. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.09.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose was to investigate the degree of expression of the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 (Bcl-2) protein in sputum eosinophils during acute asthma exacerbation and its relationship with exacerbation severity. METHODS: Sputum was obtained from 33 asthmatic children and 15 healthy children as a control group. Patients were studied during an acute asthma exacerbation. They were classified according to the severity of exacerbation into mild, moderate and severe (n=11 for each). Patients with severe exacerbation were followed up until remission and another sputum sample was obtained. Number of sputum eosinophils was expressed as percentage of leucocytes. Bcl-2 expression in sputum eosinophils was assessed by immunohistochemical staining techniques; the results were expressed as percentage of positively stained cells over total eosinophils. RESULTS: Sputum eosinophils and Bcl-2(+) eosinophils' percentages were significantly higher in patients with acute exacerbation than controls (P<0.01). Patients with severe exacerbation had significantly higher sputum Bcl-2(+) eosinophils' percentage than those with mild-to-moderate exacerbation (mean+/-SD=42.4+/-31.96% vs. 5.7+/-14.5%, P<0.01). A significant negative correlation was found between Bcl-2(+) eosinophils' percentage and peak expiratory flow rate % predicted (P<0.05). After remission, patients with severe exacerbation showed a significant decrease of Bcl-2(+) eosinophils' percentage (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Bcl-2 prolongs survival and decreases apoptosis of airway eosinophils in asthma especially during exacerbation. Eosinophil apoptosis and Bcl-2 represent a target for new and effective therapeutic strategies of asthma.","['El-Gamal, Y', 'Heshmat, N', 'Mahran, M', 'El-Gabbas, Z']","['El-Gamal Y', 'Heshmat N', 'Mahran M', 'El-Gabbas Z']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. yehiamelgamal@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Apoptosis', 'Asthma/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Peak Expiratory Flow Rate', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sputum/cytology/*metabolism']",2004/11/17 09:00,2005/04/14 09:00,['2004/11/17 09:00'],"['2004/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEA2089 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2222.2004.02089.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2004 Nov;34(11):1701-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2004.02089.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those produced by the CD4+ Th1 subset induce cell-mediated immunity, whereas those produced by the CD4+ Th2 subset are more efficient at stimulating immunoglobulin production. The goal of cytokine immunotherapy is prevention or reduction of disease progression through stimulation of cell-mediated immunity (i.e., immune reconstitution) by administration of an exogenous Th1 cytokine such as interleukin-2 (IL-2). Cytokine immunotherapy has its origins in cancer immunobiology where IL-2 has been used successfully to manage several human cancers (metastatic melanoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma). More recent work has demonstrated cytokine immunotherapy to be effective at improving immune responses in patients with HIV-1 disease. To explore cytokine immunotherapy for sight-threatening AIDS-related human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) retinitis, we developed a mouse model of experimental murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) retinitis that employs mice with MAIDS, a retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome. Systemic cytokine immunotherapy with IL-2, but not with interleukin-12 (IL-12), provides absolute protection against MAIDS-related MCMV retinitis by stimulation of the perforin-mediated pathway of cytotoxicity used by natural killer cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to kill virus-infected cells. Our findings warrant additional studies on the use of cytokine immunotherapy for management of HCMV retinitis (and possibly other opportunistic infections) during HIV-1-induced immunodeficiency. We envision systemic cytokine immunotherapy as an altemative or adjunct to traditional antiviral chemotherapy for optimal management of AIDS-related HCMV retinitis.","['Dix, Richard D', 'Cousins, Scott W']","['Dix RD', 'Cousins SW']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Jones Eye Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205, USA.

We show here that these factors interact in U-937 leukemia cells induced to apoptosis with anticancer drugs, etoposide and adriamycin (ADR). The protective effect of Hsp70 was verified using 2 approaches: mild heat stress and transfection-mediated overexpression of the Hsp70 gene. The increase in Hsp70 levels attained by these 2 methods was found to postpone caspase activation for 12-18 hours. An in vitro assay was developed using mouse myeloma NS0/1 cells, which lack the expression of Hsp70. Measurement of DEVD-ase activity in extracts of apoptotic NS0/1 cells incubated with purified Hsp70 showed that Hsp70 reduced caspase activity by up to 50% of its control value in a dose-dependent manner. The hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of Hsp70 on caspase-3/7 activity related to a direct interaction between Hsp70 and the caspases was tested by reciprocal immunoprecipitations and Far-western analyses. These tests were performed with extracts of Hsp70-overexpressing, control, and ADR-treated U-937 cells and using anti-caspase-3, caspase-7, and anti-Hsp70 antibodies, and the data clearly showed that Hsp70 was able to interact with the proforms of these caspases in cell lysates and with reconstituted purified proteins but did not bind the activated forms of either caspase-3 or -7. This association was also corroborated by a novel, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assay, protein interaction assay, that combined the advantages of immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting in a 96-well microplate-based assay. Thus, Hsp70 may act to suppress caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling through binding the precursor forms of both caspase-3 and caspase-7 and preventing their maturation.","['Komarova, Elena Yu', 'Afanasyeva, Elena A', 'Bulatova, Marina M', 'Cheetham, Michael E', 'Margulis, Boris A', 'Guzhova, Irina V']","['Komarova EY', 'Afanasyeva EA', 'Bulatova MM', 'Cheetham ME', 'Margulis BA', 'Guzhova IV']","['Institute of Cytology RAS, Tikhoretsky pr. 4, St Petersburg 194064, Russia.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp7 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspases/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2004/11/17 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2004/11/17 09:00'],"['2004/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1379/csc-27r1.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2004 Autumn;9(3):265-75. doi: 10.1379/csc-27r1.1.,,,,PMC1065285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rigorous examination was made for any evidence of unusual risk for pediatric cancer within the state; none was found. The population center of Jefferson County was examined with a bit greater detail, owing simply to the larger number. Again, no basis for public health or follow-back was identified. Among the most frequent pediatric cancers, leukemia, central nervous system, and brain were studied for implications of residential proximity to environmental hazards; no evidence of increased risk was identified. In all of the state, only Hardin County evinced any excess pediatric cancer risk, i.e., was significantly greater than the national rates. Yet this highly mobile population [owing to a large military population] may simply represent rates that are more compatible with those of the nation.

The employment of a preliminary fractionation step results in a reduction of complexity in an individual fraction and permits more complete liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis. Free flow electrophoresis (FFE), a solution-based preparative isoelectric focusing technique, fractionates and enriches protein fractions according to their charge differences and is orthogonal in selectivity to the popular reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation step. In this paper, we explored the advantages of a combination of FFE and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to extend the dynamic range of a proteomic analysis of a complex cell lysate. In this study, the whole cell lysate of a chronic myelogeneous leukemia cell line, K562/CR3, was prefractionated by FFE into 96 fractions spanning pH 3-12. Of these, 35 fractions were digested with trypsin and then analyzed by LC/MS. Depending on the algorithm used for peptide assignment from MS/MS data, at least 319 proteins were identified through database searches. The results also suggested that pI could serve as an additional criterion besides peptide fragmentation pattern for protein identification, although in some cases, a pI shift might indicate post-translational modification. In summary, this study demonstrated that free flow electrophoresis provided a useful prefractionation step for proteomic analysis and when combined with LC/MS allowed the identification of significant number of low level proteins in complex samples.","['Wang, Yonghui', 'Hancock, William S', 'Weber, Gerhard', 'Eckerskorn, Christoph', 'Palmer-Toy, Darryl']","['Wang Y', 'Hancock WS', 'Weber G', 'Eckerskorn C', 'Palmer-Toy D']","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Barnett Institute, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,J Chromatogr A,Journal of chromatography.

High-dose DDC-induced necrotic cell death is thought to depend on the increase of intracellular ROS, while low-dose DDC-induced apoptosis is thought to depend on changes of the intracellular redox state by the transporting of external metal ions.

It is seen either as a balanced t(1;19) or as an unbalanced der(19)t(1;19); occasional cases with coexisting t(1;19)- and der(19)-positive clones also have been described. Although it generally has been assumed that the unbalanced form arises from the balanced t(1;19) through loss of the derivative chromosome 1 followed by duplication of the normal homologue, this has never been proved. At least two other mechanisms are possible for the formation of the der(19): an initial trisomy 1 followed by translocation and subsequent loss of the der(1) or a rearrangement during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, with the derivative chromosomes 1 and 19 ending up in separate daughter cells. The different alternatives may be distinguished by investigation of markers proximal to the breakpoint in 1q23 because they would be expected to lead to different allelic patterns. Thus, loss of heterozygosity as a result of the presence of uniparental disomy (UPD)-both copies of a chromosome being derived from only one parent-for chromosome 1 would be present in all der(19)-harboring cases arising via the duplication pathway and in one-third of cases arising via the trisomy pathway, but in none of the der(19) formed via the G2 pathway. In this study, we used quantitative fluorescence PCR with polymorphic microsatellite markers to investigate chromosomes 1 and 19 in two t(1;19)- and four der(19)-positive ALLs. None of the der(19) cases displayed UPD for chromosome 1, excluding that this aberration arises through the duplication pathway. Because previous findings of cases with coexisting t(1;19) and der(19) clones are difficult to explain if the translocation originated in G2, the present results suggest that an unbalanced der(19) may arise from an initial trisomy 1 followed by t(1;19) translocation and loss of the derivative chromosome 1.","['Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Horvat, Andrea', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Mitelman, Felix', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Paulsson K', 'Horvat A', 'Fioretos T', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. kajsa.paulsson@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20133 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 Feb;42(2):144-8. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20133.,,,,,"['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, using a targeted pharmacologic approach, we identified germ-line polymorphisms in a single gene (thiopurine methyltransferase) associated with the risk of irradiation- and chemotherapy-induced secondary brain tumors in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To identify additional candidate genetic risk factors, in identically treated patients, we compared the gene expression profiles of diagnostic ALL blasts of those who did develop irradiation-associated brain tumors (n = 9) with the profiles from those who did not (n = 33). Weighted rank regression was used to identify 33 probe sets associated with the time-dependent development of brain tumors; k-means clustering (k = 2) identified 2 groups that differed significantly in cumulative incidence of brain tumors (P = 0.012). Permutation analysis was used to estimate the probability (P = 0.18) of obtaining 2 such clusters by chance. Linear discriminant analysis (time-independent categorization of outcome) was used to identify 70 probe sets whose expression differentiated between the 2 groups of patients. Permutation analyses (n = 1,000) was used to estimate the probability of selecting these probe sets by chance (P = 0.055). Five probe sets were in common between the time-independent and time-dependent methods. The distinguishing genes are involved in neural growth (FGFR1) and in nuclear trafficking (HNRPL, KPNB1).

Although the tumor-suppressor gene ATM in the consensus deletion region was found to be biallelically inactivated in about one third of B-CLL cases, in the majority of those who have this deletion, inactivation of the remaining ATM allele was not observed. To identify a second disease-associated gene, we investigated two B-CLL cases with translocation breakpoints in the critical 11q23 deletion region. In one case, a t(X;11)(q13;q23) was cloned and two novel genes were isolated. The breakpoint on 11q23 affected the ARHGAP20 gene, which encodes a protein predicted to be involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases. The breakpoint on Xq13 occurred in BRWD3, which codes for a putative novel transcription factor. The rearrangement of ARHGAP20 and BRWD3 did not result in fusion transcripts, but it disrupted both genes. Mutation analysis of 28 B-CLL samples with monoallelic deletions and two B-CLL samples with 11q23 translocations detected no deleterious mutation in the remaining copy of ARHGAP20. Quantitative expression analysis in 22 B-CLLs revealed significant up-regulation of ARHGAP20 in CLL B cells, whereas BRWD3 was slightly down-regulated. Thus, deregulation of ARHGAP20 by altered gene expression or by gene disruption (but not point mutation) might be a general molecular mechanism of B-CLL leukemogenesis.","['Kalla, Claudia', 'Nentwich, Hagen', 'Schlotter, Magdalena', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Wildenberger, Kathrin', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Lichter, Peter']","['Kalla C', 'Nentwich H', 'Schlotter M', 'Mertens D', 'Wildenberger K', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Lichter P']","['Abteilung Molekulare Genetik, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['GENBANK/AY496263', 'GENBANK/AY496264', 'GENBANK/AY496265', 'GENBANK/AY496266', 'GENBANK/AY496267', 'GENBANK/AY497046', 'GENBANK/AY497047', 'GENBANK/AY497048', 'GENBANK/AY497049', 'GENBANK/AY497050', 'GENBANK/AY497051', 'GENBANK/AY497052', 'GENBANK/AY497053', 'GENBANK/AY497054', 'GENBANK/AY497055', 'GENBANK/AY497056', 'GENBANK/AY497057', 'GENBANK/AY497058', 'GENBANK/AY497059', 'GENBANK/AY497060']",,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (ARHGAP20 protein, human)', '0 (BRWD3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Chromosome Banding/methods', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RNA Splice Sites/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20131 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 Feb;42(2):128-43. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20131.,,"['Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 Sep;44(1):109-10; author reply 111-2.

This antibody reacted with 170 and 195 kDa proteins in HHV-6 B-infected cord blood mononuclear cells. The IEA/ex3 antigen was detected in cord blood mononuclear cells at 6 hr post-infection, and the number of infected cells reached its maximum at 48 hr post-infection. The antigen stained in a punctate pattern and partially localized to the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein body. We also examined 60 PBMC samples from 60 febrile children (3-19 months old) and detected IEA/ex3 antigen in the PBMCs by laser-scanning microscopy. HHV-6 was isolated from 31 of the 60 samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the antigen detection were 84% (26/31) and 97% (28/29), respectively, in the samples with virus detected. The mean number of antigen-positive PBMCs was 409/10(6) cells in 20 samples with viral isolation. A significant correlation (r = 0.566; P = 0.008) was observed between the viral load and number of antigen-positive cells. Although IEA/ex3 antigen was detected by laser-scanning microscopy in PBMCs (without cultivation) collected from six patients with isolated virus, it was detected in only one sample by conventional fluorescence microscopy.

Expression of genes for the multiple drug resistance protein (MDR-1), multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP), and lung resistance protein (LRP) may confer the phenotype of resistance to the treatment of neoplasias. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the expression of the MDR-1, MRP and LRP genes in children with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia via the semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and to determine the correlation between expression and event-free survival and clinical and laboratory variables. DESIGN: A retrospective clinical study. SETTING: Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates from 30 children with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were assessed for the expression of messenger RNA for the MDR-1, MRP and LRP genes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: In the three groups studied, only the increased expression of LRP was related to worsened event-free survival (p = 0.005). The presence of the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) was correlated with increased LRP expression (p = 0.009) and increased risk of relapse or death (p = 0.05). The relative risk of relapse or death was six times higher among children with high LRP expression upon diagnosis (p = 0.05), as confirmed by multivariate analysis of the three genes studied (p = 0.035). DISCUSSION: Cell resistance to drugs is a determinant of the response to chemotherapy and its detection via RT-PCR may be of clinical importance. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of the expression of genes for resistance to antineoplastic drugs in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia upon diagnosis, and particularly the expression of the LRP gene, may be of clinical relevance, and should be the object of prospective studies.","['Valera, Elvis Terci', 'Scrideli, Carlos Alberto', 'Queiroz, Rosane Gomes de Paula', 'Mori, Bianca Maria Ortelli', 'Tone, Luiz Gonzaga']","['Valera ET', 'Scrideli CA', 'Queiroz RG', 'Mori BM', 'Tone LG']","['Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil. elvisvalera@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20041109,Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genes, MDR/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*genetics']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/04/29 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1516-31802004000400007 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802004000400007 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2004 Jul 1;122(4):166-71. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802004000400007.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this coagulopathy, however, are not completely understood. Indeed, the broad and increasing therapeutic use of cytotoxic drugs and growth factors is likely to contribute to the complexity of hemostatic abnormalities encountered in this hematologic malignancy. The nature of coagulation activation in AML was therefore investigated in vitro using the human leukemic cell line, HL60. Tissue factor (TF) was almost entirely located on the cell surface and bound factor VIIa, but only 15-25% of this TF was primarily functionally active. Treatment with increasing concentrations of daunorubicin or cytosine-beta-D-arabinofuranoside, two cytotoxic drugs commonly used in AML therapy, induced apoptosis and secondary necrosis of HL60 cells and resulted in marked decryption of TF PCA independent of de novo protein synthesis. This PCA-modulating effect was concomitant with and functionally dependent on the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane leaflet. Similar observations were made in analogous ex vivo studies on patient-derived myeloblasts.

However, approximately 50% of adult AMLs have normal cytogenetics (NC-AMLs), and represent a heterogeneous and poorly understood group. We analysed gene expression in 55 AML samples including 53 cases from adult patients with NC-AML (n = 36), trisomy 8, t(15;17), t(8;21), t(11;19), 7q deletion, and two cell lines using 9000-gene DNA microarrays. Global hierarchical clustering showed that NC-AMLs are a heterogeneous group. Supervised analysis distinguished two subgroups of NC-AML: one subgroup constituted a homogeneous NC cluster ('pure NC-AML'), and the other NC-AMLs were close to the AML cases with translocations ('translocation like'). Gene expression signatures were also derived for patients with trisomy 8, as well as FLT3 and MLL gene duplications. Importantly, samples from 24 NC-AML patients who could be evaluated for clinical outcome were analysed. In all, 43 genes that discriminated two classes of patients with significantly different prognosis were identified. The poor prognosis class contained a majority of 'pure NC-AMLs', whereas the 'translocation-like' AMLs were in the good prognosis class. Discriminator genes included genes involved in drug resistance (TOP2B), protein transport (MTX2, SLC35A2), and cell signalling (MAPK1, PRKAB2). Our results demonstrate the transcriptional heterogeneity of NC-AMLs, and suggest the existence of 'translocation-like' NC-AMLs and of a gene expression signature that may predict response to chemotherapy.","['Vey, Norbert', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Groulet-Martinec, Agnes', 'Debono, Stephane', 'Finetti, Pascal', 'Carbuccia, Nadine', 'Beillard, Emmanuel', 'Devilard, Elizabeth', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Coso, Diane', 'Sainty, Danielle', 'Xerri, Luc', 'Stoppa, Anne-Marie', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Nguyen, Catherine', 'Houlgatte, Remi', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Maraninchi, Dominique', 'Birg, Francoise', 'Birnbaum, Daniel', 'Bertucci, Francois']","['Vey N', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Groulet-Martinec A', 'Debono S', 'Finetti P', 'Carbuccia N', 'Beillard E', 'Devilard E', 'Arnoulet C', 'Coso D', 'Sainty D', 'Xerri L', 'Stoppa AM', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Nguyen C', 'Houlgatte R', 'Blaise D', 'Maraninchi D', 'Birg F', 'Birnbaum D', 'Bertucci F']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes-UMR599 Inserm, IFR137, Marseille Cancer Institute, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Duplication', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1207910 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1207910 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Dec 16;23(58):9381-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207910.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using pharmacological concentrations of the proteasome inhibitor PS-341, we demonstrate inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in fresh ATL cells, HTLV-I transformed and HTLV-I-negative malignant T cells, while normal resting or activated T lymphocytes were resistant. Combination of PS-341 and doxorubicin or etoposide resulted in an additive growth inhibition. In HTLV-I-negative malignant cells, PS-341 treatment significantly downregulated the antiapoptotic protein X-IAP and to a lesser extent c-IAP-1 and bcl-X(L) and resulted in caspase-dependent apoptosis. In HTLV-I transformed cells, the inhibition of the proteasomal degradation of Tax by PS-341 likely explains the relative protection of HTLV-I infected cells against caspase-dependent apoptosis. PS-341 treatment of these cells stabilized IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, IkappaBvarepsilon, p21, p27 and p53 proteins and selectively inhibited Rel-A DNA binding NF-kappaB complexes. In both HTLV-I-positive and -negative cells, PS-341 treatment induced ceramide accumulation that correlated with apoptosis.

A total of 90 centres reported their practice: 42 centres (47%) never used pre-transplant i.t. prophylaxis as part of the conditioning, whereas 48 centres (53%) gave i.t. prophylaxis to selected groups. The main indications were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and lymphoma (53, 33, and 23% of all centres, respectively). Prophylaxis was usually given to all patients with ALL, but often restricted to high-risk patients in AML and lymphoma. Of the 90 centres, 29 (32%) gave prophylactic i.t. treatment after the transplantation, mainly for the same indications as pre-transplant. This survey illustrates the heterogeneity in the current practice of i.t. prophylaxis in allogeneic transplantation for malignant blood disorders in Europe. The documentation in the literature to support the use of i.t. prophylaxis as part of transplantation for malignant diseases in patients without preceding CNS involvement is sparse. Based on the rarity of isolated CNS relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, EBMT does not recommend routine i.t. prophylaxis to patients without prior CNS involvement.","['Ruutu, T', 'Corradini, P', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Holler, E', 'Apperley, J', 'Dini, G', 'Rocha, V', 'Schmitz, N', 'Socie, G', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Ruutu T', 'Corradini P', 'Gratwohl A', 'Holler E', 'Apperley J', 'Dini G', 'Rocha V', 'Schmitz N', 'Socie G', 'Niederwieser D']","['Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital, POB 340, FIN-00029 HUS, Helsinki, Finland. tapani.ruutu@hus.fi']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Data Collection', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Premedication/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1704727 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1704727 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Jan;35(2):121-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704727.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims were to examine immunity and to compare the response to immunization at 1 or 6 months after treatment. METHODS: Thirty-one patients were immunized with DT and conjugated Hib vaccine (ActHib) at 1 month or 6 months after treatment of ALL with the NOPHO 92 protocol. Antibody levels were determined before and 3 weeks after vaccination. Specific T and Hib antibody-secreting cells of IgG/IgA/IgM isotypes were analyzed in peripheral blood using an ELISPOT technique. RESULTS: All specific antibody levels decreased during ALL treatment, and protective levels after treatment were noted for 17% against D, 33% against T, and 100% against Hib. No high-risk patient had full D or T protection after treatment. After vaccination all the standard- and intermediate-risk patients achieved full protection against D, T, and Hib. The high-risk group showed insufficient immune response (full protection after vaccination: D 56%, T 22%, Hib 78%). No difference was found between vaccination at 1 month or 6 months after treatment. The poor antibody production in the high-risk group correlated to low numbers of antibody-secreting cells. CONCLUSIONS: Nonprotective antibody levels against D, T, and Hib after childhood ALL are more common than previously thought. Insufficient immune response was restricted to the high-risk group and was related to a low number of memory B cells in this study. Immunizations should be included in follow-up after childhood ALL, and the policy should be adapted to treatment intensity.","['Ek, Torben', 'Mellander, Lotta', 'Hahn-Zoric, Mirjana', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas']","['Ek T', 'Mellander L', 'Hahn-Zoric M', 'Abrahamsson J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Goteborg University, Goteborg, Sweden. torben.ek@medfak.gu.se']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Diphtheria-Tetanus Vaccine)', '0 (Haemophilus Vaccines)', '0 (Haemophilus influenza type b polysaccharide vaccine-tetanus toxin conjugate)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Antibody Formation/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria-Tetanus Vaccine/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Female', 'Haemophilus Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",2004/11/16 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200411000-00008 [pii]', '10.1097/00043426-200411000-00008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Nov;26(11):727-34. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200411000-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3-year survival in pediatric multisystem LCH is still around 80%, and children with risk organ involvement (i.e., liver, spleen, hematopoietic system, or lungs) have a less favorable outcome. To further elucidate the pathogenesis of LCH in the search for a rationale cure, the authors investigated intracellular synthesis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) from biopsied lesions. METHODS: : Lesional cells were obtained by fine-needle aspiration biopsy from nine children with LCH. The study was accomplished by the use of an immunofluorescence staining method that allowed cytokine-producing cells to be differentiated from cytokine-binding cells. RESULTS: : All patients had histiocytes expressing TNF. Seven patients had histiocytes expressing IL-11 and six patients had histiocytes expressing LIF. The two children with the highest proportion of histiocytes displaying TNF and the three with the highest proportion of histiocytes expressing IL-11 and LIF all had risk organ involvement. Two-color staining revealed that histiocytes expressing TNF, IL-11, and LIF co-expressed CD1a molecules. CONCLUSIONS: : These observations suggest that LCH represents a cytokine-driven condition partially mediated by TNF, IL-11, and LIF. These three cytokines are all osteoclastogenic, suggesting a pathogenetic pathway for the osteolytic lesions in LCH. Furthermore, thrombocytosis in LCH may be explained by IL-11 and LIF activity.","['Andersson By, Ulrika', 'Tani, Edneia', 'Andersson, Ulf', 'Henter, Jan-Inge']","['Andersson By U', 'Tani E', 'Andersson U', 'Henter JI']","[""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/complications/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-11/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Langerhans Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Osteolysis/etiology', 'Thrombocytosis/etiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",2004/11/16 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200411000-00004 [pii]', '10.1097/00043426-200411000-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Nov;26(11):706-11. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200411000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using high-resolution mutagenesis, we identified three MLL domains that are essential for in vitro myeloid transformation via mechanisms that do not compromise subnuclear localization. These include the CXXC/Basic domain and two novel domains of unknown function. Point mutations in the CXXC domain that eliminate myeloid transformation by an MLL fusion protein also abolished recognition and binding of nonmethylated CpG DNA sites in vitro and transactivation in vivo.

PLZP, also known as TZFP, FAZF, or ROG, is a novel POK protein that displays strong homology with PLZF and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the cancer-predisposing syndrome, Fanconi's anemia, and of APL, in view of its ability to heterodimerize with the FANC-C and PLZF proteins, respectively. Here we report the generation and characterization of mice in which we have specifically inactivated the PLZP gene through in-frame insertion of a lacZ reporter and without perturbing the expression of the neighboring MLL2 gene. We show that PLZP-deficient mice display defects in cell cycle control and cytokine production in the T-cell compartment.

On the basis of our data, a deregulation of PLZP function in Fanconi's anemia and APL may affect the biology of the hematopoietic stem cell, in turn contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders.","['Piazza, Francesco', 'Costoya, Jose A', 'Merghoub, Taha', 'Hobbs, Robin M', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Piazza F', 'Costoya JA', 'Merghoub T', 'Hobbs RM', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program and Department of Pathology, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Box 110, 1275 York Ave., New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],,"['R01 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Rog protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lac Operon', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Transgenes']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/23/10456 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.24.23.10456-10469.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Dec;24(23):10456-69. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.23.10456-10469.2004.,,,,PMC529048,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, Ski was shown to act in distinct signaling pathways including those involving nuclear receptors, transforming growth factor beta, and tumor suppressors. These divergent roles of Ski are probably dependent on Ski's capacity to bind multiple partners with disparate functions. In particular, Ski alters the growth and differentiation program of erythroid progenitor cells, leading to malignant leukemia. However, the mechanism underlying this important effect has remained elusive. Here we show that Ski interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, the repression of GATA1-mediated transcription involves Ski's ability to block DNA binding of GATA1. This finding is in marked contrast to those in previous reports on the mechanism of repression by Ski, which have described a model involving the recruitment of corepressors into DNA-bound transcription complexes. We propose that Ski cooperates in the process of transformation in erythroid cells by interfering with GATA1 function, thereby contributing to erythroleukemia.","['Ueki, Nobuhide', 'Zhang, Leiqing', 'Hayman, Michael J']","['Ueki N', 'Zhang L', 'Hayman MJ']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5222, USA.']",['eng'],,"['R01 CA042573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '126648-96-2 (SKI protein, human)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hemin/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K562 Cells', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/23/10118 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.24.23.10118-10125.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Dec;24(23):10118-25. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.23.10118-10125.2004.,,,,PMC529047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of high levels of WT1 is associated with poor prognosis in leukemias and breast cancer. Using real-time (Taqman) reverse transcription-PCR and RNase protection assay, we have shown up-regulation of WT1 expression following cytotoxic treatment of cells exhibiting drug resistance, a phenomenon not seen in sensitive cells. WT1 is subject to alternative splicing involving exon 5 and three amino acids (KTS) at the end of exon 9, producing four major isoforms. Exon 5 splicing was disrupted in all cell lines studied following a cytotoxic insult probably due to increased exon 5 skipping. Disruption of exon 5 splicing may be a proapoptotic signal because specific targeting of WT1 exon 5-containing transcripts using a nuclease-resistant antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) killed HL60 leukemia cells, which were resistant to an ASO targeting all four alternatively spliced transcripts simultaneously. K562 cells were sensitive to both target-specific ASOs. Gene expression profiling following treatment with WT1 exon 5-targeted antisense showed up-regulation of the known WT1 target gene, thrombospondin 1, in HL60 cells, which correlated with cell death. In addition, novel potential WT1 target genes were identified in each cell line. These studies highlight a new layer of complexity in the regulation and function of the WT1 gene product and suggest that antisense directed to WT1 exon 5 might have therapeutic potential.","['Renshaw, Jane', 'Orr, Rosanne M', 'Walton, Michael I', 'Te Poele, Robert', 'Williams, Richard D', 'Wancewicz, Edward V', 'Monia, Brett P', 'Workman, Paul', 'Pritchard-Jones, Kathryn']","['Renshaw J', 'Orr RM', 'Walton MI', 'Te Poele R', 'Williams RD', 'Wancewicz EV', 'Monia BP', 'Workman P', 'Pritchard-Jones K']","['Section of Paediatrics, Institute of Cancer Research, 15 Cotswold Road, Belmont, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5NG, United Kingdom.

Using inbred NMRI mice, it was previously reported that a mutant of SL3-3 with all enhancer Runx (AML1/core) sites disrupted by 3-bp mutations (SL3-3dm) induces predominantly non-T-cell tumors with severely extended latency (S. Ethelberg, J. Lovmand, J. Schmidt, A. Luz, and F. S. Pedersen, J. Virol. 71:7273-7280, 1997). By use of three-color flow cytometry and molecular and histopathological analyses, we have now performed a detailed phenotypic characterization of SL3-3- and SL3-3dm-induced tumors in this mouse strain. All wild-type induced tumors had clonal T-cell receptor beta rearrangements, and the vast majority were CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(-) T-lymphomas. Such a consistent phenotypic pattern is unusual for murine leukemia virus-induced T-lymphomas. The mutant virus induced malignancies of four distinct hematopoietic lineages: myeloid, T lymphoid, B lymphoid, and erythroid. The most common disease was myeloid leukemia with maturation. Thus, mutation of all Runx motifs in the enhancer of SL3-3 severely impedes viral T-lymphomagenicity and thereby discloses a considerable and formerly unappreciated potential of this virus for myeloid leukemia induction. Proviral enhancers with complex structural alterations (deletions, insertions, and/or duplications) were found in most SL3-3dm-induced T-lymphoid tumors and immature myeloid leukemias but not in any cases of myeloid leukemia with maturation, mature B-lymphoma, or erythroleukemia. Altogether, our results indicate that the SL3-3dm enhancer in itself promotes induction of myeloid leukemia with maturation but that structural changes may arise in vivo and redirect viral disease specificity to induction of T-lymphoid or immature myeloid leukemias, which typically develop with moderately shorter latencies.","['Sorensen, Karina Dalsgaard', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Kunder, Sandra', 'Schmidt, Jorg', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Sorensen KD', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Kunder S', 'Schmidt J', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, C.

It specifically inhibits the replication of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) and Sindbis virus (SIN) by preventing the accumulation of viral RNA in the cytoplasm. For this report, we mapped the viral sequences that are sensitive to ZAP inhibition. The viral sequences were cloned into a luciferase reporter and analyzed for the ability to mediate ZAP-dependent destabilization of the reporter. The sensitive sequence in MLV was mapped to the 3' long terminal repeat; the sensitive sequences in SIN were mapped to multiple fragments. The fragment of SIN that displayed the highest destabilizing activity was further analyzed by deletion mutagenesis for the minimal sequence that retained the activity. This led to the identification of a fragment of 653 nucleotides. Any further deletion of this fragment resulted in significantly lower activity. We provide evidence that ZAP directly binds to the active but not the inactive fragments. The CCCH zinc finger motifs of ZAP play important roles in RNA binding and antiviral activity. Disruption of the second and fourth zinc fingers abolished ZAP's activity, whereas disruption of the first and third fingers just slightly lowered its activity.","['Guo, Xuemin', 'Carroll, John-William N', 'Macdonald, Margaret R', 'Goff, Stephen P', 'Gao, Guangxia']","['Guo X', 'Carroll JW', 'Macdonald MR', 'Goff SP', 'Gao G']","['Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China. gaogx@sun.im.ac.cn']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Zc3hav1 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Rats', 'Sindbis Virus/drug effects/genetics', '*Zinc Fingers']",2004/11/16 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['78/23/12781 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.78.23.12781-12787.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Dec;78(23):12781-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.23.12781-12787.2004.,,,,PMC525010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used a novel approach based on genetic trapping to rapidly score several thousand integration sites and found that MLV vectors trapped cellular promoters more efficiently than HIV vectors. Remarkably, 1 in 5 MLV integrations trapped an active promoter in different cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells. Such frequency was even higher in growth-stimulated lymphocytes. We show that the different behavior of MLV and HIV vectors was dependent on a different integration pattern within transcribed genes. Whereas MLV-based traps showed a strong bias for promoter-proximal integration leading to efficient reporter expression, HIV-based traps integrated throughout transcriptional units and were limited for expression by the distance from the promoter and the reading frame of the targeted gene. Our results indicate a strong propensity of MLV to establish transcriptional interactions with cellular promoters, a behavior that may have evolved to enhance proviral expression and may increase the insertional mutagenesis risk. Promoter trapping efficiency provides a convenient readout to assess transcriptional interactions between the vector and its flanking genes at the integration site and to compare integration site selection among different cell types and in different growth conditions.","['De Palma, Michele', 'Montini, Eugenio', 'Santoni de Sio, Francesca R', 'Benedicenti, Fabrizio', 'Gentile, Alessandra', 'Medico, Enzo', 'Naldini, Luigi']","['De Palma M', 'Montini E', 'Santoni de Sio FR', 'Benedicenti F', 'Gentile A', 'Medico E', 'Naldini L']","['San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (HSR-TIGET), via Olgettina 58, 20132, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['TGT03D02/Telethon/Italy', 'TGT06S01/Telethon/Italy']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041112,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2004/11/16 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45730-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-03-0798 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 15;105(6):2307-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-0798.

It has been evaluated for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. CNTF also acts on non-neuronal cells such as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, adipocytes and skeletal muscles cells. CNTF has regulatory effects on body weight and is currently in clinical trial for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. CNTF mediates its function by activating a tripartite receptor comprising the CNTF receptor alpha chain (CNTFRalpha), the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta chain (LIFRbeta) and gp130. Human, rat and chicken CNTF have been expressed as recombinant proteins, and most preclinical studies in murine models have been performed using rat recombinant protein. Rat and human CNTF differ in their fine specificities: in addition to CNTFR, rat CNTF has been shown to activate the LIFR (a heterodimer of LIFRbeta and gp130), whereas human CNTF can bind and activate a tripartite receptor comprising the IL-6 receptor alpha chain (IL-6Ralpha) and LIFR. To generate tools designed for mouse models of human diseases; we cloned and expressed in E. coli both mouse CNTF and the CNTFRalpha chain. Recombinant mouse CNTF was active and showed a high level of specificity for mouse CNTFR. It shares the arginine residue with rat CNTF which prevents binding to IL-6Ralpha. It did not activate the LIFR at all concentrations tested. Recombinant mouse CNTF is therefore specific for CNTFR and as such represents a useful tool with which to study CNTF in mouse models.

Among the chemokines, SDF-1 and its CXCR4 receptor have been reported to be key players in the nesting of haematopoietic progenitors within the bone marrow. Disruption of the SDF-1\CXCR4 axis results in cell mobilization and may participate in leukaemia extramedullary infiltration. In this review we will discuss the manifold roles of the SDF-1 chemokine and of its receptor in haematopoiesis regulation. By recruiting quiescent progenitors, by participating in their survival\cycling and by sensitizing them to further cytokine synergistic action, SDF-1 likely contributes to haematopoiesis homeostasis under physiological conditions and in stress situations. The complexity of the SDF-1\CXCR4 interactions in the regulation of haematopoiesis illustrates a dynamic and sequential cross-talk between chemokine and cytokine\growth factor worlds. Because of their pleiotropic effects on haematopoietic progenitor trafficking, survival and proliferation, the SDF-1\CXCR4 couple could be considered as promising molecules for improvement of cell-based therapy protocols in haematopoietic transplantation.","['Lataillade, Jean-Jacques', 'Domenech, Jorge', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles, Marie-Caroline']","['Lataillade JJ', 'Domenech J', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles MC']","['Departement de Recherche, Centre de Transfusion Sanguine des Armees Jean Julliard, 1 rue Lieutenant Raoul Batany, BP 410, 92141 Clamart Cedex, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['*Cell Movement', '*Cell Survival', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*physiology']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/03/22 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2004 Jul-Sep;15(3):177-88.,,,128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes the selective photolysis of activated and non-activated IL-2R expressing cells using several immunoconjugates synthesized with one of two photosensitizers, hematoporphyrin (HP) or chlorin-e(6) (Ce(6)), covalently linked to IL-2 or an anti-IL-2R antibody. Destruction of IL-2R bearing cells was achieved after photosensitizer internalization and irradiation using all tested photosensitizer conjugates. Chlorin containing conjugates were more effective, by a factor of 4 or more, than HP containing conjugates. Conjugates made with IL-2 were up to 30 times more effective than conjugates that used a monoclonal antibody against the IL-2R for targeting. Activation of the cells to increase IL-2R expression decreased the internalization time required for optimal therapeutic efficacy; however, stimulation of the cell to increase IL-2 secretion greatly reduced conjugate effectiveness.

However, there is little information available about its action. In the present study, we purified a unique polysaccharide component from A. camphorata mycelia (AC-PS) and found that it has pronounced anti-tumor effects on both in vitro and in vivo model. Our results showed that AC-PS alone did not show any direct cytotoxic effect to human leukemic U937 cells, even at high concentration (200 microg/ml). However, it could inhibit the proliferation of U937 cells via activation of mononuclear cells (MNCs). Treatment of U937 cells with AC-PS-stimulated-MNC-CM could significantly inhibit its proliferation with 55.3% growth inhibition rate. The in vitro antitumor activity was substantiated by the in vivo therapeutical study of AC-PS in sarcoma 180-bearing mice. Intraperitoneal and oral administration of AC-PS, 100 and 200 mg/kg significantly suppressed the tumor growth with the inhibition rate of 69.1% and 58.8%, respectively. In vivo studies also showed that several immunoparameters, such as the spontaneous proliferation of spleen cells, after AC-PS administration, were two-fold higher than in control mice. Furthermore, the cytolytic activity of spleen cells also increased from 9.8 +/- 1.1% in control mice to 34.2 +/- 5.5% and 48.2 +/- 2.5%, after oral and intraperitoneal treatment, respectively. Besides, the mice serum interleukin-12 levels increased significantly by AC-PS treatment. Considering all these results, it is suggested that AC-PS elicit its anti-tumor effect by promoting a Th1-dominant state and killer activities.","['Liu, Jun-Jen', 'Huang, Tien-Shang', 'Hsu, Ming-Ling', 'Chen, Chin-Chu', 'Lin, Wen-Shin', 'Lu, Fung-Jou', 'Chang, Wen-Huei']","['Liu JJ', 'Huang TS', 'Hsu ML', 'Chen CC', 'Lin WS', 'Lu FJ', 'Chang WH']","['Graduate Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Basidiomycota/*chemistry', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Immunologic Factors/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polysaccharides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Sarcoma 180/drug therapy', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(04)00278-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2004.05.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2004 Dec 1;201(2):186-93. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2004.05.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of lymphocyte activation can cause autoimmune, immunodeficient diseases, or leukemia/lymphoma. Lymphocyte activation is triggered by stimulation of antigen receptors, T cell receptors (TCR) or B cell receptors (BCR), on the surfaces of T or B lymphocyte, respectively. Stimulation of TCR or BCR induces a series of signal transduction cascades leading to activation of multiple transcription factors including NF-kappaB. Recent studies demonstrate that CARMA1, a scaffold protein, plays an essential role in mediating TCR- or BCR-induced NF-kappaB activation by recruiting two adaptor proteins, Bcl10 and MALT1, to lipid rafts following stimulation of antigen receptors. In this review, we will discuss the mechanism by which proximal signaling components connect antigen receptor signaling to CARMA1, and how CARMA1 regulates Bcl10 and MALT1, leading to activation of NF-kappaB.

In both acute and chronic screening tests, VO(cur)2 was ineffective as an insulin mimetic agent; however, it also proved to be exceptionally non-toxic, with no evidence of negative symptomatology during a month-long treatment period, at doses up to and including 2.0 mmol kg(-1) day(-1).","['Thompson, Katherine H', 'Bohmerle, Karin', 'Polishchuk, Elena', 'Martins, Candice', 'Toleikis, Philip', 'Tse, Jeremy', 'Yuen, Violet', 'McNeill, John H', 'Orvig, Chris']","['Thompson KH', 'Bohmerle K', 'Polishchuk E', 'Martins C', 'Toleikis P', 'Tse J', 'Yuen V', 'McNeill JH', 'Orvig C']","['Medicinal Inorganic Chemistry Group, Chemistry Department, University of British Columbia, 2036 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z1. kthompson@chem.ubc.ca']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Inorg Biochem,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,7905788,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blood Glucose/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*drug effects', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Synovial Membrane/cytology/*drug effects', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/01/13 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0162-0134(04)00275-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2004.09.011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Inorg Biochem. 2004 Dec;98(12):2063-70. doi: 10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2004.09.011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate these regulatory disruptions, we analyzed the promoter region and identified a tissue-specific repressor. The fragment containing this element could also produce tissue-specific suppression of transcription from the SV40 promoter.

The mechanism of this differential effect related to maturation status has not been explored. We verified that G-CSF and GM-CSF receptors remain functional on purified mature neutrophils by demonstrating that both cytokines caused phosphorylation of STAT3. However, only GM-CSF was capable of activating MAPK as assessed by gel shift and in vitro kinase assay. Both G-CSF and GM-CSF caused activation of p21 ras in neutrophils, demonstrating that early events in the ras-MAPK pathway remain functional after stimulation by either cytokine. Inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase activity by pervanadate restored the ability of G-CSF to activate MAPK in mature neutrophils. Specific inhibition of the SHP-1 phosphatase, known to be activated by G-CSF but not GM-CSF also restored the ability of G-CSF to activate MAPK in neutrophils. These studies suggest that G-CSF activation of SHP-1 may be an important regulatory step for permitting optimal terminal differentiation during neutrophil production and add to our knowledge of the instructional role of G-CSF and GM-CSF for balancing proliferation and differentiation of neutrophil progenitor cells. This information may prove useful for the understanding of conditions in which neutrophil proliferative/differentiative balancing is dysregulated, such as myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic disorders.","['Baumann, Michael', 'Frye, Tricia', 'Naqvi, Tahir', 'Gomez-Cambronero, Julian']","['Baumann M', 'Frye T', 'Naqvi T', 'Gomez-Cambronero J']","['Research Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, Medicine 111W, VAMC, 4100 W.

However, no data about the p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) have been reported. Here, we present evidence showing that Bcr/Abl is able to modulate this signalling pathway. Transient transfection experiments indicated that overexpression of Bcr/Abl in 293T cells is able to activate p38 MAPK or induce p73 stabilization, suggesting that c-Abl and Bcr/Abl share some biological substrates. Interestingly, the control exerted by Bcr/Abl on the p38 MAPK pathway was not only mediated by the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr/Abl, as the use of STI571 demonstrated. In fact, Bcr alone was able to induce p38 MAPK activation specifically through MKK3 (MAP kinase kinase 3). Supporting these observations, chronic myeloid leukaemia-derived K562 cells or BaF 3 cells stably transfected with Bcr/Abl showed higher levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK compared with Bcr/Abl-negative cells. While Bcr/Abl-negative cells activated p38 MAPK in response to Ara-C (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine), Bcr/Abl-positive cells were unable to activate p38 MAPK, suggesting that the p38 MAPK pathway is not sensitive to Abl-dependent stimuli in Bcr/Abl-positive cells. Our results demonstrate that the involvement of Bcr/Abl in the p38 MAPK pathway is a key mechanism for explaining resistance to Ara-C, and could provide a clue for new therapeutic approaches based on the use of specific Abl inhibitors.","['Sanchez-Arevalo Lobo, Victor Javier', 'Aceves Luquero, Clara Isabel', 'Alvarez-Vallina, Luis', 'Tipping, Alex J', 'Viniegra, Juan Guinea', 'Hernandez Losa, Javier', 'Parada Cobo, Carlos', 'Galan Moya, Eva Maria', 'Gayoso Cruz, Jorge', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Ramon y Cajal, Santiago', 'Sanchez-Prieto, Ricardo']","['Sanchez-Arevalo Lobo VJ', 'Aceves Luquero CI', 'Alvarez-Vallina L', 'Tipping AJ', 'Viniegra JG', 'Hernandez Losa J', 'Parada Cobo C', 'Galan Moya EM', 'Gayoso Cruz J', 'Melo JV', 'Ramon y Cajal S', 'Sanchez-Prieto R']","['Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, 28035 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism/physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kidney/chemistry/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'U937 Cells/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20040927 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20040927 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Apr 1;387(Pt 1):231-8. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040927.,,,,PMC1134951,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD26/DPPIV is considered a multifunction housekeeping protein. Malignant cells often show altered CD26/DPPIV expression or no CD26/DPPIV expression, thus suggesting a useful marker for assessing some T-cell malignancies. In this study, cell surface protein and messenger RNA expression profiles for CD26/DPPIV were examined in 49 patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), 10 carriers of human T-lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-I), and 4 HTLV-I-infected cell lines to assess the utility of CD26/DPPIV expression as a useful molecular marker for ATL pathology. In contrast to normal lymphocytes, ATL cells and HTLV-I-infected cell lines apparently down-regulated or completely lost the CD26/DPPIV antigen. Furthermore, the positive rate and antigen density for CD26/DPPIV in ATL cells gradually declined along with the advancement of ATL stage. Analysis of genomic DNA and the CD26/DPPIV transcript showed that CD26- ATL cells possessed faintly detected transcripts of the gene that were aberrantly methylated at the CpG islands within the promoter region in parallel with the advancement of ATL, a finding supported by a rescue experiment for transcript reexpression using 5-azacytidine as demethylation agent. Moreover, there was no relationship between loss of CD26/DPPIV and HTLV-I tax expression. These results indicate that ATL cells down-regulate CD26 antigens by means of epigenetic machinery and that this antigen abnormality is a useful molecular marker for the pathology of ATL.","['Tsuji, Tomohiro', 'Sugahara, Kazuyuki', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Uemura, Akiko', 'Harasawa, Hitomi', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Hamaguchi, Yukio', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Tsuji T', 'Sugahara K', 'Tsuruda K', 'Uemura A', 'Harasawa H', 'Hasegawa H', 'Hamaguchi Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/analysis/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA/analysis']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/02/17 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.04066 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Oct;80(3):254-60. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.04066.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For Baf-3, a murine interleukin 3-dependent cell line, the 2 distinct pathways involved are JAK/STATs/Bcl-xL and Ras/PI3-K. The latter is indispensable for long-term cell survival through down-regulation of Bim, a BH3-only cell death activator of the Bcl-2 superfamily. Thus, Bim is likely to be a key factor for cytokine-initiated regulation of cell survival in both hematopoietic cells and neuronal cells. Cytokines (like neurotrophic factors) regulate Bim expression at at least 3 levels: (1) at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level through transcriptional regulation and possibly through mRNA stability, (2) at the protein level through proteasome-dependent regulation of protein degradation, and (3) by affecting subcellular localization through regulation of the potential to bind to the dynein motor complex. Bim function may be regulated in different ways in certain situations such that the relative importance of these 3 mechanisms may differ among cell types. For hematopoiesis, mRNA regulation seems to be the most important. Bim is also implicated in leukemogenesis caused by the Bcr-Abl chimeric tyrosine kinase and constitutively active mutants of receptor tyrosine kinases.","['Inaba, Toshiya']",['Inaba T'],"['Department of Molecular Oncology & Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. tinaba@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Survival', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2004/11/16 09:00,2005/02/17 09:00,['2004/11/16 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.04093 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Oct;80(3):210-4. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.04093.,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of cultured endometrial cells with leptin increases the level of beta3-integrin, IL-1, leukemia inhibitory factor, and their corresponding receptors. These leptin-induced effects are eliminated by inhibitors of leptin receptor (OB-R) signaling. Herein the impact of blocking leptin/OB-R signaling in the mouse endometrium was assessed. Intrauterine injection of either leptin peptide antagonists (LPA-1 or -2) or OB-R antibody on d 3 of pregnancy impaired mouse implantation in comparison to intrauterine injection of scrambled peptides (LPA-Sc) or species-matched IgGs. Significant reduction in the number of implantation sites and uterine horns with implanted embryos was found after intrauterine injection of LPA-1 (1 of 22) vs. LPA-1Sc (11 of 15) and LPA-2 (3 of 17) vs. LPA-2Sc (14 of 16). The impact of disruption of leptin signaling on the endometrial expression of several molecules in pregnant mice was assessed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. Disruption of leptin signaling resulted in a significant reduction of IL-1 receptor type I, leukemia inhibitory factor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and beta3-integrin levels. The levels of colony stimulating factor-1 receptor and OB-R were unaltered after treatment with LPAs compared with controls. Expression of OB-R protein was pregnancy dependent and found only in glandular epithelium after implantation occurred. Our findings support previous observations that leptin signaling is critical to the implantation process and suggest that molecules downstream of leptin-activated receptor may serve obligatory roles in endometrial receptivity and successful implantation.","['Ramos, M P', 'Rueda, B R', 'Leavis, P C', 'Gonzalez, R R']","['Ramos MP', 'Rueda BR', 'Leavis PC', 'Gonzalez RR']","['Boston Biomedical Research Institute, 64 Grove Street, Watertown, Massachusetts 02472, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041111,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '0 (leptin receptor, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Integrin beta3/metabolism', 'Leptin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2004/11/13 09:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2004-1186 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2004-1186 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2005 Feb;146(2):694-701. doi: 10.1210/en.2004-1186.

Each of us has existed as a single cell--the fertilized egg--and each of us is made up of billions of cells specialized in many different ways to form our tissues and organs. The nucleus of the cell, described as far back as 1682, is known to be the site of storage of chromosomes that carry the essential and unique DNA blueprint for life. With the recent publication of the entire human genome, our knowledge of exactly what our genes say has increased immeasurably. This, however, is only a small part of the story. In order for the chromosomal genes to function correctly, a complex cellular machinery must rewrite (or transcribe) the genetic instructions of the DNA into a temporary messenger molecule, messenger RNA (mRNA), rearrange (or splice) this message into a readable format and then produce a protein that accurately represents the DNA code. It is these protein molecules that are the functional result of the genetic information. This whole process is termed 'gene expression'. Both transcription and splicing of the mRNA message are carried out in the nucleus. These events must be performed accurately and efficiently in a minute volume already full of highly packaged DNA. An ever-increasing number of sub-nuclear structures have been described, from the nucleolus (first described in 1835) to newly discovered 'paraspeckles' and 'clastosomes'. In fact, as increasing numbers of molecular probes become available, so the complexity of nuclear structure appears to expand. The functions of some of these structures are currently unknown. Those whose functions are, at least partly, understood play roles in gene expression. Interestingly, alterations in nuclear structure are associated with human diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy and promyelocytic leukaemia, suggesting that the control of nuclear organization may be vital to health. The dynamic nature of the structure of the mammalian nucleus has come under increasing scrutiny over the past few years. This has largely been driven by advances in microscopy as well as the advent of in vivo labelling techniques for sub-nuclear structures. It is now possible, using a protein originally isolated from jellyfish, to visualize sub-nuclear structures in living cultured cells. Together with three-dimensional time-lapse microscopy and an ever-expanding range of photo-bleaching techniques, this technology allows us to ask detailed questions about movements of sub-nuclear structures themselves and of the proteins contained within them. It has recently become clear that sub-nuclear structures are capable of moving within the nucleus and of physically interacting with each other. It is also now known that there is a constant flux of molecules into and out of these mobile structures as well as exchange of molecules between them, rather like passengers travelling on the London Underground. The challenge for the future is to relate dynamic events at the microscopic and molecular levels back to the organism as a whole. Only by understanding how the information encoded on genes is accurately expressed at the right time and in the right place can we really take advantage of the knowledge currently available to us.","['Sleeman, Judith E']",['Sleeman JE'],"['University of Dundee, Division of Pathology and Neuroscience, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK. j.e.sleeman@dundee.ac.uk']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Philos Trans A Math Phys Eng Sci,"Philosophical transactions.

We previously established STI571-resistant sublines (designated KTR cells) from the CML cell line KT-1. T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) was markedly downregulated in all KTR cells compared to parental KT-1 cells. Therefore, we examined whether the suppression of TC-PTP expression might contribute to imatinib mesylate-resistance in KTR cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We transduced the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP (TC45) and catalytically inactive TC45-D182A cDNAs into KTR cells by retroviral gene transfer. Subsequently, we analyzed the sensitivity to imatinib mesylate and the status of signaling pathways in the transduced cells. RESULTS: The overall levels of STAT5 phosphorylation were significantly higher in KTR cells as compared to KT-1 cells, but reconstitution of TC-PTP in KTR cells resulted in a dramatic decrease of STAT5 phosphorylation. Furthermore, STAT5 phosphorylation was ablated by imatinib mesylate in KT-1 cells but remained elevated in KTR cells. In contrast, we observed no difference in BCR-ABL or JAK2 phosphorylation and no difference in activation of other signaling pathways. Importantly, reconstitution of TC-PTP in KTR cells to levels found in parental KT-1 cells restored their sensitivity to imatinib mesylate as monitored by reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that forced expression of TC-PTP in imatinib mesylate-resistant KTR cells can restore sensitivity to imatinib mesylate. Our studies indicate that loss of TC-PTP may represent a novel mechanism by which CML cells can acquire imatinib mesylate-resistance.","['Shimizu, Takatsune', 'Miyakawa, Yoshitaka', 'Iwata, Satoshi', 'Kuribara, Akiko', 'Tiganis, Tony', 'Morimoto, Chikao', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Shimizu T', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Iwata S', 'Kuribara A', 'Tiganis T', 'Morimoto C', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kizaki M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2004/11/13 09:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2004/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(04)00269-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2004.07.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Nov;32(11):1057-63. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.07.024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other inadequacies of current transduction protocols are related to their multi-step procedures, e.g., using tissue-culture flasks, roller bottles or gas-permeable bags for clinical application. METHODS: In comparison with a conventional bag transduction protocol, a 'closed' hollow-fiber bioreactor system (HBS) was exploited to culture and transduce human peripheral blood CD34(+) progenitor cells (PBPC(MPS)) from patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) using an amphotropic retroviral vector based on a murine Moloney leukemia virus LN prototype. Both short-term colony-forming cell (CFC) and long-term culture initiating cell (LTCIC) assays were employed to determine transduction frequency and transgene expression in committed progenitor cells and primitive progenitors with multi-lineage potentials. RESULTS: A novel ultrafiltration-transduction method was established to culture and transduce enzyme-deficient PBPC(MPS) over a 5-day period without loss in viability and CD34 identity (n = 5). Significantly higher transduction efficiencies were achieved in primary CFC that derived from the HBS (5.8-14.2%) in comparison with those from gas-permeable bags (undetectable to 1.7%; p < 0.01). Up to 15-fold higher-than-normal enzyme activity was found in selected PBPC(MPS)-LP1CD transductants. Moreover, higher gene transfer (4.4-fold) and expression in very primitive progenitors were observed in products from the HBS compared with bag experiments as indicated by CFC derived from primitive LTCIC. Remarkably, with relatively modest gene transfer levels in LTCIC from HBS experiments, the expression of the IDUA transgene corrected the enzyme-deficiency in 5-week long-term cultures (LTC). CONCLUSIONS: MPS I progenitor cells achieved normalized enzyme levels in LTC after transduction in a HBS system. These studies demonstrate the advantages of a bioreactor-transduction system for viral-mediated stem cell gene transfer.","['Pan, Dao', 'Stroncek, David F', 'Whitley, Chester B']","['Pan D', 'Stroncek DF', 'Whitley CB']","['Gene Therapy Program, Department of Pediatrics, and Institute of Human Genetics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

However, clinical application of the strategy has been hampered by the potential side effects associated with immunogenicity and by low transduction efficiency. METHODS: A fully human CIR was constructed that triggers immune activation through the zeta chain of CD3 and contains a human single-chain antibody fragment specific for an extracellular epitope of HER2. PBMC were transduced with the CIR using gibbon-ape leukemia virus envelope pseudotyped retroviruses. In vitro cytotoxicity and inhibition assays were carried out using normal and tumor cell lines expressing different levels of HER2. RESULTS: Bulk populations of CIR-transduced PBMC could express high levels of the construct and subcloning ensured stable expression. CIR-mediated killing and growth inhibition of targets expressing high HER2 levels were very efficient at low effector-to-target ratios. Under the same experimental conditions, CIR-mediated activity against normal cells expressing low HER2 levels was marginal. The CIR-mediated recognition of target cells induced the release of soluble factors able to inhibit growth of both HER-positive and HER2-negative bystander tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Human CIR-transduced PBMC exert a potent and dose-dependent anti-tumor activity. Target antigen level appeared to be a critical determinant of specificity and delivery of signals leading to redirected effector functions. Soluble factors, released by redirected effectors at the site of antigen-driven activation, mediate potent bystander killing.","['Turatti, Fabio', 'Figini, Mariangela', 'Alberti, Paola', 'Willemsen, Ralph A', 'Canevari, Silvana', 'Mezzanzanica, Delia']","['Turatti F', 'Figini M', 'Alberti P', 'Willemsen RA', 'Canevari S', 'Mezzanzanica D']","['Molecular Therapies Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods']",2004/11/13 09:00,2005/06/18 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.647 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2005 Feb;7(2):158-70. doi: 10.1002/jgm.647.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we previously noticed modulation of surface antigen expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during the early treatment. Hence, we investigated this in 30 children with B-cell precursor ALL consecutively enrolled in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 protocol. Quantitative expression of seven antigens useful in MRD monitoring was studied at diagnosis and compared to that measured at different time points of remission induction therapy. Downmodulation in the expression of CD10 and CD34 occurred at follow-up. By contrast, upmodulation of CD19, CD20, CD45RA, and CD11a was observed, while the expression of CD58 remained stable. Despite this, we could unambiguously discriminate leukemic cells from normal residual B cells. This holds true when bone marrow (BM) samples from similarly treated T-ALL patients, but not from healthy donors, were used as reference.

In this study, we report that acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells exploit the Ras-MAPK activation pathway to phosphorylate at Ser112 and to inactivate the proapoptotic protein Bad, delaying arsenic trioxide (ATO)-induced apoptosis. Both in APL cell line NB4 and in APL primary blasts, the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Bad phosphorylation by MEK1 inhibitors enhanced apoptosis in ATO-treated cells. We isolated an arsenic-resistant NB4 subline (NB4-As(R)), which showed stronger ERK1/2 activity (2.7-fold increase) and Bad phosphorylation (2.4-fold increase) compared to parental NB4 cells in response to ATO treatment. Upon ATO exposure, both NB4 and NB4-As(R) cell lines doubled protein levels of the death antagonist Bcl-xL, but the amount of free Bcl-xL that did not heterodimerize with Bad was 1.8-fold greater in NB4-As(R) than in the parental line. MEK1 inhibitors dephosphorylated Bad and inhibited the ATO-induced increase of Bcl-xL, overcoming ATO resistance in NB4-As(R).

In contrast, several individual institutions have reported that benign tumors are more common than malignant tumors. To clarify these discordant findings, we surveyed the primary pathology records from 4 major pediatric centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pathology records of the contributing centers were culled for primary testicular masses in boys 12 years and younger. Older boys and those with either paratesticular tumors or leukemia were excluded. The prevalence of each histological subtype was calculated from the pooled cases. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients met our criteria. Only 15% had yolk sac tumors. Teratomas comprised 48% of the tumors (mature 44%, immature 4%). Epidermoid cysts were found in another 14% of patients. Gonadal stromal cell tumors represented 13% of the total, divided among granulosa cell (5%), Leydig cell (4%), Sertoli cell (3%) and mixed gonadal stromal cell (1%). Other pathology, including cystic dysplasia (2), lymphoma (4), inflammatory pseudotumor (1) and gonadoblastoma (2), made up 9% of the total number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: We found that benign lesions represent the majority of primary testis tumors (74%), with the most common histological type being teratoma (48%). The reported high prevalence rates of prepubertal yolk sac tumors probably results from a reporting bias, since benign tumors are less likely to be submitted to tumor registries. Therefore, the primary operative approach to the majority of testis tumors in boys 12 years and younger should entail testis sparing surgery. Orchiectomy should be reserved for histologically confirmed malignancy based on increased preoperative alpha-fetoprotein and/or frozen section analysis of the tumor.","['Pohl, Hans G', 'Shukla, Aseem R', 'Metcalf, Peter D', 'Cilento, Bartley G', 'Retik, Alan B', 'Bagli, Darius J', 'Huff, Dale S', 'Rushton, H Gil']","['Pohl HG', 'Shukla AR', 'Metcalf PD', 'Cilento BG', 'Retik AB', 'Bagli DJ', 'Huff DS', 'Rushton HG']","[""Department of Urology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*pathology']",2004/11/13 09:00,2006/05/02 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['00005392-200412010-00059 [pii]', '10.1097/01.ju.0000144402.13556.74 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2004 Dec;172(6 Pt 1):2370-2. doi: 10.1097/01.ju.0000144402.13556.74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive patients with pathologically proven PML including 29 patients with HL, 21 with Med-DLBCL, and 16 with T-LBL underwent CT prior to therapy. CT scans were independently reviewed by 2 radiologists who were blinded to the pathologic diagnosis for the following considerations: pattern of involvement (i.e., morphologic features, mass size, and contrast enhancement pattern), and ancillary findings at other sites including neck, abdomen, and pelvis. Interobserver agreement was measured by Kappa statistics, and independent predictors were calculated using multiple logistic regression analysis for determining the likelihood of the subtypes based on CT. RESULTS: Characteristic features of HL included irregular contour of the anterior mediastinal mass (20 of 29, 69%) and high prevalence of associated mediastinal lymphadenopathy (28 of 29, 97%). Characteristic features of Med-DLBCL included regular contour (14 of 21, 67%) and absence of cervical and abdominal lymphadenopathy (0 of 21). Characteristic features of T-LBL included regular contour (12 of 16, 75%) and high prevalence of cervical (9 of 16, 56%) and abdominal (6 of 16, 38%) lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly (11 of 16, 69%). CT findings independently associated with increased likelihood of HL were surface lobulation (P <0.01), the absence of vascular involvement (P <0.01), or pleural effusion (P <0.05). The presence of vascular involvement was associated with increased likelihood of Med-DLBCL (P <0.001). Furthermore, CT findings including the presence of cervical lymph nodes or inguinal lymph nodes (P <0.001), the presence of pericardial effusion (P <0.05), and the absence of surface lobulation (P <0.05) were significantly associated with the likelihood of T-LBL.

Here we demonstrate that adult mice lacking EphA4 (-/-), a molecule essential for correct guidance of spinal cord axons during development, exhibit axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord hemisection. Anterograde and retrograde tracing showed that axons from multiple pathways, including corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts, crossed the lesion site. EphA4-/- mice recovered stride length, the ability to walk on and climb a grid, and the ability to grasp with the affected hindpaw within 1-3 months of injury. EphA4 expression was upregulated on astrocytes at the lesion site in wild-type mice, whereas astrocytic gliosis and the glial scar were greatly reduced in lesioned EphA4-/- spinal cords. EphA4-/- astrocytes failed to respond to the inflammatory cytokines, interferon-gamma or leukemia inhibitory factor, in vitro. Neurons grown on wild-type astrocytes extended shorter neurites than on EphA4-/- astrocytes, but longer neurites when the astrocyte EphA4 was blocked by monomeric EphrinA5-Fc. Thus, EphA4 regulates two important features of spinal cord injury, axonal inhibition, and astrocytic gliosis.","['Goldshmit, Yona', 'Galea, Mary P', 'Wise, Graham', 'Bartlett, Perry F', 'Turnley, Ann M']","['Goldshmit Y', 'Galea MP', 'Wise G', 'Bartlett PF', 'Turnley AM']","['Center for Neuroscience and School of Physiotherapy, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA4)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Brain/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gliosis/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Lameness, Animal/etiology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nerve Regeneration/*physiology', 'Neurites/ultrastructure', 'Paraplegia/etiology/physiopathology', 'Pyramidal Tracts/pathology', 'Receptor, EphA4/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Recovery of Function', 'Red Nucleus/pathology', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/pathology/*physiopathology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2004/11/13 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/45/10064 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2981-04.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2004 Nov 10;24(45):10064-73. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2981-04.2004.,,,,PMC6730186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spermatogonia and, to a lesser extent, the somatic cells, exhibited specific LIF-binding sites. These results were strengthened by in situ analysis, showing predominant LIF-R immunoreactivity in spermatogonia at all ages studied. In addition to the 190-kDa LIF-R, Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a 50- to 60-kDa C-terminal gp190 isoform. This truncated form, which is unable to bind LIF, was the only form expressed in meiotic germ cells, suggesting an original down-regulation process of LIF-R expression during spermatogenesis. Finally, we showed that LIF increased [3H]-thymidine incorporation in spermatogonia in microdissected, cultured seminiferous tubules. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that LIF has a role in the regulation of the spermatogonial cell compartment.","['Dorval-Coiffec, Isabelle', 'Delcros, Jean-Guy', 'Hakovirta, Harri', 'Toppari, Jorma', 'Jegou, Bernard', 'Piquet-Pellorce, Claire']","['Dorval-Coiffec I', 'Delcros JG', 'Hakovirta H', 'Toppari J', 'Jegou B', 'Piquet-Pellorce C']","[""INSERM U.625, Groupe d'Etude de la Reproduction chez l'homme et les mammiferes, Universite de Rennes I, 35042 Rennes cedex, France.""]",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20041110,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Germ Cells/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Spermatogenesis/*physiology', 'Spermatogonia/*metabolism', 'Testis/cytology/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",2004/11/13 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['biolreprod.104.034892 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.104.034892 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2005 Mar;72(3):602-11. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.104.034892.

Both of these fractions suppressed strongly the proliferation of HL-60 cells with apoptosis induction in a dose-dependent manner.

Among these are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which produces acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, and murine leukemia virus (MuLV), which produces leukemias in rodents. We have obtained the first atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of these two retroviruses, both isolated from culture media and emerging from infected cell surfaces. The HIV virions are 127 nm diameter on average, and those of MuLV are 145 nm, although there are wide distributions about the means. The AFM images show the arrangement of the envelope protein, responsible for host cell entry, on the surfaces of both virions. Disruption of the viruses using detergents or physical means allowed us to visualize interior structures, including the outer shells of both MuLV and HIV, the cores of MuLV, and the nucleic acid of HIV complexed with core proteins. Using immunolabeling techniques borrowed from electron microscopy, we were able to demonstrate the binding of gold-labeled antibodies directed against the envelope protein of MuLV. The AFM images are revealing, not only in terms of surface topology, but in terms of interior features as well, and they reveal the eccentricities and uniqueness of individual virus particles rather than yielding the average member of the population. Further application of AFM to viruses associated with other pathologies may ultimately have a significant impact on the diagnosis and treatment of virus-promoted diseases.","['Kuznetsov, Yu G', 'Victoria, J G', 'Low, A', 'Robinson, W E Jr', 'Fan, H', 'McPherson, A']","['Kuznetsov YG', 'Victoria JG', 'Low A', 'Robinson WE Jr', 'Fan H', 'McPherson A']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-4800, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CD32455/CD/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States', 'GM58868/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Scanning,Scanning,7903371,,IM,"['Animals', 'HIV/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Retroviridae/*ultrastructure']",2004/11/13 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sca.4950260409 [doi]'],ppublish,Scanning. 2004 Sep-Oct;26(5):209-16. doi: 10.1002/sca.4950260409.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies using this model are elucidating the mechanisms by which stromal cells inhibit apoptosis of cultured normal precursor B cells and have demonstrated that the apoptotic rate of cultured leukemic precursor B cells can predict clinical outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In contrast to apoptosis, cell division in this model has not been well characterized. In this study, we quantified the rates of cell division in cultured primary human normal and leukemic precursor B cells by labeling precursor B cells with the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimyl ester. Based on the rate of decreasing fluorescent signal over 3 weeks, normal CD19(+), CD10(+) precursor B cells divided once every 90.5 hours, a number that correlates well with the known in vivo rate of 65.5 hours. The division rates were similar among different cultures and constant throughout the 3 weeks of culture, suggesting that the variable expansions of precursor B cells seen among different samples and culture durations are not secondary to different cell division rates. Unlike normal cells, cultured leukemic B cells had a heterogeneous division rate that ranged from once every 26-240 hours. These rates correlated well with their respective in vivo proliferation index. These findings indicate that the stroma-based cultures faithfully replicate in vivo cell division rates and can be used to elucidate the pathways that regulate cell division of primary human precursor B cells.","['Cooperman, Jonathan', 'Neely, Robert', 'Teachey, David T', 'Grupp, Stephen', 'Choi, John Kim']","['Cooperman J', 'Neely R', 'Teachey DT', 'Grupp S', 'Choi JK']","[""Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Succinimides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Infant', 'Ki-67 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/biosynthesis', 'Succinimides/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2004/11/13 09:00,2005/04/02 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/6/1111 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.22-6-1111 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2004;22(6):1111-20. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.22-6-1111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most commonly, they occur as internal tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane domain (Flt3-ITD) that transform myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo and that induce aberrant signaling and biologic functions. We identified RGS2, a regulator of G-protein signaling, as a gene specifically repressed by Flt3-ITD. Here we demonstrate an important role of RGS2 in Flt3-ITD-mediated transformation. RGS2 was repressed after forced expression of activating Flt3 mutations in 2 myeloid cell lines (32Dcl3 and NB4). Furthermore, RGS2 was repressed in Flt3-mutation-positive AML cases in comparison to Flt3-mutation-negative cases, especially in Flt3-ITD-positive cases with a high ITD-to-wild-type (WT) ratio. Coexpression of RGS2 with Flt3-ITD inhibited Flt3-ITD-induced autonomous proliferation and clonal growth of 32D cells. RGS2 also inhibited Flt3-ITD-induced phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase beta (Gsk3-beta) without influencing signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation. In addition, RGS2 reinduced the expression of Flt3-ITD-repressed CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (c/EBPalpha) and antagonized the Flt3-ITD-induced differentiation block in 32D cells. Expression analyses in myeloid cell lines revealed induction of RGS2 during granulocytic but not during monocytic differentiation. Taken together, RGS2 is a novel mediator of myeloid differentiation, and its repression is an important event in Flt3-ITD-induced transformation.","['Schwable, Joachim', 'Choudhary, Chunaram', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Tickenbrock, Lara', 'Sargin, Bulent', 'Steur, Claudia', 'Rehage, Maike', 'Rudat, Annika', 'Brandts, Christian', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Serve, Hubert']","['Schwable J', 'Choudhary C', 'Thiede C', 'Tickenbrock L', 'Sargin B', 'Steur C', 'Rehage M', 'Rudat A', 'Brandts C', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Serve H']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology, and Oncology, and the Interdisciplinary Clinical Research Center (IZKF), University Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Strasse 33, 48129 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RGS Proteins)', '0 (RGS2 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'RGS Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/11/13 09:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45824-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-03-0940 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 1;105(5):2107-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-0940.

The present study evaluated the role of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligand incompatibility using a well-defined and uniform setting of unmodified allogeneic HSCT in 374 patients with myeloid leukemias. The most striking finding was a significant heterogeneity in the 5-year estimates of hematologic leukemic relapse after human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical (n = 237; 22%), HLA class I-disparate (n = 89; 18%), and KIR ligand-incompatible transplantations (n = 48; 5%) (P < .04). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the relative relapse risk (RR) was influenced by HLA class I disparity alone (RR 0.49), but was lowest after HLA class I-disparate, KIR ligand-incompatible transplantations (RR 0.24) (P < .008). The primary graft failure rates, however, increased from 0.4% after HLA class I-identical to 2.3% after HLA class I-disparate, and to 6.3% after KIR ligand-incompatible transplantations, respectively (P < .02).

CD40 ligand is an accessory signal for T-cell activation and can overcome T-cell anergy. The OX40-OX40 ligand pathway is involved in the subsequent expansion of memory antigen-specific T cells. We expressed both CD40L and OX40L on B-CLL cells by exploiting the phenomenon of molecular transfer from fibroblasts overexpressing these ligands. We analyzed the effects of the modified B-CLL cells on the number, phenotype, and cytotoxic function of autologous T cells in 7 B-CLL patients. Transfer of CD40L and OX40L was observed in all and was followed by the up-regulation of B7-1 and B7-2. The culture of CD40L/OX40L-expressing B-CLL cells with autologous T cells generated CD4+/CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lines, which secreted interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and granzyme-B/perforin in response to autologous, but not to allogeneic, B-CLL cells or to autologous T-cell blasts. CD40L or OX40L alone was insufficient to expand tumor-reactive T cells.

We previously showed in the DA1-3b/C3H mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia that dormant tumor cells resist cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated killing because they overexpress B7-H1. Here, we vaccinated mice with DA1-3b cells transduced with CXCL10. Vaccinated mice developed a strong systemic immunity that led to the cure of established leukemia without persistence of dormant tumor cells. In vivo depletion of natural killer (NK) cells from the mice abrogated the protective effect of the vaccine. Long-term persistent leukemic cells resist CTL-mediated lysis but were killed by NK cells from mice vaccinated with DA1-3b/CXCL10. These NK cells expressed B7-H1. Recombinant CXCL10, CXCL9, CXCL11, and CXCL12 chemokines induced expression of B7-H1 on mouse and human NK cells in vitro. Mouse and human B7-H1+ NK cells induced proliferation of T cells and production of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha in vitro, and in vivo blocking of B7-H1 inhibited the protective effect of vaccination. Thus, CXCL10 induces antileukemic immunity, at least partially by stimulating NK cells to express B7-H1+. This antitumor effect is in contrast to the effect of B7-H1 when expressed on tumor cells because it stops cytotoxic lymphocytes from killing those tumor cells.","['Saudemont, Aurore', 'Jouy, Nathalie', 'Hetuin, Dominique', 'Quesnel, Bruno']","['Saudemont A', 'Jouy N', 'Hetuin D', 'Quesnel B']","['Institut National de la Sante et de Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite 524, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cd274 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL10)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'B7-H1 Antigen', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokine CXCL10', 'Chemokines, CXC/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Peptides/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Vaccination']",2004/11/13 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45748-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3458 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 15;105(6):2428-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3458.

In the present study, by exploiting our current knowledge on NK receptors and their ligands on target cells, we investigated the interactions between NK and leukemic cells. We show that the size of the NK cell subset expressing the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) not engaged by the HLA-class I alleles of the patient parallels the degree of NK cytotoxicity against leukemic cells. A sharp down-regulation of HLA-class I molecules has been detected in various leukemias and it was more frequent in myeloid than in lymphoblastic leukemias. Analysis of the ligands for triggering NK receptors revealed the consistent expression of Poliovirus receptor (PVR) and Nectin-2 in myeloid leukemias. In contrast, major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain molecules A/B (MICA/B) and UL1b-binding protein (ULBPs) were either absent or weakly expressed. Accordingly, NK-mediated lysis of these leukemias was dependent on DNAM-1 but not NKG2D. The major role of NKp46 and NKp30 was also confirmed. The expression of PVR and/or Nectin-2 was less frequent in lymphoblastic leukemias. In most leukemias, both CD48 and NTBA were down-regulated.

To improve the sensitivity of RCR detection and to shorten the assay period, we have developed a novel RCR detection method (infectivity RT-PCR method) based on real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in combination with virus infection and a novel virus concentration method using polyethyleneimine (PEI)-conjugated magnetic beads. In this method, permissive cells were infected with RCR samples, and amplified RCR in the culture supernatants was adsorbed by PEI-beads. Then RCR RNA extracted from PEI-beads was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We demonstrated that 1 infectious unit (iu) of RCR spiked in 10(6) cfu/ml of vector products could be detected within 3 days, and the sensitivity for viral detection was increased 3- to 10-fold compared with the direct S+L- assay. By this method, the presence of retroviral vector interfered with RCR detection only slightly. In conclusion, infectivity RT-PCR conducted in conjunction with virus concentration using PEI-beads can detect RCR more sensitively and rapidly than the conventional infectivity assay.","['Uchida, Eriko', 'Sato, Koei', 'Iwata, Akiko', 'Ishii-Watabe, Akiko', 'Mizuguchi, Hiroyuki', 'Hikata, Mikio', 'Murata, Mitsuhiro', 'Yamaguchi, Teruhide', 'Hayakawa, Takao']","['Uchida E', 'Sato K', 'Iwata A', 'Ishii-Watabe A', 'Mizuguchi H', 'Hikata M', 'Murata M', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Hayakawa T']","['National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan. uchida@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biologicals,Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization,9004494,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', '*Consumer Product Safety', 'Genetic Vectors/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*prevention & control', '*Virus Replication']",2004/11/13 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2004/11/13 09:00'],"['2004/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1045-1056(04)00025-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biologicals.2004.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biologicals. 2004 Sep;32(3):139-46. doi: 10.1016/j.biologicals.2004.08.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of the identification of FN fragment responsible for TNF-alpha secretion, a 30-kDa fragment derived from the carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding (Hep 2) domain of FN was isolated from the FN digest. The TNF-alpha secretion was abrogated by treatment of RBL-2H3 cells with cycloheximide, indicating the de novo synthesis of TNF-alpha, but not with polymyxin B, excluding the possible TNF-alpha induction by some contaminated lipopolysaccharides. A 22-mer synthetic peptide originated from the Hep 2 domain, termed FNIII14, which has been found to negatively modulate the beta1 integrin activation, had the ability to induce TNF-alpha production, whereas this activity of FNIII14 disappeared by shuffling a YTIYVIAL sequence essential for the integrin-inactivating activity. FNIII14 suppressed the spreading of RBL-2H3 cells on FN substrate, wherein RBL-2H3 cell proliferation was inhibited with FNIII14 in a dose-dependent manner.

Whereas prior to the first reports in the early 1980's it was felt that DS children with AML had poor outcomes, these clinical trials concluded that DS had a better outcome than non-DS (NDS) children with AML. With these recent reports, it is clear that DS children have a better outcome utilizing less intensive chemotherapy regimens. They also tolerate the more intensive regimens less well than the NDS children. This review focuses upon the six multi-institutional reports that described the DS and AML experience in order to better ascertain the chemotherapy combinations that may be useful in the future for these children. Regimens of varying intensity have all had similar outcomes. In general, the remission rates are approximately 90% with event-free survival (EFS) approximating 70-80%. Most recently, the clinical trials have been large enough to explore prognostic factors specifically in the DS children. This has identified that the younger DS children fair significantly better than the older children. AML in DS is unique and these differences in comparison to NDS children are highlighted. The significantly better outcomes for DS children likely represents a combination of the unique AML seen in DS children and the heightened sensitivity to cytarabine that DS AML cells have. Future trials should focus on age-stratified approaches that exploit the greater sensitivity of DS AML to cytarabine.","['Gamis, Alan S']",['Gamis AS'],"[""Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri, USA. agamis@cmh.edu""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment']",2004/11/10 09:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20207 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jan;44(1):13-20. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20207.,,,22,,"['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of diagnosis, 96.8% (n=519) were in chronic phase, 2.2% (n=12) in accelerated phase and 0.9% (n=5) in blastic phase. Eighty-two percent (n=443) of the patients have been treated by interferon (IFN). Sixteen point 3% (n=87) of the patients received a bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Forty-six percent (n=236) of the patients were treated with imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study providing detailed descriptive data concerning the use of medications and procedures in a large population of patients from the medical centers involved in treating CML patients in France. Further observational studies are needed to assess the impact of different treatment strategies and economic impact of CML care in France.","['Tardieu, Sophie', 'Brun-Strang, Catherine', 'Berthaud, Patrice', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Rousselot, Patrice', 'Sambuc, Roland']","['Tardieu S', 'Brun-Strang C', 'Berthaud P', 'Michallet M', 'Guilhot F', 'Rousselot P', 'Sambuc R']","['Medical Evaluation Department, Public Health Department, University Hospital of Marseille, Marseille, France. sophie.tardieu@ap-hm.fr']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Community Networks', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2004/11/10 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pds.1046 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2005 Aug;14(8):545-53. doi: 10.1002/pds.1046.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are several chemical substances present on the oil platforms, and these factors may influence workers' health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The international literature on offshore chemical exposure and health is summarised. RESULTS: The most important groups of chemical substances used on oil rigs are described: crude oil, production chemicals, asbestos and drilling chemicals. Different types of exposure during maintenance work are described as well. Very few exposure data are published. Acute, irritative health effects from chemical exposure are described, as well as chronic health effects like skin disorders and cancer. These workers seem to have a higher risk, that may be related to benzene exposure, of developing acute myelogenous leukemia. INTERPRETATION: Physicians who are treating patients working in the oil industry are advised to be aware of possible adverse health effects from the work environment on the rigs. Further exposure studies and research in this area are highly recommended, as the literature is scarce.","['Moen, Bente E', 'Steinsvag, Kjersti', 'Braveit, Magne']","['Moen BE', 'Steinsvag K', 'Braveit M']","['Seksjon for arbeidsmedisin, Institutt for samfunnsmedisinske fag, Universitetet i Bergen, 5018 Bergen. bente.moen@isf.uib.no']",['nor'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,"['0 (Hazardous Substances)', '0 (Hydrocarbons)', '0 (Petroleum)']",IM,"['*Extraction and Processing Industry', 'Hazardous Substances/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons/adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'North Sea', 'Norway', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Petroleum/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",2004/11/10 09:00,2004/11/16 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['1085865 [pii]'],ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2004 Oct 21;124(20):2627-9.,,,20,,,,,Hva vet vi om kjemisk helsefare offshore?,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall cumulative risk of an SMN by 25 years from 3-year survival from childhood cancer was 4.2%. Analysis of the cohort of nonretinoblastoma childhood cancers combined revealed a significant decline in SIR of SMN with increasing duration of follow-up. There was a greater risk of developing a SMN, particularly secondary acute myeloid leukaemia, in those diagnosed with childhood cancer from 1980 onwards. However, on multivariate modeling, this was not an independent risk factor. There was significant heterogeneity (P<0.001) in SIR of SMN across different treatment groups, the greatest risk observed in the group exposed to both radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The risks of SMN observed were comparable with those in other population-based studies. While the decline in SIR with duration of follow-up and the small excess numbers of cancers observed over later decades after diagnosis are reassuring, the high excess risk, particularly of leukaemia, associated with recent more intense therapy is of concern.","['Jenkinson, H C', 'Hawkins, M M', 'Stiller, C A', 'Winter, D L', 'Marsden, H B', 'Stevens, M C G']","['Jenkinson HC', 'Hawkins MM', 'Stiller CA', 'Winter DL', 'Marsden HB', 'Stevens MC']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Trust, Birmingham B4 6NH, UK.""]",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genetics, Population', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2004/11/10 09:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602226 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602226 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2004 Nov 29;91(11):1905-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602226.,,,,PMC2409766,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 122 relapsing patients included in two successive multicenter APL trials who achieved hematological second complete remission (generally after a salvage regimen of all-trans-retinoic acid [ATRA] combined with chemotherapy), 73 (60%) received allogeneic (n = 23) or autologous (n = 50) SCT. RESULTS: Seven-year relapse-free survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) in the autologous SCT group were 79.4%, 60.6%, and 59.8%, respectively, with a transplant-related mortality (TRM) of 6%. Of the 28 and two patients autografted with negative and positive, respectively, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction before auto SCT, three (11%) and one relapsed, respectively. In the allogeneic SCT group, 7-year RFS, EFS, and OS were 92.3%, 52.2%, and 51.8%, respectively, with 39% TRM. OS was significantly better in the autologous SCT group than in the allogeneic SCT group (P = .04), whereas RFS and EFS did not differ significantly (P = .19 and P = .11, respectively). In patients not receiving transplantation, 7-year RFS, EFS, and OS were 38%, 30.4%, and 39.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These retrospective data suggest that autologous SCT is very effective in APL relapsing after treatment with ATRA if performed in molecular remission. Allogeneic SCT yields few relapses, but it is associated with high TRM when performed after salvage with very intensive chemotherapy. Salvage with arsenic trioxyde, which has lower toxicity, should further improve the outcome of relapsing APL, especially before allogeneic SCT.","['de Botton, S', 'Fawaz, A', 'Chevret, S', 'Dombret, H', 'Thomas, X', 'Sanz, M', 'Guerci, A', 'San Miguel, J', 'de la Serna, J', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Reman, O', 'Stamatoulas, A', 'Fey, M', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Sotto, J J', 'Bourhis, J H', 'Parry, A', 'Chomienne, C', 'Degos, L', 'Fenaux, P']","['de Botton S', 'Fawaz A', 'Chevret S', 'Dombret H', 'Thomas X', 'Sanz M', 'Guerci A', 'San Miguel J', 'de la Serna J', 'Stoppa AM', 'Reman O', 'Stamatoulas A', 'Fey M', 'Cahn JY', 'Sotto JJ', 'Bourhis JH', 'Parry A', 'Chomienne C', 'Degos L', 'Fenaux P']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Avicenne, Universite Paris XIII, 125 rue de Stalingrad, 93009 Bobigny, France.""]",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041108,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Salvage Therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",2004/11/10 09:00,2005/01/29 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.03.127 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.127 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jan 1;23(1):120-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.127.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 490 patients, induction included cytarabine and daunorubicin (AD) or cytarabine and escalated doses of daunorubicin and etoposide +/- PSC-833 (ADE/ADEP). Intensification included one cycle of high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) followed by etoposide/cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone/diaziquone (group I), three HDAC cycles (group II), four intermediate-dose cytarabine (IDAC) or HDAC cycles (group III), or one HDAC/etoposide cycle and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT; group IV). RESULTS: Of 350 patients receiving AD, 73% achieved complete remission (CR), compared with 82% of 140 receiving ADE/ADEP (P = .04). Splenomegaly was associated with a lower CR rate (P < .001), and ADE/ADEP, with a higher CR rate in younger patients (P = .005). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 28% each for intensification groups I and II, compared with 41% and 45% for groups III and IV, respectively (P = .02). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 62% and 67% for groups I and II, respectively, compared with 54% and 44% for groups III and IV, respectively (P = .049). The type of postremission intensification remained significant for DFS and CIR in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: In younger adults with normal cytogenetics AML, splenomegaly predicts a lower CR rate, and the postremission strategies of either four cycles of I/HDAC or one cycle of HDAC/etoposide followed by ASCT are associated with improved DFS and reduced relapse compared with therapies that include fewer cycles of cytarabine or no transplantation.","['Farag, Sherif S', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Koduru, Prasad R K', 'Stamberg, Judith', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Block, Annemarie W', 'Vardiman, James W', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Farag SS', 'Ruppert AS', 'Mrozek K', 'Mayer RJ', 'Stone RM', 'Carroll AJ', 'Powell BL', 'Moore JO', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Koduru PR', 'Stamberg J', 'Baer MR', 'Block AW', 'Vardiman JW', 'Kolitz JE', 'Schiffer CA', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, A433A Starling-Loving Hall, 320 W Tenth Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. farag-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],,"['CA 03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041108,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FQL5EUP13W (diaziquone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAV regimen']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Aziridines/administration & dosage', 'Benzoquinones/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', '*Splenomegaly', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/11/10 09:00,2005/03/12 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.06.090 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.06.090 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jan 20;23(3):482-93. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.06.090.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: WT1 expression in hematologic malignant cells was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The cytotoxicity of a WT1-specific CTL clone against hematologic malignant cells, including myeloma cells, was examined by standard chromium-51 release assays. The extent of membrane damage induced by purified perforin was examined. Induction of WT1-specific CTLs from the patients with multiple myeloma (MM) was attempted, and we examined their function against myeloma cells. RESULTS: The expression levels of WT1 mRNA in myeloma and lymphoma cells were significantly lower than that in acute leukemia cells. Although the WT1 expression levels in myeloma and lymphoma cells were almost same, only myeloma cells were lysed efficiently by WT1-specific CTLs in a HLA-restricted manner. The amounts of interferon-gamma produced by WT1-specific CTLs in response to stimulation with myeloma cells and with lymphoma cells were almost the same, suggesting that WT1 protein is processed and expressed in the context of HLA class I molecules similarly on both myeloma and lymphoma cells. The extent of membrane damage induced by purified perforin appeared to be significantly higher in myeloma cells than in lymphoma cells. WT1-specific CTLs appeared to be present in patients with MM. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has shown that susceptibility of membranes to perforin is an important factor determining the sensitivity of target cells to CTL-mediated cytotoxicity and that WT1 is an ideal target antigen for cellular immunotherapy of MM.","['Azuma, Taichi', 'Otsuki, Takemi', 'Kuzushima, Kiyotaka', 'Froelich, Christopher J', 'Fujita, Shigeru', 'Yasukawa, Masaki']","['Azuma T', 'Otsuki T', 'Kuzushima K', 'Froelich CJ', 'Fujita S', 'Yasukawa M']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Ehime University School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '80890-47-7 (concanamycin A)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromium/metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*metabolism/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exocytosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2004/11/10 09:00,2005/05/04 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/21/7402 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0825 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Nov 1;10(21):7402-12. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0825.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Levels of human placental type GSTP1-1 are known to be increased in many tumors and hematopoietic diseases. In this work, we compare transcriptional mechanisms in cells that express or not GSTP1-1. Transient transfection assays are used to show that different GST-promoter reporter constructs generate cell-type specific levels of luciferase activity. In expressing cells, transcriptional activity is strongly dependent on AP-1 binding elements within the -65 to -75 bp region of the GSTP1 gene as shown by site-directed mutagenesis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that DNA binding activity is exclusively observed in GSTP1-1-expressing cells and is increased after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide, TPA, tert-butylhydroquinone and doxorubicin. Non-expressing cells present neither constitutive nor inducible AP-1 binding. Taken together, our results provide evidence for the induction of the GSTP1 gene via AP-1 binding activity in leukemia cells and contribute to a better understanding of the molecular events regulating genes involved in drug resistance mechanisms.","['Duvoix, Annelyse', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Delhalle, Sylvie', 'Blasius, Romain', 'Borde-Chiche, Patricia', 'Morceau, Franck', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Duvoix A', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Delhalle S', 'Blasius R', 'Borde-Chiche P', 'Morceau F', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'C12674942B (2-tert-butylhydroquinone)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Hydroquinones/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",2004/11/10 09:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(04)00378-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2004.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2004 Dec 28;216(2):207-19. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2004.05.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, several well-characterized factors, known to play important roles in apoptotic pathway, were investigated in BEA-induced CCRF-CEM cell death. CCRF-CEM cells were treated with BEA at concentrations from 1 to 10 microM for up to 24 h. The incidence of nuclear fragmentation and apoptotic body formation in the cells, cytosolic caspase-3 activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from mitochondria in BEA-treated cells were determined and compared with that in untreated cells. Moreover, to investigate the role of intracellular Ca++ in this cell death process, CCRF-CEM cells were primed with 3 microM of BAPTA/AM, a Ca++ chelator, to exclude intracellular Ca++ prior to the BEA treatment. The data revealed that BEA-induced cell death in CCRF-CEM cells exhibited a dose- and time-dependent manner. The incidence of nuclear fragmentation and apoptotic body formation was significantly increased in CCRF-CEM cells treated with BEA at concentrations of 1 microM or greater. Increase of cytosolic caspase-3 activity was also observed in BEA-treated cells with a dose-dependent manner. In addition, increased release of Cyt c from mitochondria was also observed in the cells treated with 10 microM BEA in a time-dependent pattern. The BAPTA/AM pretreatment partially blocked BEA-induced cell death in CCRF-CEM cells, indicating that intracellular Ca++ plays an important role, maybe as a mediator in cell death signaling, in this cell death pathway. The results support the notion that BEA-induced cell death in CCRF-CEM cells likely undergo through an apoptotic pathway on the basis of increase of release of Cyt c from mitochondria, increase of caspase-3 activity, and some observed typical apoptotic cellular changes in morphology.","['Jow, Guey-Mei', 'Chou, Cheng-Jen', 'Chen, Bing-Fang', 'Tsai, Jia-Huei']","['Jow GM', 'Chou CJ', 'Chen BF', 'Tsai JH']","['School of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, 510, Chung-Cheng Road, Hsin-Chuang, Taipei Hsien 242, Taiwan. nurs1019@mails.fju.edu.tw']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Morpholines)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '26S048LS2R (beauvericin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '65454-13-9 (lateritin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Egtazic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",2004/11/10 09:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(04)00455-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2004.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2004 Dec 28;216(2):165-73. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2004.06.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies have characterized how reverse transcriptase associates with recessed and exposed DNA 3' ends or RNA 5' ends to position the RNase H domain for cleavage, but little is known about how a nick might affect RNase H cleavages, or how RNase H carries out internal cleavages, which do not require positioning by a nucleic acid end. We have addressed these issues using model hybrid substrates and the reverse transcriptases of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Our results show that a nick separating an upstream RNA and a downstream RNA annealed to DNA is essentially ignored by RNase H, indicating that the RNA 5' end at a nick is not sufficient to position 5' end-directed cleavages. Cleavage sites that are located close to the 5' end of the downstream RNA are not recognized in the absence of the upstream RNA, and the 5' ends of the shorter upstream RNAs enhance cleavage at these sites. The recognition of an internal cleavage site depends on local sequence features found both upstream and downstream of the cleavage site, designated as the -1/+1 position. By analyzing the nucleotide frequencies in the sequence surrounding strong internal cleavage sites, preferred nucleotides have been identified in the flanking sequences spanning positions -14 to +1 for HIV-1 and -11 to +1 for M-MuLV. These data reveal that general degradation of the retroviral genome after minus-strand synthesis can occur through sequence-specific cleavages.","['Schultz, Sharon J', 'Zhang, Miaohua', 'Champoux, James J']","['Schultz SJ', 'Zhang M', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Box 357242, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7242, USA.']",['eng'],,['CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/physiology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Virus Replication']",2004/11/10 09:00,2005/02/23 09:00,['2004/11/10 09:00'],"['2004/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(04)01237-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2004.09.081 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2004 Nov 26;344(3):635-52. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2004.09.081.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Out of the 59 patients followed 4 years or longer, 23 (39%) are alive, free of disease, the proportion varying from 57% in the HD cases to 16% in the MM cases. The overall survival at 4 years was 49%. Negative prognostic factors for disease free survival at 4 years included male sex, lack of complete remission status at transplantation and MM diagnosis, whereas male sex and allografting were the negative prognostic factors for the 4-year overall survival.","['Cucuianu, A', 'Bosly, A']","['Cucuianu A', 'Bosly A']","['""Ion Chiricuta"" Cancer Institute, Dept. of Hematology, Bvd 21 Decembrie Nr. 73.

Acute promyelocytic leukaemia: encouraging results but persistent doubts.,135-7,"(1) Acute promyelocytic leukaemia is a rare disease. There is a high remission rate after combination treatment with tretinoin and anthracycline, but there is no established treatment for refractory or relapsed disease. Further treatment with tretinoin, combined with intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy, seems to give the best results in patients who qualify for this treatment, but assessment is limited. (2) Arsenic trioxide has now been approved for induction of remission and consolidation in patients with refractory or relapsed acute promyelocytic leukaemia. (3) The clinical evaluation dossier that supported the application contains data from two non comparative trials including 12 and 40 patients. A complete haematological response was obtained in 45 (87%) of the 52 patients, and the survival rate among patients in first relapse was 77% after a median follow-up of two years. These results are similar to those previously obtained with tretinoin plus intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy. (4) All the patients treated with arsenic trioxide experienced adverse events. This was to be expected given the acute and chronic toxicity of arsenicals. Most events included fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances, peripheral neuropathies, prolongation of the QT interval; and biochemical disturbances (hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, elevated transaminase activity). (5) Like tretinoin, arsenic trioxide can provoke a potentially severe leukocyte activation syndrome. (6) In practice, these encouraging data justify further assessment of arsenic trioxide.

The construct hinges upon the notion of Kullback-Leibler information gain. Kent and O'Quigley developed these ideas, obtaining simple, multiple and partial coefficients for the situation of proportional hazards regression. Their approach was based upon the idea of transforming a general proportional hazards model to a specific one of Weibull form. Xu and O'Quigley developed a more direct approach, more in harmony with the semi-parametric nature of the proportional hazards model thereby simplifying inference and allowing, for instance, the use of time dependent covariates. A potential drawback to the coefficient of Xu and O'Quigley is its interpretation as explained randomness in the covariate given time. An investigator might feel that the interpretation of the Kent and O'Quigley coefficient, as a proportion of explained randomness of time given the covariate, is preferable. One purpose of this note is to indicate that, under an independent censoring assumption, the two population coefficients coincide. Thus the simpler inferential setting for Xu and O'Quigley can also be applied to the coefficient of Kent and O'Quigley. Our second purpose is to point out that a sample-based coefficient in common use in the SAS statistical package can be interpreted as an estimate of explained randomness when there is no censoring. When there is censoring the SAS coefficient would not seem satisfactory in that its population counterpart depends on an independent censoring mechanism. However there is a quick fix and we argue in favour of its use.","[""O'Quigley, John"", 'Xu, Ronghui', 'Stare, Janez']","[""O'Quigley J"", 'Xu R', 'Stare J']","['Institut Curie, Paris. joq@biomath.jussieu.fr']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/11/09 09:00,2005/05/06 09:00,['2004/11/09 09:00'],"['2004/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.1946 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2005 Feb 15;24(3):479-89. doi: 10.1002/sim.1946.,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical and pathological data of 43 MDS patients over a 3-year period were reviewed. Survival analysis was performed according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) using the Kaplan-Meier method. Selected published studies for comparison were identified from MEDLINE search. RESULTS: The patients were followed up for a median duration of 175 days (range, 2 to 1044 days). The median survival for refractory anaemia (RA) and refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) has not been reached, but that for refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) was 250 days, 49 days and 44 days, respectively. The median survival for the low-risk and intermediate-1 IPSS categories has not been reached, while that for the intermediate-2 and high-risk categories was 58 days and 49 days, respectively. The survival analyses, according to the FAB classification and IPSS system, were statistically significant (P <0.05). Comparison of our data with those from neighbouring and Western countries revealed both similarity and disparity. We also noted different cytogenetic information in our cohort of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found distinctly unique cytogenetic and clinico-pathological characteristics in our MDS patients. However, whether true biological differences exist among MDS patients in different geographies and populations with different genetic and environmental backgrounds require further large multinational study.","['Lau, L G', 'Chng, W J', 'Liu, T C', 'Tan, L K', 'Ong, K H', 'Mow, B M F', 'Kueh, Y K']","['Lau LG', 'Chng WJ', 'Liu TC', 'Tan LK', 'Ong KH', 'Mow BM', 'Kueh YK']","['Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Hospital, Singapore.

The median time to leukocyte and platelet engraftment was faster in the twin group: 14 vs 17 (P=0.02) and 16 vs 26 days (P=0.09), respectively. The 5 years cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the sibling than in the twin group (38 vs 27%; P=0.05). The 5 year cumulative incidence of relapse was 32% (95% CI: 29-35%) for the siblings and 39% (95% CI: 26-60%; P=0.6) for the twins. A trend for better 5-years disease-free and overall survival was observed in the twin group: 34% (95% CI: 14-54%) vs 28% (95% CI: 25-31%; P=0.2) and 36% (95% CI: 15-57%) vs 32% (95% CI: 29-35%; P=0.09), respectively. In a multivariate analysis, stem cell transplantation from identical twins had a lower TRM: HR: 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2-0.9; P=0.03). The relapse rate was similar for both groups with a HR of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.07-2.1; P=0.5), with a better survival for the twins: HR 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4-1.0; P=0.07).

In microarray studies, the number n of samples is relatively small compared to the number p of genes per sample (usually in thousands). It is known that standard statistical methods in classification are efficient (i.e. in the present case, yield successful classifiers) particularly when n is (far) larger than p. This naturally calls for the use of a dimension reduction procedure together with the classification one. RESULTS: In this paper, the question of classification in such a high-dimensional setting is addressed. We view the classification problem as a regression one with few observations and many predictor variables. We propose a new method combining partial least squares (PLS) and Ridge penalized logistic regression. We review the existing methods based on PLS and/or penalized likelihood techniques, outline their interest in some cases and theoretically explain their sometimes poor behavior. Our procedure is compared with these other classifiers. The predictive performance of the resulting classification rule is illustrated on three data sets: Leukemia, Colon and Prostate.","['Fort, Gersende', 'Lambert-Lacroix, Sophie']","['Fort G', 'Lambert-Lacroix S']","['CNRS/LMC-IMAG BP 53, 38041 Grenoble cedex 9, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20041105,England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2004/11/09 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2004/11/09 09:00'],"['2004/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['bti114 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/bti114 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 1;21(7):1104-11. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti114.

DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate the potential alterations of these genes in lymphoid neoplasms, we examined the presence of gene mutations in exons 3, 4, and 9 in 69 cases with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 16 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 12 with follicular lymphomas (FL) and 17 with large B-cell-lymphomas (DLBCL), as well as in 4 lymphoid cell lines carrying the t(11;14) translocation, and 91 healthy blood donors. RESULTS: Three CLL and three MCL cases had 8p deletions. Two nucleotide changes in or near the intron 3 splice consensus sequence and a silent change were found. These rare changes were also present in the germ-line of the patients. The DR4 death domain A1322G polymorphism was significantly more frequent in MCL [odds ratio (OR) = 5.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.92-18.1] and CLL (OR = 4.5; CI, 1.18-17) patients than in a sex and age-adjusted healthy population. In contrast, the DR4 exon 4 C626G polymorphism was associated with a significant overall decreased risk for MCL (OR = 0.3; CI, 0.12-0.8). No mutations or cancer-associated polymorphic changes were found in DR5 domains.

These act by CD95L or granule cytotoxins, such as granzyme B (GrB) whose only known inhibitor is proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9). Since PI-9 protects cells from CTL, PI-9 may counteract GvL in leukemias. Our aim was to establish methods to analyze the expression and function of PI-9. DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened the most common pediatric ALL subsets, i.e. pre-B, common, and cortical T-ALL, for PI-9 expression, using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach which was correlated to semiquantitative and functional methods established in cell lines and patient probes. RESULTS: In vitro, PI-9 mediated resistance towards CTL and inhibited GrB-induced clevage of caspase 3. In patient-derived ALL cells, PI-9 high and PI-9 low specimens were studied by flow cytometry, RT-PCR, in vitro GrB treatment and NK assay, demonstrating concordant results and PI-9-dependent target cell protection. Analysis of PI-9 in probes from ALL patients showed differential expression, but no correlation with immunotype. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PI-9 in pediatric ALL is differentially expressed, without close correlation to subtype. Since PI-9 considerably alters GrzB and killer cell sensitivity, it may strongly influence the efficacy of GvL effects. The approaches applied here will allow evaluation of the expression and function of PI-9 in larger series of malignancies.","['Classen, Carl Friedrich', 'Ushmorov, Alexey', 'Bird, Phillip', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael']","['Classen CF', 'Ushmorov A', 'Bird P', 'Debatin KM']","[""University Children's Hospital Ulm, Germany. carl.classen@medizin.uni-ulm.de""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (SERPINB9 protein, human)', '0 (Serpins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Serpins/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*enzymology', 'Transfection']",2004/11/09 09:00,2006/05/06 09:00,['2004/11/09 09:00'],"['2004/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Nov;89(11):1314-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytoreductive therapy may reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications. Herein, we report the results of a long-term study of patients with ET treated with anagrelide to control thrombocytosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-nine (34 evaluable) patients (median age, 33 years; 24 previously untreated) were enrolled between 1989-1996; the mean platelet count prior to therapy was 1197x10(9)/L. Only 9 out of 34 evaluable patients were at high risk of thrombosis (platelet count more than 1500x10(9)/L). The initial dose of anagrelide (0.5 mg/bid for 7 days) was increased by 0.5 mg/day (maximum dose: 3 mg/day) until a response was seen. RESULTS: A complete response (platelets < 450x10(9)/L for >1 month) was seen in 15 /34 (44%) patients and a partial response (platelets 450-600x10(9)/L for >1 month) was seen in 17/34 ( 50%), so that the some kind of response was seen in 32/34 (94%) of the patients at a median time of 4.2 months after starting treatment. Seventeen patients (50%) are still being treated and have achieved platelet control for a maximum follow-up of 12.5 years. Late onset anemia occurred in 4/39 patients. Three out of 39 patients (8%) had cardiac disorders. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Anagrelide appears suitable for controlling thrombocytosis in ET patients over the long-term. This drug may be used in patients younger than 60 years, with the exclusion of women of child-bearing potential and subjects aged 40-60 years with a history of major thrombotic events. Anagrelide should not be administered to patients with cardiac disorders, and a careful approach to patients should include monitoring of heart function before and during treatment.","['Mazzucconi, Maria Gabriella', 'Redi, Roberta', 'Bernasconi, Sayla', 'Bizzoni, Luisa', 'Dragoni, Francesco', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Santoro, Cristina', 'Mandelli, Franco']","['Mazzucconi MG', 'Redi R', 'Bernasconi S', 'Bizzoni L', 'Dragoni F', 'Latagliata R', 'Santoro C', 'Mandelli F']","['Hematology Department of Biocellular Technology and Hematology, La SapienzaUniversity, Rome, Italy. mazzucconi@bce.med.uniroma1.it <mazzucconi@bce.med.uniroma1.it>']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Stomach Diseases/chemically induced', 'Tachycardia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors']",2004/11/09 09:00,2006/05/06 09:00,['2004/11/09 09:00'],"['2004/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Nov;89(11):1306-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-one females were selected and prospectively followed in a university bone marrow transplantation unit and gynecologic outpatient clinic in a university teaching hospital. The patients received regular gynecological examinations, hormonal assessment every 6 months including plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), 17-beta estradiol (E2), and transvaginal pelvic ultrasonography, mammography, and computerized bone mineralometry every 12 months. Self-assessment form of menopausal symptoms perception was filled in by all patients before HRT and during the observation period. RESULTS: All patients developed gonadal failure after SCT. The menopausal symptoms more frequently reported were: vasomotor (90%), muscleskeletal symptoms (61%), vulvo-vaginal atrophy (54%), and mood changes (54%). Fifteen premenopausal women out of 31 (51.6%) received systemic HRT on the basis of age (<45 years), absence of medical contraindication or subjective refusal, and complete remission of underlying malignancies post-SCT. The remaining patients (48.4%) did not receive HRT mainly for patient's refusal (29%), relapse of malignancy (13%) or liver toxicity (9.6%). HRT was effective in HRT treated patients promptly relieving unpleasant symptoms of gonadal failure. HRT was tolerated without minimal complications or serious side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Dramatic improvement in menopausal symptoms was observed in women on HRT although treatment was feasible only in nearly half of the patients. HRT alleviates unnecessary discomfort and improves the well-being of female patients post-transplant also by preventing menopause related complications. Feasibility and patients' compliance of HRT should be carefully evaluated in long-term survivors after stem cell transplantation.","['Piccioni, Paola', 'Scirpa, Paolo', ""D'Emilio, Ilenia"", 'Sora, Federica', 'Scarciglia, Marilisa', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'De Matteis, Silvia', 'Sica, Simona', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia']","['Piccioni P', 'Scirpa P', ""D'Emilio I"", 'Sora F', 'Scarciglia M', 'Laurenti L', 'De Matteis S', 'Sica S', 'Leone G', 'Chiusolo P']","['Instituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo Agostino Gemelli 8, 00168 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Maturitas,Maturitas,7807333,"['4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'T18F433X4S (Norethindrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Estradiol/administration & dosage', '*Estrogen Replacement Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Norethindrone/administration & dosage', '*Patient Compliance', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2004/11/09 09:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/11/09 09:00'],"['2003/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2004/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378512204001124 [pii]', '10.1016/j.maturitas.2004.02.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Maturitas. 2004 Dec 10;49(4):327-33. doi: 10.1016/j.maturitas.2004.02.015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although musculoskeletal symptoms are not usually related to severe disease, they can represent the first manifestation of an occult malignancy. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical manifestations and complementary findings of the patients referred to a pediatric rheumatology unit with a final diagnosis of malignancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all the children referred to a pediatric rheumatology unit between 1992 and 2002 whose final diagnosis was cancer. RESULTS: Of 3,982 patients referred, 10 had a final diagnosis of neoplasia (0.25 %). Six children were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, two with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, one with Ewing's sarcoma, and one with metastases from retinoblastoma. The most frequent symptoms were arthralgias, limp, or back pain. Laboratory studies revealed anemia and a significant increase in sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase values. Imaging studies contributed significantly to the diagnosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspirate in children with leukemia and by bone biopsy in those with bone tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Malignancies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with musculoskeletal pain, especially in the presence of organomegalies or abnormal laboratory or imaging studies.","['Dorronsoro Martin, I', 'Merino Munoz, R', 'Sastre-Urguelles, A', 'Garcia-Miguel Garcia-Rosado, P', 'Garcia-Consuegra Molina, J']","['Dorronsoro Martin I', 'Merino Munoz R', 'Sastre-Urguelles A', 'Garcia-Miguel Garcia-Rosado P', 'Garcia-Consuegra Molina J']","['Unidad de Reumatologia Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain. reumaped.hulp@salud.madrid.org']",['spa'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatic Diseases/*etiology']",2004/11/09 09:00,2005/03/19 09:00,['2004/11/09 09:00'],"['2004/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['13068026 [pii]', '10.1016/s1695-4033(04)78412-x [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2004 Nov;61(5):393-7. doi: 10.1016/s1695-4033(04)78412-x.,,,,,,,,Manifestaciones reumaticas como forma de comienzo de enfermedad maligna.,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by allogeneic SCT for various haematological disorders were either treated with (n = 18) or without (n = 9) G-CSF. IL-1ra plasma levels were serially determined by ELISA starting at day - 1 and continued until patients were engrafted. RESULTS: Patients receiving G-CSF had significantly shorter neutropenic periods and significantly lower mean C-reactive protein serum levels during the first 3 weeks succeeding bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Importantly, starting at day + 11 and paralleling the rise of peripheral blood leucocytes, increasing IL-1ra plasma concentrations were observed in both treatment groups. However, the magnitude of the IL-1ra surge was far greater in the G-CSF treatment group. Peak IL-1ra plasma level observed on day + 19 was 882.3 +/- 879.2 pg mL(-1) (mean +/- SD) in patients receiving G-CSF compared with 285.8 +/- 175.2 pg mL(-1) (mean +/- SD) in patients not receiving G-CSF (P = 0.0130). Furthermore, a direct correlation of IL-1ra with peripheral blood leucocytes was verified by the Spearman rank test (P = 0.0025). CONCLUSION: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mediated acceleration of neutrophil recovery following myeloablative therapy correlated with increased IL-1ra plasma concentrations. Our data suggest that IL-1ra constitutes an intrinsic component of the anti-inflammatory and neutrophil differentiating efficacy of G-CSF and, thus, IL-1ra may be required for the in vivo activity of G-CSF.","['Schwabe, M', 'Hartert, A-M', 'Bertz, H', 'Finke, J']","['Schwabe M', 'Hartert AM', 'Bertz H', 'Finke J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Postoperative Period', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2004/11/09 09:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/11/09 09:00'],"['2004/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['ECI1421 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2004.01421.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2004 Nov;34(11):759-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2004.01421.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the moment of recruiting, 10 of 65 transplanted subjects (15.3%) presented with signs of rejection of the transplanted tissue, thus they were excluded. The remaining 55 patients (21 males, 34 females, mean age 30.8 +/- 6.4 years), with a follow-up of 60 +/- 9 months after the transplant and without any treatment inducing osteopenia, underwent ABMT respectively for: chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 24); acute myeloid leukemia (n = 18); acute lymphatic leukemia (n = 13). One hundred and ten healthy control subjects (42 males and 68 females, mean age 31.0 +/- 3.7 years) matching with the patients for age, weight and height, were successively enrolled. All the participants were submitted to a densitometric evaluation (DEXA) of lumbar spine (L1-L4), of femoral neck and total femur; besides some skeletal metabolism parameters were dosed, such as: total alkaline phosphatase, bone alkaline phosphatase and urinary excretion of C-terminal telopeptide fragments normalized to creatinine. On the contrary, the morphometric evaluation, performed through a lateral dorsolumbar radiography, was actually carried out only in patients who had already undergone ABMT. The L1-L4 BMD study showed: 10/55 osteoporotic (18.1%), 19/55 osteopenic (34.5%) and 26/55 normal patients (47.4%). In transplanted patients BMD values, obtained at the three considered sites, resulted significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in comparison to controls. Moreover, in patients who underwent ABMT, a statistically significant increase was observed, in comparison to healthy subjects, in total alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.01), in bone alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.01) and in urinary excretion of C-terminal telopeptide fragments normalized to creatinine levels (p < 0.001). Seven of the 55 transplanted patients (12.7%) presented at the moment of Rx morphometric evaluation at least one vertebral fracture: 6 of whom were affected by osteoporosis and 1 by osteopenia. In conclusion, the subjects who had previously undergone ABMT maintain, even at a certain time after the transplant and without any rejection, an increased skeletal turnover and BMD values meanly lower than normal, leading to an increased risk for vertebral fracture.","['Letizia, Claudio', 'Celi, Massimiliano', 'Iori, Anna Paola', 'Verrelli, Cristiana', 'Caliumi, Chiara', 'Diacinti, Daniele', 'Arcese, William', ""D'Erasmo, Emilio""]","['Letizia C', 'Celi M', 'Iori AP', 'Verrelli C', 'Caliumi C', 'Diacinti D', 'Arcese W', ""D'Erasmo E""]","['Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche, Universita degli Studi La Sapienza, Policlinico Umberto I di Roma. claudio.letizia@uniroma1.it']",['ita'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Ann Ital Med Int,Annali italiani di medicina interna : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di medicina interna,8806705,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Bone and Bones/*metabolism', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Spinal Fractures/*epidemiology/etiology/*metabolism']",2004/11/09 09:00,2005/05/04 09:00,['2004/11/09 09:00'],"['2004/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Ital Med Int. 2004 Jul-Sep;19(3):175-83.,,,,,,,,"Massa ossea, metabolismo scheletrico e prevalenza delle fratture vertebrali in pazienti precedentemente sottoposti a trapianto di midollo osseo allogenico per leucemia.",,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the prognosis depends on the stage of the disease, according to the classifications of Rai and Binet.

It has become, therefore, useful to find new prognostic criteria particularly for these patients. In the present study, 30 patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia were investigated for stage of the disease, survival, immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, presence of nurse like cells in in vitro cultures and spontaneous clinical lymph node regression.

These autoantibody responses are involved in the glomerulonephritis that develops in these mice. This study was undertaken to explore possible connections between these 2 antigen systems. METHODS: We used monoclonal antibodies (mAb) derived from unmanipulated NZB/NZW mice to investigate the specificity of anti-gp70 and antichromatin autoantibodies for chromatin constituents, recombinant gp70, NZB retroviruses, and retrovirally infected cells. NZB mice were also immunized with retroviral particles and followed up for study of autoantibody responses. RESULTS: Spontaneous autoantibody production in NZB/NZW mice reflects high-level autoimmune responses to nuclear antigens and gp70 that do not cross-react with the other antigen. However, both types of autoantibodies have the capability to bind to the endogenous xenotropic virions NZB-X1 or NZB-X2. The mAbs to recombinant gp70 cross-reacted only with the NZB-X2 virus, whereas the antichromatin mAb frequently bound to both retroviruses. The binding of antichromatin autoantibodies was mediated by nuclear material complexed to the retrovirus, and studies showed that this material can be acquired through the budding process. Immunization with NZB-X1 or NZB-X2 virions induced strong responses to gp70 and was much more effective than chromatin at inducing autoantibody responses to chromatin and double-stranded DNA in NZB mice. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that retroviral virions may harbor nuclear antigens and may link together the autoimmune responses to the disparate antigens, chromatin and gp70.","['Tucker, Rebecca M', 'Roark, Christina L', 'Santiago-Raber, Marie-Laure', 'Izui, Shozo', 'Kotzin, Brian L']","['Tucker RM', 'Roark CL', 'Santiago-Raber ML', 'Izui S', 'Kotzin BL']","['University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colorado.']",['eng'],,['AR 37070/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Autoantibodies/*biosynthesis', 'Chromatin/immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Lupus Vulgaris/genetics/*immunology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Retroviridae/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",2004/11/06 09:00,2004/12/18 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.20623 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2004 Nov;50(11):3626-36. doi: 10.1002/art.20623.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors' case-control retrospective analysis comprised 491 consecutive patients treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston,TX) from 1993 to 2000. The cohort included 29 patients with Candida species bloodstream infection who had received GTX and 462 who had not. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in age, gender, APACHE II score, recent chemotherapy received, broad-spectrum antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, radiotherapy, intravascular catheter, and concordant antifungal therapy (P > or = 0.1). The patients who received GTX compared with those who did not had a higher incidence of underlying leukemia (86% vs. 29%, P <0.001), persistent neutropenia (59% vs. 18%, P <0.001), non-Candida albicans candidemia (Candida glabrata, 35%; Candida krusei, 31%: 90% vs. 67%, P=0.01), and breakthrough invasive mycosis (62% vs. 23%, P <0.001). Neutropenia was more prolonged in patients who received GTX (28 vs. 10 days, P <0.001). Also, more of the patients who received GTX had received hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (28% vs. 13%, P = 0.03), exposure (within 4 weeks) to antifungals (79% vs. 38%, P <0.001), and stays in critical care units (62% vs. 40%, P=0.02). The overall attributable mortality rate for 25 evaluable recipients of GTX was 48% (n=12), compared with 45% (n=115) of 254 evaluable patients in the control group (P=0.5). Of the 158 patients with leukemia, 25 (16%) had received GTX. In patients with leukemia, more of those who had received GTX experienced disseminated candidiasis (44% vs. 26%; P <0.07) and persistent neutropenia (68% vs. 43%, P <0.02), had candidemia that was more prolonged (> 72 hours, P <0.02), and had more stays in critical care units (68% vs. 44%, P <0.03). On the bases of a reduced multivariate model, a significantly increased risk of death was found for patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (odds ratio [OR]=2.51; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.99-6.31; P <0.05), for patients with persistent neutropenia (OR=4.57; 95% CI, 1.99-10.47; P <0.0003), and for patients with leukemia who also had prolonged candidemia (OR=3.59; 95% CI, 1.61-7.98; P <0.002), disseminated candidiasis (OR=5.19; 95% CI, 2.17-12.42; P <0.0002), or non-C. albicans candidemia (OR=5.02; 95% CI, 1.07-23.64; P <0.04). In patients with leukemia, death was attributable to candidemia in 50% of the GTX recipients, compared with 59% of the non-GTX patients who had received antifungal therapy alone (P=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the presence of multiple predictors of increased mortality, high-dose GTX therapy in these high-risk patients with cancer was associated with better than expected survival rates.","['Safdar, Amar', 'Hanna, Hend A', 'Boktour, Maha', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P', 'Hachem, Ray', 'Lichtiger, Benjamin', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Raad, Issam I']","['Safdar A', 'Hanna HA', 'Boktour M', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Hachem R', 'Lichtiger B', 'Freireich EJ', 'Raad II']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas M.

Deficiency in hENT1 confers resistance to toxicity of these drugs in a variety of model systems. Since some nucleoside analogs have a role in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), this study was undertaken to assess hENT1 abundance in NHL. A total of 115 cases of NHL of various subtypes and 15 reactive lymph nodes were evaluated for the presence of hENT1 protein using immunohistochemistry applied to frozen tissues. Samples were considered positive when >or=50% of neoplastic cells showed immunostaining. In reactive lymph nodes, hENT1 was confined to the germinal centers, whereas mantle zone B-cells and interfollicular T-cells were negative. In NHL, a relatively high frequency of hENT1 positivity was found in Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia (63%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL; 45%), and follicular lymphoma (40%). In DLCL, 26% of cases were positive for CD10, and CD10-positive DLCL cases were more likely to be hENT1 positive than CD10-negative cases (P=0.025). A lower frequency of hENT1 positivity was found in mantle cell lymphoma (13%) and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (37%). All marginal zone lymphomas (n=5), chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphomas (n=10), plasmacytoma (n=3), acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, and anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (n=5) were negative. In conclusion, hENT1 was most frequently found in benign and malignant follicular center cells. Prospective studies to assess the value of hENT1 immunostaining in predicting resistance to nucleoside chemotherapy for NHL are warranted.","['Chow, Laura', 'Lai, Raymond', 'Dabbagh, Laith', 'Belch, Andrew', 'Young, James D', 'Cass, Carol E', 'Mackey, John R']","['Chow L', 'Lai R', 'Dabbagh L', 'Belch A', 'Young JD', 'Cass CE', 'Mackey JR']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/*analysis', 'Germinal Center/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neprilysin/analysis']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['3800323 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.3800323 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2005 Apr;18(4):558-64. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800323.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of PML to inhibit growth and induce cell death in solid tumor cells, however, has not been determined. We therefore assayed the tumor suppressor activities of PML and compared them with those of p53 in four liver cancer cell lines. Following infection of cells with replication-deficient recombinant PML adenovirus, the exogenous PML localized in the nucleus and formed abnormally enlarged PML-nuclear bodies after 24 hours. In vitro growth curve analysis showed that the overexpressed PML initially induced a substantial G1 cell cycle arrest and triggered massive cell death in all tested cell lines, irrespective of their p53 status. PML-induced cell death decreased by about 30% in the presence of a broad caspase inhibitor, zVAD. The cell death effect of PML was higher than that induced by p53 over a longer period of time. As with p53, overexpression of PML was closely related to upregulation of p21 and decrease of cyclin D1 expression. Unexpectedly, retinoic acid (RA) antagonized rather than enhanced PML-triggered cell death. RA enhanced the expression of adenovirus-cytomegalovirus-promoted PML at both transcription and protein levels within 12 hours after treatment; however, the PML protein was significantly degraded in the presence of RA at days 3-5 postinfection. PML degradation was also observed in SK-BR3 breast cancer cells treated with RA. Taken together, our findings strongly support the hypothesis that PML acts as a strong independent cell death inducer and that RA conversely abolishes the therapeutic effects of the PML proteins through proteasomal degradation of the protein.","['Son, Se-Hee', 'Yu, Eunsil', 'Choi, Eun Kyung', 'Lee, Heuiran', 'Choi, Jene']","['Son SH', 'Yu E', 'Choi EK', 'Lee H', 'Choi J']","['Asan Institute for Life Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Zinc Fingers']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/03/09 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['7700755 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cgt.7700755 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2005 Jan;12(1):1-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700755.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This compound as well as some congeners, most notably the 4-hydroxylated analogue trans-bis(resorcylaldoximato)copper(II), CuRES2, also have potent antiproliferative activity against tumor cells in vitro. METHODS: CuRES2 was tested in vitro against a panel of 37 different types of human tumor cells (leukemias, small cell and non-small cell lung tumors, melanomas, as well as colon, breast, central nervous system, ovarian and renal tumors). The cells were incubated on microculture plates for 6 days, and the amount of viable cells was determined with the agent XTT, whose metabolic reduction gives a colored formazan compound. RESULTS: CuRES2 inhibited the proliferation of all the 37 cell lines studied. The IC50 values ranged between 0.575 and 8.57 microg/ml and the IC90 values between 1.74 and 20.6 microg/ml. Thus, it had distinct and very potent activity against all the cell lines studied, and the differences between the susceptibilities of different tumor types and cell lines were not very large. DISCUSSION: Clearly, CuRES2 is active against all the tumor cell lines studied. None of the cell lines (tumor types) demonstrates a significantly higher or lower susceptibility, but some trends appear to exist. Thus, most (but not all) of the leukemia and melanoma cell lines, the two ovarian cancer lines and one small cell lung cancer and one CNS cancer cell line were somewhat more susceptible than the cell lines on average. The results obtained for the melanomas are of special interest, since CuRES2 (and even more so CuSAO2) have very low aqueous solubilities. In cutaneous melanomas, their administration might, however, be very easy, since both compounds are soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and could thus easily be administered topically in this solvent whose ability to be absorbed through the skin is well known. CONCLUSION: The present results on human tumor cell lines are in line with previous observations that CuSAO2 and CuRES2 essentially totally inhibit the proliferation of leukemia L1210 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells in vitro in a concentration as low as approximately 5 microg/ml.","['Elo, Hannu']",['Elo H'],"['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. hannu.elo@helsinki.fi']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20041103,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (bis(salicylaldoximato)copper(II))', '29724-75-2 (bis(resorcylaldoximato)copper(II))', '789U1901C5 (Copper)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Copper/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Finland', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/09/16 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2003/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['81943 [pii]', '10.1159/000081943 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2004 Nov;50(5):229-33. doi: 10.1159/000081943.

RESULTS: We show that butyrate increased apoptosis induced by the three agents as seen by measurement of DNA content, annexin exposure and morphological characteristics. We also demonstrate that the process of apoptosis induced by butyrate and chemotherapeutic drugs involves the participation of caspases and induced activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9.

Therapy-related and de novo genomic translocation breakpoints cluster within a well-characterized 8.3-kb fragment of MLL. Repair of etoposide-stabilized DNA topoisomerase II covalent complexes may initiate MLL rearrangements observed in patients. We used a culture system of primary human hematopoietic CD34+ cells and inverse polymerase chain reaction to characterize the spectrum of stable genomic rearrangements promoted by etoposide exposure originating within an MLL translocation hotspot in therapy-related leukemia. Alterations to the region were observed at a readily detectable frequency in etoposide-treated cells. Illegitimate repair events after minimal repair included MLL tandem duplications and translocations, with minor populations of deletions or insertions. In stably repaired cells that proliferated for 10 to 14 days, the significant majority of illegitimate events were MLL tandem duplications, and several deletions, inversions, insertions, and translocations. Thus, etoposide promotes specific rearrangements of MLL consistent with the full spectrum of oncogenic events identified in leukemic samples. Although etoposide-initiated rearrangements are frequent, only a small subset of translocations occurs in cells that proliferate significantly.","['Libura, Jolanta', 'Slater, Diana J', 'Felix, Carolyn A', 'Richardson, Christine']","['Libura J', 'Slater DJ', 'Felix CA', 'Richardson C']","['Institute of Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 1150 St Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['R01CA100159/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA77683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA85469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Etoposide/*adverse effects', 'Fetal Blood', 'Gene Rearrangement/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45826-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-07-2683 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 1;105(5):2124-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2683.

CML is also the first malignancy for which targeted therapy has replaced conventional chemotherapy. Within a vast excess of proliferating progenitor cells that express breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) and are exquisitely sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) resides a small population of quiescent leukemic cells that, despite higher levels of BCR-ABL transcripts, exhibits innate insensitivity to IM. These cells remain after IM therapy, even when apparently complete responses are achieved, and they probably explain molecular disease persistence. Although it can be argued that patients may survive for many years with low levels of leukemia still present, it is possible to achieve disease clearance at the molecular level following an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The emergence of drug resistance with IM monotherapy also argues in favor of complete disease eradication that we believe should remain the ultimate therapeutic goal in CML. New approaches to the elimination of these primitive CML cells may thus be crucial to the development of curative strategies.","['Elrick, Lucy J', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Mountford, Joanne C', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Elrick LJ', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Mountford JC', 'Holyoake TL']","['Section of Experimental Haematology, Division of Cancer Sciences & Molecular Pathology, University of Glasgow, Level 3 Queen Elizabeth Bldg, Royal Infirmary, 10 Alexandra Parade, Glasgow G31 2ER, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20041104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45790-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-08-3373 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 1;105(5):1862-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-08-3373.

This can explain the virtual absence of RAS mutations in some types of tumors, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We report that in the CML cell line K562 Ras induces p21Cip1 expression through the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Because K562 cells are deficient for p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p14ARF, and p53, this would be the main mechanism whereby Ras up-regulates p21 expression in these cells. Accordingly, we also found that Ras suppresses K562 growth by signaling through the Raf-ERK pathway. Because c-Myc and Ras cooperate in cell transformation and c-Myc is up-regulated in CML, we investigated the effect of c-Myc on Ras activity in K562 cells. c-Myc antagonized the induction of p21Cip1 mediated by oncogenic H-, K-, and N-Ras and by constitutively activated Raf and ERK2. Activation of the p21Cip1 promoter by Ras was dependent on Sp1/3 binding sites in K562. However, mutational analysis of the p21 promoter and the use of a Gal4-Sp1 chimeric protein strongly suggest that c-Myc affects Sp1 transcriptional activity but not the binding of Sp1 to the p21 promoter. c-Myc-mediated impairment of Ras activity on p21 expression required a transactivation domain, a DNA binding region, and a Max binding region. Moreover, the effect was independent of Miz1 binding to c-Myc. Consistent with its effect on p21Cip1 expression, c-Myc rescued cell growth inhibition induced by Ras. The data suggest that in particular tumor types, such as those associated with CML, c-Myc contributes to tumorigenesis by inhibiting Ras antiproliferative activity.","['Vaque, Jose P', 'Navascues, Joaquin', 'Shiio, Yuzuru', 'Laiho, Marikki', 'Ajenjo, Nuria', 'Mauleon, Itsaso', 'Matallanas, David', 'Crespo, Piero', 'Leon, Javier']","['Vaque JP', 'Navascues J', 'Shiio Y', 'Laiho M', 'Ajenjo N', 'Mauleon I', 'Matallanas D', 'Crespo P', 'Leon J']","['Grupo de Biologia Molecular del Cancer, Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Unidad de Biomedicina del Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientiificas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Cantabria, 39011 Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041104,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB17 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins A-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins A-raf/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/02/26 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)76480-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M409503200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Jan 14;280(2):1112-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M409503200.

This report provides a summary of the information presented and is focused primarily on the pathology of NHLs in children and adults. In most countries, the WHO classification of lymphomas was used and most participating centers included immunohistochemistry using a wide array of lymphoid antibodies as part of routine diagnosis. Some of the series had been reviewed by an external panel of experts. B-cell lymphomas accounted for 82-88% of all NHLs. The proportions of chronic lymphatic leukemia (4-6%), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, 3-5%), and plasmacytoma (2-4%) were similar in the series presented. However, there was a significant variation in the proportion of follicular lymphoma (FL), which accounted for 15% and 11% in India and Kuwait, but less than 5% in Pakistan and Egypt. All of these frequencies are significantly lower than those reported in Western series. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma accounted for about 35% of cases in India but for more 50% in other countries, but this difference was not accounted for by an increased incidence in a single lymphoma subtype in India, but rather an apparent paucity of several subtypes (such as mantle cell and marginal zone lymphomas (MZL)) in other series. There were relatively high frequencies of Burkitt lymphoma in Egypt (7%) and precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in India (6-7%). Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) (not otherwise specified and angioimmunoblastic subtypes) accounted for 3-5% of NHLs, and extranodal lymphoma of T/NK cell type was rare (<1%). These differences in the relative proportions of NHL subtypes among developing countries and between developing countries and the rest of the world presumably arise from differences in environmental and genetic factors that influence lymphomagenesis and strongly suggest that more research in developing countries would provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of lymphoid neoplasms.","['Naresh, K N', 'Advani, S', 'Adde, M', 'Aziz, Z', 'Banavali, S', 'Bhatia, K', 'Belgaumi, A', 'Ezzat, A', 'Khaled, H', 'Mokhtar, N', 'Norton, A', 'Rohatiner, A', 'Sagar, T G', 'Taciyliz, N', 'Temmim, L', 'Venkatesh, C', 'Yan Tang, Jin', 'Magrath, I']","['Naresh KN', 'Advani S', 'Adde M', 'Aziz Z', 'Banavali S', 'Bhatia K', 'Belgaumi A', 'Ezzat A', 'Khaled H', 'Mokhtar N', 'Norton A', 'Rohatiner A', 'Sagar TG', 'Taciyliz N', 'Temmim L', 'Venkatesh C', 'Yan Tang J', 'Magrath I']","['INCTR at Institut Pasteur, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', '*Congresses as Topic', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Humans', '*International Cooperation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', '*Program Development']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/04/07 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(04)00157-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2004 Nov-Dec;33(3):330-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chance of finding a suitable donor in the international voluntary donor registries is limited by frequency of the HLA phenotype and the time required to identify the right donor from a potential panel, to establish eligibility and to harvest the cells. In adult MUD recipients, event-free survival ranges up to 50% and refers only to patients who undergo transplant, without taking into account those who do not find a donor. Umbilical cord blood offers the advantages of easy procurement, the absence of risks to donors, the reduced risk of transmitting infections, immediate availability of cryopreserved samples and acceptance of mismatches at two of the six antigens. Although UD-UCB transplantation is a viable option for children, it is seldom considered for adults. The great divergency between body weight and the number of hematopoietic cells in a standard cord blood unit, particularly if associated with a two-antigen mismatch, increases the risk of graft failure and delays hematopoietic reconstitution. Work on full-haplotype mismatched transplants has been proceeding for over 20 years. Originally, outcome in leukemia patients was disappointing because of high incidence of severe graft-vs.-host disease in T-replete transplants and high rejection rates in T-cell-depleted transplants. The breakthrough came with the use of a megadose of T-cell-depleted progenitor cells after a high-intensity conditioning regimen. Treating end-stage patients inevitably confounded clinical outcome in the early pilot studies. Today, high-risk acute leukemia patients are treated at less advanced stages of disease, receive a reasonably well tolerated conditioning regimen, and benefit from advances in post-transplant immunological reconstitution. All these factors contribute to markedly reduce transplant-related mortality. Overall, event-free survival and transplant-related mortality compare favorably with reports from unrelated matched transplants. T-cell-depleted megadose stem cell transplant from a mismatched family member, who is immediately available, can be offered as a viable option to candidates with high-risk acute leukemias.","['Aversa, Franco', 'Reisner, Yair', 'Martelli, Massimo F']","['Aversa F', 'Reisner Y', 'Martelli MF']","['Department of Hematology, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. aversa@unipg.it']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/04/07 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(04)00178-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2004 Nov-Dec;33(3):294-302. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For examples, WT1 is expressed at elevated levels in most leukaemias, but it is also expressed at reduced levels in normal CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells and in progenitor cells of other tissues. Antigen expression in normal tissues is likely to trigger immunological tolerance and thus blunt T cell responses. This could explain the observation that WT1 vaccination in mice frequently fails to stimulate high avidity cytotoxic T cell responses. In order to circumvent tolerance, we have isolated from HLA-A2-negative donors high avidity CTL specific for HLA-A2-presented peptide epitopes of WT1. These allorestricted CTL efficiently kill HLA-A2-positive leukaemia cells but not normal CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells. However, adoptive cellular therapy with allorestricted CTL could only be performed in leukaemia patients rendered tolerant to the infused CTL by prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In order to circumvent this limitation, we propose to exploit the TCR of allorestricted CTL as therapeutic tool. TCR gene transfer can be used to take advantage of the specificity of allorestricted CTL and transfer it to patient CTL, while avoiding the transfer of immunogenic alloantigens from the donor CTL to the patient.","['Xue, S', 'Gao, L', 'Gillmore, R', 'Bendle, G', 'Holler, A', 'Downs, A M', 'Tsallios, A', 'Ramirez, F', 'Ghani, Y', 'Hart, D', 'Alcock, S', 'Tranter, A', 'Stauss, H J', 'Morris, E']","['Xue S', 'Gao L', 'Gillmore R', 'Bendle G', 'Holler A', 'Downs AM', 'Tsallios A', 'Ramirez F', 'Ghani Y', 'Hart D', 'Alcock S', 'Tranter A', 'Stauss HJ', 'Morris E']","['Tumour Immunology Section, Department of Immunology, Imperial College London, London W12-0NN, UK.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Peptides/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*transplantation', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/04/07 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(04)00177-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2004 Nov-Dec;33(3):288-90. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-three pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemias (n = 32), acute myeloid, chronic myeloid and myelomonocytic leukemias (n = 13), myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 4), lymphomas (n = 4), and various nonmalignant diseases (n = 10) underwent transplantation. Mobilized peripheral-blood stem cells were selected with either anti-CD34- or anti-CD133-coated microbeads. Patients received a median of 19.5 x 10(6) purified cells and <25,000 CD3+ T lymphocytes per kilogram, with no regular posttransplant pharmacological immunosuppression. Engraftment occurred in 98% of patients (primary sustained engraftment, 83%; engraftment after reconditioning/stem cell boosts, 15%). Moreover, all survivors but one had a stable three-lineage engraftment with a median follow up of 4.1 years (range 0.6-8 years). Primary acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) grade II was seen in only 7% of patients. No severe primary acute GvHD grades III-IV occurred. Thirteen percent of the patients developed transient chronic GvHD. Probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years was 60% for patients with nonmalignant diseases and 48% for patients with acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL)/non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in complete remission (CR)1-3. None of the ALL/NHL patients with active disease survived. Children with acute and chronic myeloid leukemias had a poorer outcome (3-year DFS = 18%), whereas two of four patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are alive. Relapse probability of the whole group was not significantly increased when compared to a historical control group. The incidence of lethal viral infections was 18% between 1995 and 2002 and has since been reduced to 8% by the introduction of new therapeutic strategies. In summary, the use of stem cells from haploidentical parental donors should be strongly considered in all children who need transplantation but lack an identical donor.","['Lang, Peter', 'Greil, Johann', 'Bader, Peter', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Schumm, Michael', 'Schlegel, Paul-Gerhard', 'Feuchtinger, Tobias', 'Pfeiffer, Matthias', 'Scheel-Walter, Hans', 'Fuhrer, Monika', 'Martin, David', 'Niethammer, Dietrich']","['Lang P', 'Greil J', 'Bader P', 'Handgretinger R', 'Klingebiel T', 'Schumm M', 'Schlegel PG', 'Feuchtinger T', 'Pfeiffer M', 'Scheel-Walter H', 'Fuhrer M', 'Martin D', 'Niethammer D']","[""Children's University Hospital, University of Tuebingen, Germany. prlang@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/therapy', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/04/07 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(04)00175-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2004 Nov-Dec;33(3):281-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of unrelated cord blood transplants compared to unrelated bone marrow transplants in children with acute leukemia: 416 children with acute leukemia received a HLA matched unrelated bone marrow transplant and were compared to 99 children transplanted with an unrelated HLA mismatched cord blood. The long term outcome between these groups were comparable with delayed engraftment in cord blood transplant, more relapse in T cell depleted bone marrow transplant and more GVH in the unmanipulated bone marrow transplant resulting in similar 5 years leukemia free survival.

However, they are still referred too late, heavily pretreated, at very advanced stages. We initiated a three-step phase I study trying improve transplant-related mortality, relapse rate, and immunity: G-CSF + DLI, GM-CSF + DLI, patient- and disease-adapted strategy. Thirty-three consecutive leukemia patients, aged 18-55, were investigated (20 very poor risk, 11 poor risk, and 2 better risk). GvH type NK alloreactivity was chosen when possible (18/33) and balanced across the three groups. In the first nine patients, G-CSF was used and escalated prophylactic DLI started at month 1. Thus, G-CSF and 1-3 DLI (10(4) CD3/kg) is safe. It results in faster CD4 recovery and a low rate of infections. However, it was insufficient to induce a GVL effect. In the next 12 patients, GM-CSF was used plus 1 DLI (10(4) CD3/kg) at day 30 unless aGVHD (3 patients). The comparison between the two first groups can be summarized as follows: G-CSF + DLI: TRM at day 100: 0, RR: 6/9, severe aGVHD: 0. GM-CSF + 1 DLI group: RR: 1/12, TRM at day 100: 3, aGVHD > 1: 9/12, price to pay: GVHD resulting in five deaths in total. Step 3 (13 patients) consists of a patient-adapted strategy: no more aspecific DLI (selected anti-CMV and aspergillus DLI planned in all patients); in myeloid disorders with NK alloreactivity: no GF. In the other cases, GM-CSF (at a reduced total dose of 500 mug) is given the follow-up of these 13 patients, although promising is currently short (median 5 months). Overall, TRM at day 100 is 3/29, reflecting the good tolerance of the conditioning in a heavily pretreated population (median age: 43). NRR mortality (8/26) at 1 year is greater in the GM-CSF + DLI group, reflecting the impact of severe aGVHD.

Recently, we proposed to facilitate engraftment of mismatched BM by conditioning for alloantigen-primed lymphocyte depletion (APLD) with cyclophosphamide (CY). Here we summarize the experimental results obtained by this approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Naive or mildly irradiated BALB/c mice were primed with C57BL/6 BM cells (day 0), treated with CY (day 1) to deplete alloantigen-primed lymphocytes, and given a second C57BL/6 BM transplant (day 2) for engraftment. Recipients were repeatedly tested for chimerism in the blood and followed for GVHD and survival. The protocol was also tested for inducing tolerance to donor tissue and organ allografts, and for treatment of leukemia, breast cancer, and autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. RESULTS: APLD by 200 mg/kg CY provided engraftment of allogeneic BM from the same donor in 100% mildly irradiated recipients. Eighty percent chimeras remained GVHD-free more 200 days. All chimeras accepted permanently donor skin grafts and donor hematopoietic stromal progenitors. Allogeneic BM transplantation (BMT) after APLD had a strong therapeutic potential in BALB/c mice harboring malignant cells and in autoimmune NOD recipients. Tolerance-inducing CY dose could be reduced to 100 mg/kg. Conditioning for APLD resulted in engraftment of allogeneic BM after a significantly lower radiation dose than treatment with radiation and CY alone. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that conditioning for APLD has a definite advantage over general immunosuppression with CY and radiation therapy.","['Prigozhina, Tatyana B', 'Elkin, Gregory', 'Gurevitch, Olga', 'Morecki, Shoshana', 'Yakovlev, Elena', 'Khitrin, Sofia', 'Slavin, Shimon']","['Prigozhina TB', 'Elkin G', 'Gurevitch O', 'Morecki S', 'Yakovlev E', 'Khitrin S', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft Survival/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/04/07 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(04)00168-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2004 Nov-Dec;33(3):238-47. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cell alloreactivity reduced the risk of relapse in acute myeloid leukemia patients while improving engraftment and protecting against graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). NK cells are primed to kill by several activating receptors. NK killing of autologous cells is prevented because NK cells co-express inhibitory receptors (killer cell Ig-like receptors, KIR) that recognize groups of (self) MHC class I alleles. As KIRs are clonally distributed, the NK population in any individual is constituted of a repertoire with different allospecificities. NK cells in the repertoire mediate alloreactions when the allogeneic targets do not express class I alleles that block them. High resolution molecular HLA typing of recipient and donor, positive identification of donor KIR genes, and in some cases, functional assessment of donor NK clones will identify haploidentical donors who are able to mount donor-vs.-recipient NK alloreactions.","['Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Capanni, Marusca', 'Mancusi, Antonella', 'Urbani, Elena', 'Perruccio, Katia', 'Burchielli, Emanuela', 'Tosti, Antonella', 'Topini, Fabiana', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Velardi, Andrea']","['Ruggeri L', 'Capanni M', 'Mancusi A', 'Urbani E', 'Perruccio K', 'Burchielli E', 'Tosti A', 'Topini F', 'Aversa F', 'Martelli MF', 'Velardi A']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Host vs Graft Reaction/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/04/07 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(04)00164-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2004 Nov-Dec;33(3):216-21. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.08.005.,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some collaborative groups allow new radiation therapy delivery techniques in their trials. In many instances, the option of using these techniques is not addressed. These newer techniques of radiation delivery have the potential to reduce the probability of the common late effects of radiation and at the same time, potentially improve upon control and survival. The purpose of this study is to show the feasibility of IMRT in pediatric patients. No treatment results or toxicities will be presented. Five patients with a variety of pediatric malignancies received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) at our institution as part of their disease management. A rigid immobilization device was developed for each patient and a computed tomography (CT) simulation was performed in the treatment position. In 3 of the patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were coregistered with the planning CT to facilitate target and critical structure delineation. In all but 1 patient, coplanar beam arrangements were used in the IMRT planning process. All IMRT plans exhibited a high degree of conformality. Dose homogeneity inside the tumor and rapid dose falloff outside the target volume is characteristic of IMRT plans, which allows for improved normal tissue sparing. Dose distributions were obtained for all plans, as well as dose and volume relationship histograms, to evaluate the fitness of the plans. IMRT is a viable alternative to conventional treatment techniques for pediatric cancer patients. The improved dose distributions coupled with the ease of delivery of the IMRT fields make this technique very attractive, especially in view of the potential to increase local control and possibly improve on survival.","['Penagaricano, Jose A', 'Papanikolaou, Niko', 'Yan, Yulong', 'Ratanatharathorn, Vaneerat']","['Penagaricano JA', 'Papanikolaou N', 'Yan Y', 'Ratanatharathorn V']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.

Previous studies have shown that overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 increases cellular redox capacity. Here we report that cell lines transfected with Bcl-2 paradoxically exhibit increased rates of mitochondrial H(2)O(2) generation. Using isolated mitochondria, we determined that increased H(2)O(2) release results from the oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked substrates. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 also increase mitochondrial H(2)O(2) release when overexpressed. Chronic exposure of cells to low levels of the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(triflouromethoxy)phenylhydrazone reduced the rate of H(2)O(2) production by Bcl-xL overexpressing cells, resulting in a decreased ability to remove exogenous H(2)O(2) and enhanced cell death under conditions of acute oxidative stress. Our results indicate that chronic and mild elevations in H(2)O(2) release from Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 overexpressing mitochondria lead to enhanced cellular antioxidant defense and protection against death caused by acute oxidative stress.","['Kowaltowski, Alicia J', 'Fenton, Robert G', 'Fiskum, Gary']","['Kowaltowski AJ', 'Fenton RG', 'Fiskum G']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['ES11838/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS34152/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (carbonylcyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*physiology', '*Apoptosis', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Rats', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/11/06 09:00,2005/04/19 09:00,['2004/11/06 09:00'],"['2004/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(04)00696-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2004 Dec 1;37(11):1845-53. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.09.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the cytokine network, interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in immune responses that may lead to viral clearance. To further understand woodchuck IL-6 biology, we cloned and characterized the IL-6 gene from white blood cells. The complete woodchuck IL-6 gene is about 7 kb and consists of five exons and four introns. The IL-6 gene organization of the woodchuck is similar to those of the human, rat, and mouse. Also several elements are highly conserved in the 300 bp promoter region of the IL-6 gene, including a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) binding site. The woodchuck IL-6 gene encodes a polypeptide of 207 amino acids in a precursor form and 189 amino acids in the mature form. The expressed protein was 23 kDa according to SDS-PAGE. To demonstrate biologic activity, we expressed woodchuck IL-6 and showed that the purified recombinant protein induced terminal differentiation, as reflected by upregulation of Fcgamma receptor expression, and substantially inhibited proliferation of M1 cells, a murine myeloid leukemia cell line. The inhibitory effect of woodchuck IL-6 on M1 cells was blocked by an anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that woodchuck IL-6 activity is specifically mediated by signaling through the IL-6 receptor complex. Cloning of the woodchuck IL-6 gene and demonstrating biologic activity of the gene product will facilitate studies of human hepatitis B virus using the woodchuck model.","['Li, Daniel H', 'Kumanogoh, Atsushi', 'Cao, Thai M', 'Parnes, Jane R', 'Cullen, John M']","['Li DH', 'Kumanogoh A', 'Cao TM', 'Parnes JR', 'Cullen JM']","['Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, 269 W.

Cytogenetic abnormalities were significantly more frequent in AML M0 (71%) compared to M1 (49%), M2 (53%), and the total cohort (56%; P < 0.02). While +8 was the most common numeric abnormality in all FAB subtypes, +13, +14, and +11 were associated with AML M0-M2. The only recurring balanced translocation that was associated with one of these FAB subtypes was t(8;21) in M2 (12.5%) and, rarely, M1 (1.7%) (M0, 0% and M3-7, 0.09%; P=0.001).

In two cases we identified numerical aberrations of RB only in interphases nuclei. In seven additional cases, TEL and MLL abnormalities were found.

The CAT1 protein contains two conserved N-linked glycosylation sites in the third extracellular loops of the mouse, rat, and hamster receptors (mCAT1, rCAT1, and hCAT1, respectively). Glycosylation of the rCAT1 and hCAT1 receptors inhibits ecotropic MLV infection of CAT1-expressing cells, but that of the mCAT1 does not afford the cells this protection. As compared to the mCAT1 protein, the rCAT1 and hCAT1 proteins possess three and six amino acid insertions, respectively, in the third extracellular loop. To determine whether these inserted amino acids are associated with ecotropic MLV infection inhibition by glycosylation, several mutants of mCAT1 and rCAT1 receptors were constructed. Of all the mutants generated in the present study, only rCAT1 mutant 1 exhibited detectable protein expression levels. The rCAT1 mutant 1-expressing human NP2 cells were more susceptible to transduction by ecotropic MLV vectors than the wild-type rCAT1-expressing cells. Tunicamycin, an N-glycosylation inhibitor, increased transduction titer in the wild-type rCAT1-expressing cells, but did not do so in the cells expressing either the mCAT1 or rCAT1 mutation 1. An amino acid substitution in the glycosylation site of the wild-type rCAT1 conferred higher infection susceptibility, but that of the rCAT1 mutant 1 did not. As with the wild-type mCAT1 and rCAT1 proteins, the rCAT1 mutants were detected on the cell surface by immunofluorescence microscopy. Tunicamycin treatment did not affect cellular distribution of the rCAT1 mutant 1, wild-type mCAT1 or rCAT1 proteins.

Prospectively collected, self-reported information about allergic conditions such as asthma, hay fever or eczema was obtained through questionnaires administered in 1967. The cohort was followed 1969-99 and cancer incidence was ascertained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. RESULTS: Hives and asthma tended to increase the risk of leukemia (relative risk [RR] = 2.1, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.0-4.5 and RR = 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.5, respectively). There was also an indication of an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma associated with eczema during childhood (RR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.3). CONCLUSION: In contrast to most previous studies, our results do not indicate a protective effect of allergic conditions on the risk of developing hematological malignancies. Rather, they suggest that allergic conditions might increase the risk of some hematological malignancies.","['Soderberg, Karin C', 'Hagmar, Lars', 'Schwartzbaum, Judith', 'Feychting, Maria']","['Soderberg KC', 'Hagmar L', 'Schwartzbaum J', 'Feychting M']","['The Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Box 210, S-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.

By CD spectroscopy, cytotoxins CT1 and CT2 Naja oxiana, CT3 Naja kaouthia, and CT1 and CT2 Naja haje were shown to have similar secondary structure in an aqueous environment, with dominating beta-sheet structure, and to vary in the twisting angle of the beta-sheet and the conformation of disulfide groups. Using dodecylphosphocholine micelles and liposomes, CT1 and CT2 Naja oxiana were shown to incorporate into lipid structures without changes in the secondary structure of the peptides. The binding of CT1 and CT2 Naja oxiana with liposomes was associated with an increase in the beta-sheet twisting and a sign change of the dihedral angle of one disulfide group. The cytotoxins were considerably different in cytotoxicity and cooperativity of the effect on human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL60, mouse myelomonocytic cells WEHI-3, and human erythroleukemic cells K562. The most toxic CT2 Naja oxiana and CT3 Naja kaouthia possessed low cooperativity of interaction (Hill coefficient h = 0.6-0.8), unlike 10-20-fold less toxic CT1 and CT2 Naja haje (h = 1.2-1.7). CT1 Naja oxiana has an intermediate position on the cytotoxicity scale and is characterized by h = 0.5-0.8. The cytotoxins under study induced necrosis of HL60 cells and failed to activate apoptosis. The differences in cytotoxicity are supposed to be related not with features of the secondary structure of the peptides, but with interactions of side chains of variable amino acid residues with lipids and/or membrane proteins.","['Feofanov, A V', 'Sharonov, G V', 'Dubinnyi, M A', 'Astapova, M V', 'Kudelina, I A', 'Dubovskii, P V', 'Rodionov, D I', 'Utkin, Yu N', 'Arseniev, A S']","['Feofanov AV', 'Sharonov GV', 'Dubinnyi MA', 'Astapova MV', 'Kudelina IA', 'Dubovskii PV', 'Rodionov DI', 'Utkin YN', 'Arseniev AS']","['Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, ul.

Study on 20 cases from a single center from Romania.,95-102,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) has long been recognized as a disorder with both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative characteristics, some patients showing clinical and morphological features resembling myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) especially refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) with monocytosis, and others leukocytosis with neutrophilia, monocytosis and splenomegaly resembling myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS). The intrinsec differences determined at first the separation of CMML in two forms, one named ""dysplastic"", more similar with RAEB, and the other ""proliferative"", closer to chronic myeloid leukemia and then included by the recent WHO classification into a separate new created group--myelodysplastic diseases (MDD)/chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD). The aim of this study was the analysis of some features of 20 cases of CMML, with emphasis on the differences between the two forms. The proliferative form of CMML differed from the dysplastic one by greater white blood cells and neutrophils counts (P < 0.001), a more important monocytosis in periferal blood (P = 0.07), and by the size and frequency of splenomegaly (P = 0.03). The sex and age of the patients, the frequency of the general symptoms, the frequency of the general symptoms and signs and that of infections, the hemoglobin and hematocrit values, the platelet counts, the percentage of myeloblasts and monocytes in bone marrow, the frequency of dysplastic traits, the percentage of reticulocytes and the modified Bournemouth prognostic index were not significantly different.

METHODS: The methylation specific polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with sequencing verification was used to establish the methylation patterns of the 14 genes in the liver tissues of four healthy liver donors, as well as tumor and the paired non-cancerous tissues of 30 HCC patients. RESULTS: While 11 genes (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2(ABCG2), activating transcription factor (ATF2), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), occludin (OCLN), v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (RAF1), ralA binding protein 1 (RALBP1), splicing factor (45 kD) (SPF45), S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (p45) (SKP2), tumor protein p53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) (TP53) and topoisomerase (DNA) II beta (TOP2B)) maintained the unmethylated patterns, three genes displayed to various extents the hypermethylation state in tumor tissues in comparison with the normal counterparts. The catalase (CAT) was hypermethylated in tumor and the neighboring non-cancerous tissue of one case (3.3%). Both glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi) (80%, 24/30 in tumor and 56.7%, 17/30 in the paired non-cancerous tissues) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, ATP-binding cassette (sub-family C, member 7) (CFTR) (77%, 23/30 in tumor and 50%, 15/30 in the paired non-cancerous tissues) genes were prevalently hypermethylated in HCC as well as their neighboring non-cancerous tissues. No significant difference in the hypermethylation occurrence was observed between the HCC and its neighboring non-cancerous tissues. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands of both CFTR and GSTpi genes occurs prevalently in HCC, which may correlate with the low expression of these two genes at the mRNA level and has the profound etiological and clinical implications.

EP shows better chemical and physical properties, is said to be less toxic but is five times more expensive than VP16. Some criteria were defined for the use of each form in the Paediatric Oncohaematology Department in Hopital Sud in Rennes. As some particular cutaneous side effects were observed during treatment with etoposide-based course in this department, a retrospective study was initiated. The aims of this work were to determine the side effects (especially cutaneous toxicity), whether the pharmaceutical formulation of etoposide had any influence on the toxicity of the drug, and whether the observed side effects resulted from etoposide alone or from particular antineoplastic drug associations. METHODS: Five types of etoposide-containing protocols were chosen: NB 97 and NB 99 (neuroblastoma), FRALLE 93 (acute lymphoid leukaemia), LAME 91 (acute myeloid leukaemia), OS 94 (osteosarcoma), Ewing 97 and Euro-Ewing 99 (Ewing sarcoma). The medical files of 36 children (88 EP courses, 25 VP16 courses) included in these protocols were analysed on the basis that if a child showed a side effect during a course, the child had to have recovered from that side effect before the beginning of the next course. RESULTS: Apart from classical side effects (haematological and digestive toxicities etc.), two particular cutaneous side effects were observed: (1) palmar-plantar eruptions and nail inflammations, and (2) irritation of the anal area and anal fissures. Those side effects were observed with three of the studied protocols: NB 97, OS 94 and Ewing sarcoma treatments. CONCLUSIONS: No striking differences in toxicity appeared between the two etoposide formulations, but this retrospective study seemed to confirm the appearance of particular cutaneous and anal side effects especially with two associations: (1) etoposide-ifosfamide (OS 94 and Ewing 97), and (2) etoposide-ifosfamide-Adriamycin-vincristine (VIDE course of the Euro-Ewing 99 protocol).","['Marigny, Katel', 'Aubin, Fabienne', 'Burgot, Gwenola', 'Le Gall, Edouard', 'Gandemer, Virginie']","['Marigny K', 'Aubin F', 'Burgot G', 'Le Gall E', 'Gandemer V']","['Department of Pharmacy, CHU Hopital Sud, Bd de Bulgarie, 35000, Rennes, France. katel.MARIGNY@chu-rennes.fr']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20041104,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '528XYJ8L1N (etoposide phosphate)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anal Canal/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Fingers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Toes']",2004/11/05 09:00,2005/02/17 09:00,['2004/11/05 09:00'],"['2003/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0858-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2005 Mar;55(3):244-50. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0858-2.

Integration is one of the essential steps in the retroviral life cycle. Many transposable elements also move around and integrate into the host genome as part of their life cycle, some through RNA intermediates and some through 'cut and paste' mechanisms. Integration of retroviruses and transposable elements into 'sensitive areas' of the genome can cause irreparable damage. On the other hand, because of their ability to integrate permanently, and the relatively efficient rates of transgenesis, retroviruses and transposable elements are widely used as gene delivery tools in basic research and gene therapy trials. Recent events in gene therapy treatments for X-linked severe combined immunity deficiencies (X-SCID) have highlighted both the promise and some of the risks involved with utilizing retroviruses. Nine of 11 children were successfully treated for X-SCID using a retrovirus carrying the gene mutated in this disease. However, later two of these children developed leukemias because of retroviral integrations in the putative oncogene LMO2 [1]. A third child has also been demonstrated to have an integration in LMO2, but is as of yet nonsymptomatic [2]. It is a bit difficult to explain the high frequency of integrations into the same gene using a random model of retroviral integration, and there has been evidence for decades that retroviral integrations may not be random. But the data were somewhat limited in their power to determine the precise nature of the integration biases. The completion of the human genome sequence coupled with sensitive polymerase chain reaction techniques and an ever-decreasing cost of sequencing has given a powerful new tool to the study of integration site selection. In this review, we describe the findings from several recent global surveys of target site selection by retroviruses and transposable elements, and discuss the possible ramifications of these findings to both mechanisms of action and to the use of these elements as gene therapy vectors.","['Wu, X', 'Burgess, S M']","['Wu X', 'Burgess SM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Technology, Scientific Application International Inc., National Cancer Institute at Frederick, 915 Tollhouse Ave., Frederick, Maryland 21701, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)'],IM,"['Animals', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Dependovirus/genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Genome, Viral', 'HIV-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics', 'Virus Integration']",2004/11/05 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/05 09:00'],"['2004/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00018-004-4206-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2004 Oct;61(19-20):2588-96. doi: 10.1007/s00018-004-4206-9.,,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gain-of-function mutations in c-Kit have been described in a number of human cancers, including testicular germinomas, acute myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Stimulation of c-Kit by its ligand leads to dimerization of receptors, activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues within the receptor. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for a number of signal transduction molecules containing Src homology 2 domains, which will thereby be recruited to the receptor and activated many times through phosphorylation by the receptor. This review discusses our current knowledge of signal transduction molecules and signal transduction pathways activated by c-Kit and how their activation can be connected to the physiological outcome of c-Kit signaling.","['Ronnstrand, L']",['Ronnstrand L'],"['Experimental Clinical Chemistry,Wallenberg Laboratory, Lund University,Malmo University Hospital, 205 02, Malmo, Sweden.

A systematic review.,13-7,"The aim of this review is to determine whether physical fitness, assessed by peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak)) measurement, is reduced in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to healthy children. A systematic literature search (up to June 2004) was performed using Medline, Sportdiscus, Cinahl, Embase, Cochrane and PEDro database and reference tracking. The VO(2peak) (ml kg(-1) min(-1)) reached during a maximal exercise test until volitional exhaustion was used as the main outcome for this review. In all, 17 studies were identified in the literature. Data from three studies (102 ALL survivors, age ranging from 7 to 19 years) were pooled in a meta-analysis. Although there was a significant heterogeneity between the included studies (P=0.0006), the standardized mean difference (SMD) value of -0.61 (P=0.07) indicated that VO(2peak) tended to be reduced in survivors of childhood ALL compared to healthy control subjects, that is, decrease of -5.97 ml kg(-1) min(-1) (95% confidence interval (CI): (-12.35, 0.41); P=0.07) or -13% (95 % CI: (-27, 0.004)). Physical fitness tends to be reduced in survivors of ALL during childhood, which suggests the need for this population group to engage in regular physical activities with the purpose of increasing their functional capacity. Although more research is needed, this functional improvement might ameliorate the quality of life of ALL survivors as physical and outdoors activities are an essential part of daily routine during childhood.","['van Brussel, M', 'Takken, T', 'Lucia, A', 'van der Net, J', 'Helders, P J M']","['van Brussel M', 'Takken T', 'Lucia A', 'van der Net J', 'Helders PJ']","['Departments of Pediatric Physical Therapy & Exercise Physiology, University Hospital for Children and Youth Het Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3508 AB Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Oxygen Consumption', '*Physical Fitness', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', '*Survivors']",2004/11/05 09:00,2005/04/02 09:00,['2004/11/05 09:00'],"['2004/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403547 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403547 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jan;19(1):13-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403547.,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unstimulated CD56(low)CD33+ cells showed a low antiproliferative effect on K562, which was increased upon LPS stimulation.

To determine the role of CHK1 in the pathogenesis of lymphoid neoplasms and its relationship to other DNA damage response genes, we have analyzed the gene status, protein, and mRNA expression in a series of tumors and nonneoplastic lymphoid tissues. CHK1 protein and mRNA expression levels were very low in both reactive tissues and resting lymphoid cells, whereas tumor samples showed a variable pattern of expression related to their proliferative activity. However, seven aggressive tumors showed a dissociate pattern of extremely low or negative protein expression in spite of a high proliferative activity. Four of these tumors were diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLCLs) with concordant reduced levels of mRNA, whereas one blastoid mantle cell lymphoma (B-MCL) and two DLCLs had relatively normal levels of mRNA. No gene mutations, deletions, or hypermethylation of the promoter region were detected in any of these cases. In all these tumors ATM, CHK2, and p53 genes were wild type.

To study the diversity of cells involved in this immune response, hematopoietic cell reactive T cells were directly clonally isolated from peripheral blood of patients entering complete remission after DLI. T cells were briefly stimulated with bone marrow cells from patients pretransplant, and IFNgamma-secreting T cells were directly clonally isolated, and expanded. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones from individual patients used multiple distinct HLA-restricting molecules and varied in reactivity against patient-derived normal and/or malignant hematopoietic cells. For each patient, CTL clones specific for known immunodominant mHags as well as distinct unknown mHags were found. Within individual patients, CTL clones using the same HLA-restricting element could show differential recognition patterns, indicating further diversity in mHag reactivity. CTL clones from individual patients exhibiting identical specificities could show oligoclonal origin. In conclusion, the direct cloning technique shows that the response to hematopoietic cells after DLI is directed against multiple distinct mHags, including but not limited to known immunodominant mHags, implying that immunotherapy with T cells against multiple mHag specificities may be more effective in eradicating malignant cells.","['Kloosterboer, F M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A P', 'van Soest, R A', 'van Egmond, H M', 'Barbui, A M', 'Strijbosch, M P W', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H F']","['Kloosterboer FM', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'van Soest RA', 'van Egmond HM', 'Barbui AM', 'Strijbosch MP', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, C2-R, PO Box 9600, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.

Several human minor histocompatibility antigens recognized by T cells have been identified, but only two are presented by HLA class II molecules. In search of an efficient approach to identify antigenic peptides processed through the HLA class II pathway, we constructed a cDNA library in bacteria that were induced to express proteins. Bacteria were opsonized with complement to enforce receptor-mediated uptake by Epstein-Barr virus immortalized B cells that were subsequently used as antigen-presenting cells. This approach was validated with an HLA class II-restricted antigen encoded by gene DBY. We were able to identify bacteria expressing DBY diluted into a 300-fold excess of bacteria expressing a nonrelevant gene. Screening of a bacterial library using a DBY-specific CD4 T cell clone resulted in the isolation of several DBY cDNAs. We propose this strategy for a rapid identification of HLA class II-restricted antigenic peptides recognized by CD4 T cells.","['van de Corput, L', 'Chaux, P', 'van der Meijden, E D', 'De Plaen, E', 'Frederik Falkenburg, J H', 'van der Bruggen, P']","['van de Corput L', 'Chaux P', 'van der Meijden ED', 'De Plaen E', 'Frederik Falkenburg JH', 'van der Bruggen P']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Proteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX3Y protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Bacteria/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'Complement System Proteins', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/blood', 'Proteins/genetics']",2004/11/05 09:00,2005/02/23 09:00,['2004/11/05 09:00'],"['2004/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403583 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403583 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Feb;19(2):279-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403583.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens allow SCT in elderly patients; however, there are only limited data on the feasibility and outcomes of unrelated donor SCT in these patients. In this study, we analyzed, retrospectively, data of 36 patients with various hematological malignancies and median age 58 years (range, 55-66), who were given unrelated donor SCT after reduced-intensity conditioning. The preparative regimen consisted of fludarabine combined with oral busulfan (8 mg/kg, n=8), intravenous busulfan (6.4 mg/kg, n=11), treosulfan (30 g/m(2), n=5) or melphalan (100-150 mg/m(2), n=12). Patients were also given serotherapy, ATG (n=32), or alemtuzumab (n=4). The probabilities of overall survival, disease-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality at 1 year after SCT were 52, 43, and 39%, respectively. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and chronic GVHD occurred in 31 and 45%, respectively. Multivariable analysis determined that survival rates were higher in patients with chemosensitive disease (HR 4.5), and patients conditioned with intravenous busulfan or treosulfan (HR 3.9). Unrelated donor SCT is feasible in elderly patients, with outcomes that are similar to younger patients. Favorable outcome was observed in patients with myeloid malignancies, and those transplanted in remission and early in the course of disease.

The activity was the same in both ester- and ether-linked lysolipids, and introduction of a double bond or methoxy group on the alkyl chain did not significantly modulate the activity. However, replacement of trimethylammonium moiety in the choline structure with ammonium moiety reduced the activity. Furthermore, change of the alkyl chain length influenced the Ca2+ response.

A 28-year-old man with chronic myeloid leukaemia that resulted in azoospermia, later fathered a child with his semen that had been stored prior to chemotherapy. In an 18-year-old adolescent with non-Hodgkin lymphoma the possibility to store cryopreserved semen was only raised after chemotherapy had been started and had caused azoospermia. This caused the patient serious regret. A 14-year-old boy with acute lymphatic leukaemia had his semen stored despite initial hesitations due to his young age. The cancer hardly ever affects the semen quality to the extent that cryopreservation of the semen becomes impossible. The aim should be to obtain several ejaculates prior to the cancer therapy and to store multiple portions, so that later a number of fertilisation attempts are possible. The primary attending physician is initially responsible for raising the possibility of semen cryopreservation. Ideally, however, all health professionals involved should be aware of this aspect. There is a need for multidisciplinary protocols for oncology centres and sperm banks, so that the timely informing of patients is guaranteed, responsibilities are recorded--with appropriate procedures to prevent unnecessary delay--and procedures that concur with legal requirements and financial constraints are established.","['Janssens, P M W', 'Beerendonk, C C M', 'Blokzijl, E', 'Braat, D D M', 'Westphal, J R', 'Kremer, J A M']","['Janssens PM', 'Beerendonk CC', 'Blokzijl E', 'Braat DD', 'Westphal JR', 'Kremer JA']","['Afd.

We have attempted to describe a fundamental role of the Polycomb group (Pc-G) in VPA-induced transformations of the axial skeleton. METHODS: Pregnant NMRI mice were given a single subcutaneous injection of vehicle or VPA (800 mg/kg) on gestation day (GD) 8. The expression of genes encoding Polycomb and trithorax groups was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using total RNA isolated from the embryos exposed to vehicle or VPA for 1, 3, and 6 hr. In addition, the use of two less teratogenic antiepileptic chemicals valpromide (VPD) and valnoctamide (VCD) provide reliable evidence to support the relationship between VPA teratogenicity and the Polycomb group. RESULTS: At a teratogenic level, VPA inhibits the expression of the Polycomb group genes, including Eed, Ezh2, Zfp144, Bmi1, Cbx2, Rnf2, and YY1 in the mouse embryos. In contrast, neither VPD nor VCD have significant effects on the expression of those genes affected by VPA. The trithorax group (trx-G) gene MLL, which is known to be required to maintain homeobox gene expression such as the Polycomb gene, is not affected by a teratogenic dose of VPA. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that, during embryonic development, VPA may affect the gene silencing pathway mediated by the Polycomb group complex. The epigenetic mechanism of VPA teratogenicity on anteroposterior patterning is suspected.","['Okada, Akinobu', 'Aoki, Yoshinobu', 'Kushima, Kiyoshi', 'Kurihara, Hiroshi', 'Bialer, Meir', 'Fujiwara, Michio']","['Okada A', 'Aoki Y', 'Kushima K', 'Kurihara H', 'Bialer M', 'Fujiwara M']","['Safety Research Laboratories, Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol,"Birth defects research.

To determine whether the measurement of the DNA oxidized base 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) may be a useful biomarker in this population, the authors conducted an observational study on 103 children with ALL. Blood samples were collected at diagnosis, during interim maintenance (IM), and during delayed intensification (DI). Blood mononuclear cell 8-oxo-dG, measured with an immunohistochemical method, decreased from diagnosis to IM (P = .01) and increased between IM and DI (P < .01). In a pilot study, bone marrow was also collected from 16 patients at diagnosis and after 28 days of treatment, but 8-oxo-dG remained the same. The relationship between plasma and dietary intake of antioxidants and the level of 8-oxo-dG was also explored. There was a direct relationship between the intake of vitamin E at diagnosis and bone marrow 8-oxo-dG (P = .03) and an inverse relationship between beta-carotene intake and blood 8-oxo-dG at IM (P = .03) and vitamin A in-take and blood 8-oxo-dG at DI (P = .003). Plasma vitamin C (P = .02) and total carotenoids (P = .01) were inversely related to blood 8-oxo-dG at IM. In contrast, higher plasma E/total lipid levels were associated with higher 8-oxo-dG at IM and DI (P < .01). At IM, patients with higher 8-oxo-dG had an increased risk of chemotherapy dose reduction (P = .04). In conclusion, the level of 8-oxo-dG in blood mononuclear cells decreases after the start of chemotherapy and increases during aggressive chemotherapy in children with ALL.","['Kennedy, Deborah D', 'Santella, Regina M', 'Wang, Qiao', 'Ladas, Elena J', 'Kelly, Kara M']","['Kennedy DD', 'Santella RM', 'Wang Q', 'Ladas EJ', 'Kelly KM']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],,['ES09089/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Ascorbic Acid/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Carotenoids/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Deoxyguanosine/blood/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology/mortality', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamin E/blood']",2004/11/04 09:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/11/04 09:00'],"['2004/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['3/4/301 [pii]', '10.1177/1534735404270285 [doi]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2004 Dec;3(4):301-9. doi: 10.1177/1534735404270285.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulated HOX gene expression profoundly effects the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and committed progenitors, and aberrant activation of HOX genes is a common event in human myeloid leukemia. HOXB6 is frequently overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To gain further insight into the role of HOXB6 in hematopoiesis, we overexpressed HOXB6 in murine bone marrow using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. We also explored structure-function relationships using mutant HOXB6 proteins unable to bind to DNA or a key HOX-binding partner, pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor-1 (PBX1). Additionally, we investigated the potential cooperative interaction with myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 homolog (MEIS1). In vivo, HOXB6 expanded HSCs and myeloid precursors while inhibiting erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Overexpression of HOXB6 resulted in AML with a median latency of 223 days. Coexpression of MEIS1 dramatically shortened the onset of AML. Cytogenetic analysis of a subset of HOXB6-induced AMLs revealed recurrent deletions of chromosome bands 2D-E4, a region frequently deleted in HOXA9-induced AMLs. In vitro, HOXB6 immortalized a factor-dependent myelomonocytic precursor capable of granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. These biologic effects of HOXB6 were largely dependent on DNA binding but independent of direct interaction with PBX1.","['Fischbach, Neal A', 'Rozenfeld, Sofia', 'Shen, Weifang', 'Fong, Stephen', 'Chrobak, Daniel', 'Ginzinger, David', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Radhakrishnan, Archana', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Largman, Corey', 'Lawrence, H Jeffrey']","['Fischbach NA', 'Rozenfeld S', 'Shen W', 'Fong S', 'Chrobak D', 'Ginzinger D', 'Kogan SC', 'Radhakrishnan A', 'Le Beau MM', 'Largman C', 'Lawrence HJ']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA. fischba@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],,['DK48642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041102,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb6 protein, mouse)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Time Factors']",2004/11/04 09:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/11/04 09:00'],"['2004/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45866-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-04-1583 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 15;105(4):1456-66. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1583.

Antiretroviral therapy with combination zidovudine and interferon alfa, which induces a high rate of complete remission and lengthens survival, should be the first treatment option in acute adult T-cell leukaemia. Patients with adult T-cell lymphoma might benefit from initial aggressive chemotherapy followed by antiretroviral therapy.

This study was to inhibit activity of SDF-1 by anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5, observe changes of adhesion and proliferation of acute myelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 co-cultivated with leukemic marrow stromal cells, and to assay potential of inhibiting SDF-1-driven processes on treating marrow residual disease. METHODS: HL-60 cells were co-cultured with leukemic marrow stromal cells, and 10 mug/ml 12G5 was added to block SDF-1 activity. Adhesive state, adhesion rate, apoptosis rate, and cell cycle of HL-60 cells were observed after incubation. Living conditions of HL-60 cells were detected by trypan blue exclusion, cell growth curve was protracted. RESULTS: Adhesion rate of 24-h 12G5-incubated HL-60 cells was (39.4+/-7.9)%, while that of control HL-60 cells was (51.4+/-5.9)% (P< 0.05).

This study was designed to explore relationship between pathogenesis of leukemia, lymphoma and EDAG-1 through analyzing the structure of EDAG-1 coding region, and its expression in these cell lines. METHODS: Fifteen leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, HEL, K562, HL-60, Namalwa, Raji, J111, Jurkat, HuT 78, MEG-01, U937, 6T-CEM, HPB-ALL, KG-1a, THP-1, and DAMI, were selected to observe the expression of EDAG-1 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), EDAG-1 cDNA coding fragments (1.5 kb) were purified to construct the corresponding recombinant plasmid. Then, the plasmid was sequenced to analyze mutation of the coding region. The expression of EDAG-1 protein, and mRNA in these cell lines were detected by Western blot, and Northern blot; the rearrangement and amplification of EDAG-1 genome in these cell lines were detected by Southern blot. RESULTS: EDAG-1 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in erythroleukemia cell lines (K-562, HEL), megakaryoblast leukemia cell lines (DAMI, MEG-01), and T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat), while no gene mutation was found in coding region, no amplification and rearrangement of genome was detected in these cell lines. EDAG-1 was absent in HL-60 cell line, and rearranged in HuT 78 cells. CONCLUSION: EDAG-1 may relate with pathogenesis of erythroleukemia and megakaryoblast leukemia; its coding region may have no relation with the mechanism of its activation.","['Zhou, Ying', 'Xu, Wang-Xiang', 'Zhan, Yi-Qun', 'Li, Chang-Yan', 'Xu, Cheng-Wang', 'Zheng, Hong', 'Li, Fei-Fei', 'Yang, Xiao-Ming', 'Wang, Si-Ying']","['Zhou Y', 'Xu WX', 'Zhan YQ', 'Li CY', 'Xu CW', 'Zheng H', 'Li FF', 'Yang XM', 'Wang SY']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Basic Medical College, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230 032, P.R.

Recently it has also been considered as a drug of promise in hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially in older patients, in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) as well as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of R115777 used alone or with purine nucleoside analogs (PNA): cladribine (2-CdA) and fludarabine (F-ara-A) on leukemic progenitors [colony-forming unit-leukemia (CFU)-L] from AML patients. Our studies were based on the methods of semisolid leukemic CFU-L and normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (CFU-GM) cultures in vitro. R115777 was added to the culture alone or in combinations with PNA. We showed that R115777 used alone or together with PNA at all combinations significantly inhibited the colony growth of AML CFU-L, when compared with normal CFU-GM (P < 0.01). In addition, the drugs used in combinations of two higher concentrations in significantly higher degree inhibited CFU-L colony growth, when compared either with R115777 or with any of PNA used alone (P < 0.04). IC(50) for R115777 were 67.1 and 121.9 nm for AML CFU-L and normal CFU-GM, respectively. Furthermore, in the case of AML the combination index was 0.89 and 1.16, respectively, for the combination of R115777 with 2-CdA and R115777 with F-ara-A. An additive effect on AML CFU-L cells and subadditive effect on normal CFU-GM were seen. To assess a proapoptotic effect, the drugs were added to the liquid cultures at the same concentrations as for clonogenic assays. A significant increase in the rate of apoptosis induced by combinations of drugs in comparison with single agents was observed. In conclusion, the combination of R115777 with both PNA could be more effective than the drugs used alone. However, further experimental studies on the usefulness of these combinations in the treatment of myeloid leukemia patients are warranted.","['Korycka, Anna', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Korycka A', 'Smolewski P', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolones)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quinolones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2004/11/04 09:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/11/04 09:00'],"['2004/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH336 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00336.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Dec;73(6):418-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00336.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two months after the end of anti-CD20 therapy, all evaluated patients presented a complete haematological remission. Moreover, Rituximab increased percentage of molecular remission up to 100% 1 yr after the end of treatment. Interestingly, in all cases but one, including those persistently polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive, semi-quantitative molecular analyses showed MRD levels lower than those found before Rituximab administration.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether differences in cellular drug resistance could give an explanation for these divergent clinical courses. METHODS: The VH gene mutation status was analysed in patients with previously untreated B-CLL using VH gene family-specific PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing. In vitro sensitivity to cytarabine, fludarabine, cladribine, doxorubicin, idarubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan and prednisolone was assessed using the non-clonogenic in vitro assay, fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: The VH genes and in vitro drug resistance were successfully analysed in 46 cases, revealing that 25 (54%) cases showed unmutated and 21 (46%) cases mutated VH genes. Interestingly, the unmutated group generally tended to be more chemosensitive than the mutated group with significant differences for cytarabine and prednisolone (P < or = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The propensity of inferior drug response in mutated B-CLL may reflect a more differentiated disease than in unmutated B-CLL. We conclude that the difference in prognosis between B-CLL cases with unmutated and mutated VH genes could not be explained by difference in cellular drug resistance.","['Aleskog, Anna', 'Tobin, Gerard', 'Laurell, Anna', 'Thunberg, Ulf', 'Lindhagen, Elin', 'Roos, Goran', 'Nilsson, Kenneth', 'Nygren, Peter', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Aleskog A', 'Tobin G', 'Laurell A', 'Thunberg U', 'Lindhagen E', 'Roos G', 'Nilsson K', 'Nygren P', 'Sundstrom C', 'Hoglund M', 'Larsson R', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. anna.aleskog@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2004/11/04 09:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/11/04 09:00'],"['2004/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH334 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00334.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Dec;73(6):407-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00334.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CD40 stimulation also has an anti-apoptotic effect and may further impair the dysregulated response of B-CLL to apoptotic stimuli. Therefore, we measured the expression of virtually all regulators of apoptosis before and after CD40 stimulation. These findings were correlated with sensitivity for chemotherapy- and death-receptor-induced apoptosis and T-cell-mediated killing. CD40 stimulation enhanced the constitutive anti-apoptotic profile of B-CLL cells by upregulation of Bcl-xL and Bfl-1 and downregulation of the BH3-only protein Harakiri. Unexpectedly, the BH3-only protein Bid was strongly induced. Functionally, CD40-stimulated B-CLL cells became resistant to drug-induced apoptosis and, despite upregulation of CD95 and Bid, were not sensitive to CD95L. In contrast, autologous T cell killing, triggered by loading CLL cells with viral (CMV) peptides, was very efficient both before and after CD40 stimulation. Upon CTL interaction, CLL targets underwent mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 activation. Thus, despite an increased anti-apoptotic profile, CD40 triggered B-CLL cells remain excellent targets for resident cytotoxic T cells. These data support therapeutic exploitation of CD40 stimulation in B-CLL, provided that a strong CTL component is induced.","['Kater, Arnon P', 'Evers, Ludo M', 'Remmerswaal, Ester B M', 'Jaspers, Annelieke', 'Oosterwijk, Michiel F', 'van Lier, Rene A W', 'van Oers, Marinus H J', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Kater AP', 'Evers LM', 'Remmerswaal EB', 'Jaspers A', 'Oosterwijk MF', 'van Lier RA', 'van Oers MH', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Haematology, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",2004/11/04 09:00,2004/12/18 09:00,['2004/11/04 09:00'],"['2004/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5225 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05225.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Nov;127(4):404-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05225.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of studies performed in the last years showed that this suggestion is correct only in certain types of tumors. Data have been revealed on higher apoptotic activity in poorly differentiated tumors, whereas in well-differentiated neoplasms this activity is relatively low. At the same time, cytostatic or hormonal treatment of well-differentiated tumors result in a considerable elevation of the apoptotic index. The author considers the inducibility of apoptosis as a predictive factor regarding the efficacy of therapy in case of prostate carcinoma, colon carcinoma and acute lymphoid leukemia. This statement is less applicable to breast cancer or mesopharyngeal carcinoma. Very low apoptotic activity was observed in neuroblastomas, follicular adenomas, as well as follicular and papillary carcinomas of the thyroid gland, and adenomas of the parathyroid gland.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the disability profile of a group of patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) to identify the most affected functional areas. SETTING: Reference center for HTLV Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: A total of 72 patients (49 female and 23 male), consecutively referred by tertiary care centers, were assessed using the FIM. RESULTS: The average FIM score was 108 (+/-12 SD) ranging from 58 to 122. The lowest items scores were obtained in locomotion and bladder management. When divided into two groups (above, and below or equal to the average score), there were significant differences (P<0.05) in age at time of assessment, in the degree of muscular power and in low back pain. There were no significant differences in terms of age of onset and duration of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The most affected areas in FIM motor items were locomotion (walk and stairs) and bladder management. Age, strength in lower limbs and low back pain interfere with functional activities in patients with HAM/TSP. The duration of the disease is not a significant factor for patient disabilities. The goals of rehabilitation in HAM/TSP patients should target the modifiable factors, such as pain, strength and the neurogenic bladder.","['Franzoi, A C', 'Araujo, A Q C']","['Franzoi AC', 'Araujo AQ']","['The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital (HUCFF), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Spinal Cord,Spinal cord,9609749,,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Back Pain/etiology', '*Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motor Activity/physiology', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Urinary Bladder/physiopathology']",2004/11/03 09:00,2005/06/07 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['3101677 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.sc.3101677 [doi]']",ppublish,Spinal Cord. 2005 Apr;43(4):236-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.sc.3101677.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel agents that activate endogenous apoptosis-inducing mechanisms directly may be potentially useful to overcome chemoresistance in AML. We examined the mechanisms of apoptosis induction by the novel synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) in AML cells. CDDO-induced apoptosis was associated with the loss of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, caspases activation, the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor to the nucleus, and DNA fragmentation in AML cells. Apoptosis was equally evident in cells deficient in caspase-9 or caspase-8 after exposure to CDDO, suggesting caspase-independent cell death. The use of small interfering RNA to reduce the expression of apoptosis-inducing factor partially inhibited CDDO-induced apoptosis in AML cells. Cells overexpressing Bcl-2 were markedly resistant to CDDO-induced apoptosis. Moreover, CDDO promoted the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria, suggesting that CDDO targets the mitochondria directly to trigger the intrinsic pathway of cell death in intact cells. Together, these results suggest that CDDO functions by activating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and initiates caspase-dependent and independent cell death. The direct modulation of mitochondrial-mediated, caspase-independent apoptosis by CDDO may be advantageous for overcoming chemoresistance in AML.","['Konopleva, Marina', 'Tsao, Twee', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Lee, Ruey-min', 'Wang, Rui-Yu', 'Jackson, C Ellen', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Monaco, Giuseppe', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Belmont, John', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Sporn, Michael B', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Konopleva M', 'Tsao T', 'Estrov Z', 'Lee RM', 'Wang RY', 'Jackson CE', 'McQueen T', 'Monaco G', 'Munsell M', 'Belmont J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Sporn MB', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy and the Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation at The University of Texas M.

We have shown that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-mediated cytosolic acidification is an effector mechanism during drug-induced apoptosis of tumor cells.

More importantly, exposure of colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) and leukemia cells (HL60 and CEM) to H(2)O(2) or its intracellular production during drug-induced apoptosis is a signal for mitochondrial translocation of Bax. Furthermore, we provide evidence that drug-induced H(2)O(2)-mediated Bax translocation in tumor cells is caspase independent but involves cytosolic acidification. Inhibiting cytosolic acidification prevents Bax translocation, and contrarily enforced acidification of the intracellular milieu results in mitochondrial recruitment of Bax, even in the absence of a trigger. These findings provide a novel mechanism for mitochondrial translocation of Bax and directly implicate H(2)O(2)-mediated cytosolic acidification in the recruitment of the mitochondrial pathway during drug-induced apoptosis of tumor cells.","['Ahmad, Kashif A', 'Iskandar, Kartini B', 'Hirpara, Jayshree L', 'Clement, Marie-Veronique', 'Pervaiz, Shazib']","['Ahmad KA', 'Iskandar KB', 'Hirpara JL', 'Clement MV', 'Pervaiz S']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/11/03 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/21/7867 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0648 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Nov 1;64(21):7867-78. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0648.,,,,,,,,,['Cancer Res. 2016 Mar 15;76(6):1664-7.

The WT1 tumor suppressor encodes a four-zinc finger protein with distinct splicing isoforms. WT1(-KTS), encoding uninterrupted zinc fingers, functions as a transcription factor and has a diffusely nuclear distribution; WT1(+KTS), with an insertion of three amino acids (KTS) between zinc fingers three and four, localizes to discrete nuclear speckles, the function of which is unknown. Because the SUMO-1 E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, interacts with WT1, we tested whether sumoylation modulates the cellular localization of WT1. We find here that both WT1 isoforms are directly sumoylated on lysine residues 73 and 177. Although RNA interference-mediated Ubc9 depletion effectively suppresses WT1 nuclear speckles, a SUMO-1-deficient WT1(+KTS)(K73, 177R) double mutant retains localization to speckles. Thus, direct sumoylation of WT1 is not responsible for its cellular localization, and other sumoylated proteins may target WT1 to these nuclear structures. Identification of other components of WT1-associated speckles is likely to provide clues to their function.","['Smolen, Gromoslaw A', 'Vassileva, Maria T', 'Wells, Julie', 'Matunis, Michael J', 'Haber, Daniel A']","['Smolen GA', 'Vassileva MT', 'Wells J', 'Matunis MJ', 'Haber DA']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA.']",['eng'],,"['R01 GM060980/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060980-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM60980-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/physiology', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism']",2004/11/03 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/21/7846 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1502 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Nov 1;64(21):7846-51. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1502.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, much controversy exists on the utility of such models as valid equivalents to the human cancer condition. To perform an interspecies gene expression comparative study in breast cancer we used a mouse model that most closely resembles human breast carcinogenesis. This system relies on the transplant of p53 null mouse mammary epithelial cells into the cleared mammary fat pads of syngeneic hosts. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was used to obtain gene expression profiles of normal and tumor samples from this mouse mammary cancer model (>300,000 mouse mammary-specific tags). The resulting mouse data were compared with 25 of our human breast cancer SAGE libraries (>2.5 million human breast-specific tags). We observed significant similarities in the deregulation of specific genes and gene families when comparing mouse with human breast cancer SAGE data. A total of 72 transcripts were identified as commonly deregulated in both species. We observed a systematic and significant down-regulation in all of the tumors from both species of various cytokines, including CXCL1 (GRO1), LIF, interleukin 6, and CCL2. All of the mouse and most human mammary tumors also displayed decreased expression of genes known to inhibit cell proliferation, including NFKBIA (IKBalpha), GADD45B, and CDKN1A (p21); transcription-related genes such as CEBP, JUN, JUNB, and ELF1; and apoptosis-related transcripts such as IER3 and GADD34/PPP1R15A. Examples of overexpressed transcripts in tumors from both species include proliferation-related genes such as CCND1, CKS1B, and STMN1 (oncoprotein 18); and genes related to other functions such as SEPW1, SDFR1, DNCI2, and SP110. Importantly, abnormal expression of several of these genes has not been associated previously with breast cancer. The consistency of these observations was validated in independent mouse and human mammary cancer sets. This is the first interspecies comparison of mammary cancer gene expression profiles. The comparative analysis of mouse and human SAGE mammary cancer data validates this p53 null mouse tumor model as a useful system closely resembling human breast cancer development and progression. More importantly, these studies are allowing us to identify relevant biomarkers of potential use in human studies while leading to a better understanding of specific mechanisms of human breast carcinogenesis.","['Hu, Yuhui', 'Sun, Hongxia', 'Drake, Jeffrey', 'Kittrell, Frances', 'Abba, Martin C', 'Deng, Li', 'Gaddis, Sally', 'Sahin, Aysegul', 'Baggerly, Keith', 'Medina, Daniel', 'Aldaz, C Marcelo']","['Hu Y', 'Sun H', 'Drake J', 'Kittrell F', 'Abba MC', 'Deng L', 'Gaddis S', 'Sahin A', 'Baggerly K', 'Medina D', 'Aldaz CM']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville 78957, USA.']",['eng'],,"['U01 CA84243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-07784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA084978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA084978-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA084978-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA084978-030001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES007784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA84978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA084978-01A10001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA084978-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA084978-040001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA084978-020001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA084978-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL1)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics', 'Chemokine CXCL1', 'Chemokines, CXC/genetics', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Proteins/genetics']",2004/11/03 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/21/7748 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1827 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Nov 1;64(21):7748-55. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1827.,,,,PMC4170686,,,,,,['NIHMS222071'],,,,,,,,,

Despite lack of data on PBSC transplantation in children, there has been a change in clinical practice, with increasing numbers of children receiving PBSC allografts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the results of 143 PBSC and 630 BM transplants from human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling donors in children aged 8 to 20 years with acute leukemia. PBSC transplant recipients were older, and were more likely to have advanced leukemia, receive growth factors post-transplantation, and have undergone transplantation more recently. Risks of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), treatment-related mortality, relapse, treatment failure (relapse or death), and overall mortality were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for potentially confounding factors. RESULTS: Hematopoietic recovery was faster after PBSC transplantation. Risks of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD were similar, but chronic GVHD risk was higher after PBSC transplantation (relative risk [RR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.66; P = .001). In contrast to reports in adults, treatment-related mortality (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.80; P = .001), treatment failure (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.68; P = .03), and mortality (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.79; P = .01) were higher after PBSC transplantation. Risks of relapse were similar. CONCLUSION: These data suggest poorer outcomes after PBSC compared with BM transplantation in children after adjusting for relevant risk factors. Given the trend toward increased use of PBSC allografts in children, prospective clinical trials are required to determine their appropriate role in this group of patients.","['Eapen, Mary', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Klein, John P', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Loberiza, Fausto R Jr', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Wagner, John E']","['Eapen M', 'Horowitz MM', 'Klein JP', 'Champlin RE', 'Loberiza FR Jr', 'Ringden O', 'Wagner JE']","['IBMTR/ABMTR Statistical Center, International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Rd, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA. meapen@mail.mcw.edu']",['eng'],,['U24 CA 76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041101,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Growth Substances)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Child', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Growth Substances/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/11/03 09:00,2005/01/19 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2004.02.189 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2004.02.189 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Dec 15;22(24):4872-80. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.02.189.

In this study we show that unique among the known mammalian RGS proteins, RGS14 localizes in centrosomes. Its first Ras-binding domain is sufficient to target RGS14 to centrosomes. RGS14 also shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its nuclear export depends on the CRM-1 nuclear export receptor. Mutation of a nuclear export signal or treatment with leptomycin B causes nuclear accumulation of RGS14 and its association with promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies. Furthermore, a point mutant defective in nuclear export fails to target to centrosomes, suggesting that nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling is necessary for its proper localization. Mild heat stress, but not proteotoxic or transcription-linked stresses, re-localizes the RGS14 from the cytoplasm to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Expression of RGS14, but not point mutants that disrupt the functional activity of its RGS domain or GoLoco motif, enhances the reporter gene activity. The multifunctional domains and the dynamic subcellular localization of RGS14 implicate it in a diverse set of cellular processes including centrosome and nuclear functions and stress-induced signaling pathways.","['Cho, Hyeseon', 'Kim, Dong-Uk', 'Kehrl, John H']","['Cho H', 'Kim DU', 'Kehrl JH']","['B-cell Molecular Immunology Section, Laboratory of Immunoregulation, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1876, USA.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20041101,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RGS Proteins)', '0 (Rgs14 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Centrosome/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Matrix/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport', 'RGS Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/11/03 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)76649-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M408163200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Jan 7;280(1):805-14. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M408163200.

In hematopoietic cells, EVI1 impairs several pathways including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is a powerful cytokine that controls the immune response and limits the expansion of several tissues including bone marrow. These properties contribute to the effectiveness of IFN-alpha in the treatment of many neoplastic disorders especially chronic myeloid leukemia. We report here that in murine hematopoietic progenitors the expression of EVI1 completely abrogates the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of IFN-alpha. EVI1 does not repress the JAK/STAT signaling pathway or the activation of many IFN-responsive genes. On the contrary, EVI1 prolongs the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the activation of an IFN-dependent reporter gene. However, EVI1 specifically represses the IFN-dependent induction of the tumor suppressor PML and blocks the apoptotic pathways activated by PML. We show that the position of the ISRE, which is located within the first exon of PML, is critical to block PML induction by IFN-alpha. The relocation of the ISRE to a position upstream of the transcription start site is sufficient to re-establish the response to IFN in the presence of EVI1. Our data suggest that stabilized STAT1 phosphorylation and prolonged binding of the STAT1 complex to the first exon could impair PML transcription and inhibit the activation of PML-dependent apoptotic pathways resulting in loss of IFN response. These results point to a novel mechanism utilized by an oncogene to escape normal cell response to growth-controlling cytokines.","['Buonamici, Silvia', 'Li, Donglan', 'Mikhail, Fady M', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Platanias, Leonidas C', 'Colamonici, Oscar', 'Anastasi, John', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina']","['Buonamici S', 'Li D', 'Mikhail FM', 'Sassano A', 'Platanias LC', 'Colamonici O', 'Anastasi J', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Pathology and Cancer Center, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60607, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041101,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/11/03 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)76607-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M410836200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Jan 7;280(1):428-36. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M410836200.

New results are presented which suggest that macromolecular crowding forces play a crucial role in the assembly of at least two compartments, nucleoli and PML bodies, and an in vitro system in which crowding assembles macromolecular complexes into structures which resemble nuclear compartments is described. Crowding forces, which are strong in the nucleus due to the high macromolecule concentration (in the range of 100 mg/ml), vastly increase the association constants of intermolecular interactions and can segregate different macromolecules into discrete phases.

Little is known about the molecular responses to such high intensity noise exposures. In this study we used gene arrays to examine the early response to acoustic overstimulation in the rat cochlea. We compared cochlear RNA from noise-exposed rats with RNA from unexposed controls. The intense PTS noise induced several immediate early genes encoding both transcription factors (c-FOS, EGR1, NUR77/TR3) and cytokines (PC3/BTG2, LIF and IP10). In contrast, the TTS noise down-regulated the gene for growth hormone. The response of these genes to different noise intensities was examined by quantitative RT-PCR 2.5 h after the 90-min noise exposure. For most genes, the extent of induction correlates with the intensity of the noise exposure. Three proteins (EGR1, NUR77/TR3, and IP10) were detected in many regions of the unexposed cochlea. After exposure to 120 dB noise, these proteins were present at higher levels or showed extended expression in additional regions of the cochlea. LIF was undetectable in the cochlea of unexposed rats, but could be seen in the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion neurons following noise. NUR77/TR3 was a nuclear protein before noise, but following noise translocated to the cytoplasm. These studies provide new insights into the molecular response to noise overstimulation in the mammalian cochlea.","['Cho, Younsook', 'Gong, Tzy-Wen L', 'Kanicki, Ariane', 'Altschuler, Richard A', 'Lomax, Margaret I']","['Cho Y', 'Gong TW', 'Kanicki A', 'Altschuler RA', 'Lomax MI']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],,"['P30 DC005188/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DC02982/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DC05188/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Brain Res Mol Brain Res,Brain research.

This also implies that heterodimerization would be necessary for co-packaging and recombination. Moreover, co-packaging of distinct RNAs may be reduced if incapable of heterodimerizing. In this study, we have designed a novel two-vector rescue system in which co-packaging and interstrand transfer are necessary for transduction. Thus, the rescue titer is a measure of the ability of a given vector combination to co-package and subsequently generate a provirus. In the current MLV-based set-up, we explored Akv- and MLV-like-endogenous virus (MLEV)-derived vectors with modulated dimerization signals. Results show that rescue is influenced by competition at the level of RNA packaging, as well as complementarity between dimerization elements. Altogether, the results support the hypothesis that complementarity between dimerization elements may favor co-packaging of distinct retroviral RNAs.","['Rasmussen, Sorenvestergaard', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Rasmussen S', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dimerization', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', '*Virus Assembly']",2004/11/03 09:00,2005/01/28 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(04)00576-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2004.08.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Nov 24;329(2):440-53. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.08.027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously developed genetically simplified BLV structural gene vector (SGV) that replicates BLV structural and enzymatic genes independently of BLV regulatory and accessory genes. Results of a 20-month study in a rabbit model demonstrated that BLV SGV induces an antiviral immunological response and lacks pathogenicity. Here, these chronically infected-BLV SGV rabbits are assessed in a proof-of-principle study of preventative vaccination against challenge with pathogenic BLV. This study commences 24 months after BLV SGV inoculation and proceeds for an additional 20 months. The previously characterized BLV SGV rabbits and age-matched control rabbits were challenged with 1 x 10(8) fetal lamb kidney/BLV producer cells. BLV SGV rabbits seroconverted upon BLV challenge, but did not progress to BLV infection nor clinical disease. By contrast, naive rabbits became infected and succumbed to lymphotropic disease. Our findings provide proof-of-principle that chronic infection with BLV SGV induces protection against BLV infection. The data indicate that SGV based on HTLV or HIV is a promising approach against lymphotropic disease by human retroviruses.","['Altanerova, Veronika', 'Holicova, Dana', 'Kucerova, Lucia', 'Altaner, Cestmir', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Boris-Lawrie, Kathleen']","['Altanerova V', 'Holicova D', 'Kucerova L', 'Altaner C', 'Lairmore MD', 'Boris-Lawrie K']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, SK-833 91 Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],,"['P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW001217/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TW01217-01/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Enzymes)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*prevention & control', 'Enzymes/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Injections, Intradermal', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Rabbits', 'Sheep', '*Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/administration & dosage', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Vaccines/*administration & dosage/genetics']",2004/11/03 09:00,2005/01/28 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(04)00586-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2004.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Nov 24;329(2):434-9. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.09.001.,,,,PMC3049242,,,,,,['NIHMS183533'],,,,,,,,,

Studies have demonstrated that T-cell activating agents that stimulate CREB are potent inducers of HTLV-I transcription. Herein, we demonstrate that bpV[pic], a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor activates the HTLV-I LTR in the presence and absence of Tax expression. Optimal activation occurred at 8 h and was synergistic with forskolin or PGE(2). Infected cell lines and cells transfected with HTLV-I proviral DNA were equally responsive to the synergistic effect of bpV and forskolin on HTLV-I gene expression. Activation of the LTR by bpV[pic] was T-cell receptor-independent, but required ZAP70, calcineurin activity and functional calcium entry. Inhibition of the SHP-1 PTP was suggested to be important. Transfection experiments with a CREB dominant-negative mutant and with isolated TRE1- or CREB-responsive reporter constructs and treatment with the MDL-12,330A adenylate cyclase inhibitor all supported the involvement of a CREB/ATF family member in this bpV-dependent activation of the HTLV-I LTR, although CREB itself did not seem to be involved. Analysis of HTLV-I reporter constructs containing mutated CREB-binding sites also implied the involvement of another element in this activation. These results demonstrate for the first time a powerful effect of PTP inhibitors on HTLV-I LTR activity and suggest participation of both CREB-dependent and -independent pathways in this activation.","['Langlois, Melanie', 'Audet, Brigitte', 'Legault, Eric', 'Pare, Marie-Eve', 'Ouellet, Michel', 'Roy, Jocelyn', 'Dumais, Nancy', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Rothstein, David M', 'Marriott, Susan J', 'Tremblay, Michel J', 'Barbeau, Benoit']","['Langlois M', 'Audet B', 'Legault E', 'Pare ME', 'Ouellet M', 'Roy J', 'Dumais N', 'Mesnard JM', 'Rothstein DM', 'Marriott SJ', 'Tremblay MJ', 'Barbeau B']","['Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Pavillon CHUL, Ste-Foy (Quebec), Canada G1V 4G2.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (oxodiperoxo(pyridine-2-carboxylate)vanadate(V))', '0 (peroxovanadate)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/physiology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Organometallic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology', 'Virus Activation', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2004/11/03 09:00,2005/01/28 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(04)00589-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2004.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Nov 24;329(2):395-411. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.09.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These complications have been studied most extensively in children with brain tumors and leukemia. REVIEW SUMMARY: Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia previously treated with cranial irradiation are at risk for cognitive decline. Chemotherapy-only regimens, which rely on high-dose frequently administered methotrexate, are also associated with producing cognitive dysfunction. Children irradiated for brain tumors are even more vulnerable. Risk factors include perioperative morbidity, young age, large-volume high-dose cranial irradiation, supra-tentorial location of tumor, moyamoya syndrome, and leukoencephalopathy. Cognitive decline is progressive over at least a decade. The most common radiation-induced endocrinopathies are hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency. Treatment effects on growth are multifactorial and include growth hormone deficiency,spinal shortening, precocious puberty, undetected hypothyroidism,and poor nutrition. Fifty percent to 80% of children treated with craniospinal radiation for brain tumors will experience growth failure. In hopes of reducing neurotoxicity, current treatments limit the dose and volume of radiation while adding chemotherapy. Results have not been uniformly positive, however, and may increase toxicity in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: The standard of care in 2004 is that children who have been treated for brain tumors and leukemia should be monitored for cognitive and endocrine dysfunction. Until effective non-neurotoxic treatment is identified, long-term effects assessments are essential to maximize the quality of life of survivors of childhood cancer.","['Duffner, Patricia K']",['Duffner PK'],"['Department of Neurology, School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, State University of New York at Buffalo, 219 Bryant Street, Buffalo, NY 14222, USA. pduffner@kaleidahealth.org']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Neurologist,The neurologist,9503763,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Endocrine System/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Endocrine System Diseases/etiology', 'Growth/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrocephalus/pathology', 'Infant', 'Intelligence/physiology/radiation effects', 'Moyamoya Disease/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",2004/11/03 09:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['01.nrl.0000144287.35993.96 [pii]', '10.1097/01.nrl.0000144287.35993.96 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurologist. 2004 Nov;10(6):293-310. doi: 10.1097/01.nrl.0000144287.35993.96.,,,117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further studies revealed that the induction of apoptosis by ML was associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.

Indeed, normal proliferating cells and most tumor cell lines are characterized by the existence of a minimal cyclin E threshold level in the G1-phase, and only those cells expressing cyclin E over this threshold enter into the S-phase of the cell cycle. However, through studying clinical tumor tissue specimens, we recently observed that some cancer cells can enter into the S-phase with minimal levels of cyclin E expression. In an effort to establish an in vitro cell model system for studying the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we treated MOLT-4 lymphocyte leukemia cells with 50 mM caffeine and found that the levels of cyclin E expression were decreased markedly in these cells following 2 to 4-h exposure to caffeine. Quite unexpectedly, we observed that the percentage of the cells progressing through the S-phase increased despite the reduced levels of cyclin E, as analyzed for the cellular DNA contents, expression of nuclear-bound PCNA, immunolabelling with Ki-67 antibody and incorporation of BrdU. In fact, these cells entered into the S-phase with a level of cyclin E well below the threshold level for untreated cells, thus suggesting that lower levels of cyclin E expression are associated with cell proliferation under certain circumstances. We speculate that caffeine may enhance MOLT-4 cell entrance into the S-phase through activation of Cdc25, which in turn activates cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) including CDK2 and drives the cell cycle progression; while degradation of cyclin E by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway may account for the decreased levels of cyclin E in these cells. Our findings from both the MOLT-4 cell line and patients' cancer tissues may help decipher the mystery of the deregulation of cell cycle progression and carcinogenesis in some malignant tumors.","['Qin, Jichao', 'Tao, Deding', 'Chen, Xiaoxi', 'Feng, Yongdong', 'Hu, Junbo', 'Reed, Eddie', 'Li, Qingdi Q', 'Gong, Jianping']","['Qin J', 'Tao D', 'Chen X', 'Feng Y', 'Hu J', 'Reed E', 'Li QQ', 'Gong J']","['Institute of Cancer Research and Department of Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['P20 RR016440/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20RR16440-010003/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)']",IM,"['Caffeine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin E/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'S Phase/*drug effects/genetics']",2004/11/03 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2004 Sep-Oct;24(5A):2991-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combination treatment with STI571 and FK228 enhanced the induction of apoptosis significantly compared with each single treatment, although the histone acetylation level was not changed by the co-treatment. The combination treatment activated caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, but it did not induce any notable change in the expression of Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and Bax compared with each single treatment. Enhanced apoptosis by the co-treatment was abrogated by ectopic expression of cyclin D1, c-Myc or active MEK CONCLUSION: The combination of FK228 with STI571 is a promising treatment for Bcr-Abl-positive CML, but the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and its downstream target genes may bring resistance to the co-treatment in leukemic cells.","['Kawano, Takeshi', 'Horiguchi-Yamada, Junko', 'Iwase, Satsuki', 'Akiyama, Masaharu', 'Furukawa, Yusuke', 'Kan, Yasuhiko', 'Yamada, Hisashi']","['Kawano T', 'Horiguchi-Yamada J', 'Iwase S', 'Akiyama M', 'Furukawa Y', 'Kan Y', 'Yamada H']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Institute of DNA Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cyclin D1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Depsipeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2004/11/03 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2004 Sep-Oct;24(5A):2705-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ST1571 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that was initially developed as a BCR/ABL inhibitor for chronic myeloid leukemia patients. STI571 also selectively inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) and c-kit. We examined the expression of PDGFRs and c-kit in human MFH cell lines, and the effect of STI571 on cell proliferation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four human MFH cell lines (TNMY1, GBS-1, Nara-F and Nara-H) were used. mRNA expression of the receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGFRs and c-kit) was analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the inhibitory effect of STI571 on cell proliferation was analyzed using the MTS assay technique. RESULTS: PDGFRalpha mRNA was expressed in TNMY1 and GBS-1, and PDGFRbeta and c-kit mRNAs were expressed in TNMY1, GBS-1 and Nara-F. All three of these mRNAs were absent in Nara-H. STI571 inhibited cell proliferation of TNMY1, GBS-1 and Nara-F in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but cell proliferation of Nara-H was not inhibited by ST1571 at concentrations of 10 microM or less. CONCLUSION: STI571 significantly inhibited proliferation of the three human MFH cell lines that expressed mRNAs of target receptor tyrosine kinases. The inhibitory effect of ST1571 on cell proliferation in these three cell lines might be due to decreased tyrosine kinase activity. STI571 might be a potent chemotherapeutic agent for human MFHs.","['Kawamoto, Teruya', 'Akisue, Toshihiro', 'Marui, Takashi', 'Nakatani, Tetsuya', 'Hitora, Toshiaki', 'Fujita, Ikuo', 'Kurosaka, Masahiro', 'Yamamoto, Tetsuji']","['Kawamoto T', 'Akisue T', 'Marui T', 'Nakatani T', 'Hitora T', 'Fujita I', 'Kurosaka M', 'Yamamoto T']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics']",2004/11/03 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/11/03 09:00'],"['2004/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2004 Sep-Oct;24(5A):2675-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, differentiating agents are able to alter the susceptibility of cancer cells to antineoplastic drug therapy. However, the acquisition and/or development of drug resistance that frequently appears in anticancer treatment can impair these interactions between differentiation agents and cytotoxic drugs. In the present study, we report that the acquisition of resistance to anthracyclines in two humans, promyeolocytic leukemia HL-60 and eythroleukemia K562 cell lines, results in a restricted maturation process induced by differentiating agents with respect to that exhibited by their corresponding drug-sensitive counterparts. Interestingly, differentiating agents are able to decrease the overexpression of drug-efflux pumps as it is the case of MRP1 in the resistant HL-60 cells, thus increasing the sensitivity of cells to drug treatment. In addition, susceptibility of the drug-sensitive cells to certain apoptotic stimuli is significantly reduced after differentiation. The results here reported indicate complex interactions between cytotoxic (drug therapy) and non-cytotoxic (differentiation) cancer treatments, which should be taken into account to improve therapeutic efficiency.","['Camarasa, Maria V', 'Castro-Galache, Maria D', 'Carrasco-Garcia, Estefania', 'Garcia-Morales, Pilar', 'Saceda, Miguel', 'Ferragut, Jose A']","['Camarasa MV', 'Castro-Galache MD', 'Carrasco-Garcia E', 'Garcia-Morales P', 'Saceda M', 'Ferragut JA']","['Novuspharma spA, Bresso, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,IM,"['Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/11/02 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2004/11/02 09:00'],"['2004/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20278 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 Jan 1;94(1):98-108. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20278.,,,,,"['2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several in vitro studies on EMF effects were performed to clarify the existing controversies, define the risks, and determine the possible mechanisms of adverse effects. In some of these reports, the effects were related to other mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Modification in cell proliferation was observed after EMF exposure and a few reports on cytotoxic effects have also been published. This limited review gives an overview of the current results of scientific research regarding in vitro studies on the effects of power line frequency EMF, but also cell biological mechanisms and their potential involvement in genotoxicity and cytotoxicity are discussed. Cell cycle control and signal transduction processes are included to elucidate the biochemical background of possible interactions. Exposure to EMF has been also linked to the incidence of leukemia and other tumors in some epidemiological studies and is considered as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"", but there is no well-established biological mechanism that explains such a relation. Furthermore, EMF is also shown as a stimulus for immune relevant cells (e.g., macrophages) to release free radicals. It is known that chronic activation of macrophages is associated with the onset of phagocytosis and leads to increased formation of reactive oxygen species, which themselves may cause DNA damage and are suggested to lead to carcinogenesis. To demonstrate a possible interaction between EMF and cellular systems, we present a mechanistic model describing cell activation as a major importance for cellular response.","['Simko, Myrtill']",['Simko M'],"['University of Rostock, Institute of Cell Biology and Biosystems Technology, Division of Environmental Physiology, Albert-Einstein-Str. 3, D-18059 Rostock, Germany. myrtill.simko@biologie.uni-rostock.de']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20041020,United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans']",2004/11/02 09:00,2005/03/23 09:00,['2004/11/02 09:00'],"['2004/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1100/tsw.2004.174 [doi]'],epublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2004 Oct 20;4 Suppl 2:4-22. doi: 10.1100/tsw.2004.174.,,,154,PMC5956406,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that TIMP-1 overexpression impairs differentiation of the myeloblastic M1 cell line following interleukin (IL)-6 stimulation. We generated retroviral vectors coexpressing human TIMP-1 and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and stably transduced murine M1 myeloid cells. TIMP-1 expressing cells showed a large reduction in IL-6-induced macrophage differentiation in vitro that was reversible with a specific monoclonal antibody. The differentiation delay in M1/TIMP-1 cells was also specifically reversible by pharmacologic phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K) inhibition. Additionally, overexpression of a TIMP-1/GFP fusion protein also impaired M1 differentiation and this protein was localized to the cell surface, consistent with an autocrine receptor-mediated mechanism. Surprisingly, TIMP-1 transduced cells had a selective advantage for growth in IL-6, indicating that functional effects on growth and differentiation of M1 cells were primarily through an autocrine mechanism.

Protein half-life analyses showed that PML-RARalpha enhanced MNK1 protein stability in U937 cells and ATRA exposure decreased MNK1 half-life in NB4 cells. EIF4E, the main MNK1 substrate, plays a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of cancers. Upon MNK1 overexpression, eIF4E phosphorylation increased as a sign of functional activation. Interestingly, MNK1 protein expression decreased during myeloid differentiation. Inhibition of MNK1 activity by a specific inhibitor (CGP57380) enhanced differentiation of HL60 and 32D cells, further suggesting a role for MNK1 in the myeloid differentiation. In addition, kinase dead mutants of MNK1 significantly impaired proliferation of 32D cells.

Using an equivalent circuit mimicking simultaneous whole-cell voltage-clamp and cell-attached current-clamp recordings we have defined both mathematically and experimentally the relationship between the membrane patch resistance, the seal resistance, and the fraction of the whole-cell potential recorded across an intact membrane patch. This analysis revealed a steep increase in the accuracy of recording of steady-state membrane potential as the seal/membrane ratio increases from 0. The recording accuracy approaches 100% as the seal/membrane ratio approaches infinity. Membrane potential measurements across intact cell-attached patches in rat basophilic leukemia cells and rat megakaryocytes revealed a surprisingly high degree of accuracy and demonstrated the ability of this noninvasive technique to follow dynamic changes in potential in nonexcitable cells.","['Mason, M J', 'Simpson, A K', 'Mahaut-Smith, M P', 'Robinson, H P C']","['Mason MJ', 'Simpson AK', 'Mahaut-Smith MP', 'Robinson HP']","['Department of Physiology, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. mjm39@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041029,United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrodes', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques/*methods', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology']",2004/11/02 09:00,2005/07/12 09:00,['2004/11/02 09:00'],"['2004/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(05)73145-3 [pii]', '10.1529/biophysj.104.049866 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2005 Jan;88(1):739-50. doi: 10.1529/biophysj.104.049866.

While this somatic hypermutation was thought to occur only at the variable region, recent studies suggest that hypermutation can occur at locations throughout the genome. Building upon this notion, we sought to exploit this mechanism as a mutagenesis tool. We created a substrate based on GFP that could be screened using flow cytometry and showed that retroviral infection can deliver the transgene to genomic locations that support hypermutation. Infected cells generated various GFP mutants with increased fluorescence intensity and analysis revealed mutations not only at the chromophore, but also an unexpected mutation at a distant residue. Our results demonstrate in principle that immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation can be a potent means of mutagenesis.

A 63-year-old man contracted hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) from a blood transfusion at age of 18. At age 57, he was treated with interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) for chronic hepatitis C. A month later, he developed muscle weakness in the proximal part of his lower extremities. IBM was diagnosed after a muscle biopsy at age 62. Steroid therapy improved his muscle power. One year later, worsening of his hepatic condition required re-administration of IFN alpha after gradual decrease and discontinuation of prednisolone. However, several days later, he rapidly became weaker and required a cane to walk. Elevated serum creatine kinase (2,199IU/L) and abnormal intensity in his MRI of thigh were demonstrated. The second muscle biopsy, performed after obtaining the informed consent from our patient, confirmed relapse of IBM. His symptoms improved again after discontinuation of IFN alpha and re-induction of prednisolone. Although a few cases each of IBM associated with HCV or HTLV-1 have been reported, the pathogenesis of virus-associated inflammatory myositis has not been clearly understood. Moreover, there has been no description on IBM associated with IFN alpha treatment, though several cases of polymyositis have been reported.

CASE REPORT: Recently, we encountered three patients treated by immunocell therapy with imatinib mesylate (Glivec). One patient was diagnosed as having Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) (+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and had a relapse-free survival of more than 24 months. The other two were diagnosed as having GIST; a partial response was observed in one which lasted more than 21 months, while the other's disease has been stabilized for more than 25 months. No side-effects were observed, other than those mentioned in the directions for the use of imatinib. CONCLUSION: Immunocell therapy may have a potent therapeutic effect when used in combination with molecularly-targeted therapy, which has few side-effects.","['Kaneko, Toru', 'Goto, Shigenori', 'Kushima, Yoshiaki', 'Miyamoto, Yoju', 'Eriguchi, Masazumi', 'Nieda, Mie', 'Egawa, Koji']","['Kaneko T', 'Goto S', 'Kushima Y', 'Miyamoto Y', 'Eriguchi M', 'Nieda M', 'Egawa K']","['Shin-yokohama Medical Clinic, Usui building 3F, 2-5-14 Shin-yokohama, Kohoku-ku, Yokohama-shi, Kanagawa, Japan. kaneko@j-immunother.com']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Stromal Cells/pathology']",2004/11/02 09:00,2004/11/09 09:00,['2004/11/02 09:00'],"['2004/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2004 Sep-Oct;24(5C):3303-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine leukemia virus is a retrovirus that is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for validating clearance of retrovirus-like particles. Due to biosafety considerations, an amphotropic murine leukemia virus vector (A-MLV) that is incapable of self-replication was used. Further, A-MLV is incapable of infecting CHO cells, thus ensuring that infection of the CHO cells in the feed did not result in a reduced virus titer in the permeate. The virus vector contains the gene for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to facilitate assaying for infectious virus particles. The virus particles are 80-130 nm in size. The feed streams were flocculated using a cationic polyelectrolyte. Microfiltration was conducted using 0.1 and 0.65 microm pore size hollow fiber membranes. The level of virus clearance in the permeate was determined. For the 0.1 microm pore size membranes a 1,000-fold reduction in the virus titer in the permeate was observed for feed streams consisting of A-MLV, A-MLV plus flocculant, A-MLV plus CHO cells, and A-MLV plus flocculant and CHO cells. While the flocculant had little effect on the level of virus clearance in the permeate for 0.1 microm pore size membranes, it did lead to higher permeate fluxes for the CHO cell feed streams. Virus clearance experiments conducted with 0.65 microm pore size membranes indicate little clearance of A-MLV from the permeate in the absence of flocculant. However, in the presence of flocculant the level of virus clearance in the permeate was similar to that observed for 0.1 microm pore size membranes. The results obtained here indicate that significant clearance of A-MLV is possible during tangential flow microfiltration. Addition of a flocculant is essential if the membrane pore size is greater than the diameter of the virus particles. Flocculation of the feed stream leads to an increase in the permeate flux.","['Akeprathumchai, Saengchai', 'Han, Binbing', 'Wickramasinghe, S Ranil', 'Carlson, Jonathan O', 'Czermak, Peter', 'Preibeta, Katrin']","['Akeprathumchai S', 'Han B', 'Wickramasinghe SR', 'Carlson JO', 'Czermak P', 'Preibeta K']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1370, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bioreactors/*microbiology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Cell Separation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Flocculation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*isolation & purification', 'Microfluidics/instrumentation/*methods', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Ultrafiltration/instrumentation/*methods']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/05/12 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.20312 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2004 Dec 30;88(7):880-9. doi: 10.1002/bit.20312.,,,,,"['2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we conducted a detailed analysis of anti-leukemic effects of an HDAC inhibitor (HDI), depsipeptide (FK228), using myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60 and K562. DNA chip analysis revealed upregulation of TNF-alpha mRNA and a number of molecules involved in TNF-signaling such as TRAF-6, caspases-10, and -7 in depsipeptide-treated HL-60 cells, which prompted us to examine the involvement of the TNF/TNF receptor system in the anti-leukemic effects of the drug. Upregulation of TNF-alpha was induced by depsipeptide in HL-60 and K562 cells, which expressed type I TNF receptors (TNF-RI). Depsipeptide activated caspases-8 and -10, which in turn cleave caspases-3 and -7, leading to apoptotic cell death in both cell lines. Anti-TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody and short interfering RNA (siRNA) against TNF-RI alleviated the activation of the caspase cascade and the induction of apoptosis, indicating the presence of an autocrine loop. Finally, we demonstrated that the enhanced production of TNF-alpha by depsipeptide was due to transcriptional activation of the TNF-alpha gene through hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in its promoter region (-208 to +35). These results suggest that autocrine production of TNF-alpha plays a role in the cytotoxicity of depsipeptide against a subset of leukemias.","['Sutheesophon, Krittaya', 'Nishimura, Noriko', 'Kobayashi, Yukiko', 'Furukawa, Yutaka', 'Kawano, Mikihiko', 'Itoh, Kouichi', 'Kano, Yasuhiko', 'Ishii, Hideshi', 'Furukawa, Yusuke']","['Sutheesophon K', 'Nishimura N', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Furukawa Y', 'Kawano M', 'Itoh K', 'Kano Y', 'Ishii H', 'Furukawa Y']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, 33311-1 Yakushiji, Minamikachi-machi, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Autocrine Communication/drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/06/02 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20235 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2005 May;203(2):387-97. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20235.,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Corticosteroids, representing an essential element of antileukemic therapy, are known to induce ON, which in turn may cause significant morbidity. Due to spontaneous reporting of affected patients with ON, a group-wide evaluation was performed to determine incidence, risk factors, and morbidity for ON. PROCEDURE: Patients were identified via spontaneous reporting to the study center and via questionnaire, addressing all 64 participating centers. We retrospectively analyzed 1,951 patients below 18 years of age who were treated according to trial ALL-BFM 95 between 01.01.1996 and 30.06.2000. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (14 male, 17 female) affected by ON were identified. The overall 5-year cumulative incidence for ON is 1.8%. The incidence for patients <10 years is 0.2%, whereas for patients >/=10 years it is 8.9% (P = 0.00) and 16.7% (P = 0.003) for patients >/=15 years. The majority (n = 20) showed ON in two or more joints, and the joints most commonly affected were knees (14 patients, 24 affected knees) and hips (11 patients, 20 affected joints). Thirteen out of 31 patients had to undergo surgery in the course of their disease. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic ON is a rare event in patients treated with BFM-type chemotherapy with an overall 5-year cumulative incidence of 1.8%.

RESULTS: One hundred four patients (11.5%) enrolled onto the clinical trials AML-BFM 93 and AML-BFM 98 died shortly after diagnosis or as a result of treatment-related complications. Thirty-two patients (3.5%) died before (six patients) or during (26 patients) the first 14 days of treatment, mainly as a result of bleeding or leukostasis. Low performance status, hyperleukocytosis, and French-American-British type M5 were the main risk factors for a lethal event before day 15. After day 15, the predominant causes of death were complications caused by infections, particularly bacterial and fungal infections. The incidence of lethal infections was highest during induction therapy and decreased thereafter. When comparing both clinical trials, significantly fewer patients died within the first 6 weeks in AML-BFM 98 than in AML-BFM 93 (14 [3.5%] of 430 patients v 35 [7.4%] of 471 patients; P = .01). CONCLUSION: To reduce the high incidence of ED and TRM in children with AML, early diagnosis and adequate treatment of complications are needed. Children with AML should be treated in specialized pediatric cancer centers only. Prophylactic and therapeutic regimens for better treatment management of bleeding disorders and infectious complications have to be assessed in future trials to ultimately improve overall survival in children with AML.","['Creutzig, Ursula', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Stary, Jan', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas']","['Creutzig U', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reinhardt D', 'Dworzak M', 'Stary J', 'Lehrnbecher T']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Str 33, D-48129 Muenster, Germany. ursula@creutzig.de""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*toxicity', 'Cause of Death', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2004/10/30 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/21/4384 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2004.01.191 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Nov 1;22(21):4384-93. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.01.191.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A chemotherapy dose-escalation study was performed with PSC-833 in patients younger than 60 years with untreated acute myeloid leukemia. Clinical rather than pharmacokinetic end points were used to develop two induction therapies containing drugs susceptible to Pgp-mediated efflux and associated with comparable toxicities at the maximum-tolerated doses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 410 patients were enrolled. Fifteen induction regimens containing variable doses of daunorubicin (DNR) and etoposide (ETOP) and fixed doses of cytarabine were evaluated with (ADEP) or without (ADE) a fixed dose of PSC-833. RESULTS: Doses selected for phase III testing were DNR 90 mg/m(2) and ETOP 100 mg/m(2) in ADE, and DNR and ETOP each 40 mg/m(2) in ADEP. Intolerable mucosal toxicity occurred at higher doses of ADEP. Although the design of this study precludes direct comparisons, there was an apparent advantage for receiving ADEP with respect to disease-free and overall survival in patients < or = 45 years old, despite the significantly lower doses of DNR and ETOP given in ADEP compared with ADE. CONCLUSION: A large clinical data set was used to develop induction regimens containing two drugs susceptible to Pgp-mediated efflux, with and without an inhibitor of Pgp function. The chosen doses have comparable antileukemia activity and toxicity, making them suitable for use in a phase III comparative study of induction chemotherapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia younger than 60 years. That trial will also clarify whether patients < or = 45 years old are especially likely to benefit from Pgp inhibition during induction therapy.","['Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'George, Stephen L', 'Dodge, Richard K', 'Hurd, David D', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Velez-Garcia, Enrique', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Shea, Thomas C', 'Hoke, Eva', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Vardiman, James W', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Larson, Richard A']","['Kolitz JE', 'George SL', 'Dodge RK', 'Hurd DD', 'Powell BL', 'Allen SL', 'Velez-Garcia E', 'Moore JO', 'Shea TC', 'Hoke E', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Vardiman JW', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Larson RA']","['Don Monti Division of Oncology and Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital, New York University School of Medicine, NY 11030, USA. kolitz@nshs.edu']",['eng'],,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/10/30 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/21/4290 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2004.11.106 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Nov 1;22(21):4290-301. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.11.106.,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results indicated that (1) the expression of TEL-FGFR3 but not DeltaHLH-TEL-FGFR3 resulted in efficient focus formation in NIH/3T3 cells and conferred interleukin 3 independence to Ba/F3 cells by a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity probably through oligomerization by the HLH domain of TEL; (2) although effector proteins including classical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), mammalian target or rapamycin (mTOR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) and STAT-5 were activated in TEL-FGFR3 transformants, the growth of the transformants was inhibited by SU5402 (concentration that inhibits 50% [IC5)]=5 microM) and the PI3-K inhibitor, LY294002 (IC5)=10 microM) and wortmannin (IC50=5 microM), but not by U0126, SB203580, or rapamycin; and (3) injection of TEL-FGFR3 transformants induced lethal leukemia into syngeneic mice.

However, the classification is usually based on a small number of samples, and each sample is a long vector of thousands of gene expression levels. An important issue in parametric modeling for so many gene expression levels is the control of the number of nuisance parameters in the model. Large models often lead to intensive or even intractable computation, while small models may be inadequate for complex data. METHODOLOGY: We propose a two-step empirical Bayes classification method as a solution to this issue. At the first step, we use the model-based cluster algorithm with a non-traditional purpose of assigning gene expression levels to form abundance groups. At the second step, by assuming the same variance for all the genes in the same group, we substantially reduce the number of nuisance parameters in our statistical model. RESULTS: The proposed model is more parsimonious, which leads to efficient computation under an empirical Bayes estimation procedure. We consider two real examples and simulate data using our method. Desired low classification error rates are obtained even when a large number of genes are pre-selected for class prediction.","['Ji, Yuan', 'Tsui, Kam-Wah', 'Kim, Kyungmann']","['Ji Y', 'Tsui KW', 'Kim K']","['Department of Biostatistics and Applied Mathematics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Houston, TX 77030, USA. yuanji@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,"['CA52733/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041028,England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['bti092 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/bti092 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 1;21(7):1055-61. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti092.

Many structurally related AQ derivatives are medicinal natural plant products. Examples include 1-hydroxyanthraquinone (1-OH-AQ) and 2-hydroxyanthraquinone (2-OH-AQ), which are also metabolites of AQ. Some commercial AQ is produced by the oxidation of anthracene (AQ-OX). In the recent past, the anthracene used was distilled from coal tar and different lots of derived AQ often contained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants, particularly 9-nitroanthracene (9-NA). Many toxicology studies on AQ used contaminated anthracene-derived AQ-OX, including a National Toxicology Program (NTP) 2-year cancer bioassay that reported a weak to modest increase in tumors in the kidney and bladder of male and female F344/N rats and in the livers of male and female B6C3F1 mice. The AQ-OX used in that bioassay was mutagenic and contained 9-NA and other contaminants. In contrast, purified AQ is not genotoxic. The purpose of this paper is to provide additional information to help iterpret the NTP cancer bioassay. This paper describes a quantitative analytical study of the NTP anthracene-derived AQ-OX test material, and presents the results of mutagenicity studies with the 1-OH-AQ and 2-OH-AQ metabolites and the primary contaminant 9-NA. Purified 1-OH-AQ and 2-OH-AQ exhibited only weak mutagenic activity in selected strains of tester bacteria and required S9. Literature reports of potent mutagenic activity for 1-OH-AQ and 2-OH-AQ in bacteria minus S9 are, once again, very likely the result of the presence of contaminants in the test samples. Weak activity and limited production of the 1-OH-AQ and 2-OH-AQ metabolites are possible reasons that AQ fails to exhibit activity in numerous genotoxicity assays. 9-NA was mutagenic in tester strains TA98 and TA100 minus S9. This pattern of activity is consistent with that seen with the contaminated AQ-OX used in the NTP bioassay. Analysis of all the mutagenicity and analytical data, however, indicates that the mutagenic contamination in the NTP bioassay probably resides with compounds in addition to 9-NA. 9-NA exhibited potent mutagenic activity in the L5178Y mammalian cell mutagenicity assay in the presence of S9. The positive response was primarily associated with an increase in small colony mutants suggesting a predominance of a clastogenic mechanism. Quantitative mutagenicity and carcinogenicity potency estimates indicate that it is plausible that the contaminants alone in the NTP AQ-OX bioassay could have been responsible for all of the observed carcinogenic activity. Although AQ-OX is no longer commercially used in the United States, many of the reported genotoxicity and carcinogenicity results in the literature for AQ and AQ derivative compounds must be viewed with caution.","['Butterworth, Byron E', 'Mathre, Owen B', 'Ballinger, Kenneth E', 'Adalsteinsson, Orn']","['Butterworth BE', 'Mathre OB', 'Ballinger KE', 'Adalsteinsson O']","['Butterworth Consulting, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. bebutterworth@earthlink.net']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Toxicol,International journal of toxicology,9708436,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Ribosomal Protein S9)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', 'JZ1TB3N57P (9-nitroanthracene)', 'LFU129OE9H (1-hydroxyanthraquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes/classification/metabolism/toxicity', 'Anthraquinones/chemistry/classification/metabolism/*toxicity', '*Drug Contamination', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects/genetics', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/chemistry/classification/*toxicity', 'Mutation', 'Rats', 'Ribosomal Protein S9', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/genetics']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['G3Q69H12RKEUM694 [pii]', '10.1080/10915810490517072 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Toxicol. 2004;23(5):335-44. doi: 10.1080/10915810490517072.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is, as yet, no established marker for leukemia-associated vessels in bone marrow. In this study, immunohistochemical stainings for von Willebrand factor (vWf), CD34, Tie-2, angiomodulin, glycodelin, cycloxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and endoglin were compared in order to identify the bone marrow vasculature. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a disease displaying intense angiogenesis, and polycythemia vera (PV), a disease with a low microvascular density (MVD), were studied, as well as normal bone marrow. Only vWf, CD34 and Tie-2 stained the bone marrow endothelium. Although more vessels were stained for vWf than for CD34, there was no evidence that vWf stained more disease-associated vessels. In double staining, Tie-2 co-localized with CD34, but vessels staining only for Tie-2 were also found. However, the number of Tie-2-positive vessels did not correlate to either the MVD or the disease. Angiomodulin, glycodelin, Cox-2 and endoglin did not stain vessel-like structures. In conclusion, estimating the MVD by means of CD34 staining appears to be the most reliable method, but none of the tested molecules qualified as a specific marker for leukemia-associated vessels in the bone marrow.","['Zetterberg, E', 'Lundberg, L G', 'Palmblad, J']","['Zetterberg E', 'Lundberg LG', 'Palmblad J']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Huddinge University Hospital, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,0404375,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (ENG protein, human)', '0 (Endoglin)', '0 (Glycodelin)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PAEP protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (tumor-derived adhesion factor)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Blood Vessels/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Endoglin', 'Female', 'Glycodelin', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*diagnosis', 'Polycythemia Vera/*diagnosis', 'Pregnancy Proteins/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Receptor, TIE-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'von Willebrand Factor/metabolism']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/03/09 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['6XV4ADCYGB578V6A [pii]', '10.1080/00365510410002968 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2004;64(7):641-7. doi: 10.1080/00365510410002968.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, karyotypic investigations are now routinely performed for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in ALL, with the chromosomal abnormalities/cytogenetic patterns playing a major role for proper risk assessment and choice of treatment. At the same time, the cytogenetic analyses have resulted in the identification of more than 70 different genes, located at the breakpoints of ALL-associated structural chromosomal abnormalities, that are causally implicated in the leukemogenic process. Hence, the genetic studies have also improved our understanding of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis. However, the almost staggering amount of cytogenetic information presently available has made it increasingly difficult to obtain a general overview of the clinical and biological importance of karyotypic patterns in ALL. Here, we summarize and review the cytogenetic features of childhood and adult ALL, with emphasis on their molecular genetic consequences and their clinical impact.","['Johansson, Bertil', 'Mertens, Fredrik', 'Mitelman, Felix']","['Johansson B', 'Mertens F', 'Mitelman F']","['Deaprtment of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden. bertil.johansson@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Ann Med,Annals of medicine,8906388,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['J6K613PJK9CCXVWA [pii]', '10.1080/07853890410018808 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Med. 2004;36(7):492-503. doi: 10.1080/07853890410018808.,,,118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The conditioning regime consisted of fractionated (f) TBI 8 Gy followed by f total nodal irradiation (TNI) 6 Gy. In addition, patients received CY 60 mg/kg on 2 consecutive days. Cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood grafts from HLA-identical siblings were T-cell depleted with CAMPATH-1H 'in the bag'. CsA was commenced on day -1 and continued until day +90. RESULTS: Seventeen heavily transfused patients with aplastic anemia, median age 18 years (range 14-56 years), were studied. The median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 172 days (range 34-443 days). The median CD34(+) cell number infused was 3.47 x 10(6)/kg (range 1.03-18.4 x 10(6)/kg). All patients engrafted. Recovery was fast and patients reached 0.5 x 10(9)/L polymorphs by median day 11 (range 9-17 days). Toxicity from the conditioning included grade 4 hematologic toxicity in all patients. Another major toxicity was gastrointestinal mucosal damage, which exceeded grade 2 in two instances. One patient developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which responded to substitution of CsA with tacrolimus and plasmapheresis. Another patient, who had normal blood counts, died of infection on day 241. Chimerism studies at 6 months post-transplantation confirmed the donor origin of hematopoiesis in all seven patients tested. None of the patients developed acute or chronic GvHD. There was no delayed graft failure and 94% of patients had survived disease free at a median of 1303.5 days (range 216-2615 days) from graft infusion. DISCUSSION: In this cohort of multiply transfused patients, the radiation-containing schedules described in this study led to universal engraftment with limited toxicity despite T-cell depletion. No patient developed GvHD or late graft failure. Lower doses of radiation-containing conditioning should be explored further.","['Novitzky, N', 'Thomas, V', 'Stubbings, H', 'Hale, G', 'Waldmann, H']","['Novitzky N', 'Thomas V', 'Stubbings H', 'Hale G', 'Waldmann H']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Division of Haematology, Cape Town, South Africa.']",['eng'],,,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['FY9UHY7162H8YX3R [pii]', '10.1080/14653240410004970 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2004;6(5):450-6. doi: 10.1080/14653240410004970.,,['Cytotherapy. 2004;6(5):439.

Mast cell leukemia (MCL) is an extremely rare subtype of mastocytosis in which a leukemic spread of mast cells and a rapid progression of disease is seen. In typical cases, mast cells are found in the peripheral blood. However, an aleukemic variant of MCL (formerly termed malignant mastocytosis) has also been described. We here report a case of aleukemic MCL with abnormal immunophenotype of mast cells and the classical c-kit point mutation Asp-816-Val (=D816V). The 75-year-old male patient had a short history of weight loss and lymphadenopathy. There were no urticaria pigmentosa-like skin lesions. The bone marrow was diffusely infiltrated with atypical mast cells that comprised more than 80% of all nucleated cells on a bone marrow smears. As assessed by immunohistochemistry, neoplastic mast cells expressed tryptase, chymase, CD2, CD25, CD68, and the KIT protein (CD117). Mutation analysis revealed the c-kit mutation D816V. Since circulating mast cells could not be detected in the peripheral blood, the diagnosis of aleukemic MCL was established in accordance to the updated WHO consensus classification. This case further supports the notion that the pathogenesis (c-kit mutation D816V) in MCL is closely related to that found in indolent mast cell disorders. However, additional (but yet unknown) molecular (genetic) defects have to be considered to explain the extremely heterogenous clinical course in these patients.","['Noack, Frank', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Notter, Martin', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Valent, Peter', 'Horny, Hans-Peter']","['Noack F', 'Sotlar K', 'Notter M', 'Thiel E', 'Valent P', 'Horny HP']","['Department of Pathology, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany. noack@patho.mu-luebeck.de']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'CD2 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/cytology', 'Mastocytosis', '*Mutation', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Temperature']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/04/19 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['WTN26F31KQ18PP28 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190412331272695 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Nov;45(11):2295-302. doi: 10.1080/10428190412331272695.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antigen expression intensity was calculated as relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) and for direct quantitative analysis the QuantiBRITE test (Becton Dickinson) was applied. Antibody bounding capacity (ABC) was calculated using QuantiCALC software. CD117 antigen was present in 49/158 MM, 5/12 PCL and 5/7 MGUS patients. The RFI values ranged from 0.2 to 20.2 in particular MM patients (mean: 11.0+/-5.3; median 11.5) while the number of CD117 binding sites (ABC) on MM plasma cells ranged from 637 to 6217 (mean: 3029+/-1568; median 2946) (r=0.8328). In responsive to chemotherapy c-kit positive MM patients the percentage of CD117+ plasma cells in the bone marrow decreased significantly while in c-kit negative MM patients the percentage of CD117+ cells in bone marrow did not change and remained in the normal limits. When comparing the clinical and biological disease characteristics (monoclonal protein isotype, albumin, beta2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase, stage of disease, response to chemotherapy, survival time) of c-kit positive and c-kit negative cases, no significant differences were found. In CD117 positive PCL cases expression of CD117 was detected in bone marrow plasma cells as well as in peripheral blood plasma cells. Normal plasma cells and those in IgM lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma did not show reactivity for the CD117 antigen. We conclude that it may be rationale to consider usefulness of therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the management of c-kit positive plasma cell proliferations. In one third of MM and PCL patients c-kit antigen could be considered as a ""tumor associated marker"" and together with CD38 and CD138 it may be of value for the identification of the malignant clone in minimal residual disease as it was first suggested by Spanish authors.","['Kraj, Maria', 'Poglod, Ryszard', 'Kopec-Szlezak, Joanna', 'Sokolowska, Urszula', 'Wozniak, Jolanta', 'Kruk, Barbara']","['Kraj M', 'Poglod R', 'Kopec-Szlezak J', 'Sokolowska U', 'Wozniak J', 'Kruk B']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Warsaw, Poland. mkraj@ihit.waw.pl']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (SDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Syndecan-1)', '0 (Syndecans)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/biosynthesis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Aged', 'Antigens/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Binding Sites', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism', 'Paraproteinemias/*metabolism', 'Plasma Cells/*metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis', 'Remission Induction', 'Syndecan-1', 'Syndecans', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/04/19 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['VDV2CBBX3X5R4VRE [pii]', '10.1080/10428190412331283279 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Nov;45(11):2281-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190412331283279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a systematic review of evidence from 5 randomized controlled trials involving approximately 1300 patients with CLL, comparing Fludarabine with several alkylator-based combination regimens in the primary treatment of CLL. Complete response rate was significantly higher for Fludarabine compared to alkylator-based chemotherapy (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.10-3.19, P=0.02), while overall response, though superior, did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.22, 95% CI=0.88-1.69, P=0.24). Overall survival was similar for Fludarabine and alkylator-based therapy (the pooled log hazard ratio of death, HR=-0.05, 95% CI=-0.36-0.26, P=0.75). Infection rate was significantly higher (RR 1.58, 95% CI=1.10-2.27, P=0.01), but there was no significant difference in the incidence of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia. Therefore, this meta-analysis supports the findings that Fludarabine as an induction agent for patients with CLL yields a better clinical response with acceptable toxicity when compared with alkylator-based combination therapy, but without a survival benefit by 5-6 years of follow up.","['Zhu, Q', 'Tan, D C L', 'Samuel, M', 'Chan, E S Y', 'Linn, Y C']","['Zhu Q', 'Tan DC', 'Samuel M', 'Chan ES', 'Linn YC']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai No 9 People's Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai, The People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'MEDLINE', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/04/19 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['ANX4W5T4WUY5NNX5 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190412331283260 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Nov;45(11):2239-45. doi: 10.1080/10428190412331283260.,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MDS a tendential inverse correlation between survivin and TUNEL positivity was identified (P=0.08), whereas survivin expression was independent of the proliferative rate. Survivin levels did not predict disease progression in MDS; among AML patients treated with intensive polichemotherapy, survivin expression was significantly higher in resistant cases (P=0.01).

We compared a flow cytometric assay using JC-1 with a technique using rhodamine 123 (rho123) to evaluate the P-gp function in acute leukemia. Samples from 50 acute leukemia patients were analyzed by both functional assays. The P-gp expression was assessed by an immunological flow cytometric test and the association between the P-gp status and the clinical outcome was evaluated. Of all samples, 28% showed a reversible JC-1 efflux and 36% scored positive for the rho123 assay. In two cases, the leukemic blasts showed a reversible JC-1 efflux whereas they were negative for rho123. These patients had blast cells with a very low P-gp activity. Six samples scored positive for the rho123 assay but were negative for the JC-1 test. Five of these samples did not express P-glycoprotein and were considered false positive. We found a strong correlation between the JC-1 and the rho123 test (R(s)=0.59, p<0.0001) and the JC-1 and the immunological assay (R(s)=0.29, P=0.05). There was also an association between the JC-1 status and the clinical outcome of adult patients (chi2=6.30, P=0.04). In conclusion, we recommend the JC-1 assay to study the P-gp activity in acute leukemia because it is more specific and less labor intensive than conventional functional flow cytometric tests using rhodamine 123. In addition, the JC-1 assay can be used to identify adult patients with an increased risk for adverse clinical outcome.","['Swerts, Katrien', 'de Moerloose, Barbara', 'Dhooge, Catharina', 'Noens, Lucien', 'Laureys, Genevieve', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Philippe, Jan']","['Swerts K', 'de Moerloose B', 'Dhooge C', 'Noens L', 'Laureys G', 'Benoit Y', 'Philippe J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

Eighty-one patients with leukemia were randomized to receive either 500 mg or 1,000 mg of valacyclovir orally every 8 h and followed clinically, as well as with serial surveillance cultures. Over a total of 1,979 days on study between the groups, and 380 throat cultures, no documented episodes of herpes simplex reactivation were noted.

Conventional wisdom suggests that elimination of the Philadelphia (Ph)- positive cells will lead to re-establishment of normal Ph-negative hematopoiesis. Surprisingly, karyotypic abnormalities were detected in the chromosome negative cells of some patients with cytogenetic response to imatinib. In some cases, this was associated with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). While clonal evolution in Ph-positive cells is considered part of the progression of CML, clonal evolution in Ph-negative cells had been observed only rarely in a small number of patients treated with IFN or bone marrow transplantation, raising the question whether the phenomenon may be causally linked to imatinib therapy. In this manuscript, we will review the currently available data, suggest possible causes and discuss potential implications for patient management. We are fully aware that a systematic study of a larger patient cohort will be required to conclusively address these issues.","['Loriaux, Marc', 'Deininger, Michael']","['Loriaux M', 'Deininger M']","['Department of Pathology and the Division of Hematology and Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA. loriauxm@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/04/19 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['P0VQA77KAWHQ7RJ4 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190410001723278 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Nov;45(11):2197-203. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001723278.,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans-retinoic acid is a potent agent for the treatment of this fatal subtype of AML, and is particularly effective when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The important biological activities of all-trans-retinoic acid in vitro and in vivo have provoked extensive studies over the years, aimed to define the mechanisms by which it induces its antileukemic effects. It is now well established that all-trans-retinoic acid when administered at pharmacological doses can reverse the dominant-negative effects that the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein exhibits on the functions of the wild type PML and RARalpha proteins. All-trans-retinoic acid induces gene transcription via retinoic acid responsive elements (RARE) that are present in the promoters of retinoid-responsive genes that ultimately result in the production of protein products that regulate leukemic cell differentiation and induce cell-cycle arrest. There is now accumulating evidence that additional signalling pathways are activated during all-trans-retinoic acid-treatment of cells, involving Stat-proteins, tyrosine kinases and mitogen-activated protein (Map) kinases.

The purpose of this study was to (1) determine the frequency of ERBB2 amplification (in comparison to other proto-oncogenes) in tumors from patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, (2) characterize structural details of an ERBB2 amplicon in the esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE19 (contains a 100-fold ERBB2 amplification), and (3) test whether growth of the OE19 cell line is sensitive to the ERBB2 inhibitor trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genetech, Inc, San Francisco, CA). METHODS: First, we determined the frequency, by Southern blotting techniques, of amplification of ERBB2 and 13 other proto-oncogenes in a panel of 25 esophageal adenocarcinoma tumors. Then, in a second panel of 10 tumor specimens, expression levels of the ERBB2 gene and of several other genes that flank ERBB2 on chromosome 17 were determined by microarray analysis. Next we characterized the ERBB2 amplicon in the esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE19 using cytogenetic methods and a Rec-A protein assisted restriction endonuclease mapping technique. Finally, an in vitro growth inhibition assay was used to measure the sensitivity of OE19 and OE33 cells to treatment with trastuzumab (humanized antibody to ERBB2). RESULTS: ERBB2 was the most frequently amplified proto-oncogene among 25 esophageal adenocarcinoma tumors tested (greater than 10-fold amplification in 3 of 25 (12%) tumors tested). The OE19 cell line contains a 100-fold amplification of the ERBB2 gene, and highly expresses its messenger ribonucleic acid. Transcripts from genes that flank ERBB2 including GRB7, a protein linked to metastasis in esophageal cancer, also showed high levels of expression. In OE19 cells, the ERBB2 amplicon was localized to a homogeneously staining region of chromosome 14. Southern blots from the Rec-A protein assisted restriction endonuclease cleavage mapping experiments in OE19 showed a strong band of 210 kilobases in size, demonstrating that the main amplicon was a tandem repeat. In the in vitro growth inhibition assay, trastuzumab inhibited the OE19 and OE33 cells growth by 49% and 20%, respectively, at a saturating concentration of 20 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: ERBB2 is the most frequently amplified proto-oncogene in esophageal adenocarcinoma among the genes that we tested. In the OE19 esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line, the ERBB2 amplicon is translocated onto chromosome 14, is amplified 100-fold at the deoxyribonucleic acid level, and is highly overexpressed at the messenger ribonucleic acid level. Finally, the growth of this cell line was inhibited by incubation with trastuzumab. These results demonstrate that a substantial number of esophageal adenocarcinomas have amplified copies of the ERBB2 gene, and that they may be responsive to ERBB2 targeted therapies such as trastuzumab.","['Dahlberg, Peter S', 'Jacobson, Blake A', 'Dahal, Ganesh', 'Fink, James M', 'Kratzke, Robert A', 'Maddaus, Michael A', 'Ferrin, Lance J']","['Dahlberg PS', 'Jacobson BA', 'Dahal G', 'Fink JM', 'Kratzke RA', 'Maddaus MA', 'Ferrin LJ']","['Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. dahlb002@umn.edu']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Ann Thorac Surg,The Annals of thoracic surgery,15030100R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Computer Systems', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, erbB-2', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stomach Neoplasms/pathology', 'Trastuzumab']",2004/10/30 09:00,2005/02/05 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003497504011798 [pii]', '10.1016/j.athoracsur.2004.05.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Thorac Surg. 2004 Nov;78(5):1790-800. doi: 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2004.05.037.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other sources of evidence, particularly from studies of other groups of test participants, are also considered. It was concluded that overall levels of mortality and cancer incidence in UK nuclear weapons test participants were similar to those in a matched control group, and overall mortality was lower than expected from national rates. There was no evidence of an increased raised risk of multiple myeloma among test participants in recent years, and the suggestion in the first analysis of this cohort of a raised myeloma risk relative to controls is likely to have been a chance finding. There was some evidence of a raised risk of leukaemia other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia among test participants relative to controls, particularly in the early years after the tests.

The best treatment of this complication is still a matter of debate due to the very high risk of hemorrhage in this group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From December 2000 to December 2002 four Caucasian patients with acute leukemia developed VTE complications. The patients were three men and one woman, mean age 55.7 years (range, 27-77). Two patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (L1 and L2 according to the FAB classification) developed deep venous thrombosis during the administration of chemotherapy; one patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, M2 according to the FAB classification) had pulmonary thromboembolism at diagnosis, while another AML patient (M4 according to FAB) showed deep venous thrombosis as the first symptom of leukemia. The clinical diagnosis of symptomatic VTE was confirmed by objective imaging procedures including lower limb venous color Doppler imaging in all cases and a ventilation-perfusion lung scan in one case. All patients were treated with enoxaparin 100 IU/kg subcutaneously twice daily for one month, followed by 150 IU/kg once daily for at least five months. When the platelet count was below 20,000 x 10(9)/L, the dose was reduced by 50%. RESULTS: During antithrombotic treatment neither VTE recurrences nor hemorrhagic complications or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia occurred. The platelet count at the beginning of enoxaparin treatment was very low (mean, 55,750 x 109/L; range, 12,000-121,000 x 10(9)/L) and treatment did not affect platelet recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Enoxaparin proved to be efficacious and safe in the management of deep venous thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism in patients affected by acute leukemia. Enoxaparin cured acute venous thrombosis, prevented recurrences and did not cause any hemorrhagic complications despite prolonged severe thrombocytopenia.","['Imberti, Davide', 'Vallisa, Daniele', 'Anselmi, Elisa', 'Moroni, Carlo Filippo', 'Berte, Raffaella', 'Lazzaro, Antonio', 'Bernuzzi, Patrizia', 'Arcari, Anna Lisa', 'Cavanna, Luigi']","['Imberti D', 'Vallisa D', 'Anselmi E', 'Moroni CF', 'Berte R', 'Lazzaro A', 'Bernuzzi P', 'Arcari AL', 'Cavanna L']","['Third Internal Medicine Unit and Medical Oncology and Haematology, Civic Hospital, Piacenza, Italy. d.imberti@ausl.pc.it']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Enoxaparin)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Enoxaparin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Thromboembolism/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Venous Thrombosis/complications/*drug therapy']",2004/10/30 09:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/10/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2004 Jul-Aug;90(4):390-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from his HLA-identical, HTLV-I antibody-negative sibling donor in June 2002.

Cyclosporine A and a short course of methotrexate were given as prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Engraftment was achieved on day 16, while ATL cells were detected in the peripheral blood throughout the transplantation. ATL cells were also detected in bone marrow on day 20.

Several other viral and cellular proteins are present in the PIC, but their functional roles are less well established. Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is a cellular protein component of the PIC that blocks autointegration of the viral DNA and stimulates intermolecular integration. In uninfected cells, BAF interacts with members of the LEM family of inner nuclear membrane and nucleoplasmic proteins. Here, we demonstrate that one of the LEM proteins, lamina-associated polypeptide 2alpha (LAP2alpha), is a component of the PIC. LAP2alpha stabilizes the association of BAF with the PIC to stimulate intermolecular integration and suppress autointegration.

Growth-inhibiting cytokines, the Fas/FasLigand pathway, and autoreactive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes have been identified to be important proapoptotic factors in MDS. In normal hematopoiesis, alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1 integrin-mediated interactions between progenitors and fibronectin are critical for progenitor cell survival. In this study, we have used flow cytometry to quantify the expression levels of members of the beta1 integrin family on CD34(+) marrow progenitors in 27 untreated patients with MDS, three with s-AML, and 25 control subjects. In MDS, we observed that nonapoptotic progenitors significantly downregulate cell surface expression levels of alpha4 and beta1 integrin chains compared with healthy controls. Downregulation of alpha4, beta1, and also alpha5 was present in MDS patients with > or =25% apoptotic progenitors, irrespective of their French, American, British subcategory. Reduced cell surface expression levels of alpha4, alpha5, and beta1 did also correlate with decreased in vitro adhesiveness to fibronectin fragments. Therefore, our observations suggest that downregulation of alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1 integrins on CD34(+) progenitors could be a newly identified proapoptotic mechanism in MDS.","['Delforge, M', 'Raets, V', 'Van Duppen, V', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Boogaerts, M']","['Delforge M', 'Raets V', 'Van Duppen V', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Boogaerts M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium. michel.delforge@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*metabolism', 'Integrin alpha5beta1/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2004/10/29 09:00,2005/04/02 09:00,['2004/10/29 09:00'],"['2004/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403551 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403551 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jan;19(1):57-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403551.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using microarray analysis, we investigated global changes in gene expression after 5-Aza-CdR treatment in AML. In the AML cell line OCI-AML2, Aza-CdR induced the expression of 81 out of 22 000 genes; 96 genes were downregulated (> or =2-fold change in expression). RT-PCR analysis of 10 randomly selected genes confirmed the changes of expression in AML cells. Similar results were obtained with primary AML and MDS cells after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR ex vivo and in vivo, respectively. In contrast, significantly fewer changes in gene expression and cytotoxicity were detected in normal peripheral blood mononuclear and bone marrow cells or transformed epithelial cells treated with 5-Aza-CdR. Interestingly, only 50.6% of the induced genes contain putative CpG islands in the 5' region. To further investigate the significance of promoter methylation in the induced genes, we analyzed the actual methylation status of randomly selected 5-Aza-CdR-inducible genes. We detected hypermethylation exclusively in the 5' region of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene. DNA methylation inversely correlated with MPO expression in newly diagnosed untreated AML patients (P< or =0.004). In contrast, all other analyzed 5-Aza-CdR-inducible genes revealed no CpG methylation in the promoter region, suggesting a methylation-independent effect of 5-Aza-CdR.","['Schmelz, K', 'Sattler, N', 'Wagner, M', 'Lubbert, M', 'Dorken, B', 'Tamm, I']","['Schmelz K', 'Sattler N', 'Wagner M', 'Lubbert M', 'Dorken B', 'Tamm I']","['Charite, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Virchow-Clinic, Internal Medicine, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Decitabine', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/10/29 09:00,2005/04/02 09:00,['2004/10/29 09:00'],"['2004/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403552 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403552 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jan;19(1):103-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403552.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anagrelide's efficacy was well established during a phase II study of more than 400 patients with one of the four myeloproliferative disorders: essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia, idiopathic myelofibrosis, and CML. In the last subgroup, there were 114 CML patients with significant thrombocytosis treated with anagrelide. Out of these patients, 38 had symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage and had thrombocytosis resistant to HU. They were then treated with anagrelide at an initial dose of 2.0 mg/day, followed by modifications based upon response and toxicity. In all, 71% of these patients responded with platelet reductions of more than 50% in a median time of approximately 4 weeks. The response rate was not influenced by age, gender, or prior thrombosis or hemorrhage. Importantly, the response rate to anagrelide in patients refractory to prior HU was essentially the same as that of the other 76 CML patients. Treatment with anagrelide was well tolerated and without undue toxicity.

Due to the subtle appearance of this chromosome rearrangement, both initial detection and minimal residual disease (MRD) tracking by conventional karyotyping can be difficult. Unfortunately, no commercial or previously published fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) strategies exist for this recurrent anomaly. We have developed a highly sensitive assay using dual-color, double-fusion FISH (D-FISH), which can be used both for initial detection and MRD monitoring. We analyzed archived bone marrow samples from 15 patients with a previously identified t(6;9)(p23;q34) and 10 corresponding post-treatment samples. The results demonstrate that our D-FISH method effectively identified all abnormal samples, including a low-level MRD sample that was considered to be normal by conventional cytogenetic analysis. Normal value ranges were established from 30 negative controls to be < 0.6% when 500 interphase nuclei were analyzed. The development of this sensitive D-FISH strategy for the detection of the t(6;9)(p23;q34) adds to the AML FISH testing repertoire, and is effective in the detection of low-level disease in post-treatment samples in these patients.","['Shearer, B M', 'Knudson, R A', 'Flynn, H C', 'Ketterling, R P']","['Shearer BM', 'Knudson RA', 'Flynn HC', 'Ketterling RP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DEK-CAN fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2004/10/29 09:00,2005/04/02 09:00,['2004/10/29 09:00'],"['2004/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403557 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403557 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jan;19(1):126-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403557.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the known plasma membrane transporters, we have previously observed a significant correlation between fludarabine uptake via ENT carriers and ex vivo sensitivity of CLL cells to fludarabine, although mRNA amounts of the equilibrative nucleoside transporters hENT1 and hENT2 do not show any predictive response to treatment. In this study, using polyclonal monospecific antibodies we have observed a significant correlation between the expression of hENT2 by Western blot and fludarabine uptake via hENT carriers and also with ex vivo sensitivity of CLL cells to fludarabine.

In this study, a gene-enhanced tissue-engineering approach was used to assess bone regenerative capacity of Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-transduced gingival fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and fat-derived cells delivered to rabbit cranial bone defects in an alginate/collagen matrix. Human Shh cDNA isolated from fetal lung tissue was cloned into the replication-incompetent retroviral expression vector LNCX, in which the murine leukemia virus retroviral LTR drives expression of the neomycin-resistance gene. The rat beta-actin enhancer/promoter complex was engineered to drive expression of Shh. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the transduced primary rabbit cell populations expressed Shh RNA. Shh protein secretion was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Alginate/ type I collagen constructs containing 2 x 10(6) Shh-transduced cells were introduced into male New Zealand White rabbit calvarial defects (8 mm). A total of eight groups (N=6) were examined: unrestored empty defects, matrix alone, matrix plus the three cell populations transduced with both control and Shh expression vectors. The bone regenerative capacity of Shh gene enhanced cells was assessed grossly, radiographically and histologically at 6 and 12 weeks postimplantation. After 6 weeks, new full thickness bone was seen emanating directly from the alginate/collagen matrix in the Shh-transduced groups. Quantitative two-dimensional digital analysis of histological sections confirmed statistically significant (P<0.05) amounts of bone regeneration in all three Shh-enhanced groups compared to controls. Necropsy failed to demonstrate any evidence of treatment-related side effects. This is the first study to demonstrate that Shh delivery to bone defects, in this case through a novel gene-enhanced tissue-engineering approach, results in significant bone regeneration. This encourages further development of the Shh gene-enhanced tissue-engineering approach for bone regeneration.","['Edwards, P C', 'Ruggiero, S', 'Fantasia, J', 'Burakoff, R', 'Moorji, S M', 'Paric, E', 'Razzano, P', 'Grande, D A', 'Mason, J M']","['Edwards PC', 'Ruggiero S', 'Fantasia J', 'Burakoff R', 'Moorji SM', 'Paric E', 'Razzano P', 'Grande DA', 'Mason JM']","['Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Department of Dental Medicine, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,['R41 DE-015430/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (SHH protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', '*Bone Regeneration', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Gingiva', 'Hedgehog Proteins', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Engineering/methods', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods']",2004/10/29 09:00,2005/03/15 09:00,['2004/10/29 09:00'],"['2004/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['3302386 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.gt.3302386 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2005 Jan;12(1):75-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3302386.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, the role of ETO in normal physiology has remained obscure. Here we show that ETO is highly expressed in preadipocytes and acts as an inhibitor of C/EBPbeta during early adipogenesis, contributing to its characteristically delayed activation. ETO prevents both the transcriptional activation of the C/EBPalpha promoter by C/EBPbeta and its concurrent accumulation in centromeric sites during early adipogenesis.

In yeast, ESCRT-I is composed of three proteins, VSP23, VPS28, and VPS37, whereas in mammals only Tsg101(VPS23) and VPS28 were originally identified as ESCRT-I components. Using yeast two-hybrid screens, we identified one of a family of human proteins (VPS37C) as a Tsg101-binding protein. VPS37C can form a ternary complex with Tsg101 and VPS28 by binding to a domain situated toward the carboxyl terminus of Tsg101 and binds to another class E VPS factor, namely Hrs. In addition, VPS37C is recruited to aberrant endosomes induced by overexpression of Tsg101, Hrs, or dominant negative form of the class E VPS ATPase, VPS4. Enveloped viruses that encode PTAP motifs to facilitate budding exploit ESCRT-I as an interface with the class E VPS pathway, and accordingly, VPS37C is recruited to the plasma membrane along with Tsg101 by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) Gag. Moreover, direct fusion of VPS37C to HIV-1 Gag obviates the requirement for a PTAP motif to induce virion release. Depletion of VPS37C from cells does not inhibit murine leukemia virus budding, which is not mediated by ESCRT-I, however, if murine leukemia virus budding is engineered to be ESCRT-I-dependent, then it is inhibited by VPS37C depletion, and this inhibition is accentuated if VPS37B is simultaneously depleted. Thus, this study identifies VPS37C as a functional component of mammalian ESCRT-I.","['Eastman, Scott W', 'Martin-Serrano, Juan', 'Chung, Wayne', 'Zang, Trinity', 'Bieniasz, Paul D']","['Eastman SW', 'Martin-Serrano J', 'Chung W', 'Zang T', 'Bieniasz PD']","['Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and the Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],,['R01-AI052774/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041027,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)', '0 (VPS37C protein, human)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Vesicles/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'HIV Infections/metabolism/virology', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2004/10/29 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2004/10/29 09:00'],"['2004/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)76629-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M410384200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Jan 7;280(1):628-36. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M410384200.

The activated glucocorticoid receptor initiates a transcriptional program leading to caspase activation and cell death, but the critical signaling intermediates in GC-induced apoptosis remain largely undefined. We have observed that GC induction of the three major protein products of the Bcl-2 relative Bim (BimEL, BimS, and BimL) correlates with GC sensitivity in a panel of human precursor B-cell (pre-B) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines. To test the hypothesis that Bim facilitates GC-induced apoptosis, we reduced BIM mRNA levels and Bim protein levels by RNA interference in highly GC-sensitive pre-B ALL cells. Reducing Bim proteins by either electroporation of synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes or lentivirus-mediated stable expression of short hairpin RNA inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and increased cell viability following GC exposure. We also observed that the extent of GC resistance correlated with siRNA silencing potency. siRNA duplexes that reduced only BimEL or BimEL and BimL (but not BimS) exhibited less GC resistance than a potent siRNA that silenced all three major isoforms, implying that induction of all three Bim proteins contributes to cell death. Finally, the modulation of GC-induced apoptosis caused by Bim silencing was independent of Bcl-2 expression levels, negating the hypothesis that the ratio of Bim to Bcl-2 regulates apoptosis. These results offer evidence that the induction of Bim by GC is a required event for the complete apoptotic response in pre-B ALL cells.","['Abrams, Marc T', 'Robertson, Noreen M', 'Yoon, Kyonggeun', 'Wickstrom, Eric']","['Abrams MT', 'Robertson NM', 'Yoon K', 'Wickstrom E']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Thomas Jefferson University, 233 S. 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20041027,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism', '*Alternative Splicing', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electroporation', 'Glucocorticoids/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lentivirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2004/10/29 09:00,2005/02/26 09:00,['2004/10/29 09:00'],"['2004/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(18)66351-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M411767200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Dec 31;279(53):55809-17. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M411767200.

MATERIAL/METHODS: PDT was based on the 5-aminolevulinic acid treatment of K562 cells, followed by blue light irradiation under conditions which in HL-60 cells induce an apoptotic process without previous terminal maturation. Nuclei and nucleoli were visualized by cytochemical procedures to demonstrate DNA, RNA and silver stained proteins of nucleolus organizer regions (AgNORs). TUNEL and propidium iodide assays were used for additional control of the incidence of apoptotic and necrotic cells. RESULTS: In contrast to HL-60 cells, PDT did not induce apoptosis in K562 cells. However, after PDT some K562 cells exhibited major alterations, expressed by nuclear and cell swelling, reflecting a necrotic process, confirmed by propidium iodide. In addition, PDT produced a reduction of AgNORs, though smaller than that previously described in apoptotic HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: PDT produced only necrotic changes in some K562 cells under conditions which induced in apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Thus the induction of apoptosis, nuclear and nucleolar changes in individual cells does not depend on the inducer--PDT--but on the cell properties.","['Smetana, Karel', 'Pluskalova, Michaela', 'Marinov, Yuri', 'Hrkal, Zbynek']","['Smetana K', 'Pluskalova M', 'Marinov Y', 'Hrkal Z']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. karel.smetana@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041026,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)']",IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Nucleolus/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Necrosis', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects']",2004/10/28 09:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/10/28 09:00'],"['2003/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['4139 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2004 Nov;10(11):BR405-9.

Murine cells lack HIV-1 receptor molecules, do not support efficient viral gene expression, and lack factors necessary for the assembly and release of virions. Many of these blocks have been described using mouse fibroblast cell lines. Here we identify a postentry block to HIV-1 infection in mouse T-cell lines that has not been detected in mouse fibroblasts. While murine fibroblastic lines are comparable to human T-cell lines in permissivity to HIV-1 transduction, infection of murine T cells is 100-fold less efficient. Virus entry occurs efficiently in murine T cells. However, reduced efficiency of the completion of reverse transcription and nuclear transfer of the viral preintegration complex are observed. Although this block has similarities to the restriction of murine retroviruses by Fv1, there is no correlation of HIV-1 susceptibility with cellular Fv1 genotypes. In addition, the block to HIV-1 infection in murine T-cell lines cannot be saturated by a high virus dose.

It is highly basic and contains one or two zinc fingers. Mutations in either the basic residues or the zinc fingers can affect several events of the virus life cycle. They frequently prevent the specific packaging of the viral RNA, affect reverse transcription, and impair virion assembly. In this work, we explore the role of NC in murine leukemia virus (MLV) particle assembly and release. A panel of NC mutants, including mutants of the zinc finger and of a basic region, as well as truncations of the NC domain of Gag, were studied. Several of these mutations dramatically reduce the release of virus particles. A mutant completely lacking the NC domain is apparently incapable of assembling into particles, although its Gag protein is still targeted to the plasma membrane. By electron microscopy on thin sections of virus-producing cells, we observed that some NC mutants exhibit various stages of budding defects at the plasma membrane and have aberrant particle morphology; electron micrographs of cells expressing some of these mutants are strikingly similar to those of cells expressing ""late-domain"" mutants. However, the defects of NC mutants with respect to virus release and infectivity could be complemented by an MLV lacking the p12 domain. Therefore, the functions of NC in virus budding and infectivity are completely distinct from viral late-domain function.","['Muriaux, Delphine', 'Costes, Sylvain', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'Mirro, Jane', 'Cho, Ed', 'Lockett, Stephen', 'Rein, Alan']","['Muriaux D', 'Costes S', 'Nagashima K', 'Mirro J', 'Cho E', 'Lockett S', 'Rein A']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, P.O.

This cytopathicity resembles that of Spl574 MLV, a novel variant recently isolated from the spleen of a Mus spicilegus mouse neonatally inoculated with Moloney MLV. F-S MLV is an N-tropic Friend MLV that also has the unusual ability to infect hamster cells, which are normally resistant to mouse ecotropic MLVs. Syncytium induction by both F-S MLV and Spl574 is accompanied by the accumulation of large amounts of unintegrated viral DNA, a hallmark of pathogenic retroviruses, but not previously reported for mouse ecotropic gammaretroviruses. Sequencing and site-specific mutagenesis determined that the syncytium-inducing phenotype of F-S MLV can be attributed to a single amino acid substitution (S84A) in the VRA region of the viral env gene. This site corresponds to that of the single substitution previously shown to be responsible for the cytopathicity of Spl574, S82F. The S84A substitution in F-S MLV also contributes to the ability of this virus to infect hamster cells, but Spl574 MLV is unable to infect hamster cells. Because this serine residue is one of the critical amino acids that form the CAT-1 receptor binding site, and because M. dunni and hamster cells have variant CAT-1 receptors, these results suggest that syncytium formation as well as altered host range may be a consequence of altered interaction between virus and receptor.","['Jung, Yong Tae', 'Wu, Tiyun', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Jung YT', 'Wu T', 'Kozak CA']","['Labotratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/NIH, Bldg. 4, Room 329, 4 Center Drive, MSC 0460, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],"['GENBANK/AY563028', 'GENBANK/AY563029']",,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Genes, env', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'NIH 3T3 Cells']",2004/10/28 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/28 09:00'],"['2004/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['78/22/12189 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.78.22.12189-12197.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Nov;78(22):12189-97. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.22.12189-12197.2004.,,,,PMC525060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been assumed, but not tested, that copackaging results from random RNA associations in the cytoplasm to yield encapsidated RNA homodimers and heterodimers in Hardy-Weinberg proportions. Here, virion RNA homo- and heterodimerization were examined for Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) using nondenaturing Northern blotting and a novel RNA dimer capture assay. The results demonstrated that coexpressed MLV RNAs preferentially self-associated, even when RNAs were identical in known packaging and dimerization sequences or when they differed overall by less than 0.1%. In contrast, HIV-1 RNAs formed homo- and heterodimers in random proportions. We speculate that these species-specific differences in RNA dimer partner selection may at least partially explain the higher frequency of genetic recombination observed for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 than for MLV.","['Flynn, Jessica A', 'An, Wenfeng', 'King, Steven R', 'Telesnitsky, Alice']","['Flynn JA', 'An W', 'King SR', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, 1150 W.

Recently, a nonnucleosidic small molecule inhibitor, BIBR1532 (2-[(E)-3-naphtalen-2-yl-but-2-enoylamino]-benzoic acid), has been identified that is highly selective for inhibition of telomerase, resulting in delayed growth arrest of tumor cells. Here we examined the effects of BIBR1532 in different leukemia cell lines as well as in primary cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in short-term culture assays. We observed a dose-dependent direct cytotoxicity in concentrations ranging from 30 to 80 microM. Interestingly, cell death was not dependent on the catalytic activity of telomerase but was delayed in cells with very long telomeres. We observed time-dependent individual telomere erosion, which was associated with loss of telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) and increased phosphorylation of p53. Importantly, the proliferative capacity of normal CD34(+) cells from cord blood and leukapheresis samples was not affected by treatment with BIBR1532. We conclude that using this class of telomerase inhibitor at higher concentrations exerts a direct cytotoxic effect on malignant cells of the hematopoietic system, which appears to derive from direct damage of the structure of individual telomeres and must be dissected from telomerase-suppressed overall telomere shortening.","['El-Daly, Hesham', 'Kull, Miriam', 'Zimmermann, Stefan', 'Pantic, Milena', 'Waller, Cornelius F', 'Martens, Uwe M']","['El-Daly H', 'Kull M', 'Zimmermann S', 'Pantic M', 'Waller CF', 'Martens UM']","['Freiburg University Medical Center, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hugstetterstr 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041026,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aminobenzoates)', '0 (BIBR 1532)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aminobenzoates/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diploidy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/toxicity', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Growth Inhibitors/toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology', 'Naphthalenes/*toxicity', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Telomere/*drug effects/enzymology/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",2004/10/28 09:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/10/28 09:00'],"['2004/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45903-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2003-12-4322 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 15;105(4):1742-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4322.

Monomethylated and in particular, dimethylated H3K9 are present to variable degrees in the granulocytes of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients, without being accompanied by HP1 proteins. In patients with an acute phase of CML and in acute myeloid leukemia patients, strong methylation of H3K9 and all isoforms of HP1 are detected. In chronic forms of CML, no strong correlations among the level of histone methylation, disease progression, and modality of treatment were observed. Histone methylation was found even in ""cured"" patients without Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) resulting from +(9;22)(q34;q11) BCR/ABL translocation, suggesting an incomplete process of developmentally regulated chromatin remodeling in the granulocytes of these patients. Similarly, reprogramming of leukemia HL-60 cells to terminal differentiation by retinoic acid does not eliminate H3K9 methylation and the presence of HP1 isoforms from differentiated granulocytes. Thus, our study shows for the first time that histone H3 methylation may be changed dramatically during normal cell differentiation. The residual histone H3 methylation in myeloid leukemia cells suggests an incomplete chromatin condensation that may be linked to the leukemia cell proliferation and may be important for the prognosis of disease treatment and relapse.","['Lukasova, Emilie', 'Koristek, Zdenek', 'Falk, Martin', 'Kozubek, Stanislav', 'Grigoryev, Sergei', 'Kozubek, Michal', 'Ondrej, Vladan', 'Kroupova, Iva']","['Lukasova E', 'Koristek Z', 'Falk M', 'Kozubek S', 'Grigoryev S', 'Kozubek M', 'Ondrej V', 'Kroupova I']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041026,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CBX5 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Disease Progression', 'Granulocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', '*Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2004/10/28 09:00,2005/03/09 09:00,['2004/10/28 09:00'],"['2004/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0704388 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0704388 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2005 Jan;77(1):100-11. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0704388.

E2A is also involved in a chromosomal translocation that leads to the expression of an oncogenic transcription factor called E2A-PBX1 in cases of acute leukemia. In the work described here, we elucidate the interaction between E2A-PBX1 and transcriptional co-activators. We confirm that the E2A portion can interact with CBP and PCAF and map required elements on E2A and CBP. On CBP, the interaction involves the KIX domain, a well characterized domain that mediates interactions with several other oncogenic transcription factors. On E2A, the interaction with CBP requires conserved alpha-helical domains that reside within activation domains 1 and 2 (AD1 and AD2, respectively). Using purified, recombinant proteins, we show that the E2A-CBP interaction is direct. Notwithstanding the previously demonstrated ability of AD1 and AD2 to function independently, some of our findings suggest functional cooperativity between these two domains. Finally, we show that the CBP/p300-interactive helical domains of E2A are important in the induction of proliferation in cultured primary bone marrow cells retrovirally transduced with E2A-PBX1.

Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice.

FeLV-945 is a viral variant identified as predominant in a cohort of naturally infected animals. FeLV-945 contains a unique sequence motif in the long terminal repeat (LTR) comprised of a single copy of transcriptional enhancer followed by a 21-bp sequence triplicated in tandem. The LTR is precisely conserved among independent cases of multicentric lymphoma, myeloproliferative disease and anemia in animals from the cohort. The 21-bp triplication was previously shown to act as a transcriptional enhancer preferentially in hematopoietic cells and to confer a replicative advantage. The objective of the present study was to examine the molecular mechanism by which the 21-bp triplication exerts its influence and the selective advantage responsible for its precise conservation. RESULTS: Potential binding sites for the transcription factor, c-Myb, were identified across the repeat junctions of the 21-bp triplication. Such sites would not occur in the absence of the repeat; thus, a requirement for c-Myb binding to the repeat junctions of the triplication would exert a selective pressure to conserve its sequence precisely. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated specific binding of c-Myb to the 21-bp triplication. Reporter gene assays showed that the triplication-containing LTR is responsive to c-Myb, and that responsiveness requires the presence of both c-Myb binding sites. Results further indicated that c-Myb in complex with the 21-bp triplication recruits the transcriptional co-activator, CBP, a regulator of normal hematopoiesis. FeLV-945 replication was shown to be positively regulated by CBP in a manner dependent on the presence of the 21-bp triplication. CONCLUSION: Binding sites for c-Myb across the repeat junctions of the 21-bp triplication may account for its precise conservation in the FeLV-945 LTR. c-Myb binding and CBP recruitment to the LTR positively regulated virus production, and thus may be responsible for the replicative advantage conferred by the 21-bp triplication. Considering that CBP is present in hematopoietic cells in limiting amounts, we hypothesize that FeLV-945 replication in bone marrow may influence CBP availability and thereby alter the regulation of CBP-responsive genes, thus contributing to altered hematopoiesis and consequent hematologic disease.","['Finstad, Samantha L', 'Prabhu, Sudha', 'Rulli, Karen R', 'Levy, Laura S']","['Finstad SL', 'Prabhu S', 'Rulli KR', 'Levy LS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology and Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. sfinsta1@tulane.edu']",['eng'],,"['R01 CA083823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20040903,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Cats', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Virus Replication']",2004/10/28 09:00,2006/12/27 09:00,['2004/10/28 09:00'],"['2004/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1743-422X-1-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-1-3 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2004 Sep 3;1:3. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-1-3.,,,,PMC524034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic study identified the point mutations of 3BP2 gene in human-inherited disease cherubism. The multiple cysts in cherubism lesion of jaw bones are filled with the activated osteoclasts and stromal cells, including mast cells. By over-expression study using rat basophilic leukaemia RBL-2H3 mast cells, we have analysed the effect of the point mutations on the function of 3BP2 protein, which plays a positive regulatory role on FcepsilonRI-mediated mast cell activation. Over-expression of 3BP2 mutants suppressed the antigen-induced degranulation and cytokine gene transcription. Antigen-induced phosphorylation of Vav1, activation of Rac1, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB kinase (IKK) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) were all impaired in the cells over-expressing the cherubism mutants of 3BP2. Furthermore, cherubism mutations of 3BP2 may abrogate the binding ability to interact with chaperone protein 14-3-3. These results demonstrate that over-expression of the mutant form of 3BP2 inhibits the antigen-induced mast cell activation. It suggests that point mutations of 3BP2 gene cause the dysfunction of 3BP2 in vivo.","['Miah, S M Shahjahan', 'Hatani, Tomoko', 'Qu, Xiujuan', 'Yamamura, Hirohei', 'Sada, Kiyonao']","['Miah SM', 'Hatani T', 'Qu X', 'Yamamura H', 'Sada K']","['Division of Proteomics, Department of Genome Sciences, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe 650-0017, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (SH3BP2 protein, human)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '0 (Vav1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cherubism/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'Rats', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2004/10/28 09:00,2005/04/12 09:00,['2004/10/28 09:00'],"['2004/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['GTC784 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2443.2004.00784.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2004 Nov;9(11):993-1004. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2004.00784.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We have developed a semiautomated analysis method for laser scanning cytometry (LSC) termed ""multiple thresholding,"" which is suitable for archived or fresh biopsy material of human lymph nodes and tonsils. Sections are stained with PI for nuclear DNA and up to four antigens using direct and indirect immunofluorescence (argon laser, Ar) or on specific cell labeling. Due to the heterogeneity of cell density, measurements are performed repeatedly at different threshold levels (low threshold: regions of low cellular density, germinal center; high threshold: dense regions, mantle zone). Data are acquired by single-(Ar) or dual-laser excitation (Ar-HeNe) in order to analyze single-(FITC) up to fourcolor (FITC/PE/PECy5/APC) stained specimen. RESULTS: Percentage and cellular density of cell-subsets is quantified in different microanatomical regions of the specimen. These data were highly correlated with manual scoring a identical specimens (r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.0001). With LSC, semiautomated operator-independent immunophenotyping in tissue sections of lymphatic organs with up to three antibodies simultaneously is possible. CONCLUSIONS: We expect this tissue cytometric approach to yield new insight into processes during diseases and help to quantify the success of therapeutic interventions.","['Gerster, Andreas O H', 'Trumpfheller, Christine', 'Racz, Paul', 'Osmancik, Pavel', 'Tenner-Racz, Klara', 'Tarnok, Attila']","['Gerster AO', 'Trumpfheller C', 'Racz P', 'Osmancik P', 'Tenner-Racz K', 'Tarnok A']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology/Surgery, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Corrected and Republished Article', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Most strategies to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease target all T cells regardless of their specificity, and this leads to prolonged posttransplantation immunodeficiency. Selective depletion of alloreactive T cells could spare protective immunity and facilitate engraftment and graft-versus-leukemia effects. Recently described depletion strategies target activation markers such as CD25 that are expressed by alloreactive T cells. However, incomplete depletion may occur when a single surface epitope or pathway of apoptosis is targeted that may not be fully and concurrently expressed among all alloreactive cells. We now report on a novel strategy effective in both cord blood and peripheral blood stem cell alloreactive T cells that simultaneously induces 2 independent pathways of apoptosis after stimulation by recipient dendritic cells or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells. First, we demonstrate that the folate antagonist trimetrexate selectively depletes proliferating alloreactive precursors in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Similarly, a second agent, denileukin diftitox, kills activated alloreactive T cells expressing CD25. Most importantly, these 2 agents can exert their effects in concert with superior efficacy while sparing resting bystander T cells, which remain available to mount antimicrobial or third-party responses.","['Szabolcs, Paul', 'Park, Kyung-Duk', 'Marti, Luciana', 'Deoliveria, Divinomar', 'Lee, Young-Ah', 'Colvin, Michael O', 'Kurzberg, Joanne']","['Szabolcs P', 'Park KD', 'Marti L', 'Deoliveria D', 'Lee YA', 'Colvin MO', 'Kurzberg J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Program, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. szabo001@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],,"['1PO1-HL-67314-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-67141/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '25E79B5CTM (denileukin diftitox)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*pharmacology', '*Fetal Blood/cytology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Trimetrexate/*pharmacology']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/04/01 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879104003969 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2004 Nov;10(11):772-83. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.07.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GVL effect occurred significantly earlier than GVHD, being that 19 of 23 patients had a sustained GVL response that antedated the onset of clinical GVHD. The median difference between time to GVL and graft-versus-host (GVH) reactivity in the entire cohort was 14 days. There was no correlation between total T-cell dose and the relative onset of GVL versus GVH reactivity, indicating that temporal dissociation of GVL and GVH responses was not a function of the absolute number of infused donor T cells.

IAPs are also explored as a specific target for new antitumor strategies, including antisense oligonucleotides of XIAP (X-chromosome-linked IAP) or survivin and small molecules of polyphenylurea-based XIAP inhibitors. Several proteins negatively regulate the function of the IAP family. One of those antagonists is Smac/DIABLO. Short peptides of Smac were found to enhanced apoptosis, induced by chemo- or immunotherapy, in the leukemic cells in vitro. Moreover, small-molecule agents, resembling Smac/DIABLO in function, were shown to potentiate cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in different malignancies.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 338 patients were randomly assigned after surgery to receive TAM 30 mg/d for 3 years (TAM, n = 164), or EPI 30 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for six cycles plus TAM 30 mg/d for 3 years (EPI-TAM, n = 174). In both arms, patients received radiotherapy, delivered after chemotherapy (CT) in the EPI-TAM group. RESULTS: The 6-year DFS rates were 69.3% with TAM and 72.6% with EPI-TAM (P = .14). The multivariate analysis shows a relative risk of relapse of 1.93 (95% CI, 1.70 to 2.17) with TAM compared with EPI-TAM (P = .005). The 6-year OS, related to disease progression, was 79.1% and 79.8%, respectively (P = .41). Compliance with CT was good: 96.9% of patients received six cycles. The acute toxicity per patient was mild: grade 2 neutropenia in 5.9%, grade 2 anemia in 2.0%, grade 3 nausea or vomiting in 4.6%, and grade 3 alopecia in 7.2%. Five cases (in five patients) of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction occurred after CT: three after adjuvant CT, and two after anthracycline-based CT for relapse.

Clustering of 547 highly expressed genes in these leukemic cells showed 38 genes preferentially expressed in normal hematopoietic tissues and 122 other genes preferentially expressed in different normal nonhematopoietic tissues, including neuronal tissues, muscle, liver, and testis. We have also analyzed the genes whose expression in the leukemic cells changed after activation of WT p53 and treatment with the cytokine IL-6 or the calcium mobilizer thapsigargin. Of 620 such genes in the leukemic cells that were differentially expressed in normal tissues, clustering showed 80 genes that were preferentially expressed in hematopoietic tissues and 132 genes in different normal nonhematopoietic tissues that also included neuronal tissues, muscle, liver, and testis. Activation of p53 and treatment with IL-6 or thapsigargin induced different changes in the genes preferentially expressed in these normal tissues. These myeloid leukemic cells thus express genes that are expressed in normal nonhematopoietic tissues, and various treatments can reprogram these cells to induce other such nonhematopoietic genes. The results indicate that these leukemic cells share with normal hematopoietic stem cells the plasticity of differentiation to different cell types. It is suggested that this reprogramming to induce in malignant cells genes that are expressed in different normal tissues may be of clinical value in therapy.","['Lotem, Joseph', 'Benjamin, Hila', 'Netanely, Dvir', 'Domany, Eytan', 'Sachs, Leo']","['Lotem J', 'Benjamin H', 'Netanely D', 'Domany E', 'Sachs L']","['Departments of Molecular Genetics and Physics of Complex Systems, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041025,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, p53', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tissue Distribution']",2004/10/27 09:00,2004/12/29 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['0406966101 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0406966101 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Nov 9;101(45):16022-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0406966101.

Imatinib mesylate has been useful in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia through the inhibition of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib mesylate has also been shown to inhibit KIT, ARG, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta, and potentially other tyrosine kinases. We have produced a mutant allele of BCR-ABL (T315A) that is uniquely inhibitable by the small molecule 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1-naphthyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine and used it to demonstrate that sole suppression of BCR-ABL activity was insufficient to eliminate BCR-ABL(+) KIT(+)-expressing immature murine myeloid leukemic cells. In contrast, imatinib mesylate effectively eliminated BCR-ABL(+) KIT(+)-expressing leukemic cells. In the cellular context of mature myeloid cells and Pro/Pre B cells that do not express KIT, monospecific BCR-ABL inhibition was quantitatively as effective as imatinib mesylate in suppressing cell growth and inducing apoptosis. These results suggest that the therapeutic effectiveness of small molecule drugs such as imatinib mesylate could be due to the inhibitor's ability to suppress protein kinases in addition to the dominant target.","['Wong, S', 'McLaughlin, J', 'Cheng, D', 'Zhang, C', 'Shokat, K M', 'Witte, O N']","['Wong S', 'McLaughlin J', 'Cheng D', 'Zhang C', 'Shokat KM', 'Witte ON']","['Molecular Biology Interdepartmental Ph.D. Program, University of California-Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],,"['R01 AI044009/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 044009/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 76204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041025,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', '*Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/genetics/metabolism']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['0407061101 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0407061101 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Dec 14;101(50):17456-61. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0407061101.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of the review were to locate and describe measures of HRQL used in pediatrics and in pediatric oncology that might be applicable to ALL, to summarize studies that have applied HRQL measures to ALL, to identify and summarize economic evaluations of the costs and consequences of care for pediatric ALL, and to identify areas requiring further research. DATA SOURCES: To identify the HRQL literature in pediatric ALL, searches were run on the major biomedical and social science bibliographic databases. Search terms included a variety of MeSH and other thesaurus terms, text words, names of HRQL instruments, and the names of key authors in the field. The economic literature searches included most of the same databases, with the addition of the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit. Searches on specific authors and instruments and hand searches were also conducted. STUDY SELECTION: Only English language studies published from 1975 through 2000 were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Standardized data extraction forms were used to abstract information from HRQL and economic evaluation studies. Two reviewers independently screened the search results, and differences were resolved by consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: A number of generic HRQL measures, both adult and pediatric, have been applied in pediatric ALL. In addition, a number of pediatric oncology-specific instruments and pediatric oncology disease-specific instruments have been developed. Most of these instruments have been used to measure the health status of patients undergoing therapy. Despite the limited numbers of patients and resources available to assess HRQL measures in children with cancer, a fairly substantial body of literature has been published. Economic studies of pediatric ALL have only recently been undertaken. Most studies focus on a particular, narrow aspect of costs associated with the disease. There are relatively few cost-effectiveness studies that compare the costs and consequences of two or more treatment options. There are no published, comprehensive economic evaluations of pediatric ALL. CONCLUSIONS: HRQL measures provide not only important information on the improvements offered by new therapies but also an outcome measure for economic evaluations. Recently developed HRQL measures and applications that include the direct assessments of children are important contributions. By the age of 7 or 8 years, children can generally provide reliable responses. Furthermore, children often provide information that is not available from parental reports (e.g., in the more subjective areas of pain and emotion). However, the use of multiple viewpoints, such as the patient, parent, and health professional perspectives, can provide valid and important complementary information. Expertise in HRQL measurement should be included in the design of most future trials. Funds for HRQL research should be made available to enhance the scope of HRQL activities by organizations such as the Children's Oncology Group. In the near future, further work to generate evidence of validity for available HRQL measures for use in children with ALL will be a high priority. Continuation of inquiries into the methods for HRQL assessment of younger children (i.e., preschoolers) is also a priority.","['Pickard, A Simon', 'Topfer, Leigh-Ann', 'Feeny, David H']","['Pickard AS', 'Topfer LA', 'Feeny DH']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.']",['eng'],,['263-MQ-112556/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

A third, PAR3, is preferentially expressed by tissues of hematopoietic origin and megakaryocytes. Although PAR3 is also a thrombin substrate, its low-level expression on human platelets suggests a function distinct from that of PAR1, the major receptor involved in thrombin-mediated platelet activation. We studied the expression of PARs during megakaryocyte differentiation of human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells in order to determine the role of PAR3 in megakaryocytopoiesis. METHODS: HEL cells exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce megakaryocyte differentiation were examined by light microscopy and flow cytometry (DNA ploidy, surface expression of PAR1, PAR3, GPIIb-IIIa). Northern blot, RT-PCR, and quantitative RT-PCR were used to evaluate the expression of PARs 1, 3, and 4 mRNA. HEL cells were also exposed to thrombin and thrombopoietin (TPO). RESULTS: In baseline studies, unstimulated HEL cells were found to express comparable levels of PAR1 and PAR3 by Northern blot. Minimal expression of PAR4 was detected by RT-PCR, but not by Northern analysis. Exposure to PMA, but not thrombin or TPO, resulted in megakaryocytic differentiation as evident by increased cell size and nuclear complexity, increased ploidy, and enhanced expression of GPIIb-IIIa, a specific marker of megakaryocytes/platelets. PMA-stimulated HEL cells showed enhanced PAR3 cell-surface expression (approximately threefold increase by day 2) by flow cytometry. In contrast, there was no change in cell-surface PAR1 expression. Northern blot analysis (approximately 10-fold) and quantitative RT-PCR (approximately threefold) confirmed the upregulation of PAR3 mRNA expression (by 24 hours) in cells exposed to PMA. This did not occur with exposure to TPO. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate increased expression of PAR3 mRNA and protein in HEL cells undergoing megakaryocytic maturation following PMA exposure, suggesting a developmental role for PAR3. Furthermore, regulation of PAR3 expression appears to be specifically coupled to the protein kinase C system, but independent of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway.","['Cupit, Lisa D', 'Schmidt, Valentina A', 'Gnatenko, Dmitri V', 'Bahou, Wadie F']","['Cupit LD', 'Schmidt VA', 'Gnatenko DV', 'Bahou WF']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York at Stony Brook, NY 11794-8151, USA. lcupit@notes.cc.sunysb.edu']",['eng'],,"['DK62040/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL42390/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49141/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '0 (protease-activated receptor 3)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA/analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Receptors, Proteinase-Activated/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombin/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/10/27 09:00,2004/12/17 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2004/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(04)00247-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2004.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Oct;32(10):991-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.07.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an allogeneic rat BMT model we defined the conditions to induce a lethal GVHD with HSV-Tk gene-transduced T cells. We studied the feasibility to rescue the animals by conditional elimination of the T cells with ganciclovir (GCV) treatment. METHODS: Allogeneic T cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding the HSV-Tk suicide gene were added in varying numbers to a BM graft. Expression of HSV-Tk strongly increases the cytolytic effect of GCV, thereby allowing elimination of overreactive T cells at will. Various experimental conditions were tested in the rat model. RESULTS: A relation between the number of HSV-Tk(+) T cells added to the BM graft and GVHD development was found. GCV treatment resulted in selective HSV-Tk(+) T-cell elimination in blood and tissues but not in abrogation of GVHD due to persistence of HSV-Tk(-) T cells. T cells in unmanipulated rat BM normally have a low risk to induce GVH but when they are administered in combination with high numbers of HSV-Tk(+) T cells there is an apparent increase in their GVH-inducing potential. When HSV-Tk(+) T cells are added to T cell-depleted BM a consequently developing GVH can be controlled by GCV treatment with 60-70% of the animals surviving. CONCLUSIONS: We show that T cell-mediated suicide gene therapy within the context of allo-BMT can be applied with success. The apparent limitation in the number of transduced as well as nontransduced T cells that can be safely added to the BM graft should be taken into consideration when designing human suicide gene therapy protocols.","['Weijtens, Mo', 'van Spronsen, Anke', 'Hagenbeek, Anton', 'de Weger, Roel', 'Martens, Anton']","['Weijtens M', 'van Spronsen A', 'Hagenbeek A', 'de Weger R', 'Martens A']","['Jordan Laboratory of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3508 GA Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Ganciclovir/*pharmacology', '*Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Models, Animal', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/transplantation', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/10/27 09:00,2004/12/17 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2003/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2004/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(04)00251-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2004.07.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Oct;32(10):962-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.07.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A fixed effects model was employed to systematically combine the results of 14 case-control studies addressing the effect of short-term (< or = 6 months) and long-term (>6 months) breastfeeding on the risk of childhood ALL and/or AML. Subgroup analyses of studies that did and did not adjust for SES were also performed. RESULTS: A significant, negative association was observed between long-term breastfeeding and both ALL risk (odds ratio [OR]=0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68, 0.84) and AML risk (OR=0.85; 95% CI 0.73, 0.98). Short-term breastfeeding was similarly protective for ALL and AML. Results for studies that adjusted and did not adjust for SES were not significantly different from the results for the 14 studies combined. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that both short-term and long-term breastfeeding reduced the risk of childhood ALL and AML, suggesting that the protective effect of breastfeeding might not be limited to ALL as earlier hypothesized.

We found that HSC70 protein was contained in goat serum and casein used as blocking agents in the usual ELISA method. Here, it was demonstrated that HSC70 contamination in the blocking agents causes a false-negative result in the detection of anti-gp46-197 antibody in serum samples from HTLV-1-infected individuals. By using ELISA without the blocking agents, we detected antibodies recognizing the HSC70-binding site of gp46, and the anti-gp46-197 antibody specifically appeared in sera from patients with HTLV-1-associated diseases. The frequency of serum anti-gp46-197 antibody-positive individuals was 98% and 100% among ATLL and HAM/TSP patients, respectively, but only 6% among asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected carriers (ACs). The antibody titer in ATLL and HAM/TSP patients was higher than that in ACs (P < 0.002 for ATLL; P < 0.0001 for HAM/TSP).

Moreover, there were previous controversies as to whether the cell cycle is upregulated or suppressed by the benzene exposure. Subsequently, it was found that the cell cycle is suppressed, but how leukemia develops under such suppression of hemopoiesis remains to be clarified. These questions were fortunately resolved with much effort. Benzene exposure was found to induce the expression of p21, an interlocking counterdevice for cell cycle: due to p53 upregulation, thereby inducing the immediate suppression of the kinetics of hemopoietic progenitors followed by the prominent suppression of hemopoiesis. Intermittent benzene exposure (i.e., cessation of exposure during weekends, for example) allowed an immediate recovery from marrow suppression after terminating exposure, which induced continuous oscillatory changes in marrow hemopoiesis. Benzene-induced leukemia was chiefly due to such an oscillatory change in hemopoiesis, which epigenetically developed leukemia more than 1 year later. The mechanisms of benzene-induced leukemogenicity seem to differ between wild-type mice and mice lacking p53. For p53 knockout mice, DNA damage such as weak mutagenicity or chromosomal damage was retained, and such damage induced consequent activation of proto-oncogenes and related genes, which led cells to undergo further neoplastic changes. In contrast, for wild-type mice carrying the p53 gene, a marked oscillatory change in the cell cycle of the stem cell compartment seems to be important. Compatible and discriminative gene expression profiling between the p53 knockout mice and wild-type mice was observed after benzene exposure by microarray analyses.","['Hirabayashi, Yoko', 'Yoon, Byung-Il', 'Li, Guang-Xun', 'Kanno, Jun', 'Inoue, Tohru']","['Hirabayashi Y', 'Yoon BI', 'Li GX', 'Kanno J', 'Inoue T']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Toxicology, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,"['0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzene/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, p53', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/metabolism']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01926230490451725 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 2004 Jul-Aug;32 Suppl 2:12-6. doi: 10.1080/01926230490451725.,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of c-Myc distribution, however, have produced conflicting results. To overcome technical challenges inherent in c-Myc cytology, we use here three methods to visualize c-Myc and in addition examine the impact of proteasome inhibition. EYFP or HA-tagged Myc was reintroduced by stable transfection into myc null diploid rat fibroblasts, replacing endogenous Myc with tagged Myc expressed at or near normal levels. This tagged Myc is shown to functionally replace the endogenous Myc by restoration of normal cell morphology and growth rate. We were able to confirm key findings using antibodies to the endogenous c-Myc and/or its partner, Max. Contrary to some published reports, by all three methods the c-Myc protein in rat fibroblasts distributes predominantly throughout the nucleus in a dispersed granular pattern, avoiding the nucleolus. Importantly, however, several findings provide evidence for an unanticipated relationship between c-Myc and PML nuclear bodies, which is enhanced under conditions of proteasome inhibition. Evidence of Max concentration within PML bodies is shown both with and without proteasome inhibition, strengthening the relationship between PML bodies and Myc/Max. Some accumulation of Myc and Max in nucleoli upon proteasome inhibition is also observed, although co-localization of ubiquitin was only seen with PML bodies. This work provides a comprehensive study of c-Myc distribution and also presents the first evidence of a relationship between turnover of this oncoprotein and PML nuclear bodies, known to break down in certain cancers.","['Smith, Kelly P', 'Byron, Meg', ""O'Connell, Brenda C"", 'Tam, Rose', 'Schorl, Christoph', 'Guney, Isil', 'Hall, Lisa L', 'Agrawal, Pooja', 'Sedivy, John M', 'Lawrence, Jeanne B']","['Smith KP', 'Byron M', ""O'Connell BC"", 'Tam R', 'Schorl C', 'Guney I', 'Hall LL', 'Agrawal P', 'Sedivy JM', 'Lawrence JB']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 55 Lake Avenue North, Worcester, Massachusetts 01655, USA.

CONCLUSIONS: Asparaginase with addition of lidocaine significantly decreases the pain as measured by the visual analog scale without changing the bioavailability or the absorption rate of the enzyme.","['Albertsen, Birgitte Klug', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Clausen, Niels', 'Schroder, Henrik', 'Jakobsen, Preben']","['Albertsen BK', 'Hasle H', 'Clausen N', 'Schroder H', 'Jakobsen P']","['Department of Pharmacology, The Bartholin Building, University of Aarhus, Denmark. bka@farm.au.dk']",['eng'],,,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anesthetics, Local)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '98PI200987 (Lidocaine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anesthetics, Local/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Combinations', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Lidocaine/*administration & dosage', 'Pain/*drug therapy', 'Pain Measurement']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/03/18 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20214 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Mar;44(3):255-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20214.,,,,,"['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Veno-occlusive disease was previously recognized as a complication of TG on CCG-1952. We report a newly recognized pediatric complication of TG: splenomegaly and portal hypertension (PH) developing during maintenance or after completion of therapy. PROCEDURE: Twelve patients (3-10 years) had been randomized to receive a targeted dose of 50 mg/m(2)/day of TG during maintenance phases. Actual TG dose ranged from 25 to 77 mg/m(2)/day (median 34 mg/m(2)/day). RESULTS: The initial patient, a boy who had marked thrombocytopenia and intermittent splenomegaly during maintenance therapy, was evaluated for persistent pancytopenia and progressive splenomegaly 3 months after completion of therapy. Dilated splenic vein and collaterals consistent with PH were documented by MRI/MRA. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy found esophageal varices. Liver biopsy showed periportal fibrosis and marked dilatation of veins and venules. Of the other 12 patients, 9 patients studied had abnormal MRI/MRAs with evidence of varices in 4. Eight patients had splenomegaly on physical examination. Liver biopsies in a girl after 3.3 courses of TG and a boy after 4.6 courses of TG showed periportal fibrosis and dilatation of venules and sinusoids and minimal focal fatty changes. Subsequent MRI/MRAs have been stable or improved. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluations of these 12 patients suggest that treatment with TG causes injury to the liver leading to PH and that thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly are clinical hallmarks of this toxicity.","['Broxson, Emmett H', 'Dole, Mukund', 'Wong, Raymond', 'Laya, Bernard F', 'Stork, Linda']","['Broxson EH', 'Dole M', 'Wong R', 'Laya BF', 'Stork L']","[""Hematology/Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio, USA.""]",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Esophageal and Gastric Varices/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Portal/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/toxicity', 'Pancytopenia/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Splenomegaly/chemically induced', 'Thioguanine/*toxicity', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/03/18 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20202 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Mar;44(3):226-31. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20202.,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Nov;45(6):867; author reply 868.

The characteristics and outcomes of 25 patients with IgD myeloma (2.6% of all myeloma patients), including 11 patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are reported. The presenting features were not unique for myeloma, but it appears that the commonest presenting symptom was bone pain in 20 (80%) patients. Other associated disorders were B-CLL in -1 patient and hairy cell leukemia in another. Three patients had a marked increase in bone marrow reticulin. Three (out of a total of 9) patients had 13q deletion (1 by cytogenetics and 2 by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation [FISH]), while 2 patients had a complex karyotype. A total of 11 patients were treated with ASCT, while 14 patients had chemotherapy alone. The response to treatment was: in the ASCT group 2 had a complete response (CR) and 9 had a good partial response (PR), while in the chemotherapy group 6 had a good PR with no CRs. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) has not yet been reached after a median follow up of 4 years. The median PFS after chemotherapy was 1.23 years (95% CI 1.02-1.44). The mean OS transplantation was 5.09 years compared with 2.03 years for those treated with chemotherapy alone. However, this difference was not statistically significant (log rank p=0.09). This small series appears to suggest that outcome for IgD myeloma remains poor with chemotherapy and appears to be superior with ASCT, and larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.","['Wechalekar, Ashutosh', 'Amato, Dominic', 'Chen, Chris', 'Keith Stewart, A', 'Reece, Donna']","['Wechalekar A', 'Amato D', 'Chen C', 'Keith Stewart A', 'Reece D']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada. ashutosh.wechalkar@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20041022,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Immunoglobulin D)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin D', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0944-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Feb;84(2):115-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0944-x.

Doxorubicin, an important anti-AML drug, is a known MDR1 substrate and inducer. Its cytostatic efficacy is thus limited by MDR1 overexpression. A recent study demonstrated cyclooxygenase-2-dependent, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2))-mediated regulation of mdr1b expression in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. Cyclooxygenase-2 expression is increased in several malignancies and considered a negative prognostic factor. Our study focused on cyclooxygenase system's impact on drug-induced MDR1 overexpression in AML cells. As a prerequisite, coexpression of MDR1 and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA in HL-60 cells and primary AML blasts was demonstrated by Northern blot. Interestingly, incubation of AML cells with doxorubicin not only induced functionally active MDR1 overexpression but also mediated increased cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA and protein expressions with subsequent PGE(2) release (determined by flow cytometry, rhodamine123 efflux assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). After preincubation and subsequent parallel treatment with the cyclooxygenase-2-preferential inhibitor meloxicam, doxorubicin-induced MDR1 overexpression and function were reduced (maximally at 0.1-0.5 microM meloxicam), whereas cytostatic efficacy of doxorubicin in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assays was significantly increased by up to 78 (HL-60) and 30% (AML blasts) after 72 h of doxorubicin treatment. In HL-60 cells, meloxicam-dependent effect on doxorubicin cytotoxicity was neutralized by PGE(2) preincubation. In conclusion, the cyclooxygenase system, especially the cyclooxygenase-2 isoform, might be involved in regulating doxorubicin-induced MDR1 overexpression in AML cells, with PGE(2) seeming to be a mediating factor. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors thus bear promise to overcome MDR in AML and improve therapy.","['Puhlmann, Ulrike', 'Ziemann, Christina', 'Ruedell, Gudrun', 'Vorwerk, Hagen', 'Schaefer, Dirk', 'Langebrake, Claudia', 'Schuermann, Peter', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Reinhardt, Dirk']","['Puhlmann U', 'Ziemann C', 'Ruedell G', 'Vorwerk H', 'Schaefer D', 'Langebrake C', 'Schuermann P', 'Creutzig U', 'Reinhardt D']","[""AML-BFM Study, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Str. 33, 48129 Muenster, Germany. ulrike@puhlmann.de""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041022,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Thiazines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'VG2QF83CGL (Meloxicam)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*adverse effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Meloxicam', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123/pharmacology', 'Thiazines/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/04/14 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.104.071571 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.104.071571 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2005 Jan;312(1):346-54. doi: 10.1124/jpet.104.071571.

Because ATLL is a life-threatening lymphoproliferative disorder and is resistant to chemotherapy, the establishment and enhancement of T-cell immunity to HTLV-I through the development of therapeutic vaccines could be of value. Thus, the identification of HTLV-I epitopes for both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells should facilitate the development of effective vaccines. Although numerous HTLV-I epitopes for CTLs have been identified, few epitopes recognized by CD4(+) helper T cells against this virus have been described. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Synthetic peptides prepared from several regions of the HTLV-I envelope (Env) sequence that were predicted to serve as helper T-cell epitopes were prepared with use of computer-based algorithms and tested for their capacity to trigger in vitro helper T-cell responses using lymphocytes from normal volunteers. RESULTS: The results show that the HTLV-I-Env(317-331), and HTLV-I-Env(384-398)-reactive helper T lymphocytes restricted by HLA-DQw6 and HLA-DR15, respectively, could recognize intact HTLV-I+ T-cell lymphoma cells and, as a consequence, secrete lymphokines. In addition, HTLV-I Env(196-210)-reactive helper T lymphocytes restricted by HLA-DR9 were able to directly kill HTLV-I+ lymphoma cells and recognize naturally processed antigen derived from killed HTLV-I+ lymphoma cells, which was presented to the helper T cells by autologous antigen-presenting cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings hold relevance for the design and optimization of T-cell epitope-based immunotherapy against HTLV-I-induced diseases such as ATLL.","['Kobayashi, Hiroya', 'Nagato, Toshihiro', 'Yanai, Mitsuru', 'Oikawa, Kensuke', 'Sato, Keisuke', 'Kimura, Shoji', 'Tateno, Masatoshi', 'Omiya, Ryusuke', 'Celis, Esteban']","['Kobayashi H', 'Nagato T', 'Yanai M', 'Oikawa K', 'Sato K', 'Kimura S', 'Tateno M', 'Omiya R', 'Celis E']","['Department of Pathology, Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Japan. hiroya@asahikawa-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['P50CA91956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA82677/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00585/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/20/7053 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0897 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Oct 15;10(20):7053-62. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0897.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight modified CD33 peptides YLISGDSPV, YIGSGDSPV, YIIIGDSPV, YIILGDSPV, YIISGISPV, YIISGDLPV, YIISGDSWV and YIISGDSPL were designed for increased HLA-A2.1 or T cell receptor affinity and compared with the native CD33(65-73) peptide, AIISGDSPV, for enhanced immunogenicity. The YLISGDSPV peptide was found to be the most immunogenic epitope producing highly cytolytic CTLs against AML target cells. The CTLs generated withYLISGDSPV peptide showed CD33 peptide-specificity through targeting of both native (AIISGDSPV) and modified (YLISGDSPV) peptide presenting EBV-BLCL. The CTL cultures displayed a distinct phenotype consisting of a high percentage of activated memory (CD69(+)/CD45RO(+))-CD8(+)and a low percentage of naive (CD45RA(+)/CCR7(+))-CD8(+)cells. In addition, T-cell clones specific to the YLISGDSPV peptide were isolated and characterized to target AML cells. The clones exhibited both HLA-A2.1-restricted and AML cell-specific cytotoxicity that was mediated through a granule-dependent pathway. More importantly, the CTL clones did not lyse or inhibit the proliferation of normal CD34(+) progenitor cells. In conclusion, we report on the identification of a highly immunogenic heteroclitic YLISGDSPV CD33 epitope that is a promising candidate for immunotherapy targeting AML.","['Bae, Jooeun', 'Martinson, Jeffrey A', 'Klingemann, Hans G']","['Bae J', 'Martinson JA', 'Klingemann HG']","['Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Cell Therapy, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA. jooeun_bae@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/chemistry/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/20/7043 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0322 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Oct 15;10(20):7043-52. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0322.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the distinct protein profiles that contribute to the subtypes and facilitate molecular definition of acute leukemia classification are still unclear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The proteins of leukemic cells from 61 cases of acute leukemia characterized by FAB classification were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the differentially expressed protein spots were identified by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and tandem electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS/MS). RESULTS: The distinct protein profiles of acute leukemia FAB types or subtypes were successfully explored, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its subtypes (M2, M3, and M5) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), which were homogeneous within substantial samples of the respective subgroups but clearly differed from all other subgroups. We found a group of proteins that were highly expressed in M2 and M3, rather than other subtypes. Among them, myeloid-related proteins 8 and 14 were first reported to mark AML differentiation and to differentiate AML from ALL. Heat shock 27 kDa protein 1 and other proteins that are highly expressed in ALL may play important roles in clinically distinguishing AML from ALL. Another set of proteins up-regulated was restricted to granulocytic lineage leukemia. High-level expression of NM23-H1 was found in all but the M3a subtype, with favorable prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data have implications in delineating the pathways of aberrant gene expression underlying the pathogenesis of acute leukemia and could facilitate molecular definition of FAB classification. The extension of the present analysis to currently less well-defined acute leukemias will identify additional subgroups.","['Cui, Jiu-Wei', 'Wang, Jie', 'He, Kun', 'Jin, Bao-Feng', 'Wang, Hong-Xia', 'Li, Wei', 'Kang, Li-Hua', 'Hu, Mei-Ru', 'Li, Hui-Yan', 'Yu, Ming', 'Shen, Bei-Fen', 'Wang, Guan-Jun', 'Zhang, Xue-Min']","['Cui JW', 'Wang J', 'He K', 'Jin BF', 'Wang HX', 'Li W', 'Kang LH', 'Hu MR', 'Li HY', 'Yu M', 'Shen BF', 'Wang GJ', 'Zhang XM']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, the First Clinical Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Proteomics', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Survival Analysis', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/20/6887 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0307 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Oct 15;10(20):6887-96. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received fludarabine (10 to 15 mg/m(2) x 5 days), carboplatin (area under the curve 10 to 12 by continuous infusion over 5 days), followed by escalated doses of topotecan infused over 72 hours (fludarabine, carboplatin, topotecan regimen). Twenty-eight patients had acute myelogenous leukemia (7 untreated secondary acute myelogenous leukemia, 11 in first relapse, and 10 in second relapse or refractory), 1 patient had refractory/relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 2 patients had untreated chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis. Six patients had failed an autologous stem cell transplant. Patients ranged from 19 to 76 (median 54) years. Measurement of platinum-DNA adducts were done in serial bone marrow specimens. RESULTS: Fifteen of 31 patients achieved bone marrow aplasia. Clinical responses included 2 complete response, 4 complete response with persistent thrombocytopenia, and 2 partial response. Prolonged myelosuppression was observed with median time to blood neutrophils >/=200/microl of 28 (0 to 43) days and time to platelets >/=20,000/microl (untransfused) of 40 (24 to 120) days. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in all of the patients, and there were 2 infection-related deaths. The nonhematologic toxicity profile was acceptable. Five patients subsequently received allografts without early transplant-related mortality. Maximum tolerated dose of fludarabine, carboplatin, topotecan regimen was fludarabine 15 mg/m(2) x 5, carboplatin area under the curve 12, and topotecan 2.55 mg/m(2) over 72 hours. An increase in bone marrow, platinum-DNA adduct formation between the end of carboplatin infusion and 48 hours after the infusion correlated with bone marrow response.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression profile (mRNA and protein expression) was analyzed with the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas Oncochip, a cDNA microarray containing 6386 cancer-related genes, and a tissue microarray (TMA). The results were correlated with the IgV(H) mutational status, ZAP-70 expression, cytogenetic alterations, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: We found correlations between the presence of p-IkappaBalpha, a surrogate marker of NF-kappaB activation, and changes in the expression profile (mRNA and protein expression) and clinical outcome in a series of CLL cases with lymph node involvement. Activation of NF-kappaB, as determined by the expression of p-IkappaBalpha, was associated with the expression of a set of genes comprising key genes involved in the control of B-cell receptor signaling, signal transduction, and apoptosis, including SYK, LYN, BCL2, CCR7, BTK, PIK3CD, and others. Cases with increased expression of p-IkappaBalpha showed longer overall survival than cases with lower expression. A Cox regression model was derived to estimate some parameters of prognostic interest: IgV(H) mutational status, ZAP-70, and p-IkappaBalpha expression. The multivariate analysis disclosed p-IkappaBalpha and ZAP-70 expression as independent prognostic factors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: A variable degree of activation of NF-kappaB, as determined by the expression of p-IkappaBalpha, is an identifiable event in CLL, and is correlated with changes in the expression profile and overall survival.","['Rodriguez, Antonia', 'Martinez, Nerea', 'Camacho, Francisca I', 'Ruiz-Ballesteros, Elena', 'Algara, Patrocinio', 'Garcia, Juan-Fernando', 'Menarguez, Javier', 'Alvaro, Tomas', 'Fresno, Manuel F', 'Solano, Fernando', 'Mollejo, Manuela', 'Martin, Carmen', 'Piris, Miguel A']","['Rodriguez A', 'Martinez N', 'Camacho FI', 'Ruiz-Ballesteros E', 'Algara P', 'Garcia JF', 'Menarguez J', 'Alvaro T', 'Fresno MF', 'Solano F', 'Mollejo M', 'Martin C', 'Piris MA']","['Molecular Pathology Program, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/20/6796 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0753 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Oct 15;10(20):6796-806. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0753.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent resurgence in the use of arsenic trioxide is related to its high efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Most arsenic trioxide preparations are intravenous, although an oral formulation is similarly efficacious. Side effects of arsenic trioxide are usually minor, including skin reactions, gastrointestinal upset, and reversible increases in transaminases. During therapy, a leukocytosis occasionally occurs, which may be complicated by fluid accumulation and pulmonary infiltration. Arsenic trioxide causes an asymptomatic QT prolongation in most patients. However, if concomitant cardiopulmonary diseases or electrolyte disturbances are present, more sinister arrhythmias may develop. Therefore, before commencement of arsenic trioxide therapy, a full cardiac assessment and avoidance of drugs that prolong QT interval should be instituted. Arsenic trioxide is partly renally excreted and, therefore, dose adjustment is required when renal function is impaired. In addition to its use in APL, arsenic trioxide is now tested in other malignancies, notably multiple myeloma.","['Kwong, Yok-Lam']",['Kwong YL'],"['University of Hong Kong, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2004/10/27 09:00,2005/10/06 09:00,['2004/10/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['EDS030607 [pii]', '10.1517/14740338.3.6.589 [doi]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2004 Nov;3(6):589-97. doi: 10.1517/14740338.3.6.589.,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spontaneous cure cannot be expected due to the unique life cycle of the parasite, termed autoinfection. The disease occurs worldwide, but especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Serious clinical problems with complications and refractory strongyloidiasis are observed, especially in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with human T cell leukaemia virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) or HIV, or corticosteroid-treated patients. Thiabendazole is effective against S. stercoralis infection; however, serious side effects have been reported. Recently, ivermectin, which has been introduced for the treatment of human onchocerciasis, has been reported to be effective against strongyloidiasis, without serious side effects. The interval of administration is important for treatment, because if autoinfective migrating larvae are not eradicated, S. stercoralis will resume its life cycle and multiply again. To evaluate the results of treatment of S. stercoralis, stool examinations and S. stercoralis-specific antibody titres should be examined for at least 1 or 2 years if possible.

However, some patients receiving ATRA develop a serious complication called retinoid syndrome (RS). The objective of this study was to compare the hematological and immunophenotypic features of APL patients who developed RS with those who did not. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records, roentgenograms, peripheral blood smears and bone marrow aspirates from 71 APL patients. Immunophenotypic analyses were available in 56 of these cases. Eight cases of RS were detected, whose clinical presentation was characterized by respiratory distress (n = 8), impairment of the renal function (n = 2), fever (n = 5), weight gain (n = 3), edema (n = 3) and/or pleural effusion (n = 5). The following variables were compared in patients with and without RS: hemoglobin levels, leukocyte and platelet counts, frequency of hypergranular and variant morphological subtypes, percentages of CD33+, CD13+, CD117+ blasts in the bone marrow, fluorescence intensity and variation of these markers in the leukemic cells, expressed as the median channel of fluorescence (MCF) and fluorescence coefficient of variation (CV), respectively. RESULTS: RS incidence was 11.26% and the average time for syndrome development was 11.5 days after starting ATRA treatment. All patients presented acute respiratory distress. Other symptoms included fever, weight gain, edema and renal insufficiency. The main radiological findings were ground glass opacities, increased vascular pedicle and peribronchial cuffing. There was no significant correlation between the variables selected and the risk of development of RS, however the Odds Ratios for patients presenting MCF for CD117 > 30 ua and CV for CD33 < 50 were of 7.14 (P = 0.08) and 7.86 (P = 0.06), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence, as well as the clinical, radiological and laboratory features of RS in this group of Brazilian APL patients were similar to those described in literature. None of the variables studied were significantly correlated to a higher risk of developing RS.","['Santos, Flavia Leite Souza', 'Dore, Adriana I', 'Lima, Ana Silvia G', 'Garcia, Aglair B', 'Zago, Marco A', 'Rizzatti, Edgar G', 'Elias, Jorge Jr', 'Falcao, Roberto Passetto', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes']","['Santos FL', 'Dore AI', 'Lima AS', 'Garcia AB', 'Zago MA', 'Rizzatti EG', 'Elias J Jr', 'Falcao RP', 'Rego EM']","['Divisoes de Hematologia e de Diagnostico por Imagem, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, SP.']",['por'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20041021,Brazil,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992),9308586,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Distribution', 'Syndrome', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects']",2004/10/23 09:00,2005/07/15 09:00,['2004/10/23 09:00'],"['2004/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0104-42302004000300036 [pii]', '10.1590/s0104-42302004000300036 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992). 2004 Jul-Sep;50(3):286-92. doi: 10.1590/s0104-42302004000300036.

Significantly elevated risks were found for coeliac disease (4.7; 1.3 to 12.2), acquired hypothyroidism (9.4; 3.4, 20.5), other thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus (2.8; 1.0 to 6.1). A decreased risk was found for asthma (0.4; 0.2 to 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Our data add to the body of information on the risks of co-morbidity in people with Down's syndrome. The finding on asthma needs to be confirmed or refuted by other studies.","['Goldacre, M J', 'Wotton, C J', 'Seagroatt, V', 'Yeates, D']","['Goldacre MJ', 'Wotton CJ', 'Seagroatt V', 'Yeates D']","['Unit of Health-Care Epidemiology, Department of Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. michael.goldacre@dphpc.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Celiac Disease/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology', 'Down Syndrome/*epidemiology', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Thyroid Diseases/epidemiology']",2004/10/23 09:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/10/23 09:00'],"['2004/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['89/11/1014 [pii]', '10.1136/adc.2003.046219 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2004 Nov;89(11):1014-7. doi: 10.1136/adc.2003.046219.,,,,PMC1719725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand FLT3 signaling in leukemogenesis, we have examined the changes in gene expression induced by FLT3/ITD or constitutively activated wild-type FLT3 expression. Microarrays were used with RNA harvested before and after inhibition of FLT3 signaling. Pim-1 was found to be one of the most significantly down-regulated genes upon FLT3 inhibition. Pim-1 is a proto-oncogene and is known to be up-regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), which itself is a downstream target of FLT3 signaling. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) confirmed the microarray results and demonstrated approximately 10-fold decreases in Pim-1 expression in response to FLT3 inhibition. Pim-1 protein also decreased rapidly in parallel with decreasing autophosphorylation activity of FLT3. Enforced expression of either the 44-kDa or 33-kDa Pim-1 isotypes resulted in increased resistance to FLT3 inhibition-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis. In contrast, expression of a dominant-negative Pim-1 construct accelerated cytotoxicity in response to FLT3 inhibition and inhibited colony growth of FLT3/ITD-transformed BaF3 cells. These findings demonstrate that constitutively activated FLT3 signaling up-regulates Pim-1 expression in leukemia cells. This up-regulation contributes to the proliferative and antiapoptotic pathways induced by FLT3 signaling.","['Kim, Kyu-Tae', 'Baird, Kristin', 'Ahn, Joon-Young', 'Meltzer, Paul', 'Lilly, Michael', 'Levis, Mark', 'Small, Donald']","['Kim KT', 'Baird K', 'Ahn JY', 'Meltzer P', 'Lilly M', 'Levis M', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70970CA91177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041021,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/10/23 09:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/10/23 09:00'],"['2004/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45905-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-05-2006 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 15;105(4):1759-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-05-2006.

The clinical results show a relatively low incidence of graft-versus-host disease and leukemia relapse. Since maternal cells traffic into the fetus during pregnancy, we questioned whether cord blood has the potential to generate cytotoxic T cells specific for the hematopoietic minor histocompatibility (H) antigen HA-1 that would support the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of ex vivo generation of minor H antigen HA-1-specific T cells from cord blood cells. Moreover, we observed pre-existing HA-1-specific T cells in cord blood samples. Both the circulating and the ex vivo-generated HA-1-specific T cells show specific and hematopoietic restricted lysis of human leukocyte antigen-A2(pos)/HA-1(pos) (HLA-A2(pos)/HA-1(pos)) target cells, including leukemic cells. The cord blood-derived HA-1-specific cytotoxic T cells are from child origin. Thus, the so-called naive cord blood can comprise cytotoxic T cells directed at the maternal minor H antigen HA-1. The apparent immunization status of cord blood may well contribute to the in vivo graft-versus-leukemia activity after transplantation. Moreover, since the fetus cannot be primed against Y chromosome-encoded minor H antigens, cord blood is an attractive stem cell source for male patients.","['Mommaas, Bregje', 'Stegehuis-Kamp, Janine A', 'van Halteren, Astrid G', 'Kester, Michel', 'Enczmann, Jurgen', 'Wernet, Peter', 'Kogler, Gesine', 'Mutis, Tuna', 'Brand, Anneke', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Mommaas B', 'Stegehuis-Kamp JA', 'van Halteren AG', 'Kester M', 'Enczmann J', 'Wernet P', 'Kogler G', 'Mutis T', 'Brand A', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, PO Box 9600, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041021,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Fetus/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange/*immunology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/biosynthesis/blood/*immunology', 'Oligopeptides/biosynthesis/blood/*immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology/metabolism']",2004/10/23 09:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/10/23 09:00'],"['2004/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45914-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-07-2832 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 15;105(4):1823-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2832.

Several STAT5 targets are known, although it is likely that most remain uncharacterized. To identify a more complete set of STAT5-regulated genes, we used a modification of the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure, which does not presuppose any information regarding these targets. Employing Ba/f3 cells in which STAT5 is activated by interleukin-3, we have identified novel STAT5 binding sites that may be regulatory regions for nearby genes. These sites are typically found far from transcription start sites, and most do not contain CpG islands, indicating that they are not in traditional promoter regions. Nonetheless, when the expression of genes near these STAT5 binding sites was examined, all were expressed in Ba/f3 cells, and most were modulated by interleukin-3. Furthermore, genes identified by this strategy show unique expression patterns in acute leukemias, tumors characterized by activated STAT5. Whereas both STAT5 isoforms bound to all promoters tested, STAT5a and STAT5b bound with different kinetics, suggesting that at least some of the differences between the functions of these two proteins are mediated by their DNA binding activity. Therefore, this method of transcription factor target identification represents an effective strategy to isolate transcription factor targets in an unbiased fashion, and it has revealed many novel STAT5-dependent regulatory regions outside of traditional promoters.","['Nelson, Erik A', 'Walker, Sarah R', 'Alvarez, James V', 'Frank, David A']","['Nelson EA', 'Walker SR', 'Alvarez JV', 'Frank DA']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],,['CA79547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041020,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Milk Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/analysis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/10/23 09:00,2005/03/15 09:00,['2004/10/23 09:00'],"['2004/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)63239-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M408464200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Dec 24;279(52):54724-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M408464200.

Replacement of patient haematopoiesis by donor haematopoiesis allows the application of donor-derived specifically targeted cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of leukaemia. Following allogeneic transplantation, donor-derived T cells recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens expressed on haematopoietic cells from the patient may result in eradication of all haematopoietic cells of recipient origin. Since after transplantation, normal haematopoiesis is of donor origin, these T-cell responses may result in establishment of full donor chimerism associated with elimination of the haematological malignancy. By targeting the immune response to minor histocompatibility antigens that are not expressed on non-haematopoietic tissues, graft-vs.-host reactions may be limited. Several methods can be used for in vitro selection of T-cell responses with high specificity for malignant cells, and in vitro manipulation of donor T cells including transfer of antigen-specific T-cell receptors may greatly enhance specificity and efficacy of donor-derived cellular immunotherapy of haematological malignancies.","['Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Willemze, Roel']","['Falkenburg JH', 'Willemze R']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Centre, P.O.

In the current study, we investigated the mechanism of apoptosis induced by alpha-mangostin in HL60 cells. Alpha-mangostin-treated HL60 cells demonstrated caspase-9 and -3 activation but not -8, which leads us to assume that alpha-mangostin may mediate the mitochondrial pathway in the apoptosis. Parameters of mitochondrial dysfunction including swelling, loss of membrane potential (deltapsim), decrease in intracellular ATP, ROS accumulation, and cytochrome c/AIF release, were observed within 1 or 2 h after the treatment. On the other hand, alpha-mangostin-treatment did not affect expression of bcl-2 family proteins and activation of MAP kinases. These findings indicate that alpha-mangostin preferentially targets mitochondria in the early phase, resulting in indication of apoptosis in HL60 cells. Furthermore, we examined the structure-activity relationship between xanthone derivatives including alpha-mangostin and the potency of deltapsim-loss in HL60 cells. Interestingly, replacement of hydroxyl group by methoxy group remarkably decreased its potency. It was also shown that the cytotoxicity substantially correlated with deltapsim decrease.

Their action was considered to be achieved mainly through binding to nuclear hormone receptors, retinoic acid receptors (RARs), although they have been observed to have different biological effects. For example, the two compounds have similar effects on differentiation but different effects on proliferation in human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells. To elucidate the genes responsible for this and other differences, we attempted for the first time to determine the genes whose expressions were differentially modulated during the time course of HL-60 cell differentiation by ATRA and Am80 treatment up to 72h utilizing DNA microarray and clustering analyses. As a result, the expressions of 204 genes were found to be modulated differentially by ATRA and Am80. Among them, we focused on two components of the PI3-kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, beta-catalytic subunit and ribosomal protein S6 kinase polypeptide 1, which are related to the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Their expressions were specifically suppressed by ATRA, which coincided with the suppressive effects of ATRA on the HL-60 cell proliferation. Moreover, PI3-kinase inhibitors suppressed the proliferation of Am80-treated cells to the same extent as ATRA did.

The vector expression in leukemia cell lines (HL60 and K562) was achieved by transfection using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). After transfection, ectopic expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit was analyzed by quantitative fluorescence real-time RT-PCR, and cellular apoptosis and cell cycle parameters were evaluated by flow cytometry respectively. RESULTS: An antisense pcDNA-hTERT eukaryotic expression vector was successfully constructed. Leukemia cell lines transfected with antisense hTERT constructed displayed a significant inhibition of gene expression of telomerase and its activity in vitro, as compared with the result of the control groups (without transfection and vector control).

Morphology, phenotype, cytogenetics, and function of induced cells were studied. The results showed that after culture for 3 days, cells in 20/25 AML cases demonstrated an increase in size with dendritic morphology. After culture for 8 - 9 days, the percentage of such cells reached peak. When cultured for 12 days, the total number of cells and the number of cells with DC morphology decreased greatly. Phenotypic analyses of cells (11/20 cases) were measured by flow cytometry before and after culture. Before culture, cells did not express CD1a, CD80 and CD83, while expressed CD54, CD86 and HLA-DR with low frequency. After culture, cells upregulated CD1a, CD80, CD83, CD54, CD86 and HLA-DR significantly. A marked increase of the T-cell stimulatory capacity could be generated in Allo-MLRs.

The results showed that a STI571-resistant cell line based on multidrug-resistance was established, which exhibited 23.41-fold resistance to STI571, 662.26-fold resistance to VCR and cross-resistance to HHT. K562-n/STI was generated from K562-n and had some characteristics of MDR. The intracellular accumulation of DNR in K562-n/STI and K562-n/VCR/STI were 33.24 and 18.76 respectively. Transcription of mdr-1 gene in both K562-n/STI and K562-n/VCR/STI was positive. Cell doubling time of K562-n/STI and K562-n/VCR/STI was significantly longer than that in their parent cells (P <0.05). And proliferation index was also higher than that in parent cells (P <0.05). It is conclusion that the tolerance of K562-n cells to STI571 can be augmented by adding low-dose of STI571 into the culture medium repeatedly. K562-n/STIs expressed MDR at some extent, and transcription of mdr-1 gene in K562-n/STIs was positive.

An important and necessary step in the epidemiological study was the reconstruction of the historical water supply strategy of the water distribution system serving the Dover Township area, New Jersey. The sensitivity of solutions to: (1) pressure and pattern factor constraints, (2) allowable operational extremes of water levels in the storage tanks, and (3) the non-uniqueness of the water supply solution are analysed in detail. The computational results show that the proposed approach yields satisfactory results for the complete set of monthly simulations and sensitivity analyses, providing a consistent approach for identifying the historical water supply strategy of the water distribution system. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the alternative strategy obtained from the revised objective function and the variation of constraints did not yield significantly different water supply characteristics. The overall analysis demonstrates that the progressive optimality genetic algorithm (POGA) developed to solve the optimization problem is an effective and efficient algorithm for the reconstruction of water supply strategies in water distribution systems.","['Aral, M M', 'Guan, J', 'Maslia, M L', 'Sautner, J B', 'Gillig, R E', 'Reyes, J J', 'Williams, R C']","['Aral MM', 'Guan J', 'Maslia ML', 'Sautner JB', 'Gillig RE', 'Reyes JJ', 'Williams RC']","['Multimedia Environmental Simulations Laboratory, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, USA. maral@ce.gatech.edu']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,J Water Health,Journal of water and health,101185420,"['0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', '*Models, Genetic', 'New Jersey/epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Sanitary Engineering', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/toxicity', 'Water Supply/analysis/*statistics & numerical data']",2004/10/23 09:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2004/10/23 09:00'],"['2004/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Water Health. 2004 Sep;2(3):137-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methodology.,123-36,"The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS), with support from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) conducted an epidemiological study of childhood leukaemia and nervous system cancers that occurred in the period 1979 through 1996 in Dover Township, Ocean County, New Jersey. The epidemiological study explored a wide variety of possible risk factors, including environmental exposures. ATSDR and NJDHSS determined that completed human exposure pathways to groundwater contaminants occurred in the past through private and community water supplies (i.e. the water distribution system serving the area). To investigate this exposure, a model of the water distribution system was developed and calibrated through an extensive field investigation. The components of this water distribution system, such as number of pipes, number of tanks, and number of supply wells in the network, changed significantly over a 35-year period (1962--1996), the time frame established for the epidemiological study. Data on the historical management of this system was limited. Thus, it was necessary to investigate alternative ways to reconstruct the operation of the system and test the sensitivity of the system to various alternative operations. Manual reconstruction of the historical water supply to the system in order to provide this sensitivity analysis was time-consuming and labour intensive, given the complexity of the system and the time constraints imposed on the study. To address these issues, the problem was formulated as an optimization problem, where it was assumed that the water distribution system was operated in an optimum manner at all times to satisfy the constraints in the system. The solution to the optimization problem provided the historical water supply strategy in a consistent manner for each month of the study period. The non-uniqueness of the selected historical water supply strategy was addressed by the formulation of a second model, which was based on the first solution. Numerous other sensitivity analyses were also conducted using these two models. Both models are solved using a two-stage progressive optimality algorithm along with genetic algorithms (GAs) and the EPANET2 water distribution network solver. This process reduced the required solution time and generated a historically consistent water supply strategy for the water distribution system.","['Aral, M M', 'Guan, J', 'Maslia, M L', 'Sautner, J B', 'Gillig, R E', 'Reyes, J J', 'Williams, R C']","['Aral MM', 'Guan J', 'Maslia ML', 'Sautner JB', 'Gillig RE', 'Reyes JJ', 'Williams RC']","['Multimedia Environmental Simulations Laboratory, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, USA. maral@ce.gatech.edu']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,J Water Health,Journal of water and health,101185420,"['0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Child', '*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', '*Models, Genetic', 'New Jersey/epidemiology', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Sanitary Engineering/statistics & numerical data', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/toxicity', 'Water Supply/analysis/*statistics & numerical data']",2004/10/23 09:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2004/10/23 09:00'],"['2004/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Water Health. 2004 Sep;2(3):123-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotyping of haematopoietic cells is performed with the use of a number of monoclonal antibodies (MOABs), which are directed specifically against structures of blood cells that become expressed at the different stages of differentiation and maturation. Cells to which the fluorescently labelled MOABs are directed can be recognised and measured using fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence flow cytometry. Many MOABs, fluorochromes and user-friendly flow cytometers have become available in the last 15 years, as a result of which immunophenotyping is now routinely applied in clinical practice. Immunophenotyping has the potential to classify leukaemias and other malignant lymphomas according to cell type and stage of maturation. This information is important for the establishment of the right diagnosis and prognosis, and for the optimal treatment choice. In a number of cases immunophenotyping provides information which cannot be obtained by simple morphological investigation.

Survivals in MDS and JMML were analyzed separately.

To detect IGHS translocations, Southern blot assays using 5' and 3' switch probes were performed. Illegitimate Smu rearrangements were amplified from the 5' end (5'Smu LDI-PCR) from the alternative derivative chromosome, and those of Sgamma or Salpha were amplified from the 3' end (3'Sgamma or 3'alpha LDI-PCR) from the derivative chromosome 14.

Here we show the activity of NVP-LAQ824 in acute myeloid leukemia cells and BCR/ABL-expressing cells of mouse and human origin, both sensitive and resistant to imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571). Whereas imatinib inhibited overall cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in Ba/F3.p210 cells, NVP-LAQ824 did not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation, and did not affect BCR/ABL or ABL protein expression. Neither compound was able to inhibit cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in the imatinib-resistant Ba/F3.p210-T315I cell line. These data taken together suggest that BCR/ABL kinase activity is not a direct target of NVP-LAQ824. Synergy between NVP-LAQ824 and imatinib was demonstrated against BCR/ABL-expressing K562 myeloid leukemia cell lines. In addition, we show that NVP-LAQ824 was well tolerated in vivo in a pre-clinical murine leukemia model, with antileukemia activity resulting in significant prolongation of the survival of mice when treated with NVP-LAQ824 compared to control mice.

Traditional model-building techniques with NONMEM were used. Covariates were entered into the base model using a forward selection significance level of .05 and a backwards deletion criterion of .005. Model performance, stability, and influence analysis were assessed using the nonparametric bootstrap and n-1 jackknife. Simulations were used to understand the relationship between important covariates and exposure. A 2-compartment model with weight (scaled to a 40-kg reference patient) modeled as a power function on all pharmacokinetic parameters (0.75 on clearance-related terms and 1.0 on volume-related terms) was fit to plasma clofarabine concentrations (n = 32). White blood cell (WBC) count, modeled as a power function (scaled to a WBC count of 10 x 10(3)/microL), was a significant predictor of central volume with power term 0.128 +/- 0.0314. A reference patient had a systemic clearance of 32.8 L/h (27% between-subject variability [BSV]), a central volume of 115 L (56% BSV), an intercompartmental clearance of 20.5 L/h (27% BSV), and a peripheral volume of 94.5 L (39% BSV). Intracellular clofarabine triphosphate concentrations were modeled using a random intercept model without any covariates. The average predicted concentration was 11.6 +/- 2.62 microM (80% BSV), and although clofarabine triphosphate half-life could not be definitively estimated, its value was taken to be longer than 24 hours.

All of these compounds displayed effective antiproliferative activity using sulforhodamine B assays and induced cell apoptosis by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-reaction technique. The data demonstrated that caseamembrin C was the most effective compound among these clerodane diterpenoids. Caseamembrin C induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, while up-regulation of proapoptotic protein Mcl-1S (short chain), suggesting that these Bcl-2 family member proteins may play a role on arbitrating the apoptotic cell death. Caseamembrin C also induced the up-regulation of Fas ligand (FasL) expression, cleavage and activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9, Bid cleavage and activation of executor caspase-3. However, z-IETD-FMK (Z-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, a selective caspase-8 inhibitor) almost completely inhibited caseamembrin C-induced Bid cleavage without any modification of caspase-9 activation, indicating that the extrinsic pathway of FasL/caspase-8/Bid cascade only played a minor role in the apoptotic signaling. Taken together, it is suggested that caseamembrin C-induced apoptosis is predominantly through the activation of intrinsic apoptosis pathways by causing the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, up-regulation of Mcl-1S protein and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3.","['Huang, Dong-Ming', 'Shen, Ya-Ching', 'Wu, Chi', 'Huang, Yao-Ting', 'Kung, Fan-Lu', 'Teng, Che-Ming', 'Guh, Jih-Hwa']","['Huang DM', 'Shen YC', 'Wu C', 'Huang YT', 'Kung FL', 'Teng CM', 'Guh JH']","['Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Jen-Ai Road, Sect. 1, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Diterpenes, Clerodane)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '2609-88-3 (lissamine rhodamine B)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coloring Agents', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Diterpenes, Clerodane/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rhodamines', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",2004/10/22 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2004/10/22 09:00'],"['2004/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(04)01075-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.09.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2004 Oct 25;503(1-3):17-24. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.09.040.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth factors that have been used in priming include both filgrastim (G-CSF) and sagramostim (GM-CSF). Priming has often been applied in the treatment of older patients, who do not respond as well to standard treatment regimens, and whose disease was transformed from a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or preleukemia.

Co-expression of both transcripts and higher amounts of L-type mRNA were always found in all cancer cell types analysed. However, mature lymphocytes from the medullar blood of a patient suffering aplasia did not express the K-type transcript and showed a 15-fold increase of L-type transcript. Co-expression was also confirmed at the protein level using isoform-specific antibodies; nevertheless, it did not correlate with the relative abundance of glutaminase transcripts and strong K-type protein signals were detected. On the other hand, marked differences were found with regard to glutamate inhibition and phosphate activation of tumour glutaminase activity. Taken together, the protein data suggest that K isoform would account for the majority of glutaminase activity in these human tumour cells. The results confirm that simultaneous expression of both isoenzymes in human cancer cells is a more frequent event than previously thought. Furthermore, the present work and other previous data suggest that K isoform is up-regulated with increased rates of proliferation, whereas prevalence of the L isoform seems to be related with resting or quiescent cell states.","['Perez-Gomez, Cristina', 'Campos-Sandoval, Jose A', 'Alonso, Francisco J', 'Segura, Juan A', 'Manzanares, Elisa', 'Ruiz-Sanchez, Pedro', 'Gonzalez, Maria E', 'Marquez, Javier', 'Mates, Jose M']","['Perez-Gomez C', 'Campos-Sandoval JA', 'Alonso FJ', 'Segura JA', 'Manzanares E', 'Ruiz-Sanchez P', 'Gonzalez ME', 'Marquez J', 'Mates JM']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Bioquimica, Laboratorio de Quimica de Proteinas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Malaga, 29071 Malaga, Spain.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis/blood', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain/abnormalities/enzymology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Glutamic Acid/pharmacology', 'Glutaminase/blood/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/blood/genetics', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Neoplasms/blood/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/10/22 09:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2004/10/22 09:00'],"['2004/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20040996 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20040996 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Mar 15;386(Pt 3):535-42. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040996.,,,,PMC1134872,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients were treated with subcutaneous interferon-alpha, and only 1 experienced temporary control of the disease. Three of these patients were then treated with imatinib mesylate: transient improvement was noted in two patients. One patient underwent stem cell transplantation as first therapy and achieved complete remission; this patient had associated MDS and is now in complete remission for 8 years. The patient with associated AML was treated with high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin; he has been in complete remission for 16 months. One patient was treated with induction chemotherapy consisting of high-dose cytarabine and 2CDA but expired due to sepsis.

More recent studies identified methylation of other tumor suppressor genes, DAP-kinase and SOCS1, singly in AML. We therefore assessed the methylation status of these genes concurrently with other known targets of methylation. We used methylation-specific PCR or COBRA to determine the extent of methylation of 10 genes in 28 AML samples from Turkey. In addition to DAP-kinase and SOCS1, we included ER, p15, and E-cadherin (reported to be frequently methylated) as well as p16, GSTP1, and HIC1 (reported as rarely methylated). We also included RARbeta and p73 for which only minimal data in AML is available. All samples were methylated at least in one locus and all except one demonstrated methylation of DAP-kinase, SOCS1, p15, and/or ER. DAP-kinase is the most frequently methylated gene in both pediatric (70%) and adult AML (55%). RARbeta is methylated in 18% and p73 in 10% of AMLs. Methylation of E-cadherin and RARbeta occurs preferentially in AMLs with high methylation index (MI), while epigenetic lesions in SOCS1, DAP-kinase, and p15 appear to be independent. MI may be age-dependent, with a peak in young adults. FAB M3 demonstrated a higher extent of methylation than M2/M4. This study provides an impetus for larger studies to define if the extent and pattern of methylation in subgroups of AML are clinically relevant.","['Ekmekci, Cumhur G', 'Gutierrez, Marina I', 'Siraj, Abdul K', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Bhatia, Kishor']","['Ekmekci CG', 'Gutierrez MI', 'Siraj AK', 'Ozbek U', 'Bhatia K']","['Genetics, Institute for Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics']",2004/10/21 09:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20186 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2004 Nov;77(3):233-40. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Homozygous deletions are unusually prevalent at this locus in very different human cancers. In the present study, we compared deletions in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cell lines to those in T-cell acute lymphatic leukemia (T-ALL), glioma, and bladder carcinoma (TCC) cell lines. Of 14 SCCHN lines, 10 showed homozygous deletions of CDKN2A, one displayed promoter hypermethylation with gene silencing, and one had a frameshift deletion in exon 2. Many deletion ends were in or proximal to the repetitive sequence clusters flanking the locus. Breakpoint junctions displayed variable microhomologies or insertions characteristic of DNA repair by nonhomologous end-joining. In general, deletions were much smaller in SCCHN than in TCC and glioma. In T-ALL, breakpoints were near consensus sites for recombination mediated by RAG (recombination activating genes) enzymes, and the structure of the junctions was consistent with this mechanism. We suggest that different mechanisms of CDKN2A deletion prevail in different human cancers. Aberrant RAG-mediated recombination may be responsible in T-ALL, and exuberant DNA repair by nonhomologous end-joining is the likely prevailing mechanism in SCCHN, but a distinct mechanism in TCC and glioma remains to be elucidated.","['Raschke, Sascha', 'Balz, Vera', 'Efferth, Thomas', 'Schulz, Wolfgang A', 'Florl, Andrea R']","['Raschke S', 'Balz V', 'Efferth T', 'Schulz WA', 'Florl AR']","['Urologische Klinik, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p16', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/10/21 09:00,2005/03/09 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20119 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 Jan;42(1):58-67. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20119.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The common practice is to admit the patient to hospital and treat empirically with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. Oral therapy could be an alternative approach for selected patients. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of oral antibiotics versus intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenic cancer patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Cancer Network Register of trials (November 2002), the Cochrane Library (issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to 2002), EMBASE (January 1980 to 2002) and LILACS (1982 to 2002). We searched several databases for ongoing trials. We checked the conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) 1995 to 2002 and all references of included studies and major reviews were scanned. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing oral antibiotic/s to intravenous antibiotic/s for the treatment of neutropenic cancer patients with fever. The comparison between the two could be started initially (initial oral), or following an initial course of intravenous antibiotic treatment (sequential). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality and extracted data. Data concerning mortality, treatment failures and adverse events were extracted from included studies assuming an ""intention-to-treat"" basis for the outcome measures whenever possible. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data were estimated. MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen trials (median mortality 0, range 0 to 8.8%) were included in the analyses. The mortality rate was similar comparing oral to intravenous antibiotic treatment (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.62, 7 trials, 1223 patients). Treatment failure rates were also similar (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05, all trials). No significant heterogeneity was shown for all comparisons but adverse events. This effect was stable in a wide range of patients. Quinolones alone or combined with another antibiotics were used with comparable results. Adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal were more common with oral antibiotics. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present data, oral treatment is an acceptable alternative to intravenous antibiotic treatment in febrile neutropenic cancer patients (excluding patients with acute leukaemia) who are haemodynamically stable, without organ failure, not having pneumonia, infection of a central line or a severe soft-tissue infection. The wide confidence interval for mortality allows the present use of oral treatment in groups of patients with an expected low risk for mortality, and further research should be aimed at clarifying the definition of low risk patients.","['Vidal, L', 'Paul, M', 'Ben-Dor, I', 'Pokroy, E', 'Soares-Weiser, K', 'Leibovici, L']","['Vidal L', 'Paul M', 'Ben-Dor I', 'Pokroy E', 'Soares-Weiser K', 'Leibovici L']","['Department of Internal Medicine E, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petah Tikva, Israel, 49100. vidall@clalit.org.il']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20041018,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Fever/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Failure']",2004/10/21 09:00,2005/03/24 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD003992.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2004 Oct 18;(4):CD003992. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD003992.pub2.,,['ACP J Club. 2005 Mar-Apr;142(2):32.

The aim of this study is to circumvent the risk of transmission through blood transfusion and to describe the prevalence of HTLV-I/II antibody among blood donors of Al-Hasa region and the cost effectiveness of screening blood donors. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Department of Laboratory and Blood Bank, King Fahad Hospital, Al-Hofuf, Al-Hasa, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the period of 1997 to 2003. A total of 47426 blood donors were screened for HTLV-I/II antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, during the 7 years of study period. The positive samples were confirmed by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Overall, HTLV-I antibody positivity (confirmed by western blot) was 3/47426 (0.006%). Out of 3 donors positive for HTLV-I antibody during 1997 to 1998, 2 were expatriates (Indian) and one was native Saudi donor. Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I antibody positivity among the native Saudi donors was 1/47426 (0.002%) (2/100000 blood donors). None of the donor were positive for HTLV-II antibody.

The tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of BCR-ABL is known to activate several major signalling pathways in malignant cells, including Ras, JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt with evidence of proteasome-mediated degradation of other targets such as the DNA repair protein DNA-PKcs and cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitor p27. Targeting these abnormalities by blocking TK of BCR-ABL with STI571 provided a promising approach for the therapy of CML. The recent development of resistance to STI571 illustrates, however, that the use of other TK inhibitors could be of major interest for therapeutic purposes. To this end, the TK inhibitor Tyrphostin AG1024 was used to evaluate effect on regulation of BCR-ABL expression, inhibition of cell proliferation and tumour formation in vivo in human and murine BCR-ABL expressing cell lines. Tyrphostin AG1024 was shown to downregulate expression of BCR-ABL and P-Akt, and to upregulate DNA-PKcs expression. In addition, Tyrphostin AG1024 was able to inhibit cell proliferation, and delay tumour growth in vivo. Thus, AG1024 is able to interfere with three major targets of BCR-ABL in leukaemic cells.

METHODS: Tumor lysate pulsed DC were used to generate effector T cells in the murine L615 leukemia model. DC were induced and pulsed with tumor lysate. The splenocytes from the DC based vaccine primed mice were termed VPS. Some VPS were activated with anti-CD3 alone (VPS-CD3), the other cells were activated with a cocktail of cytokines including IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, anti-CD3 and IL-2 (VPSC). RESULTS: Both VPS and VPS-CD3 showed moderate IFN-gamma release to stimulatory tomor cells in vitro and antitumor capacity in vivo. However, VPSC showed much higher IFN-gamma release and far superior antitumor capacity than the other cells in this leukemia model. CONCLUSION: The result here indicates that tumor lysate pulsed DC can be used as a strategy to generate effector T cells which can be further activated with a cocktail of cytokines for adoptive immunotherapy.","['Zhang, Sheng', 'Li, Wen-Feng', 'Zhang, Hong-Jun', 'Wang, Qin']","['Zhang S', 'Li WF', 'Zhang HJ', 'Wang Q']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Medical School Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao 266003, China. wozhangsheng@263.net.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured/immunology/transplantation', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/transplantation', '*Immunotherapy, Active', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/radiation effects']",2004/10/21 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2004 Sep;26(3):243-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of MSI in familial predisposition to colorectal cancer was investigated in this study by both microsatellite analysis and mutation screening of the two major MMR genes MLH1 and MSH2 among familial cases. METHODS: PCR-based microsatellite analysis was performed in blood obtained from 30 members from HNPCC families. Blood samples age matched healthy individuals (n = 28) served as control. MSI was studied at five loci containing single- or dinucleotide repeat sequences and mapping to different chromosomal locations: BAT-25 (at locus 4q12), BAT-26 (2p16), D2S123 (2p16-p21), D5S346 (5q21-q22) and D17S250 (17q11.2-q12). RESULTS: MSI frequency was higher in member of HNPCC families [7/30 (23%)] than in control [3/28 (10.7%)] cases. Two MLH1 and one MSH2 mutations were identified in 7 MSI positive samples from HNPCC families. MLH1/MSH2 mutations were only in MSI high samples detected.

The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility, reliability and safety of the subtotal splenectomy performed by laparoscopic means. METHODS: An experimental study was conducted in accordance with the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals. Fourteen adult mongrel dogs of both sexes were divided into 2 groups (n=7): Group 1 -- laparoscopic subtotal splenectomy, preserving the upper pole supplied by splenogastric vessels; the splenic section, hemostasis and closure was done with a 45 mm linear laparoscopic surgical stapler; Group 2 -- total splenectomy was performed through a median laparotomy. After 3 months, we accomplished hematological, immunological and scintigraphic exams in all animals. Sections of the remnant spleens, livers and lymph nodes were histologically processed. RESULTS: Blood loss was minimal and all animals survived to operation and during the 3 months follow-up. Reduction (p<0.05) of the platelets was verified in Group 1. The rest of the hematological mean values remained normal. The remnant spleens, livers and lymph nodes showed normal histological aspects, with increasing amounts of polymorphonuclear cells observed in both groups.

We administered recombinant CPDG2 (2000 U) intrathecally to seven cancer patients 3 to 9 hours after they had received an accidental overdose of intrathecal methotrexate (median dose = 364 mg; range = 155-600 mg). Four of the seven patients had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exchange to remove methotrexate before CPDG2 administration. Immediate symptoms of the methotrexate overdoses included seizures (n = 5), coma (n = 2), and cardiopulmonary compromise (n = 2). Before CPDG2 administration, the median concentrations of methotrexate in CSF were 264 microM (range = 97-510 microM) among patients who had CSF exchange and 8050 microM (range = 2439-16 500 microM) among patients who did not. After intrathecal CPDG2 administration, methotrexate concentrations in CSF declined by more than 98%. All patients recovered completely from the intrathecal methotrexate overdose except for two patients who had memory impairments. Antibodies to CPDG2 were not detected in plasma after treatment with intrathecal CPDG2.

Birth weight is one of the few pregnancy-related risk factors that has been associated with leukemia risk, but the association has remained poorly characterized. We conducted a population-based case-control study in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland to investigate the association between birth weight (and other birth characteristics) and the risk of childhood leukemia. METHODS: Overall, 1905 children (aged 0-14 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 299 children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 1999, were identified in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology acute leukemia database. Each case patient was matched to five population control subjects (n = 10745) on nationality, age, and sex. All live-born siblings of case patients (n = 3812) and control subjects (n = 17,937) were also identified in population registers. Information on birth weight and gestational age at birth was ascertained from the national Medical Birth Registers. The association between various birth characteristics and leukemia risk was assessed by conditional logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Risk of ALL overall was statistically significantly associated with birth weight (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26 per 1-kg increase in birth weight, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13 to 1.41). The association was similar for B- and T-lineage ALL and across all diagnostic ages (0-14 years). However, children with ALL did not weigh more at birth than their siblings. Statistically significantly reduced risks of B-precursor ALL were observed with increasing position in the birth order (OR = 0.90 per position increase, 95% CI = 0.84 to 0.96) and increasing gestational age (OR = 0.87 per 2-week increase in gestational age, 95% CI = 0.81 to 0.94). Risk of AML did not vary monotonically with birth weight, and low birth weight (<1500 g [i.e., 3.3 pounds]) was associated with the highest risk. CONCLUSION: Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that a high birth weight is associated with an increased risk of ALL.","['Hjalgrim, Lisa Lyngsie', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Westergaard, Tine', 'Thomassen, Harald', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Gustafsson, Goran', 'Kristinsson, Jon', 'Melbye, Mads', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Hjalgrim LL', 'Rostgaard K', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Westergaard T', 'Thomassen H', 'Forestier E', 'Gustafsson G', 'Kristinsson J', 'Melbye M', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Danish Epidemiology Science Center, Statens Serum Institut, Artillerivej 5, 2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark. lih@ssi.dk']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Birth Order', '*Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2004/10/21 09:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['96/20/1549 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djh287 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2004 Oct 20;96(20):1549-56. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djh287.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is a type II C-type lectin that functions as an adhesion receptor and is used by viral and bacterial pathogens to gain access to human DC. We report that DC-SIGN specifically interacts with clinical isolates of A. fumigatus. DC-SIGN-dependent binding of A. fumigatus conidia can be demonstrated with stable transfectants and monocyte-derived DC and is inhibited by anti-DC-SIGN Abs. Binding and internalization of A. fumigatus conidia correlates with DC-SIGN cell surface expression levels and is abolished in the presence of A. fumigatus-derived cell wall galactomannans. The clinical relevance of this interaction is emphasized by the presence of DC-SIGN in lung DC and alveolar macrophages, and further illustrated by the DC-SIGN-dependent attachment of A. fumigatus conidia to the cell membrane of IL-4-treated monocyte-derived macrophages. Our results suggest the involvement of DC-SIGN in the initial stages of pulmonary infection as well as in fungal spreading during invasive aspergillosis.","['Serrano-Gomez, Diego', 'Dominguez-Soto, Angeles', 'Ancochea, Julio', 'Jimenez-Heffernan, Jose A', 'Leal, Juan Antonio', 'Corbi, Angel L']","['Serrano-Gomez D', 'Dominguez-Soto A', 'Ancochea J', 'Jimenez-Heffernan JA', 'Leal JA', 'Corbi AL']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CLEC4M protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (ICAM3 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/immunology/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Binding Sites/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism/microbiology', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lectins, C-Type/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Lung/immunology/metabolism/microbiology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*immunology/metabolism/microbiology', 'Mannans/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/immunology/microbiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Spores, Fungal/immunology/*metabolism']",2004/10/21 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['173/9/5635 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.9.5635 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Nov 1;173(9):5635-43. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.9.5635.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) showed an increased uPAR expression after G-CSF treatment in CD33+ myeloid and CD14+ monocytic cells, whereas mobilized CD34+ HSCs remained uPAR negative. G-CSF treatment also induced an increase in serum levels of soluble uPAR (suPAR). Cleaved forms of suPAR (c-suPAR) were released in vitro by PBMNCs and were also detected in the serum of G-CSF-treated donors. c-suPAR was able to chemoattract CD34+ KG1 leukemia cells and CD34+ HSCs, as documented by their in vitro migratory response to a chemotactic suPAR-derived peptide (uPAR84-95). uPAR84-95 induced CD34+ KG1 and CD34+ HSC migration by activating the high-affinity fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) receptor (FPR). In addition, uPAR84-95 inhibited CD34+ KG1 and CD34+ HSC in vitro migration toward the stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1), thus suggesting the heterologous desensitization of its receptor, CXCR4. Finally, uPAR84-95 treatment significantly increased the output of clonogenic progenitors from long-term cultures of CD34+ HSCs. Our findings demonstrate that G-CSF-induced upregulation of uPAR on circulating CD33+ and CD14+ cells is associated with increased uPAR shedding, which leads to the appearance of serum c-suPAR. c-suPAR could contribute to the mobilization of HSCs by promoting their FPR-mediated migration and by inducing CXCR4 desensitization.","['Selleri, Carmine', 'Montuori, Nunzia', 'Ricci, Patrizia', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Carriero, Maria Vincenza', 'Sidenius, Nicolai', 'Serio, Bianca', 'Blasi, Francesco', 'Rotoli, Bruno', 'Rossi, Guido', 'Ragno, Pia']","['Selleri C', 'Montuori N', 'Ricci P', 'Visconte V', 'Carriero MV', 'Sidenius N', 'Serio B', 'Blasi F', 'Rotoli B', 'Rossi G', 'Ragno P']","['Division of Hematology, Istituto di Endocrinologia ed Oncologia Sperimentale (IEOS), Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Via Pansini 5, I-80131, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041019,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Cell Movement', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tissue Donors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2004/10/21 09:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45838-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-06-2424 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 1;105(5):2198-205. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-06-2424.

Combined exposure of U937 cells to subtoxic concentrations of UCN-01 and L744832 resulted in a dramatic increase in mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and loss of clonogenicity. Similar interactions were noted in other leukemia cells (HL-60, Raji, Jurkat) and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts. Coadministration of L744832 blocked UCN-01-mediated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK), leading to down-regulation of phospho-cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element-binding protein (phospho-CREB) and -p90(RSK) and activation of p34(cdc2) and stress-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SEK/JNK). Combined treatment also resulted in pronounced reductions in levels of phospho-Akt, -glycogen synthase kinase-3 (-GSK-3), -p70(S6K), -mammalian target of rapamycin (-mTOR), -forkhead transcription factor (-FKHR), -caspase-9, and -Bad. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL but not dominant-negative caspase-8 blocked UCN-01/L744832-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis but did not prevent activation of p34(cdc2) and JNK or inactivation of MEK/ERK and Akt. Enforced expression of myristoylated Akt but not constitutively active MEK significantly attenuated UCN-01/L744832-induced apoptosis. However, dual transfection with Akt and MEK resulted in further protection from UCN-01/L744832-mediated lethality. Finally, down-regulation of JNK1 by siRNA significantly reduced the lethality of the UCN-01/L744832 regimen. Together, these findings suggest that farnesyltransferase inhibitors interrupt the cytoprotective Akt and MAPK pathways while reciprocally activating SAPK/JNK in leukemia cells exposed to UCN-01 and, in so doing, dramatically increase mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.","['Dai, Yun', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Pei, Xin-Yan', 'Khanna, Payal', 'Han, Song Iy', 'Mitchell, Clint', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Rahmani M', 'Pei XY', 'Khanna P', 'Han SI', 'Mitchell C', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond VA, 23298, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041019,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (L 744832)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Methionine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/toxicity', 'U937 Cells']",2004/10/21 09:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45899-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-07-2767 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 15;105(4):1706-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2767.

We studied in a clinically relevant canine model of gene therapy the P140K mutant of the drug resistance gene methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT), which encodes a DNA-repair enzyme that confers resistance to the combination of the MGMT inhibitor O(6)-benzylguanine (O(6)BG) and nitrosourea drugs such as carmustine and methylating agents such as temozolomide. Two dogs received MGMT(P140K)-transduced autologous CD34(+)-selected cells. After stable engraftment, gene marking in granulocytes was between 3% and 16% in the 2 animals, respectively. Repeated administration of O(6)BG and temozolomide resulted in a multilineage increase in gene-modified repopulating cells with marking levels of greater than 98% in granulocytes. MGMT(P140K) overexpression prevented the substantial myelosuppression normally associated with this drug combination. Importantly, hematopoiesis remained polyclonal throughout the course of the study. Extrahematopoietic toxicity was minimal, and no signs of myelodysplasia or leukemia were detected.

Ezetimibe is a specific inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption recently introduced into medical practice; its mechanism of action, however, is still unknown. Ezetimibe neither influences the release of cholesterol from mixed micelles in the gut lumen nor the transfer of cholesterol to the enterocyte brush border membrane. With membrane-impermeable Ezetimibe analogues we could demonstrate that binding of cholesterol absorption inhibitors to the brush border membrane of small intestinal enterocytes from the gut lumen is sufficient for inhibition of cholesterol absorption. A 145-kDa integral membrane protein was identified as the molecular target for cholesterol absorption inhibitors in the enterocyte brush border membrane by photoaffinity labeling with photoreactive Ezetimibe analogues (Kramer, W., Glombik, H., Petry, S., Heuer, H., Schafer, H. L., Wendler, W., Corsiero, D., Girbig, F., and Weyland, C. (2000) FEBS Lett. 487, 293-297). The 145-kDa Ezetimibe-binding protein was purified by three different methods and sequencing revealed its identity with the membrane-bound ectoenzyme aminopeptidase N ((alanyl)aminopeptidase; EC 3.4.11.2; APN; leukemia antigen CD13). The enzymatic activity of APN was not influenced by Ezetimibe (analogues). The uptake of cholesterol delivered by mixed micelles by confluent CaCo-2 cells was partially inhibited by Ezetimibe and nonabsorbable Ezetimibe analogues. Preincubation of confluent CaCo-2 cells with Ezetimibe led to a strong decrease of fluorescent APN staining with a monoclonal antibody in the plasma membrane. Independent on its enzymatic activity, aminopeptidase N is involved in endocytotic processes like the uptake of viruses. Our findings suggest that binding of Ezetimibe to APN from the lumen of the small intestine blocks endocytosis of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, thereby limiting intestinal cholesterol absorption.","['Kramer, Werner', 'Girbig, Frank', 'Corsiero, Daniel', 'Pfenninger, Anja', 'Frick, Wendelin', 'Jahne, Gerhard', 'Rhein, Matthias', 'Wendler, Wolfgang', 'Lottspeich, Friedrich', 'Hochleitner, Elisabeth O', 'Orso, Evelyn', 'Schmitz, Gerd']","['Kramer W', 'Girbig F', 'Corsiero D', 'Pfenninger A', 'Frick W', 'Jahne G', 'Rhein M', 'Wendler W', 'Lottspeich F', 'Hochleitner EO', 'Orso E', 'Schmitz G']","['Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH, ein Unternehmen der sanofi-aventis-Gruppe, D-65926 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

A chromosomal translocation between its gene and that of the c-abl kinase ('Philadelphia chromosome') plays a major causative role in that malignancy. Thus most attention has been paid to the role of the protein in hemopoietic cells. However, Bcr is also expressed in other cell types including epithelia. Bcr is generally considered to be a cytoplasmic protein but in addition to its kinase and GTPase exchange and activating domains it contains potentially membrane-interacting pleckstrin homology and C2 domains as well as a PDZ-binding C terminus mediating an interaction with a PDZ-domain protein at intercellular junctions of epithelial cells. We have examined the ability of Bcr to interact with other epithelial PDZ proteins and found specific binding to both the apical PDZK1 protein and the Golgi-localized Mint3. The former is important in the organization of several apical functions and the latter in vesicular trafficking in the secretory pathway.

This initial specification of cell lineage facilitates further differentiation of the inner mass of the embryoid bodies. These processes are considered to recapitulate early embryonic development from the blastocyst stage to the egg-cylinder stage. Formation of the primitive endoderm layer in the embryoid bodies was induced solely by aggregation of embryonic stem cells, in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor/STAT3 and serum/BMP4, which were considered to be sufficient for embryonic stem cell self-renewal. Interestingly, cell aggregation by itself induced Nanog repression at the outer layer, which was essential for aggregation-induced primitive endoderm formation. These data illustrate aggregation-based cell-fate specification during early embryonic development, when downregulation of Nanog plays a crucial role.","['Hamazaki, Takashi', 'Oka, Masahiro', 'Yamanaka, Shinya', 'Terada, Naohiro']","['Hamazaki T', 'Oka M', 'Yamanaka S', 'Terada N']","['Department of Pathology, University of Florida College of Medicine, PO Box 100275, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],,"['DK59699/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR17001/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041019,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Aggregation/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Endoderm/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2004/10/21 09:00,2005/04/12 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.01489 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.01489 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2004 Nov 1;117(Pt 23):5681-6. doi: 10.1242/jcs.01489.

As a paradigm, we generated mouse leukemia virus-based vectors encoding the site-specific recombinase Cre. The vectors were disabled in primer binding site function, blocking reverse transcription of the virion mRNA. While reducing transgene insertion more than 1000-fold and abolishing toxic effects of constitutive Cre expression, transient Cre delivery was still highly efficient, receptor restricted, and insensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of reverse transcription. This form of Cre transfer required the retroviral packaging signal, cap-proximal positioning of the translation unit, as well as gag and env expression in producer cells, revealing retroviral mRNA transfer as the underlying mechanism. Thus, retrovirally delivered mRNA may serve as an immediate translation template if not being reverse transcribed. This approach allows multiple modifications for targeted and reversible cell manipulation with nucleic acids.","['Galla, Melanie', 'Will, Elke', 'Kraunus, Janine', 'Chen, Lei', 'Baum, Christopher']","['Galla M', 'Will E', 'Kraunus J', 'Chen L', 'Baum C']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Integrases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Retroviridae/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2004/10/21 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1097-2765(04)00578-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2004.09.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2004 Oct 22;16(2):309-15. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2004.09.023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existence of elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in bone marrow during early stages of MDS, and the possibility that TNF- proportional, variant suppresses normal hematopoiesis led to studies of attempts to block the activity of TNF-alpha. An anti-TNF monoclonal antibody and an antibody comprised of the soluble extracellular ligand-binding portion of the TNF receptor have both been evaluated recently in several small pilot studies. The recognition that marrow suppression in MDS may, in part, be a T-cell mediated autoimmune process has stimulated various trials of antithymocyte globulin and other similar agents. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, an antibody against CD33 conjugated to the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin, is approved for use in AML and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic agent in MDS. Clinical trials were conducted as either monotherapy or in combination with cytokines such as IL-11 and chemotherapeutic agents including idarubicin, fludarabine, and/or cytarabine.

The failure of therapeutic treatment may be due to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR), mechanisms of which include upregulation of membrane-resident transporters which efflux chemotherapeutic drugs from tumor cells, and failure of the cancer cell to undergo apoptosis in response to chemotherapy. Membrane transporter-based drug efflux transporters have been extensively studied, and agents that block drug efflux have been found and investigated. Presence of P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1, ABCB1), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in AML and MDS. In MDS, Pgp expression increases as the disease progresses. Overexpression of other transporters, such as the multidrug resistance protein (MRP1, ABCC1), and the vault-associated transporter lung resistance protein have been shown as well in both MDS and AML, but their prognostic relevance is not clear. Recently, a novel ABC half-transporter, the breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) has been found in approximately 30% of AML cases, and may play a role in resistance to chemotherapy. In clinical trials in MDS, first-generation Pgp blockers, such as cyclosporin-A and verapamil, were minimally effective, non-specific, and toxic. However, another first-generation blocker, quinine, was used in MDS and may specifically benefit MDS patients overexpressing Pgp. A second-generation drug, the non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine analog valspodar (PSC833), was studied in AML and MDS, and was highly toxic, resulting in the need to reduce the dosage of the chemotherapeutic drugs as a result of valspodar reducing the clearance of the chemotherapeutic agents. Third-generation drugs, which are highly specific for Pgp and which seem to have only modest effects on drug clearance, include tariquidar, zosuquidar, laniquidar, and ONT-093.

Secretion of cytokines and growth factors modulates angiogenesis in the marrow leading to increased vascularity and sustenance of the clonal population. For high-risk MDS patients older than 60 years who are not eligible for aggressive chemotherapy or stem cell transplant, there are few therapeutic options other than supportive treatment. Recent delineation of the pathobiology of MDS has resulted in the development of new agents and treatment modalities that impact on these mechanisms. One of the features of bone marrow pathology is the presence of new vessels, which appear to sustain growth and the hypercellularity of the marrow. Blocking angiogenesis may reduce the microvessel density of the marrow, cellularity, and disease progression. Angiogenesis can be targeted by inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which modulates new vessel growth, by the use of antibodies aimed at VEGF and its receptors, as well as receptor tyrosine kinases that block VEGF signaling. Other agents include inhibitors of farnesyl transferase and protein kinase C, which affect upstream modulators of growth factors and their receptor interactions; matrix metalloproteinases, which disrupt matrices and adhesion function promoting vessel growth; and other inhibitors with broader function, such as endostatin, thalidomide, and related analogues.","['Estey, Elihu H']",['Estey EH'],"['Section of Acute Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Division of Cancer Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Box 428, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. eestey@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Reduced conditioning or nonmyeloablative conditioning, particularly in the elderly, has been attempted with some success. Reduced conditioning also increases the graft-versus-leukemia effect, allowing for a higher percentage of disease-free survival. Current use of peripheral blood as a source of stem cells for autotransplant is associated with an extremely low procedural mortality.

Unfavorable cytogenetics associated with this group of disorders includes monosomy or deletion of the long arm of chromosomes 5 or 7, inversions of chromosome 3, translocations, deletions, and trisomies involving several other chromosomes. These unbalanced chromosomal aberrations result in hemizygosity and unmasking of oncogenes, changes in levels of expressed genes, or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. It is evident that the cytogenetics associated with MDS is highly complex and heterogeneous, leading to an equally heterogeneous manifestation of the disease. Classifications, initially defined by the French-British-American group followed by the World Health Organization, and now by the International Prognostic Scoring System, have determined prognosis and helped develop treatment strategies for these patients, thus reducing their potential to develop acute leukemia. To date there are seven different prognostic schemas. These are constantly being improved so that MDS patients, who tend to be elderly, can be suitably treated. Additionally, treatment considerations and prognosis are different for patients who develop therapy-related MDS or for the juvenile population than for those with de novo MDS. The genetic alterations in MDS bone marrow and blood cells have been identified and possible models have been proposed for the development and progress of MDS, from the early stage to late-stage MDS evolving to acute myeloid leukaemia.

Human T-lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) is associated with HAM/TSP and, in HIV coinfected patients only, rare cases of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Proviral load may be important in the pathogenesis of HTLV-associated disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A real time quantitative PCR assay using SYBR Green intercalation was established. Primers targeting the tax region were standardized against MT2 and MOT cell line DNA for HTLV-I and HTLV-II, respectively. HTLV-I/II copy number was normalized to the amount of cellular DNA by quantitation of the HLA-DQ alpha gene. We measured proviral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a large cohort of 120 HTLV-I and 335 HTLV-II seropositive former blood donors. We also assessed the intra- and inter-assay reproducibility of the assay. RESULTS: Proviral load for HTLV-I infected patients ranged from 3.1 x 10(0) to 1.8 x 10(5)copies/10(6) PBMCs with a mean of 1.6 x 10(4) and a median of 3.0 x 10(3). HTLV-I was undetectable in 7 of 120 cases (5.8%). Proviral load for HTLV-II infected patients ranged from 1.1 x 10(0) to 1.0 x 10(6)copies/10(6) PBMCs with a mean of 2.8 x 10(4) and a median of 5.0 x 10(2). HTLV-II was undetectable in 31 out of 335 cases (9.3%). CONCLUSION: The assay has excellent dynamic range from 10(6) to 10(0)copies/reaction, good intra- and inter-assay reproducibility, and a lower limit of detection of a single copy per reaction. The sensitivity and high dynamic range allow determination of a broad range of HTLV-I/II proviral load in clinical subjects.

Western blots probed with anti-Sp3 detected a high molecular weight Sp3 isoform that is stabilized by a SUMO-1 hydrolase inhibitor, and this protein is also bound by anti-SUMO-1 antiserum. Transient transfection assays with epitope-tagged-SUMO-1 and GFP-SUMO-1 fusion proteins confirmed that Sp3, M1 and M2 proteins are sumoylated in vivo. Substitution of arginine for lysine at one putative site of sumoylation, lysine(551), blocked sumoylation of all Sp3 isoforms in vivo and led to a marginal increase in Sp3-mediated trans-activation in insect and mammalian cells. In contrast, introduction of this amino acid substitution within M1 converted it into a potent transcriptional trans-activator. We conclude that Sp3 isoforms are sumoylated in vivo and this post-translational modification plays an important role in the regulation of Sp3-mediated transcription.","['Spengler, Mary L', 'Kennett, Sarah B', 'Moorefield, K Scott', 'Simmons, Steven O', 'Brattain, Michael G', 'Horowitz, Jonathan M']","['Spengler ML', 'Kennett SB', 'Moorefield KS', 'Simmons SO', 'Brattain MG', 'Horowitz JM']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA53248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA86500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07046/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM065405/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (SP3 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '148710-94-5 (Sp3 Transcription Factor)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ethylmaleimide/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sp3 Transcription Factor', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism']",2004/10/21 09:00,2005/04/27 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(04)00134-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2005 Feb;17(2):153-66. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.06.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among integrin-mediated signals, the activation of ion channels can be included. We demonstrated that a long-lasting activation of hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) potassium channels occurs in both human neuroblastoma and leukaemia cells after the activation of the beta1 integrin subunit. This activation is apparently a determining factor inducing neurite extension and osteoclastic differentiation in both the cell types. More recently, we provided evidences that beta1 integrins and hERG channels co-precipitate in both the cell types. Preliminary results suggest that a macromolecular signalling complex indeed occurs between integrins and the hERG1 protein and that hERG channel activity can modulate integrin downstream signalling.","['Arcangeli, A', 'Becchetti, A', 'Cherubini, A', 'Crociani, O', 'Defilippi, P', 'Guasti, L', 'Hofmann, G', 'Pillozzi, S', 'Olivotto, M', 'Wanke, E']","['Arcangeli A', 'Becchetti A', 'Cherubini A', 'Crociani O', 'Defilippi P', 'Guasti L', 'Hofmann G', 'Pillozzi S', 'Olivotto M', 'Wanke E']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Firenze, Italy. annarosa.arcangeli@unifi.it']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (KCNH6 protein, human)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cation Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/metabolism', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction']",2004/10/21 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['BST0320826 [pii]', '10.1042/BST0320826 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2004 Nov;32(Pt 5):826-7. doi: 10.1042/BST0320826.,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The antitumor effects of JIMB01 in cell culture was detected by MTT staining. JIMB01-induced apoptosis in leukemia and lymphoma cells was tested by Giemsa staining, fluorescent Hoechst33258 staining, as well as DNA gel electrophoresis. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. JIMB01-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation in CEM cell lines was detected by Western blot methods. The activities of caspase-3 and caspase-8 were determined by colorimetric protease assay and that of caspase-9 was determined by fluorescent intensity. RESULTS: This compound showed antiproliferative activities in a panel of nine human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines with IC50 values in the range of 0.25 micromol x L(-10 to 0. 51 micromol x L(-1). Morphological observation and cell cycle analysis indicated that CEM cells were blocked at mitosis phase by JIMB01. The fluorescent Hoechst33258 staining showed apoptotic nuclear degradation dispersed in the cytoplasm of CEM cells exposed to JIMB01 at 0. 80 micromol x L(-1) for 24 h. DNA degradation in the form of a multiple-unit DNA ladder was clearly demonstrated in CEM leukemia cells treated with JIMB01 at 0.15 micromol x L(-1) or higher for 24 h using agarose gel electrophoresis. Bcl-2 phosphorylation became visible, in Western blot, within 6 h in CEM cells treated with JIMB01 at 0.15 micromol x L(-1) or higher for 24 h. JIMB01 increased the activities of caspase-3, -8 and -9 in CEM cells; DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, inhibited the cytotoxicity of JIMB01 in CEM leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: The antitumor mechanism of JIMB01 is that JIMB01 may induce tumor cell apoptosis through Bcl-2 phosphorylation and then caspase passway.","['Li, Jian-Nong', 'Song, Dan-Qing', 'Jiang, Jian-Dong']","['Li JN', 'Song DQ', 'Jiang JD']","['Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China. jiannong@ht.rol.cn.net']",['chi'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Yao Xue Xue Bao,Yao xue xue bao = Acta pharmaceutica Sinica,21710340R,"['0 (3-bromopropionylamino benzoylurea)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Urea/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2004/10/21 09:00,2005/01/04 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Yao Xue Xue Bao. 2004 Jul;39(7):491-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effects of arsenic trioxide were tested in human pancreatic (AsPC-1), colonic (HT-29), and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. In all three cancer cell lines, arsenic trioxide inhibited proliferation in a concentration and time-dependent manner, as measured by 3H-methyl thymidine incorporation and cell counting. Coincident with inhibition of growth, arsenic trioxide induced marked morphologic changes, including reduced cytoplasmic volume, membrane blebbing, and nuclear condensation consistent with apoptosis. Propidium iodide DNA staining at 24 hours revealed cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and an increase in the S phase, while at 72 hr there was G2/M phase arrest with a marked increase in the sub-G0/G1, apoptotic cell population. The DNA fragmentation induced by arsenic trioxide was confirmed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay in all cell lines. Western blot analysis revealed activation of caspase -3, -7, and -9 by arsenic trioxide. Caspase-3 activity was confirmed by demonstrating cleavage of its downstream target, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Expression of the antiapoptosis protein, Bcl-2, was time-dependently decreased. In contrast, arsenic trioxide markedly enhanced the expression of the p21 protein, GADD45 and GADD153, in a time-dependent manner. These findings suggest that arsenic trioxide has potential as a therapeutic agent for these cancers.","['Li, Xinquan', 'Ding, Xianzhong', 'Adrian, Thomas E']","['Li X', 'Ding X', 'Adrian TE']","['Department of Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],,['CA72712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (GADD45A protein, human)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factor CHOP', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/10/21 09:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/cnv-200029068 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2004;22(3):389-400. doi: 10.1081/cnv-200029068.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AML cells showed clear upregulation of CD80, CD83, CD86, CD40, and HLA-DR expression under all culture conditions, without significant differences between these groups. However, the addition of CD40L (as in Group C) showed a slight upregulation in the expression of CD83 and CD86 on leukemic DCs. The leukemic DCs in Groups A and B had higher allogeneic T-cell stimulatory capacities than untreated AML cells, and the addition of CD40L (Group C) enhanced this effect. The function of the cytotoxicity-stimulating autologous T cells was also augmented by the addition of CD40L (Group C).

In the current study, the authors estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of imatinib versus interferon-alpha plus low-dose cytarabine (IFN+LDAC) as first-line therapy for these patients. METHODS: Data from the International Randomized Interferon versus STI571 Study and the literature were used to estimate lifetime costs, survival, and quality-adjusted survival. Survival estimates were based on published survival curves for patients who achieved and those who did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response after treatment with interferon-alpha. RESULTS: The mean estimated survival with first-line imatinib therapy was 15.30 years, compared with 9.07 years with IFN+LDAC. Undiscounted lifetime costs were approximately $424,600 with imatinib and $182,800 with IFN+LDAC. Using a 3% discount rate, the incremental survival gain with imatinib was 3.93 life-years and 3.89 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental discounted lifetime costs were found to be $168,100 higher with imatinib, resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $43,100 per life-year saved (95% confidence interval [95% CI], $37,600-51,100) and $43,300 per QALY (95% CI, $38,300-49,100).

METHODS: Two-year survival and cytogenetic response were determined using data from 553 patients who received first-line imatinib in the International Randomized Interferon versus ST571 Study (IRIS). Long-term survival was modeled on complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) after 2 years. Long-term survival for patients with a CCyR was modeled using data from a cohort study of 317 patients with CCyRs. Long-term survival for patients without a CCyR was modeled using data from a trial of 275 patients who were treated with IFN+LDAC. Computation of lifetime survival estimates for imatinib assumed a proportional hazards relation between survival for an age-matched and gender-matched cohort and survival for patients with and without a CCyR. RESULTS: For IRIS patients receiving imatinib, the estimated survival was 95.8% and the CCyR rate was 73.8%. The average residual life expectancy was estimated to be 16.71 years for CCyR patients and 5.78 years for non-CCyR patients. The estimated life expectancy after treatment with imatinib was 15.30 years, compared with 9.07 years for patients who were treated with IFN+LDAC in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming the relation between CCyR and survival with interferon-alpha holds for imatinib, higher CCyR rates with imatinib therapy will result in an estimated 6.23 life-years gained compared with treatment with IFN+LDAC.","['Anstrom, Kevin J', 'Reed, Shelby D', 'Allen, Andrew S', 'Glendenning, G Alastair', 'Schulman, Kevin A']","['Anstrom KJ', 'Reed SD', 'Allen AS', 'Glendenning GA', 'Schulman KA']","['Center for Clinical and Genetic Economics, Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/10/20 09:00,2004/12/28 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20674 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Dec 1;101(11):2584-92. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20674.,,,,,['(c) 2004 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we characterized human ARHGAP27 gene by using bioinformatics. Complete coding sequence of ARHGAP27 isoform 1, encoding a full-length 889-aa protein, was determined by assembling exon 1 (nucleotide position 143440-144096 of AC091132.16) and most part of FLJ43547 cDNA (nucleotide position 69-3628 of AK125535.1). Complete coding sequence of ARHGAP27 isoform 2, encoding an N-terminally truncated 548-aa protein, was derived from FLJ43547 cDNA. ARHGAP27 isoform 1 consists of exons 1-17, while ARHGAP27 isoform 2 consists of exons 1B, and 2-17. ARHGAP27 gene encoded two isoforms due to alternative splicing of alternative promoter type. ARHGAP27 mRNA was expressed in germinal center B cell, spleen, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer. LOC303583 (NM_ 198759.1) was the representative rat Arhgap27 cDNA.

ARHGAP27 and ARHGAP12 shared the common-domain structure, consisting of SH3, WW, PH, and RhoGAP domains. ARHGAP27 gene was located at human chromosome 17q21, while ARHGAP12 gene was located at human chromosome 10p11. ARHGAP family genes are cancer-associated genes, because their genetic alterations lead to carcinogenesis through the dysregulation of Rho/Rac/ Cdc42-like GTPases.

Therefore, studying their natural prevalence among wild non-human primates is important for planning strategies to prevent the emergence of additional human retroviral pathogens. This article is focused on tracing the origin and evolution of the human T-cell leukemia viruses HTLV-I and HTLV-II in comparison to that of the simian lymphotropic viruses STLV-I, STLV-II and STLV-L, which are phylo-genically classified into a common group called primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLV). Thus, HTLV-I and STLV-I are referred to as PTLV-I and HTLV-II and STLV-II as PTLV-II, whereas STLV-L, which is highly divergent from both HTLV types, comprises a third subgroup called PTLV-L. The phylogeny of PTLV indicates that both, HTLV-I and HTLV-II emerged from a simian origin, but their subsequent evolution continued in different patterns. HTLV-I includes 6 subtypes which evolved from STLV-I through several times of different geographic interspecies transmission between simian and human hosts. These repeated invasions to new primate species are likely to give rise to viral strains with increasing pathogenic potential. On the other hand, HTLV-II includes 4 subtypes which appear to originate from a common human ancestor virus that emerged from only one simian to human transmission, whereas the subsequent evolution of HTLV-II and STLV-II strains continued separately only within the Homo sapiens and Pan paniscus species respectively, without repeated interspecies jumps. Such evolution pattern likely involves less genetic changes and selection of viral strains with low pathogenic virulence that could co-exist with their hosts for long time. These different evolution patterns can explain the much wider implication of HTLV-I with human clinical disorders than HTLV-II. Of note, however, more recently HTLV-II started spreading much more rapidly through intravenous drug users to many geographical regions, with a 150-350 fold higher mutation rate than that of its previous strictly endemic strains. This change in the mode of the virus spread creates a serious risk for emergence of HTLV-II strains with higher virulence.","['Azran, Inbal', 'Schavinsky-Khrapunsky, Yana', 'Priel, Esther', 'Huleihel, Mahmoud', 'Aboud, Mordechai']","['Azran I', 'Schavinsky-Khrapunsky Y', 'Priel E', 'Huleihel M', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cancer Research Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,,IM,"['Animals', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'HIV/classification/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Phylogeny', 'Primate T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/genetics', 'Virulence/*genetics']",2004/10/20 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2004 Nov;14(5):909-15.,,,90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha induces apoptosis through activation of caspase pathway. A monoblastic leukemia cell line, U937, undergoes apoptosis following stimulation with TNF-alpha. We found that Notch activation induced by a recombinant Notch ligand, Delta-1, reduced the TNF-alpha-induced growth suppression and apoptosis in U937 cells. As the molecular mechanism involved, we showed Delta-1 stimulation partially suppressed the sequential activation of caspase-8, caspase-3, and, PARP induced by TNF-alpha. The TNF-alpha-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and NF-kappaB was not affected by Delta-1 stimulation. The cells needed to be exposed to Delta-1 prior to TNF-alpha stimulation to reduce the suppressive effect of TNF-alpha. Therefore, we thought that Delta-1 stimulation might reduce the expression of TNF-receptor (R) 1 and proteins to modulate the activation of caspases such as FLIP and XIAP. However, Delta-1 stimulation did not affect their expression. The precise mechanism by which Notch signaling suppresses caspase activation has yet to be determined.

Increased cell membrane permeability induced by ATP may cause high incorporation of 4HC into leukemia cells, ultimately leading to cell death. In the present study, we show that ATP has cytotoxicity against PC14, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line. When PC14 cells were cultured with 1, 3, and 5 mM ATP, colony number significantly decreased to 91.0, 48.8, and 2.3% respectively, compared to untreated controls. Additionally, ATP enhanced the antitumor effects of etoposide (VP16) in PC14 and another lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549.

In the presence of 3 mM ATP, however, the colony number of PC14 was further limited to 49.6, 34.1, and 24.4% of the untreated level in 5, 25, and 50 mM VP16, respectively. When A549 cells were incubated with 1 mM ATP, the proportion of clonogeneic cells significantly fell to 62.5, 41.7, and 31.7% in 5, 25, and 50 mM VP16, respectively. With 3 and 5 mM of ATP, uptake of [3H]VP16 in PC14 cells increased respectively to 8.9- and 14.1-fold of the negative controls. These results suggest that ATP itself has antitumor effects on lung cancer cells and enhances the cytotoxicity of VP16 through the increased uptake of VP16 into the cells. The combined use of ATP and antitumor agents such as VP16 may have the potential to improve the therapeutic index in human lung carcinoma.","['Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Takahashi, Miki', 'Enomoto, Yuko', 'Takahashi, Noriaki', 'Sawada, Umihiko', 'Horie, Takashi']","['Hatta Y', 'Takahashi M', 'Enomoto Y', 'Takahashi N', 'Sawada U', 'Horie T']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Nihon University School of Medicine, 30-1 Oyaguchi-kami-machi, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan. yhatta@med.nihon-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2004/10/20 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2004 Nov;12(5):1139-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we focused on cellular transport and catalysis of the nucleoside in order to elucidate the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to araC in carcinomas. Activities of two metabolizing enzymes for araC, deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and cytidine deaminase (CDA), and cellular transport of the agent were examined in 9 carcinoma cell lines. These variables in carcinoma lines were compared with those in 14 araC-sensitive leukemia lines and one leukemia line with acquired resistance. The mean IC50 in 9 carcinoma lines was 3 x 10(3)-fold higher than that in 14 leukemia lines (4.6 x 10(3) vs. 1.3 microM, p<0.01). A cell line with acquired resistance (U937R), which was established from U937 monocytoid leukemia cells, showed more than 10(3)-fold higher IC50 than the parent cells (1.6 x 10(3) vs. 1.3 microM). The resistance in carcinomas was associated with higher CDA activity and lower influx when compared to araC sensitive leukemias. Especially, these two types of malignant cell lines were clearly distinguished by CDA activity. The acquired resistance in U937R cells was followed by increase in cytidine deaminase (CDA) activity, decrease in DCK activity and decrease in influx of the drug. In conclusion, carcinomas are intrinsically resistant to cytarabine through high CDA activity and low cellular transport, but not low DCK activity. This finding suggests that treatment of carcinoma with deoxycytidine analogues should conquer the high CDA activity.","['Ohta, Takuya', 'Hori, Hiroki', 'Ogawa, Masahiro', 'Miyahara, Masazumi', 'Kawasaki, Hajime', 'Taniguchi, Norihisa', 'Komada, Yoshihiro']","['Ohta T', 'Hori H', 'Ogawa M', 'Miyahara M', 'Kawasaki H', 'Taniguchi N', 'Komada Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology']",2004/10/20 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2004 Nov;12(5):1115-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook this study to determine the impact of splenectomy on transfusion requirements in patients with chronic leukemia, acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and lymphoma. METHODS: Records of 134 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent splenectomy were reviewed. Results are reported as mean +/- standard error of the mean. RESULTS: Mean preoperative (preop) platelet count was 97 +/- 8 K/microL. A significant rise in platelets, compared with preop, was observed starting on postsplenectomy day 1 (141 +/- 8 K/microL, P < 0.001 versus preop) and persisted through day 7. Counts remained significantly elevated at 3 and 6 months and years 1-5. In profoundly thrombocytopenic patients (preop levels < 20 K/microL), preop count was 11 +/- 1 K/microL. A significant postsplenectomy platelet rise persisted for at least 1 year (137 +/- 52 K/microL, P < 0.05 versus preop). An increased platelet level was observed in all hematologic subgroups; in the chronic leukemias (n = 58, P < 0.01) and in lymphoma (n = 59, P < 0.001), this reached significance. Mean platelet transfusions were significantly decreased from preop (3 months preop: 8.6 +/- 2 units) compared with postsplenectomy (3 months postsplenectomy: 5.0 +/- 1 unit, P = 0.03). This decrease was even more pronounced in profoundly thrombocytopenic patients (31.6 +/- 10.6 units preop versus 8.9 +/- 4.8 units postoperative, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the hematologic malignancies, splenectomy produces a significant and longlasting restoration of platelet levels and a resultant decrease in platelet transfusion requirements. These beneficial effects of splenectomy hold true even for the most profoundly thrombocytopenic patients.","['Berman, Russell S', 'Feig, Barry W', 'Hunt, Kelly K', 'Mansfield, Paul F', 'Pollock, Raphael E']","['Berman RS', 'Feig BW', 'Hunt KK', 'Mansfield PF', 'Pollock RE']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas M.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is an important activator of apoptosis in normal cells; conversely its functional loss may cause drug resistance. The ABL oncoprotein-p53 paradigm represents the relationship between an oncogenic tyrosine kinase and a tumor suppressor gene. Here we show that BCR/ABL oncoproteins employ p53 to induce resistance to DNA damage in myeloid leukemia cells. Cells transformed by the ABL oncoproteins displayed accumulation of p53 upon DNA damage. In contrast, only a modest increase of p53 expression followed by activation of caspase-3 were detected in normal cells expressing endogenous c-ABL. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-like protein kinases (ATR and also ATM) -dependent phosphorylation of p53-Ser15 residue was associated with the accumulation of p53, and stimulation of p21(Waf-1) and GADD45, resulting in G(2)/M delay in BCR/ABL cells after genotoxic treatment. Inhibition of p53 by siRNA or by the temperature-sensitive mutation reduced G(2)/M accumulation and drug resistance of BCR/ABL cells. In conclusion, accumulation of the p53 protein contributed to prolonged G(2)/M checkpoint activation and drug resistance in myeloid cells expressing the BCR/ABL oncoproteins.","['Stoklosa, Tomasz', 'Slupianek, Artur', 'Datta, Mandrita', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Nowicki, Michal O', 'Koptyra, Mateusz', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Stoklosa T', 'Slupianek A', 'Datta M', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Nowicki MO', 'Koptyra M', 'Skorski T']","['Molecular Carcinogenesis Section, Center of Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, 1900 N. 12th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19122, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA83700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041110,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA Interference', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/10/20 09:00,2007/08/08 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1229 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.3.11.1229 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2004 Nov;3(11):1463-72. doi: 10.4161/cc.3.11.1229.

The specificity of RNAi makes it an ideal tool for targeted therapeutics against unique fusion oncogene sequences. RNAi may also be effective against viral-mediated oncogenesis and has the potential to enhance tumor sensitivities to existing chemotherapy. The current interest in the success of RNAi-based therapies will depend on the delivery systems that protect the silencing apparatus from endogenous nucleases, sustain tissue-specific expression of the small-interfering RNAs, and prevent the activation of a destructive nonspecific host immune response.","['Cheng, Jerry C', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M']","['Cheng JC', 'Sakamoto KM']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA. jerryccheng@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],20041115,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tat/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'HIV Infections/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication/genetics', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2004/10/20 09:00,2007/08/08 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1240 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.3.11.1240 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2004 Nov;3(11):1398-401. doi: 10.4161/cc.3.11.1240.

Unlike other polyamines, spermine affected this differentiation by acting as a negative regulator. This negative regulation was established by showing that the PMA-induced macrophage phenotype, but not PMA-associated replication arrest, was abrogated (a) by replenishing the PMA-evoked decrease in cellular spermine levels with this polyamine from an exogenous source and (b) by blocking PMA-induced expression of the polyamine catabolic enzyme N(1)-spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT) with antisense oligonucleotides in the presence of low substrate level. The PMA-evoked reduction in cellular spermine appears to result from an increase in the activity of SSAT and a decrease in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase, the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme. To a degree, these changes are due to corresponding changes in the expression of the genes that code for these enzymes. When cell differentiation is initiated, SSAT expression is increased after PMA-evoked activation of protein kinase C-beta.

In this study, we found that PIs, including ritonavir, saquinavir, and indinavir, inhibited the growth of DU145 and PC-3 androgen-independent prostate cancer cells as measured by a clonal proliferation assay. Recent studies showed that ritonavir inhibited cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) in liver microsomes. The CYP3A4 is involved in drug metabolism and acquisition of drug resistance. To clarify the drug interaction between ritonavir and other anticancer drugs, we cultured DU145 cells with docetaxel either alone or in combination with ritonavir. Ritonavir enhanced the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of docetaxel in the hormonally independent DU145 prostate cancer cells in vitro as measured by the clonogenic soft agar assay and detection of the activated form of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase using Western blot analysis. Real-time PCR showed that docetaxel induced the expression of CYP3A4 at the transcriptional level, and ritonavir (10(-5) mol/L) completely blocked this induction. An ELISA-based assay also showed that ritonavir inhibited DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) in DU145 cells, which is a contributor to drug resistance in cancer cells. Furthermore, combination treatment of docetaxel and ritonavir dramatically inhibited the growth of DU145 cells present as tumor xenografts in BNX nude mice compared with either drug alone. Importantly, docetaxel induced expression of CYP3A4 in DU145 xenografts, and ritonavir completely blocked this induction. Ritonavir also inhibited NFkappaB DNA binding activity in DU145 xenografts. Extensive histologic analyses of the liver, spleen, kidneys, bone marrow, skin, and subcutaneous fat pads from these mice showed no abnormalities. In summary, combination therapy of ritonavir and anticancer drugs holds promise for the treatment of individuals with advanced, drug resistant cancers.","['Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Hisatake, Yasuko', 'Takeuchi, Tamotsu', 'Ohtsuki, Yuji', 'Yang, Yang', 'Said, Jonathan W', 'Taguchi, Hirokuni', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Ikezoe T', 'Hisatake Y', 'Takeuchi T', 'Ohtsuki Y', 'Yang Y', 'Said JW', 'Taguchi H', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA. ikezoet@ed.kochi-ms.ac.jp']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'O3J8G9O825 (Ritonavir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', '*Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Synergism', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'HIV-1/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/drug therapy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/pharmacology', 'Ritonavir/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2004/10/20 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/20/7426 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2677 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Oct 15;64(20):7426-31. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2677.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hereby, we analyzed routine biopsies from 360 acute leukemias of lymphoid (ALLs) and myeloid (AMLs) origin with a specific anti-PAX5 monoclonal antibody. Blasts from 150 B-cell ALLs showed strong PAX5 nuclear expression, paralleling that of CD79a in the cytoplasm. Conversely, PAX5 was not detected in 50 T-cell ALLs, including 20 cases aberrantly coexpressing CD79a. Among 160 cytogenetically/molecularly characterized AMLs, PAX5 was selectively detected in 15 of 42 cases bearing the t(8;21)/AML1-ETO rearrangement. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR studies in t(8;21)-AML showed a similar up-regulation of PAX5 transcript in all of the 8 tested samples (including 4 cases that were negative at anti-PAX5 immunostaining), suggesting that PAX5 is expressed in t(8;21)-AML more widely than shown by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, PAX5(+) t(8;21)-AML also expressed CD79a and/or CD19 (major transcriptional targets of PAX5 in B-cells) in 10 of 12 evaluable cases. Our results indicate that PAX5 is a more specific marker than CD79a for B-cell ALL diagnosis. Moreover, among AMLs, PAX5 expression selectively clusters with t(8;21), allowing its immunohistochemical recognition in a proportion of cases, and likely explaining a peculiar biological feature of this subset of myeloid leukemias, i.e. the aberrant expression of B-cell genes.","['Tiacci, Enrico', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Orleth, Annette', 'Pacini, Roberta', 'Tabarrini, Alessia', 'Frenguelli, Federica', 'Liso, Arcangelo', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Falini, Brunangelo']","['Tiacci E', 'Pileri S', 'Orleth A', 'Pacini R', 'Tabarrini A', 'Frenguelli F', 'Liso A', 'Diverio D', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Falini B']","['Institutes of Hematology and Internal Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/10/20 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/20/7399 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1865 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Oct 15;64(20):7399-404. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1865.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Id2, a negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, has also been proposed as a Myc target gene that drives the proliferative response of Myc by binding to and overriding the checkpoint functions of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein. Targeted deletion of Id2 in mice results in defects in B-cell development and prevents the development of peripheral lymphoid nodes. In precancerous B cells and lymphomas that arise in Emu-Myc transgenic mice and in Burkitt's lymphomas, Id2 is overexpressed, suggesting that it plays a regulatory role in lymphoma development. Surprisingly, despite these connections, Emu-Myc mice lacking Id2 succumb to lethal B-cell lymphoma at rates comparable with wild-type Emu-Myc transgenics. Furthermore, precancerous splenic B cells lacking Id2 do not exhibit any significant defects in Myc-induced target gene transactivation and proliferation. However, due to their lack of secondary lymph nodes, Emu-Myc mice lacking Id2 rather succumb to disseminated lymphoma with an associated leukemia, with pronounced infiltrates of the bone marrow and other major organs.

The 53BP1-PDGFRbeta fusion protein is predicted to retain the kinetochore-binding domain of 53BP1 fused to the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of PDGFRbeta. The presence of the fusion was confirmed by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcription-PCR, and by characterizing the genomic breakpoints. The reciprocal fusion, which would contain the p53-binding 53BP1 BRCA1 COOH-terminal domains, was not detectable by fluorescence in situ hybridization or nested PCR.

Studies were done to address the question whether ATRA-induced apoptosis is a consequence of destabilization of bcl-2 mRNA and decreased cellular levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-2. ATRA induced differentiation of HL-60 cells along the granulocytic pathway within 48 h. The half-lives of bcl-2 mRNA in HL-60 cells incubated with ATRA for 48 or 72 h were reduced to 39 and 7% of the corresponding untreated control values, respectively. Cellular differentiation was accompanied by down-regulation of the cytoplasmic levels of nucleolin, a bcl-2 mRNA-stabilizing protein. Binding of a bcl-2 mRNA instability element (AU-rich element-1) to nucleolin in S100 extracts from ATRA-treated cells was decreased to 15% of control within 72 h. The decay of 5' capped, polyadenylated bcl-2 mRNA transcripts containing ARE-1 was more rapid in S100 extracts from ATRA-treated cells compared with untreated cells. However, when recombinant nucleolin was added to extracts of ATRA-treated cells, the rate of bcl-2 mRNA decay was similar to the rate in extracts of untreated cells.

Complementarity-determining region (CDR) mutagenesis is used to increase antibody affinity but can be difficult to perform successfully. We previously showed that antibodies with increased affinity and immunotoxins with increased activity could be obtained by directing mutations at specific DNA residues called hot spots. Because hot spots can arise either by somatic mutation or be present in the germline, we examined which type of hot spot is preferred for increasing antibody affinity. Initially, a second generation antibody phage-display library targeting a germline hot spot (Ser(30)-Asn(31)) within CDR1 of the antibody light chain was mutated. Substitution of serine 30 or asparagine 31 with arginine produced mutant immunotoxins with an affinity (0.8 nM) increased 7-fold over BL22 (5.8 nM) and 3-fold over the first generation mutant HA22 (2.3 nM). More importantly, a 10-fold increase in activity over BL22 and a 2-3-fold increase over HA22 were observed in various B lymphoma cell lines including WSU-CLL that contains only 5500 CD22 sites per cell. For comparison, two phage-display libraries targeting non-germline hot spots in heavy chain CDR1 and CDR3 were generated but did not produce Fv with increased affinity.

Among hematopoietic disorders and nonhematopoietic neoplasms, CD163 expression was restricted largely to cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, histiocytic sarcoma, sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, and littoral cell angioma. Acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with monocytic differentiation were CD163- with the exception of 1 case of acute monoblastic leukemia. Most myeloid sarcomas also were CD163-. Compared with the CD68 antibodies, CD163 demonstrated greater specificity as a marker of disorders of monocyte/macrophage origin. However, immunohistochemical evaluation of CD163 expression does not seem to be a sensitive means of determining monocytic differentiation in AMLs in paraffin sections or establishing a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma.","['Lau, Sean K', 'Chu, Peiguo G', 'Weiss, Lawrence M']","['Lau SK', 'Chu PG', 'Weiss LM']","['Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', '*Paraffin Embedding', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology/*metabolism']",2004/10/20 09:00,2004/12/23 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['QHD6YFN81KQXUUH6 [pii]', '10.1309/QHD6-YFN8-1KQX-UUH6 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2004 Nov;122(5):794-801. doi: 10.1309/QHD6-YFN8-1KQX-UUH6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach, termed fluorescent ligation detection reaction (f-LDR) is more rapid and cost-effective than oligoprobe Southern blot hybridization (SBH). A standard f-LDR protocol was developed to detect the leukemia-associated chimeric transcripts bcr-abl and promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor a (PML-RARalpha) in 2 multiplex and multicolor assays. The f-LDR platform was 100% specific and demonstrated comparable or better sensitivity than standard oligoprobe SBH. The usefulness of f-LDR was evaluated in 94 posttherapy samples from 13 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia with the PML-RARalpha gene fusion. The f-LDR method was highly concordant (93%) with oligoprobe SBH; essentially all discrepancies were noted to be due to the enhanced sensitivity of f-LDR. We conclude that f-LDR is a highly specific and sensitive post-PCR method with wide potential application.","['Chen, I-Ming', 'Chakerian, Artemis', 'Combs, David', 'Garner, Kelly', 'Viswanatha, David S']","['Chen IM', 'Chakerian A', 'Combs D', 'Garner K', 'Viswanatha DS']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Health Science Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/10/20 09:00,2004/12/23 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['NMUVJJGLHQ7JX6V2 [pii]', '10.1309/NMUV-JJGL-HQ7J-X6V2 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2004 Nov;122(5):783-93. doi: 10.1309/NMUV-JJGL-HQ7J-X6V2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirteen patients underwent a combined total of 64 courses of chemotherapy. Urinary albumin, beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG), N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) and urinary protein were measured before and serially after chemotherapy. RESULTS: The values of albumin/creatinine (albumin/cre) ratio and beta2-MG/creatinine (beta2-MG/cre) ratio after chemotherapy were higher than those before chemotherapy (P <0.01). NAG/creatinine (NAG/cre) ratio and creatinine clearance (Ccr) were not different. These were also examined before the next course of chemotherapy and were compared with those of control children. Albumin/cre ratio was significantly different (P <0.01). beta2-MG/cre ratio and NAG/cre were not different. Furthermore, in patients with normal beta2-MG/cre, the albumin/cre ratio was significantly higher than in control children.

Although less common in haematological malignancies, 10-15% of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) cases carry a p53 mutation. Recently, the compound P53-dependent reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis (PRIMA-1) has been shown to induce cytotoxic effects and apoptosis in human tumour cells by restoration of the transcriptional activity of mutated p53. This is believed to be mediated by a change in the conformation of mutated p53 protein, restoring DNA binding and activation of p53 target genes. We studied the effects of PRIMA-1 and commonly used anti-leukaemic drugs on B-CLL cells from 14 patients with and without hemizygous p53 deletion. Cells obtained from peripheral blood or bone marrow were exposed to PRIMA-1 and fludarabine alone or in combination.

This leads to cure in 50-70% of patients, and also results in significant morbidity and mortality. Hence, we need other ways to improve the cure rate. This review discusses possibilities for tailored therapy, reviewing in vitro cellular drug sensitivity data. The results provide suggestions regarding the adaptation of clinical protocols in certain AML subgroups, although further clinical studies will show whether this is effective. Secondly, we review type 1 genetic abnormalities (such as receptor tyrosine kinase mutations) that result in enhanced survival and proliferation of leukaemic cells, which can be detected in approximately 50% of paediatric AML samples, and are non-randomly associated with French-American-British type and cytogenetic subgroups. FLT3 internal tandem duplication is associated with poor clinical outcome, and may be used for risk-group stratification. The first results with small molecule inhibitors in adult AML do not suggest their use in children as yet.

No specific virus has been definitively linked with childhood leukaemia and there is no evidence to date of viral genomic inclusions within leukaemic cells. The case-control and cohort studies have revealed equivocal results. Maternal infection during pregnancy has been linked with increased risk whilst breast feeding and day care attendance in the first year of life appear to be protective. There is inconclusive evidence from studies on early childhood infectious exposures, vaccination and social mixing. Some supportive evidence for an infectious aetiology is provided by the findings of space-time clustering and seasonal variation. Spatial clustering suggests that higher incidence is confined to specific areas with increased levels of population mixing, particularly in previously isolated populations. Ecological studies have also shown excess incidence with higher population mixing. The marked childhood peak in resource-rich countries and an increased incidence of the childhood peak in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (occurring at ages 2-6 years predominantly with precursor B-cell ALL) is supportive of the concept that reduced early infection may play a role. Genetically determined individual response to infection may be critical in the proliferation of preleukaemic clones as evidenced by the human leucocyte antigen class II polymorphic variant association with precursor B-cell and T-cell ALL.","['McNally, Richard J Q', 'Eden, Tim O B']","['McNally RJ', 'Eden TO']","[""Cancer Research UK Paediatric and Familial Cancer Research Group, Central Manchester and Manchester Children's University Hospitals NHS Trust, Manchester, UK. richard.mcnally@man.ac.uk""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Breast Feeding', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immune System/physiology', 'Parents', 'Population Dynamics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/immunology/*microbiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Environment', 'Vaccination']",2004/10/20 09:00,2004/12/18 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5166 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05166.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Nov;127(3):243-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05166.x.,,,137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oral absorption of 6-MP, however, is quite erratic, with only 16-50% of the administered dose reaching the blood. In this report, water-soluble parenterally administered poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) prodrugs of 6-MP were synthesized using several chemical approaches that enabled the protection of the thiol group through a modification of the benzyl elimination (BE) system. In our earlier work on antimetabolites, it was found that branching of the PEG allowed greater loading of the active drug. This approach was also utilized within this work to give multiloaded systems. The resulting conjugates were stable in pH 7.4 PBS buffer as well as in rat plasma for extended periods. However, these conjugates did act as prodrugs in vivo and a number of PEG-6-MP constructs had significant (P < 0.05) activity in murine leukemia, as well as certain solid tumors, compared with unconjugated 6-MP in a solubilizing vehicle. The fact that some PEG-6-MP conjugates were stable during in vitro plasma dissociation assays, but demonstrated in vivo anticancer activity, suggests extravascular cleavage of the linking group. This work demonstrates that PEG conjugation is an effective means of solubilizing 6-MP for parenteral administration.","['Choe, Yun H', 'Greenwald, Richard B', 'Conover, Charles D', 'Zhao, Hong', 'Longley, Clifford B', 'Guan, Shuiyun', 'Zhao, Qiuxia', 'Xia, Jing']","['Choe YH', 'Greenwald RB', 'Conover CD', 'Zhao H', 'Longley CB', 'Guan S', 'Zhao Q', 'Xia J']","['Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 20 Kingsbridge Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzyl Compounds/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Prodrugs/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics']",2004/10/20 09:00,2005/02/12 09:00,['2004/10/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/0965040041791446 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2004;14(9):455-68. doi: 10.3727/0965040041791446.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her chemotherapy was stopped because of increase in fever, leukopenia and neutropenia. Central venous catheter and peripheral blood cultures were obtained. Fusarium thapsinum was recovered from blood cultures, obtained in two consecutive days. Thereupon central venous catheter of the patient was removed and intravenous amphotericin B was added to the therapy. On the fifth day of febrile neutropenia attack, her fever was decreased after the onset of antifungal therapy. Radiological examinations were normal and no fungal growth was observed in the later blood cultures. On the 21st day of amphotericin B therapy, chemotherapy was started again and amphotericin B was changed to peroral itraconazole (200 mg/day) at the fifth week.

Their effects on proliferation rate and differentiation pattern of hNSCs, however, have not been fully characterized. In this study, we cultured hNSCs in seven regimens, including bFGF, EGF, and LIF, either alone or in combinations. Cells were maintained as neurospheres in treatment media for various periods, up to six passages. A combination of bFGF, EGF, and LIF expanded hNSCs more efficiently than any other treatment as determined by counting total cell numbers using a trypan blue exclusion assay, a WST-1 cell viability assay, and a bromodeoxyuridine incorporation flow cytometric analysis. Differentiation patterns of hNSCs expanded under different conditions were also analyzed. We reported previously that hNSCs primed in vitro with a combination of bFGF, heparin, and laminin (FHL) induced neuronal differentiation toward a cholinergic phenotype. In this study, we show that the FHL priming increases neuronal differentiation while decreasing astroglial generation in all treatment groups as determined by immunostaining. However, cells proliferated under different growth factor conditions do vary in their phenotypic differentiation patterns. Particularly, significant generation of cholinergic cells was observed only in hNSCs expanded with EGF/bFGF or EGF/bFGF/LIF, but not with other treatment regimens, even when they are exposed to the same priming procedure. Our results indicate that hNSCs are highly plastic, with their proliferation and differentiation potential dependent on different growth factor treatments.","['Tarasenko, Yevgeniya I', 'Yu, Yongjia', 'Jordan, Paivi M', 'Bottenstein, Jane', 'Wu, Ping']","['Tarasenko YI', 'Yu Y', 'Jordan PM', 'Bottenstein J', 'Wu P']","['Department of Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555-1043, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Tubulin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Fetus/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Neurons/cytology/*drug effects', 'Prosencephalon/cytology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Time Factors', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",2004/10/19 09:00,2005/03/01 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.20316 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2004 Dec 1;78(5):625-36. doi: 10.1002/jnr.20316.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, there was a direct interaction between cyclin A1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1, as well as a major ATRA receptor, RARalpha, in ATRA-treated cells but not in untreated leukemic cells. Our results indicate that the altered intracellular distribution of cyclin A1 in leukemic cells correlates with the status of the leukemic phenotype.","['Ekberg, Jenny', 'Landberg, Goran', 'Holm, Caroline', 'Richter, Johan', 'Wolgemuth, Debra J', 'Persson, Jenny Liao']","['Ekberg J', 'Landberg G', 'Holm C', 'Richter J', 'Wolgemuth DJ', 'Persson JL']","['Division of Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, University Hospital, Malmo S-20502, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['CA09363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (Cyclin A)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclin A/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Subcellular Fractions/*metabolism']",2004/10/19 09:00,2005/04/02 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208090 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208090 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Dec 2;23(56):9082-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It regulates calcium homeostasis, immunity, cellular differentiation, and other physiological processes. Recently, VDR was found to respond to bile acids as well as other nuclear receptors, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR). The toxic bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA) induces its metabolism through VDR interaction. To elucidate the structure-function relationship between VDR and bile acids, we examined the effect of several LCA derivatives on VDR activation and identified compounds with more potent activity than LCA. LCA acetate is the most potent of these VDR agonists. It binds directly to VDR and activates the receptor with 30 times the potency of LCA and has no or minimal activity on FXR and PXR. LCA acetate effectively induced the expression of VDR target genes in intestinal cells. Unlike LCA, LCA acetate inhibited the proliferation of human monoblastic leukemia cells and induced their monocytic differentiation. We propose a docking model for LCA acetate binding to VDR. The development of VDR agonists derived from bile acids should be useful to elucidate ligand-selective VDR functions.","['Adachi, Ryutaro', 'Honma, Yoshio', 'Masuno, Hiroyuki', 'Kawana, Katsuyoshi', 'Shimomura, Iichiro', 'Yamada, Sachiko', 'Makishima, Makoto']","['Adachi R', 'Honma Y', 'Masuno H', 'Kawana K', 'Shimomura I', 'Yamada S', 'Makishima M']","['Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041016,United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (Bile Acids and Salts)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (lithocholic acid acetate)', '5QU0I8393U (Lithocholic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bile Acids and Salts', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lithocholic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2004/10/19 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2275(20)34080-3 [pii]', '10.1194/jlr.M400294-JLR200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2005 Jan;46(1):46-57. doi: 10.1194/jlr.M400294-JLR200.

Our findings indicate that the translation of short ORFs occurs in vivo whether or not there exists a longer coding region in the downstream of the mRNA. This investigation provides the first direct evidence of translation of upstream ORFs in human cells, which could greatly change the current outline of the human proteome.","['Oyama, Masaaki', 'Itagaki, Chiharu', 'Hata, Hiroko', 'Suzuki, Yutaka', 'Izumi, Tomonori', 'Natsume, Tohru', 'Isobe, Toshiaki', 'Sugano, Sumio']","['Oyama M', 'Itagaki C', 'Hata H', 'Suzuki Y', 'Izumi T', 'Natsume T', 'Isobe T', 'Sugano S']","['Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames/*genetics', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteome', '*Proteomics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2004/10/19 09:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/10b/2048 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.2384604 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2004 Oct;14(10B):2048-52. doi: 10.1101/gr.2384604.,,,,PMC528919,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The agents and cancers considered here are human papillomaviruses (cervical carcinoma); human polyomaviruses (mesotheliomas, brain tumors); Epstein-Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases and nasopharyngeal carcinoma); Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (Kaposi's Sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas); hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma); Human T-cell Leukemia Virus-1 (T-cell leukemias); and helicobacter pylori (gastric carcinoma), which account for up to 20% of malignancies around the globe. The criteria most often used in determining causality are consistency of the association, either epidemiologic or on the molecular level, and oncogenicity of the agent in animal models or cell cultures. However use of these generally applied criteria in deciding on causality is selective, and the criteria may be weighted differently. Whereas for most of the tumor viruses the viral genome persists in an integrated or episomal form with a subset of viral genes expressed in the tumor cells, some agents (HBV, HCV, helicobacter) are not inherently oncogenic, but infection leads to transformation of cells by indirect means. For some malignancies the viral agent appears to serve as a cofactor (Burkitt's lymphoma-EBV; mesothelioma - SV(40)). For others the association is inconsistent (Hodgkin's Disease, gastric carcinomas, breast cancer-EBV) and may either define subsets of these malignancies, or the virus may act to modify phenotype of an established tumor, contributing to tumor progression rather than causing the tumor. In these cases and for the human polyomaviruses the association with malignancy is less consistent or still emerging. In contrast despite the potent oncogenic properties of some strains of human adenovirus in tissue culture and animals the virus has not been linked with any human cancers. Finally it is likely that more agents, most likely viruses, both known and unidentified, have yet to be implicated in human cancer. In the meantime study of tumorigenic infectious agents will continue to illuminate molecular oncogenic processes.","['Pagano, Joseph S', 'Blaser, Martin', 'Buendia, Marie-Annick', 'Damania, Blossom', 'Khalili, Kamel', 'Raab-Traub, Nancy', 'Roizman, Bernard']","['Pagano JS', 'Blaser M', 'Buendia MA', 'Damania B', 'Khalili K', 'Raab-Traub N', 'Roizman B']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and Departments of Medicine and Microbiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Campus Box 7295, Mason Farm Road, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7295, USA. joseph_pagano@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infections/*complications/*microbiology/virology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology/*virology', 'Viruses/*pathogenicity']",2004/10/19 09:00,2005/03/17 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1044579X04000525 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2004.06.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2004 Dec;14(6):453-71. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2004.06.009.,,,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: A patient was diagnosed with bilateral subfoveal infiltration of known systemic acute myelogenous leukemia. He received a standard induction chemotherapy, followed by consolidation therapy for his systemic leukemia. However, despite a complete marrow response, the intraocular tumors did not regress. Therefore, he was given low dose (1950-cGy) ocular external beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: One course of systemic cytarabine chemotherapy failed to control the subfoveal tumors, leaving the patient at risk for permanent vision loss. In contrast, external beam radiation therapy improved his vision from 20/60 in his right eye to 20/20 and from 20/70 in his left eye to 20/25. CONCLUSION: Although systemic chemotherapy can be used to treat intraocular metastasis, external beam radiation may provide more prompt resolution of vision-threatening tumors.","['Finger, Paul T', 'Pro, Michael J', 'Schneider, Susan', 'Kurli, Madhavi', 'Shapira, Ilan', 'Hu, Kenneth']","['Finger PT', 'Pro MJ', 'Schneider S', 'Kurli M', 'Shapira I', 'Hu K']","['The Ocular Tumor Service, The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, New York, New York 10021, USA. pfinger@eyecancer.com <pfinger@eyecancer.com>']",['eng'],,,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Ophthalmol,American journal of ophthalmology,0370500,,IM,"['Adult', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/physiopathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Recovery of Function/*physiology', 'Retinal Neoplasms/physiopathology/*radiotherapy', 'Visual Acuity/*physiology']",2004/10/19 09:00,2004/11/16 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9394(04)00461-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajo.2004.04.047 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ophthalmol. 2004 Oct;138(4):659-62. doi: 10.1016/j.ajo.2004.04.047.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of combined treatment of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-transfected embryonic fibroblasts and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were elucidated and subsequently the in vivo applications of both were tested in an artificial dermal substitute. METHODS: Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, BALB-3T3, were stably transfected with mouse full-length LIF cDNA and added to various doses of VEGF for detection of signaling interaction. LIF-transfected cells and VEGF treatment were tested with pig-tendon derived collagen dermal substitute in the backs of BALB/c male mice up to for 14 days. RESULTS: LIF-transfected cells as well as vector-transfected fibroblasts significantly proliferated by 1, 10, or 100 ng VEGF on days 3 and 5. Erk mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation was observed from 1 to 30 min in LIF-transfected and 10 ng of VEFG, and 1 to 60 min in LIF-transfected and 100 ng VEFG treatments. The cellular fibronectin levels also increased in LIF-transfected cells with 10 and 100 ng VEGF additions. In in vivo analyses, LIF-transfected embryonic fibroblasts with 50 microg of VEGF markedly enhanced collagen I expression and CD34 angiogenic marker on days 7 and 14. CONCLUSION: LIF transfection and VEGF treatment enhanced phosphorylated-Erk-MAP kinase in vitro. In vivo study revealed that the combined application of LIF transfection of embryonic fibroblasts with an angiogenic factor such as VEGF in the template of a dermal substitute induced greater skin collagen production and angiogenesis in the dermal substitute.","['Akita, Sadanori', 'Daian, Takahiro', 'Ishihara, Hiroshi', 'Fujii, Tohru', 'Akino, Kozo']","['Akita S', 'Daian T', 'Ishihara H', 'Fujii T', 'Akino K']","['Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Developmental and Reconstructive Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, 1-7-1 Sakamoto machi, Nagasaki 8528501, Japan. akitas@hf.rim.or.jp']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Dermatol Sci,Journal of dermatological science,9011485,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin/metabolism', 'Time Factors', '*Transfection', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",2004/10/19 09:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S092318110400101X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jdermsci.2004.05.007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dermatol Sci. 2004 Oct;36(1):11-23. doi: 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2004.05.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have shown that the ethanol extract of Physalis peruviana (EEPP) inhibits growth and induces apoptotic death of human Hep G2 cells in culture, whereas proliferation of the mouse BALB/C normal liver cells was not affected. In this study, we performed detailed studies to define the molecular mechanism of EEPP-induced apoptosis in Hep G2 cells. The results further confirmed that EEPP inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At 50 microg/ml, EEPP significantly increased the accumulation of the sub-G1 peak (hypoploid) and the portion of apoptotic annexin V positive cells. EEPP was found to trigger apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 from mitochondria to cytosol and consequently resulted in caspase-3 activation. Pre-treatment with a general caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) prevented cytochrome c release. After 48 h of EEPP treatment, the apoptosis of Hep G2 cells was found to associate with an elevated p53, and CD95 and CD95L proteins expression. Furthermore, a marked down-regulation of the expression of the Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and XIAP, and up-regulation of the Bax and Bad proteins were noted. Taken together, the present results suggest that EEPP-induced Hep G2 cell apoptosis was possibly mediated through the CD95/CD95L system and the mitochondrial signaling transduction pathway.","['Wu, Shu-Jing', 'Ng, Lean-Teik', 'Lin, Doung-Liang', 'Huang, Shan-Ney', 'Wang, Shyh-Shyan', 'Lin, Chun-Ching']","['Wu SJ', 'Ng LT', 'Lin DL', 'Huang SN', 'Wang SS', 'Lin CC']","['Graduate Institute of Natural Products, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', ""116110-46-4 (cytochrome c'')""]",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Physalis/*chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2004/10/19 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(04)00347-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2004.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2004 Nov 25;215(2):199-208. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2004.05.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that CREST is localized to sub-nuclear structures in the rat neuroendocrine pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. A yellow fluorescence protein-CREST fusion protein was expressed in HEK 293 and PC12 cells and the recombinant protein was exclusively targeted to nuclear bodies. A similar result was obtained with a Flag-tagged CREST. Deleting the N-terminal 148 or the C-terminal 79 amino acid sequences had no effect on targeting, whereas removing 164 amino acid residues from the C-terminus abolished nuclear body localization. We found that CREST did not co-localize with promyelocytic leukaemia oncoprotein (PML) body and was not targeted to PML bodies. Overexpression of CREST markedly increased the number of nuclear bodies positive for the histone acetyltransferase CREB binding protein (CBP). Double immunofluorescence staining of Flag-CREST and CBP suggested that CREST and CBP had a high degree of co-localization within the nuclear bodies. Deletion of the CBP binding domain of CREST inhibited the recruitment of CBP to CREST nuclear bodies. These results suggest that CBP recruitment to nuclear bodies by CREST may play an important role in CREST-mediated calcium-responsive transactivation, and CREST nuclear body may function as an assembly site for activators/co-activators in gene transcription control.","['Pradhan, Anuradha', 'Liu, Yuechueng']","['Pradhan A', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, PO Box 26901, Oklahoma City, OK 73190, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Ireland,Neurosci Lett,Neuroscience letters,7600130,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ss18l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (citrate-binding transport protein)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (C-terminal binding protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, rat)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Line/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/10/19 09:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3940(04)01006-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neulet.2004.08.062 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Lett. 2004 Nov 11;370(2-3):191-5. doi: 10.1016/j.neulet.2004.08.062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the protein-coding region of NAT1 is contained within a single exon, examination of the human EST (expressed sequence tag) database at the NCBI revealed the presence of nine separate exons, eight of which were located in the 5' non-coding region of NAT1. Differential splicing produced at least eight unique mRNA isoforms that could be grouped according to the location of the first exon, which suggested that NAT1 expression occurs from three alternative promoters. Using RT (reverse transcriptase)-PCR, we identified one major transcript in various epithelial cells derived from different tissues. In contrast, multiple transcripts were observed in blood-derived cell lines (CEM, THP-1 and Jurkat), with a novel variant, not identified in the EST database, found in CEM cells only. The major splice variant increased gene expression 9-11-fold in a luciferase reporter assay, while the other isoforms were similar or slightly greater than the control. We examined the upstream region of the most active splice variant in a promoter-reporter assay, and isolated a 257 bp sequence that produced maximal promoter activity. This sequence lacked a TATA box, but contained a consensus Sp1 site and a CAAT box, as well as several other putative transcription-factor-binding sites. Cell-specific expression of the different NAT1 transcripts may contribute to the variation in NAT1 activity in vivo.","['Butcher, Neville J', 'Arulpragasam, Ajanthy', 'Goh, Hui Li', 'Davey, Tamara', 'Minchin, Rodney F']","['Butcher NJ', 'Arulpragasam A', 'Goh HL', 'Davey T', 'Minchin RF']","['Centre for Medical Research, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (N-acetyltransferase 1)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma/genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genetic Variation/genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'HT29 Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Melanoma/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*genetics']",2004/10/19 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20040903 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20040903 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Apr 1;387(Pt 1):119-27. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040903.,,,,PMC1134939,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work is to show epidemiologycal concerns about IA in Castilla y Leon and Cantabria: the disease's incidence, the main clinical presentations, the underlaying diseases and diagnostic rules in the laboratory. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 50 cases of IA were obtained from the countries of Castilla y Leon and Cantabria in a two-years (1998-1999) retrospective study. Epidemiology, clinical and diagnostic features including the 14 main institutions were registered and accounted in a single data base. RESULTS: The majority of IA cases were recorded in major institutions possessing haematology units or organ transplantation programs. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was the main feature (39/50 cases) showing serious underlying diseases (25/50 cases) or following organ transplantation programs (15/50 cases). Certain diagnosis was obtained for only ten cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and eleven cases of extrapulmonary stages of IA. In a high number of cases (44/50 cases) conventional microbiological procedures (42/50 showing positive cultures) were developed. Serology investigations were undertaken in eight cases. Serological issues relying on anti-Aspergillus antibodies showed no diagnostic value. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common species involved in IA (33/44 cases). CONCLUSIONS: A low incidence of the disease in this country was reported: with 50 cases in 14 hospital institutions during a two-year period. We observed most cases in large hospital centres performing transplant operations. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was the main clinical setting in immunosupressed patients. Microbiology diagnostic issues relied on conventional methods in particularly on culture.","['Lopez-Medrano, R']",['Lopez-Medrano R'],"['Seccion de Microbiologia, Hospital del Bierzo, C/ la Dehesa-Fuentesnuevas, 24411, Ponferrada, Leon, Espana. ramirozlm@teleline.es']",['spa'],,,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Rev Iberoam Micol,Revista iberoamericana de micologia,9425531,,,,2004/10/19 09:00,2004/10/19 09:01,['2004/10/19 09:00'],"['2004/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/19 09:01 [medline]', '2004/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['20011870 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Iberoam Micol. 2001 Jun;18(2):70-5.,['Grupo de Microbiologos de la Sociedad Castellano-Leonesa de Microbiologia'],,,,,,,Aspergilosis invasora en Castilla y Leon y Cantabria: anos 1998 y 1999.,,,,,,,,,,,

It is caused by members of the order Mucorales, and it is considered to be the most fatal fungal infection known to man because it is rapidly disseminated by the blood vessels. It is most commonly associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, hematologic malignancies, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and immunosuppressive therapy. This rare opportunistic infection exists in many forms, the most common of which is rhinocerebral mucormycosis. Treatment includes aggressive surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue combined with systemic antifungal therapy.

An exacerbated type-1 immune response with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) is significantly higher in patients with myelopathy associated to HTLV-I than in HTLV-I asymptomatic carriers. In contrast with HTLV-I, a chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection is associated with a type-2 immune response with high levels of interleukin (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) and low levels of IFN-gamma. In this study, clinical and immunological consequences of the HTLV-I and S. mansoni infection were evaluated. The immune response in patients with schistosomiasis co-infected with HTLV-I showed low levels of IL-5 (p < 0.05) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures stimulated with S. mansoni antigen (SWAP) and decreased SWAP-specific IgE levels when compared with patients with only schistosomiasis (p < 0.05). Liver fibrosis was mild in all HTLV-I co-infected patients. Immunological response was also compared in individuals who had only HTLV-I infection with those who were co-infected with HTLV-I and helminths (S. mansoni and Strongyloides stercoralis). In patients HTLV-I positive co-infected with helminths the IFN-gamma levels were lower than in individuals who had only HTLV-I. Moreover, there were fewer cells expressing IFN-gamma and more cells expressing IL-10 in individuals co-infected with HTLV-I and helminths. These dates indicate that HTLV-I infection decrease type 2-response and IgE synthesis and are inversely associated with the development of liver fibrosis. Moreover, helminths may protect HTLV-I infected patients to produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-gamma.","['Santos, Silvane Braga', 'Porto, Aurelia Fonseca', 'Muniz, Andre Luiz', 'Jesus, Amelia Ribeiro de', 'Carvalho, Edgar M']","['Santos SB', 'Porto AF', 'Muniz AL', 'Jesus AR', 'Carvalho EM']","['Servico de Imunologia, Hospital Universitario Professor Edgard Santos, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Rua Joao das Botas, s/n, 40110-160 Salvador, BA, Brazil.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041013,Brazil,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,7502619,"['0 (Antigens, Helminth)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Helminth/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/immunology/*virology', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*immunology', 'Schistosomiasis mansoni/*complications/immunology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2004/10/16 09:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0074-02762004000900022 [pii]', '10.1590/s0074-02762004000900022 [doi]']",ppublish,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2004;99(5 Suppl 1):121-6. doi: 10.1590/s0074-02762004000900022.

The objective of this study was to identify the factors affecting the in-hospital mortality of these particular patients, and to assess whether the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) was protective in our study population. DESIGN: We retrospectively collected variables in 166 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies who had acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring MV, and identified factors obtained within 24 h of ICU admission affecting in-hospital mortality in univariate and multivariate stepwise logistic regression analyses. The effect of NPPV on mortality was assessed using a pair-wise matched exposed-unexposed analysis. RESULTS: The mean simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II was 58.9. The in-hospital mortality rate was 71%. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the in-hospital mortality rate was predicted by increasing severity of illness, as measured by SAPS II (odds ratio [OR] per point of increase, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.11) and a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.05 to 7.11). Female sex (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.82), endotracheal intubation (ETI) within 24 h of ICU admission (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.78), and recent bacteremia (defined as blood cultures positive for bacteria < 48h before or < 24h after ICU admission) [OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.61] were associated with a lower mortality rate. Twenty-seven patients who received NPPV were matched for SAPS II (+/- 3) with 52 patients who required immediate ETI on a 1:2 basis. The crude in-hospital mortality rate was 65.4% in both groups. CONCLUSION: Although the in-hospital mortality rate in hematologic patients who develop ARF remains high, the reluctance to intubate and start treatment with invasive MV in this population is unjustified, especially when bacteremia has precipitated ICU admission.","['Depuydt, Pieter O', 'Benoit, Dominique D', 'Vandewoude, Koenraad H', 'Decruyenaere, Johan M', 'Colardyn, Francis A']","['Depuydt PO', 'Benoit DD', 'Vandewoude KH', 'Decruyenaere JM', 'Colardyn FA']","['Department of Intensive Care, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, 9000 Ghent, Belgium. pdepuydt@msn.com']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Chest,Chest,0231335,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Health Status Indicators', '*Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Intubation, Intratracheal', 'Leukemia/complications/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/mortality', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/mortality', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/complications/*mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/10/16 09:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-3692(15)31310-6 [pii]', '10.1378/chest.126.4.1299 [doi]']",ppublish,Chest. 2004 Oct;126(4):1299-306. doi: 10.1378/chest.126.4.1299.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These heterodimers bind to DNA and activate the transcription of target genes. Here, we report that the PPAR gamma receptor protein is expressed in primary myeloid and lymphoid leukemias and in lymphoma and myeloma cell lines. In this study, we compared the activity of several PPAR gamma ligands including BRL49653 (rosiglitazone), 15-deoxy-Delta 12,14-prostaglandin J(2), and the novel triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid on leukemia cells. Exposure to these PPAR gamma ligands induced apoptosis in myeloid (U937 and HL-60) and lymphoid (Su-DHL, Sup-M2, Ramos, Raji, Hodgkin's cell lines, and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia) cells. A similar exposure to these PPAR gamma ligands induced the differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells. A combination of PPAR gamma ligands with a retinoid X receptor agonist (i.e., LG100268) or a retinoic acid receptor agonist (i.e., all trans-retinoic acid) enhanced differentiating and growth-inhibitory effects. 2-Cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid induced differentiation and apoptosis with much greater potency than the other PPAR gamma ligands in established cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples. Exposure to 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation, which was associated with apoptosis induction. In Bcl-2-overexpressing chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, the small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor HA14-1 sensitized these cells to 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that PPAR gamma ligation alone and in combination with retinoids holds promise as novel therapy for leukemias by activating the transcriptional activity of target genes that control apoptosis and differentiation in leukemias.","['Konopleva, Marina', 'Elstner, Elena', 'McQueen, Teresa J', 'Tsao, Twee', 'Sudarikov, Andrey', 'Hu, Wei', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'Wang, Rui-Yu', 'Chism, David', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Younes, Anas', 'Collins, Steven J', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Konopleva M', 'Elstner E', 'McQueen TJ', 'Tsao T', 'Sudarikov A', 'Hu W', 'Schober WD', 'Wang RY', 'Chism D', 'Kornblau SM', 'Younes A', 'Collins SJ', 'Koeffler HP', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy and Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['P50 CA100632-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA89346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (1-(2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oyl) imidazole)', '0 (15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', '9002-18-0 (Agar)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Agar/chemistry', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Dimerization', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'PPAR gamma/*metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors/*metabolism', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",2004/10/16 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['3/10/1249 [pii]'],ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2004 Oct;3(10):1249-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As clofarabine is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RnR), we hypothesized that clofarabine will modulate ara-c triphosphate accumulation and increase the antileukemic activity of cytarabine (ara-C). We conducted a phase 1-2 study of clofarabine plus ara-C in 32 patients with relapsed acute leukemia (25 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), 4 high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 1 blast-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).(1) Clofarabine was given as a 1-hour intravenous infusion for 5 days (days 2 through 6) followed 4 hours later by ara-C at 1 g/m(2) per day as a 2-hour intravenous infusion for 5 days (days 1 through 5). The phase 2 dose of clofarabine was 40 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days. Among all patients, 7 (22%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 5 (16%) achieved CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), for an overall response rate of 38%. No responses occurred in 3 patients with ALL and CML. One patient (3%) died during induction. Adverse events were mainly less than or equal to grade 2, including transient liver test abnormalities, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, mucositis, and palmoplantar erythrodysesthesias. Plasma clofarabine levels generated clofarabine triphosphate accumulation, which resulted in an increase in ara-CTP in the leukemic blasts. The combination of clofarabine with ara-C is safe and active. Cellular pharmacology data support the biochemical modulation strategy.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Gandhi, Varsha', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Bonate, Peter', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Wierda, William', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Du, Min', 'Kwari, Monica', 'Keating, Michael', 'Plunkett, William', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Faderl S', 'Gandhi V', ""O'Brien S"", 'Bonate P', 'Cortes J', 'Estey E', 'Beran M', 'Wierda W', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Estrov Z', 'Giles FJ', 'Du M', 'Kwari M', 'Keating M', 'Plunkett W', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, Box 428, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA. sfaderl@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,"['CA101354/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041014,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenine Nucleotides', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/10/16 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)46777-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-05-1933 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 1;105(3):940-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-05-1933.

Elevated ROS levels in BCR-ABL-transformed cells were found to be blocked by the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone as well as the glucose transport inhibitor phloretin, suggesting that the source of increased ROS might be related to increased glucose metabolism. The glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) reduced ROS to levels found in non-BCR-ABL-transformed cells and inhibited cell growth alone or in cooperation with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). A mutant of BCR-ABL that is defective in transformation of myeloid cells, Tyr177Phe, was also found to be defective in raising intracellular ROS levels. Glucose metabolism in BCR-ABL-transformed cells is likely to be mediated by activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which is regulated through this site. Inhibition of PI3K or mTOR led to a significant decrease in ROS levels. Overall, our results suggest that elevated levels of ROS in BCR-ABL-transformed cells are secondary to a transformation-associated increase in glucose metabolism and an overactive mitochondrial electron transport chain and is specifically regulated by PI3K.

Varying concentrations of metal mono- and bis-histidine complexes will be formed and the inhibition of 65Zn uptake could be correlated with the calculated complex concentrations to investigate competition between metals. For each metal, the calculated concentrations of bis-histidine complex giving 50% inhibition of 65Zn uptake were similar at both 5 mM and 40 mM histidine. Manganese-bis-histidine appeared to have a much higher affinity for the binding site than the other metal-bis-histidine complexes, which had similar affinities to each other. Studies of the inhibition of histidine-stimulated 54Mn uptake by the addition of manganese confirmed that manganese-bis-histidine does act as a substrate for the transporter in a similar fashion to the other metals studied. In addition, human erythroleukaemic cells (HEL cells) were used as a model for erythroid precursor cells. L-histidine, but not D-histidine, stimulated 65Zn uptake in a saturable fashion.

Both the capacity for metal transport per cell, and the affinity of the transporter for the metal-bis-histidine complexes, were much greater in the HEL cells than in the erythrocyte.

Although it is clear that glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis requires transcription, the gene products that induce apoptosis remain unknown. Using gene expression profiles of lymphoma cell lines and primary thymocytes treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, we discovered that induction of tdag8 (T-cell death-associated gene 8) was a common event in each model system investigated. Activation of TDAG8 by its agonist psychosine markedly enhanced dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in a TDAG8-dependent manner. Expression of a TDAG8-GFP fusion protein was sufficient to induce apoptosis, and repression of endogenous TDAG8 using RNA interference partially inhibited dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that TDAG8 is a regulator of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and that agonists of TDAG8 may be promising agents to improve the efficacy of glucocorticoids for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma.","['Malone, Michael H', 'Wang, Zhengqi', 'Distelhorst, Clark W']","['Malone MH', 'Wang Z', 'Distelhorst CW']","['Department of Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, 10900 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],,"['P30 CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA042755/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA059366-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041012,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (GPR65 protein, human)', '0 (GPR65 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '2238-90-6 (Psychosine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glucocorticoids/*chemistry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Psychosine/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/chemistry/*physiology', 'Sphingosine/chemistry']",2004/10/16 09:00,2005/02/05 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(18)81917-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M408040200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Dec 17;279(51):52850-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M408040200.

However, this proteolytic event could be actively induced by the NF-kappa B-inducing kinase and the human T-cell leukemia virus-encoded oncoprotein Tax or be constitutively turned on due to the loss of the C-terminal portion of p100. Whereas NF-kappa B-inducing kinase-mediated p100 processing requires beta-transducin repeat-containing protein, constitutive processing of p100 is independent of this protein. On the other hand, Tax-induced processing of p100 appears to be both beta-transducin repeat-containing protein-dependent and -independent. We show here that, besides the C-terminal sequences, multiple functional regions, including the two alpha-helices, dimerization domain, nuclear localization sequence, and glycine-rich region, located in the N terminus of p100, also play important roles in both constitutive and inducible processing, suggesting a common mechanism for p100 processing. We further demonstrate that with the help of the C-terminal death domain and I kappa B kinase alpha-targeting serines, the C-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain of p100 strongly interacts with its N-terminal dimerization domain and nuclear localization sequence, thereby bringing the C- and N-terminal sequences together to form a three-dimensional domain. This presumptive domain is not only responsible for suppression of constitutive processing but also required for inducible processing of p100. Taken together, these studies highlight the mechanism by which the different sequences within p100 work in concert to regulate its processing and shed light on the mechanisms of how p100 processing is tightly and delicately controlled.","['Qing, Guoliang', 'Qu, Zhaoxia', 'Xiao, Gutian']","['Qing G', 'Qu Z', 'Xiao G']","['Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041014,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis']",2004/10/16 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)76559-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M406619200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Jan 7;280(1):18-27. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M406619200.

METHODS: Eighteen patients who failed to obtain CR before transplantation received very-high-dose conditioning regimen protocol (experimental group), and 62 patients with acute leukemia with CR or with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase before transplantation received total body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide (CTX) or modified BuCY (hydroxyurea, busulfan, Ara-C, CTX) protocol (control group). In patients with refractory leukemia who did not develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 30 d after the transplantation, GVL was induced by rapid reduction of the dosage of cyclosporin A or by donor lymphocytic infusion. The incidence and mortality of RRT and the rates of CR, GVHD and leukemia relapse after transplantation were investigated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis model was used to estimate the disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 3 years post-transplantation. RESULTS: Except for one patient in the experimental group and two in the control group who died of transplantation- related complications, all the other patients obtained hematopoietic reconstitution. The total incidence of RRT was 100% in both groups, involving most frequently the stomach and intestines at the rate as high as 83.3% in the experimental group and 85.5% in the control group. RRT involving the oral cavity occurred in 44.4% and 62.9%, and that involving the bladder in 16.7% and 33.9% of the cases in the experimental group and control group, respectively, all similar between the groups (P=0.823, 0.172 and 0.244, respectively). The RRT mortality was 0 and 5% in the experimental and control groups, respectively (P=0.341). With the exception of one patient who died of infection, all the other patients treated with very-high-dose conditioning regimen obtained CR. The incidences of acute/chronic GVHD were 58.8%/92.6% and 40.0%/55.8%, respectively, in the experimental and control groups. The incidence of leukemia relapse was 11.8% and 18.3%, and DFS at 3 years after transplantation was (61.2+/-12.3)% and (65.0+/-7.4)% (P=0.6311) in the two groups, respectively.

Two cases of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), one associated with an insect bite-like reaction and the other with a true hypersensitivity to mosquito bites, have previously been reported in the English language literature. The pathogenesis of the skin eruption may be related to the release of different cytokines that also trigger an IgE elevation and dermal eosinophils. CASE REPORT: We describe two additional cases of MCL associated with an insect bite-like reaction. One patient had been diagnosed with MCL 4.5 years prior to the appearance of the skin eruption, and in the other patient the skin symptoms preceded the diagnosis of the MCL by 2 years and led to its diagnosis.

Our study included 52 patients (age 20-78 years). The initial anagrelide dose was, in general, 0.5 mg once daily and mean maintenance dosage was 1.7 mg/day. The overall response rate was 79% including 75% complete remission and 4% partial remission. Forty-two patients (81%) had adverse effects and in 29% of the study population, the adverse effects necessitated cessation of anagrelide. The most common adverse effect was moderate anaemia (50%). Two patients experienced erectile dysfunction which has been described only once previously in association with anagrelide treatment. One patient progressed to acute leukaemia. However, this patient had been pre-treated with two potentially leukaemogenic drugs and had only been in short-term treatment with anagrelide. Furthermore, a total of 13 events were recorded. More than 25% of these events occurred in patients with platelet counts between 400 and 600 x 10(9)/l and almost 40% of all events occurred in patients with platelet counts above 400 x 10(9)/l. This observation supports the hypothesis that aggressive control of thrombocytosis to a platelet count <400 x 10(9)/l might reduce the number of thrombohaemorrhagic events. Anagrelide is safe and effective in reducing the platelet counts, but a high proportion of the patients discontinue treatment because of the adverse effects of the drug.","['Penninga, E', 'Jensen, B A', 'Hansen, P B', 'Clausen, N T', 'Mourits-Andersen, T', 'Nielsen, O J', 'Hasselbalch, H C']","['Penninga E', 'Jensen BA', 'Hansen PB', 'Clausen NT', 'Mourits-Andersen T', 'Nielsen OJ', 'Hasselbalch HC']","['Department of Haematology, National University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/chemically induced', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*drug therapy', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytosis/drug therapy', 'Thromboembolism/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/10/16 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH637 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2257.2004.00637.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2004 Oct;26(5):335-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2257.2004.00637.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of new pathways and target molecules in leukemia has ushered in a promising new era of therapy.

Responses have not correlated with the presence of Ras mutations, suggesting that novel pathways are involved. In several early trials, FTIs have shown activity as single agents in poor-risk AML, suggesting a potential role in combination with standard chemotherapy.

The purpose of the current study was to determine whether socioeconomic factors were associated with HSCT usage rates in patients with leukemia. METHODS: The authors identified 6574 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or other leukemias from the 1999 Texas Hospital Inpatient Discharge Public Use Data File. Of these patients, 1604 received an autologous or allogeneic HSCT. The authors assessed patients' ethnicity, payer status, age, gender, and comorbid medical conditions. Logistic regression was used to control for patient characteristics and to evaluate associations among payer status, ethnicity, and HSCT use. P < or = 0.05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: Patients who self-paid had the highest rate of HSCT use in all age groups (32%; P < or = 0.01) and in the adult group (36%; P = 0.11). Elderly patients with Medicare had a low rate of HSCT use (17%; P = 0.13). Logistic regression showed no statistically significant associations between payer status or ethnicity and HSCT use. However, elderly women were significantly less likely to undergo HSCT than elderly men (odds ratio, 0.34; P < or = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of statistically significant differences in HSCT use among adult patients with leukemia was surprising because previous studies had shown differences in HSCT by ethnicity and insurance.","['Hwang, Jessica P', 'Lam, Tony P', 'Cohen, Deborah S', 'Donato, Michele L', 'Geraci, Jane M']","['Hwang JP', 'Lam TP', 'Cohen DS', 'Donato ML', 'Geraci JM']","['Department of General Internal Medicine, Ambulatory Treatment and Emergency Care, The University of Texas M.

The primary purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether there was evidence of palliative effects associated with suramin at any of the three doses administered in the original clinical trial. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed advanced hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma of the prostate were randomized to receive suramin at a low dose (n = 129; median age, 69 years), an intermediate dose (n = 129; median age, 71 years), or a high dose (n = 127; median age, 70 years) as part of the Intergroup 0159/Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9480 trial. Patients completed a battery of assessment tools, including the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Prostate, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), the Brief Pain Inventory, and an opioid medication log, at baseline, on Day 1 of the sixth week of active therapy, during the second week after treatment termination, and 3 months after administration of the final suramin dose. RESULTS: Patients who received low-dose suramin reported improvement in QOL (FACT-General: P < 0.01; FACT-Treatment Outcome Index: P < 0.01) and decreased levels of depression (CES-D: P < 0.0006) during treatment compared with patients in the intermediate- and high-dose arms. After treatment, all groups experienced equal decreases in FACT and CES-D scores. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of results suggests that the lowest dose of suramin administered had a palliative effect in terms of improvement in QOL and decreased levels of depression and that this effect was lost once suramin was discontinued.","['Ahles, Tim A', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Small, Eric J', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Stadler, Walter', 'Palchak, David', 'Marshall, M Ernest', 'Wilding, George', 'Petrylak, Daniel', 'Holland, Jimmie C']","['Ahles TA', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Small EJ', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Kornblith AB', 'Ratain MJ', 'Stadler W', 'Palchak D', 'Marshall ME', 'Wilding G', 'Petrylak D', 'Holland JC']","['Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Department of Psychiatry, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.

Hsp90 client proteins involved in oncogenic survival signaling are frequently mutated in leukemia, and the integrity of the Hsp90 complex could therefore be important for leukemic cell survival. We demonstrate here that p23 is cleaved to a stable 17 kDa fragment in leukemic cell lines treated with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. The cleavage of p23 paralleled the activation of procaspase-7 and -3 and was suppressed by the caspase-3/-7 inhibitor DEVD-FMK. In vitro translated 35S-p23 (in reticulocyte lysate) was cleaved at D142 and D145 by caspase-7 and -3. Cleavage of p23 occurred in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, suggesting a role for caspase-7 in intact cells. The Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin enhanced caspase-dependent p23 cleavage both in vitro and in intact cells. Geldanamycin also enhanced anthracycline-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. We conclude that p23 is a prominent target in leukemic cell apoptosis. Geldanamycin enhanced p23 cleavage both by rendering p23 more susceptible to caspases and by enhancing chemotherapy-induced caspase activation.

We explored Ig variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain gene usage in highly stable and indolent B-CLL (n=25) who never required treatment over 10 or more years. We observed an unexpectedly high usage of mutated VH3-72 (6/25; 24.0%), a gene that was otherwise rare in B-CLL (7/805; 0.87%; P<0.01), including mutated cases (6/432; 1.39%; P<0.01) and was exceptional among indolent (1/230, 0.435%; P<0.01), and aggressive B-cell lymphomas (0/105; P<0.01). Three of six VH3-72 B-CLL cases utilized the same VL Vkappa4-1 gene. Two V(H)3-72 B-CLL cases had highly homologous VH complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3s), encoding Cys-XXXX-Cys domains, and utilized Vkappa4-1 genes with homologous IgVL CDR3s. An identical threonine to isoleucine change at codon 84 of V(H)3-72 framework region 3 (FR3) recurred in four cases of highly stable VH3-72 B-CLL. This mutation is expected to cause a conformational change of FR3 proximal to CDR3 that might critically affect high-affinity antigen binding. B-cell receptors encoded by VH3-72 may identify a specific B-CLL group and be implicated in leukemogenesis through an antigen-driven expansion of B cells.","['Capello, D', 'Guarini, A', 'Berra, E', 'Mauro, F R', 'Rossi, D', 'Ghia, E', 'Cerri, M', 'Logan, J', 'Foa, R', 'Gaidano, G']","['Capello D', 'Guarini A', 'Berra E', 'Mauro FR', 'Rossi D', 'Ghia E', 'Cerri M', 'Logan J', 'Foa R', 'Gaidano G']","['Hematology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences & IRCAD, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['GENBANK/AF103057', 'GENBANK/AF103194', 'GENBANK/AF103257', 'GENBANK/AF129753', 'GENBANK/AF471540', 'GENBANK/AF471541', 'GENBANK/AF471542', 'GENBANK/AF471543', 'GENBANK/AF471545', 'GENBANK/AJ008218', 'GENBANK/AJ009524', 'GENBANK/AJ231563', 'GENBANK/AJ275377', 'GENBANK/AJ275422', 'GENBANK/AJ407996', 'GENBANK/AJ415013', 'GENBANK/AY206989', 'GENBANK/D83679', 'GENBANK/S76904', 'GENBANK/Z11950', 'GENBANK/Z37300', 'GENBANK/Z80700']",,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/chemistry/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/chemistry/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/chemistry/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/chemistry/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",2004/10/16 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403537 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403537 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Dec;18(12):1941-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403537.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MAPK p38 was constitutively activated in B-CLL, but not in normal peripheral B cells. In addition, we demonstrated that the upstream kinases of p38, MKK3/6 were also constitutively activated in B-CLL cells. Furthermore, we determined by EMSA that the p38 MAP kinase pathway was not linked to the constitutive high expression of NF-kappaB, a critical survival factor of B-CLL cells. Recently, it has been shown that serum levels of angiogenic factors like VEGF, bFGF and MMP-9 are elevated in the serum of CLL patients and correlate with an unfavorable prognosis. We showed that the constitutive expression of MMP-9 was dependent on p38-activity and inhibition of p38 strongly downregulated MMP-9 expression. Coculture of B-CLL cells and stromal cells can protect spontaneous apoptosis of leukemic B cells. To determine the role of permanently activated p38 and MMP-9 expression, we cocultured B-CLL cells with bone marrow stromal cells. Survival of B-CLL cells on stroma was severely impaired when p38 was inhibited. Furthermore, blockade of MMP-9 activity also antagonized the antiapoptotic effect of stromal cells.","['Ringshausen, I', 'Dechow, T', 'Schneller, F', 'Weick, K', 'Oelsner, M', 'Peschel, C', 'Decker, T']","['Ringshausen I', 'Dechow T', 'Schneller F', 'Weick K', 'Oelsner M', 'Peschel C', 'Decker T']","['IIIrd Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. iringshausen@cc.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*enzymology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 6/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Stromal Cells/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2004/10/16 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403544 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403544 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Dec;18(12):1964-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403544.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL cells generate increased levels of radical species such as superoxide and nitric oxide (NO), which is associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations. Considering that NO levels can affect mitochondrial biogenesis, we hypothesized that the inherent nitrosative stress in CLL cells may lead to hyperactive mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we report that primary CLL cells contained significantly more mitochondria than normal lymphocytes and that their mitochondrial mass was significantly related to endogenous NO levels. Expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis factors nuclear respiratory factor-1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A was elevated in most CLL specimens examined and appeared to be related to cellular NO levels. Treatment of B cells with exogenous NO caused a substantial increase in mitochondrial mass. In vitro sensitivity of CLL cells to fludarabine was highly related to mitochondrial mass in that cells with greater mitochondrial mass were less sensitive to the drug. Taken together, our results suggest that NO is a key mediator of mitochondrial biogenesis in CLL and that modulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by NO may alter cellular sensitivity to fludarabine.","['Carew, J S', 'Nawrocki, S T', 'Xu, R H', 'Dunner, K', 'McConkey, D J', 'Wierda, W G', 'Keating, M J', 'Huang, P']","['Carew JS', 'Nawrocki ST', 'Xu RH', 'Dunner K', 'McConkey DJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA100428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (NRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1)', '0 (TFAM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (mitochondrial transcription factor A)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1', 'Organelle Biogenesis', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2004/10/16 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403545 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403545 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Dec;18(12):1934-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403545.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiepitope T-cell vaccines are more likely to generate a broad long-lasting immune response than those composed of single epitopes. We recently reported a novel multivalent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte peptide construct derived from the Tax protein of HTLV-1 separated by arginine spacers that elicited high cellular responses against individual epitopes simultaneously in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 transgenic mice. We now report the effect of epitope orientation on the processing of the multiepitope construct by 20s proteasomes and the effect of the processing rates on the immunogenicity of the intended epitopes. A positive correlation was found between processing rates and the immunogenicity of the intended epitopes. The construct with the highest immunogenicity for each epitope was tested for protective efficacy in a preclinical model of infection using HTLV-1 Tax recombinant vaccinia virus and HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. Mice vaccinated with the multiepitope construct displayed a statistically significant reduction in viral replication that was dependent on CD8 T cells. Reduction in viral replication was also confirmed to be specific to Tax-vaccinia virus. These results demonstrate the activation of Tax-specific CD8+ T cells by vaccination and are supportive of a multivalent peptide vaccine approach against HTLV-1 infections.,"['Sundaram, Roshni', 'Lynch, Marcus P', 'Rawale, Sharad', 'Dakappagari, Naveen', 'Young, Donn', 'Walker, Christopher M', 'Lemonnier, Francois', 'Jacobson, Steven', 'Kaumaya, Pravin T P']","['Sundaram R', 'Lynch MP', 'Rawale S', 'Dakappagari N', 'Young D', 'Walker CM', 'Lemonnier F', 'Jacobson S', 'Kaumaya PT']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],,['A140302/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Epitopes', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/*genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*immunology', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics/*immunology']",2004/10/16 09:00,2005/10/27 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['00126334-200411010-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/00126334-200411010-00001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2004 Nov 1;37(3):1329-39. doi: 10.1097/00126334-200411010-00001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reviews the control of Akt activation by the opposing actions of the oncogene phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) and the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10. The activation of Akt by transforming mutations, such as the amplification of HER-2/neu in breast cancer and the formation of the BCR/ABL fusion gene in chronic myelogenous leukemia, seems to be essential for the transforming activity of these oncogenes. We discuss several of the proposed mechanisms for the antiapoptotic effect of activated Akt, including the inhibition of the proapoptotic protein Bad, downregulation of death receptors, and enhancement of the glycolytic rate. Increased glycolysis is seen in many malignancies and forms the basis for the increasing use of positron emission tomography imaging for diagnosis and staging. Finally, we discuss rapamycin and its analogs, which are now in trials as antineoplastic therapy; these agents show particular promise in tumors in which Akt has been activated.","['Thompson, James E', 'Thompson, Craig B']","['Thompson JE', 'Thompson CB']","['University of Pennsylvania, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, 421 Curie Blvd, Room 450 BRB II/III, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160, USA.']",['eng'],,"['K08-HL73977-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-HL07439-24/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics/physiology', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2004/10/16 09:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/20/4217 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2004.01.103 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Oct 15;22(20):4217-26. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.01.103.,,,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Colombia)].,462-6,"OBJECTIVES: This study describes the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of adult patients with blood cancer and neutropenic enterocolitis treated in the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (National Cancer Institute) in Bogota, Colombia. METHODS: The clinical histories of 692 adult patients hospitalized in the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia between 1997 and 2001 with a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma were reviewed. Thirty-five of these cases met the criteria for probable or confirmed neutropenic enterocolitis. RESULTS: Twenty-two cases were confirmed and the remaining 13 were probable neutropenic enterocolitis. All patients were undergoing chemotherapy and all presented watery diarrhea and abdominal pain. In addition, 17% had melena and 25% severe vomiting. Eight of 26 stool cultures (30%) and 17 of 32 (58%) blood cultures were positive for potentially pathogenic microorganisms, particularly gram-negative bacilli. Three patients with probable neutropenic enterocolitis and ten confirmed cases died (37%); mortality was higher among patients who were managed surgically. CONCLUSION: Neutropenic colitis presents as a multifactorial syndrome in patients with blood cancer undergoing cytotoxic therapy with agents such as cytosine arabinoside, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and corticoids. This highly lethal complication is partly due to infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.","['Cardona, Andres Felipe', 'Combariza, Juan Felipe', 'Reveiz, Ludovic', 'Ospina, Edgar Guillermo', 'Poveda, Claudia Marcela', 'Ruiz, Carlos Adrian', 'Ramos, Pedro', 'Aponte, Diego Mauricio']","['Cardona AF', 'Combariza JF', 'Reveiz L', 'Ospina EG', 'Poveda CM', 'Ruiz CA', 'Ramos P', 'Aponte DM']","['Servicio de Medicina Interna, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.']",['spa'],,,['Journal Article'],,Spain,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica,9104081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Colombia/epidemiology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Enterocolitis, Neutropenic/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/etiology/microbiology', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/etiology/microbiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Inpatients', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2004/10/16 09:00,2005/02/05 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['13066853 [pii]', '10.1157/13066853 [doi]']",ppublish,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin. 2004 Oct;22(8):462-6. doi: 10.1157/13066853.,,,,,,,,Caracteristicas clinicas y microbiologicas de la colitis neutropenica en adultos con neoplasias hematologicas del Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia de Bogota D.C.

During the past 13 years, 34 patients with trisomy 8 (+8) and previous diagnoses of refractory anemia with excess blasts in myelodysplastic syndromes were followed and studied in our institute. None of the patients had been given cytotoxic drugs before the leukemia became apparent. Eighteen patients (52.9%) had a history of 3 months to more than 20 years before cytogenetic detection of +8.

However, DNA methylation is also involved in malignancies because aberrant methylating gene activity occurs during leukemic transformation. Thus, genes such as tumor suppressor genes, growth-regulatory genes, and adhesion molecules are often silenced in various hematopoietic malignancies by epigenetic inactivation via DNA hypermethylation. This inactivation is frequently seen not only in transformed cell lines but also in primary leukemia cells. Because this defect is amenable to reversion by pharmacologic means, agents that inhibit DNA methylation have been developed to specifically target this hypermethylation defect in leukemia and preleukemia cases. The most clinically advanced agents, the azanucleosides 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine), were discovered more than 25 years ago, when their methylation-inhibitory activities, even at low concentrations, became apparent. Although both of these agents, like cytarabine, had been clinically used until then at high doses, the redevelopment of these agents for low-dose schedules has revealed very interesting clinical activities for treating myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because these diseases occur mostly in patients over 60 years of age, low-dose schedules with these compounds provide a very promising approach in such patient groups by virtue of their low nonhematologic toxicity profiles. In the present review, we describe the development of treatments that target DNA hypermethylation in MDS and AML, and clinical results are presented. In addition, pharmacologic DNA demethylation may be viewed as a platform for biological modification of malignant cells to become sensitized (or resensitized) to secondary signals, such as differentiating signals (retinoids, vitamin D3) and hormonal signals (eg, estrogen receptor in breast cancer cells, androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells). Finally, an in vitro synergism between the reactivating potency of demethylating agents and inhibitors of histone deacetylation has been tested in several pilot studies of AML and MDS treatment. Finally, gene reactivation by either group of compounds results in therapeutically meaningful reactivation of fetal hemoglobin in patients with severe hemoglobinopathies, extending the therapeutic range of derepressive epigenetic agents to nonmalignant hematopoietic disorders.","['Ruter, Bjorn', 'Wijermans, Pierre W', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Ruter B', 'Wijermans PW', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Albert-Ludwigs- University (ALU) Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*DNA Methylation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics']",2004/10/16 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/16 09:00'],"['2004/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.04094 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Aug;80(2):128-35. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.04094.,,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only mature DC are able to initiate adaptive immune responses by sensitising naive antigen-specific T cells. For clinical immunotherapeutic applications, safe and efficient clinical grade maturation factors of DC are required. Here, we investigated the impact of OM-197-MP-AC (OM-197), a synthetic lipid A analogue pseudo-dipeptide derived from amino acids linked to three fatty acid chains, on the maturation of human monocyte-derived-DC (Mo-DC) and leukemia-derived DC generated in serum-free conditions. After culture with clinical grade GM-CSF and IL-13, OM-197 at 20 microg/ml efficiently induced CD83+ Mo-DC. In comparison to immature Mo-DC that were derived by culture with GM-CSF and IL-13 only, CD40, CD80, CD86, HLA-ABC and HLA-DR molecules were up-regulated upon OM-197 or LPS treatment similarly. In MLR, OM-197-matured Mo-DC were found to be as potent stimulators as LPS-matured Mo-DC for CD4+ T cell proliferation. No significant difference in IFN-gamma quantification was shown between naive CD4+ T cells stimulated by LPS- or OM-197-Mo-DC suggesting that OM-197-Mo-DC can drive naive T cells towards a Th1 response profile that was mainly independent of IL-12 secretion. Similarly, CD8+ T cells could be efficiently polarized into IFN-gamma-secreting-cells by OM-197-Mo-DC, and activated polyclonal pp65-cytomegalovirus-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes. Finally, myeloid leukemic blasts were able to differentiate in vitro into mature functional DC-like cells upon OM-197 treatment in our culture model. Overall, the in vitro effects of clinical grade adjuvant OM-197, showed that it represents a potent inducer of both normal and leukemic-DC maturation, and is likely a good candidate for adjuvant immunotherapy in DC-based vaccines.","['Veran, Julie', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Gaugler, Beatrice', 'Chiavaroli, Carlo', 'Olive, Daniel']","['Veran J', 'Mohty M', 'Gaugler B', 'Chiavaroli C', 'Olive D']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie des Tumeurs, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Universite de la Mediterranee, 232 Bd.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CCG 1922 accrued patients from March 1993 to August 1995. A total of 1,060 patients were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: oral 6MP plus prednisone (OP), intravenous 6MP plus prednisone (IP), oral 6MP plus dexamethasone (OD), and intravenous 6MP plus dexamethasone (ID). During the 2nd through 4th month of therapy groups OP and OD were treated with 75 mg/m(2)/day of oral 6MP for 70 days and groups IP and ID with 1,000 mg/m(2)/week of intravenous 6MP over 10 hr for 11 doses. All patients received a single delayed intensification and all received oral 6MP in maintenance. RESULTS: Patients randomized to oral 6MP had significantly better 5-year overall survival (96 +/- 1% vs. 92 +/- 1%; P = 0.008). There was, however, no statistically significant difference in the event-free survival (EFS). Of the 179 patients who relapsed, 84 had a second or later event and 68 have died. Forty of the 84 second events were a death. Survival after relapse was significantly greater for patients randomized to oral 6MP during consolidation than those receiving intravenous 6MP (P = 0.002, log rank test) with 4-year survival post-relapse of 67 +/- 6% vs. 48 +/- 6%. The steroid randomization had no influence on outcome. Post-relapse therapy details are not available and if different between groups may have influenced the outcome. CONCLUSION: Treatment with intravenous 6MP during a brief period of total therapy had a significant negative impact on the prognosis in childhood ALL even though oral 6MP was used during maintenance.","['Tolar, Jakub', 'Bostrom, Bruce C', 'La, Mei K', 'Sather, Harland N']","['Tolar J', 'Bostrom BC', 'La MK', 'Sather HN']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],,['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Life Tables', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Recurrence', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate']",2004/10/14 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20239 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jul;45(1):5-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20239.,,"['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jul;45(1):2-4.

With a median follow-up time of 63 months, the 5-year survival rate was 38% and the 5-year CR duration rate was 38%. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for CR duration identified the following adverse factors: age > or = 45 years, leukocytosis > or = 50 x 10(9)/L, poor performance status (an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 3-4), Ph-positive disease, French-American-British L2 morphology, > 1 course to achieve CR, and Day 14 bone marrow blasts > 5%. Patients were divided into low-risk (risk score 0-1; 37%), intermediate risk (risk score 2-3; 36%), and poor-risk groups (risk score > or = 4; 27%) with 5-year CR duration rates of 52%, 37%, and 10%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the previous VAD regimens, Hyper-CVAD was associated with significantly better CR rates, CR duration, and survival. The long-term follow-up results of Hyper-CVAD were favorable. Comparison of Hyper-CVAD with other established adult ALL regimens is warranted.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Thomas, Deborah', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Giles, Francis', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Koller, Charles', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Keating, Michael', 'Freireich, Emil J']","['Kantarjian H', 'Thomas D', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Giles F', 'Jeha S', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Pierce S', 'Shan J', 'Koller C', 'Beran M', 'Keating M', 'Freireich EJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The first is that certain selenium compounds such as sodium selenite have pro-oxidant ability to catalyze the oxidation of thiols and simultaneously generate superoxide. The second lies in the exquisite susceptibility of NB4 cells to arsenic trioxide-induced, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis due to less efficiency of the cellular defense system. In this study, we demonstrated that sodium selenite could induce apoptosis in NB4 cells via the classic mitochondrial pathway involving caspase-3 activation and Bcl-2 cleavage. An increase in the basal cellular glutathione (GSH) content rendered NB4 cells resistant to arsenic trioxide, but could sensitize NB4 cells to sodium selenite. Moreover, combined treatment of NB4 cells with all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) at low concentration and sodium selenite exhibited a synergistic effect on apoptosis induction. Together, our results suggest that selenite is a promising candidate for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and the mechanism underlying its anticancer effects warrants further investigation.","['Zuo, Lu', 'Li, Jian', 'Yang, Yang', 'Wang, Xuan', 'Shen, Ti', 'Xu, Cai-min', 'Zhang, Zhi-nan']","['Zuo L', 'Li J', 'Yang Y', 'Wang X', 'Shen T', 'Xu CM', 'Zhang ZN']","[""Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, 100730, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041006,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sodium Selenite/*pharmacology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2004/10/14 09:00,2005/03/18 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0920-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Dec;83(12):751-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0920-5.

Research to define reasons for this increase is extensive, but has not yet resolved them. We have conducted a literature analysis on trends regarding changes in the incidence, geographic distribution, and etiologic factors of NHL. From our own and previous analyses, an increasing NHL incidence at a rate of 3-4% per year was observed for the 1970s and 1980s. This stabilized in the 1990s, nevertheless still with an annual rise of 1-2%, resulting in almost a doubling of the NHL incidence. This rise has been noted worldwide, particularly in elderly persons >55 years. Concerning gender subgroups, a male predominance throughout all age groups is apparent. Although the NHL incidence has historically been higher in whites than blacks, disproportional increases have recently been observed in the latter group. Increases in high-grade NHL and extranodal disease are predominant. Differences in geographic distribution are striking for follicular lymphoma, which is more common in Western countries than elsewhere. Asians have higher rates of aggressive NHL, T-cell lymphomas, and extranodal disease. In the Middle East, high rates of intestinal extranodal disease are observed, whereas in Africa, endemic Burkitt's lymphoma accounts for a substantial proportion. Risks for developing NHL include immunosuppression and a causal link between infectious agents, and lymphomagenesis has also been determined, particularly for human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Helicobacter pylori infections. Exposure to environmental agents and occupational risks have been studied; however, their significance is as yet uncertain.","['Muller, Antonia M S', 'Ihorst, Gabriele', 'Mertelsmann, Roland', 'Engelhardt, Monika']","['Muller AM', 'Ihorst G', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Engelhardt M']","['Hematology and Oncology Department, University of Freiburg Medical Hospital, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20041009,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/complications', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Infections/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Topography, Medical']",2004/10/14 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0939-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Jan;84(1):1-12. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0939-7.

We have previously shown that Ad5 E1B-55kDa possesses a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), which confers rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling via the CRM1-dependent export pathway. In this study we report that an export-deficient mutant of the viral protein (E1B-NES) substantially enhances focus formation of primary baby rat kidney cells in combination with Ad E1A. Transformed rat cells stably expressing the E1B-NES protein exhibited increased tumorigenicity and accelerated tumor growth in nude mice compared to transformants containing the wild-type E1B product. This 'gain of function' correlated with enhanced inhibition of p53 transactivation in transient reporter assays and the accumulation of the mutant protein and p53 in several dot-like subnuclear aggregates. Interestingly, these structures also contained a large fraction of cellular promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), a known regulator of p53. These data indicate that E1B-NES promotes oncogenic transformation by combinatorial mechanisms that involve modulation of p53 in the context of PML nuclear bodies. In sum, these results extend our previous observation that inhibition of PML activities by E1B-55kDa is required for efficient focus formation and provide further support for the view that blocking p53 transcriptional functions is the principal mechanism by which the Ad protein contributes to complete cell transformation in conjunction with Ad E1A.","['Endter, Christian', 'Hartl, Barbara', 'Spruss, Thilo', 'Hauber, Joachim', 'Dobner, Thomas']","['Endter C', 'Hartl B', 'Spruss T', 'Hauber J', 'Dobner T']","['Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universitat Regensburg, Landshuterstrasse 22, D-93047 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Adenoviridae/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Karyopherins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Sorting Signals/physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",2004/10/14 09:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208170 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208170 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Jan 6;24(1):55-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208170.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After exposure to antigen, further diversification is accomplished by means of somatic hypermutation of the antibody variable region genes and class-switch recombination between the heavy-chain mu constant region and the downstream gamma, epsilon, and alpha constant region. The variable region mutations are responsible for the affinity maturation of the antibody response, whereas class-switch recombination enables the antibodies to be distributed throughout the body and to carry out different effector functions. Both somatic mutation and class switching require an enzyme called activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) that converts deoxycytidines to deoxyuracils on single-stranded DNA. Genetic defects of AID in human subjects result in hyper-IgM syndrome type 2. The analysis of both mutant mice and immunodeficient patients has led to a better understanding of the mechanism of action and role of AID in immunity, as well as in the malignant transformation of B cells.","['Luo, Zhonghui', 'Ronai, Diana', 'Scharff, Matthew D']","['Luo Z', 'Ronai D', 'Scharff MD']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],,"['AI 43937/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 102705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 72649/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Antibody Diversity/*immunology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/immunology', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/immunology']",2004/10/14 09:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0091674904021682 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2004.07.049 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2004 Oct;114(4):726-35; quiz 736. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2004.07.049.,,,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present a retrospective analysis of KIR-ligand-matched (n=167) and mismatched (n=23) unrelated ASCTs for hematologic malignancies performed at a single center. We observed that KIR-ligand mismatch was associated with increased transplantation-related mortality (P=0.02), leading to decreased overall survival (P=0.01). The increased transplantation-related mortality was a consequence of a higher rate of infections (P=0.01), whereas incidence of graft-versus-host disease and leukemic relapse did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease and its treatment with steroids are identified as main risk factors. In a single-center, prospective cohort study of patients undergoing allogeneic SCT for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute lymphatic leukemia, we determined the incidence of hip AVN necessitating total arthroplasty (severe adverse event) and performed risk factor analysis. METHODS: A total of 255 patients were followed for an observation period of at least 4 years. Thirteen potential risk factors including age, recipient and donor gender, underlying disease and disease stage, conditioning therapy, human leukocyte antigen match, acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease, and immunosuppressive medication were tested in univariate and multifactorial nominal logistic and Cox proportional hazard analyses. RESULTS: Severe adverse events occurred in eight patients (4-year cumulative incidence rate 6.1%). Univariate and multifactorial analysis revealed a diagnosis other than CML and steroid intake as main risk factors (chi model 31.6, P=0.0005; chi diagnosis 11, P=0.001; chi steroid 6.8, P=0.009). The demonstrably strong influence of diagnosis was steroid independent (steroid intake in CML comparable to non-CML). We repeated the analysis in 103 patients without CML (70 with acute myeloid leukemia, 13 with myelodysplastic syndrome, and 20 with acute lymphatic leukemia), excluding 152 patients with CML. Univariate and multifactorial analyses revealed female gender (of both recipient and donor) as risk factors for AVN in addition to steroids. Relative AVN risk for female compared with male donor transplantation was 8.7 (P=0.01); relative AVN risk for female compared with male recipient transplantation was 4.3 (P=0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis and gender are steroid-independent risk factors for severe hip AVN after allogeneic SCT.","['Schulte, Claudia M S', 'Beelen, Dietrich W']","['Schulte CM', 'Beelen DW']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital of Essen, Germany. claudia.schulte@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteonecrosis/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/10/14 09:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['00007890-200410150-00017 [pii]', '10.1097/01.tp.0000138026.40907.38 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2004 Oct 15;78(7):1055-63. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000138026.40907.38.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such restriction, human Ref1, targets strains of murine leukemia virus bearing an arginine at CA residue 110 (N-MLV), resulting in decreased accumulation of viral cDNA. The cellular factors accounting for Ref1 activity are unknown. As(2)O(3) increases N-MLV titer in Ref1-positive cells, possibly by counteracting Ref1. Restriction factor saturation experiments suggest that Ref1 may also target human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but only if its CA is not bound to the cellular protein cyclophilin A (CypA). As a step towards understanding the genetic determinants of Ref1, we subjected Ref1-positive TE671 cells to three sequential rounds of selection with N-MLV reporter viruses. We isolated a subclone, 17H1, that was permissive for N-MLV infection and therefore deficient in Ref1 activity. Stimulation of N-MLV replication by As(2)O(3) was attenuated in 17H1, confirming that the drug acts by overcoming Ref1 activity. HIV-1 infection of 17H1 cells was resistant to disruption of the CA-CypA interaction, demonstrating that Ref1 restricts CypA-free HIV-1.

Both ts1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infect astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes but do not infect neurons. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the neuropathology of AIDS dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. We report here that ts1 infection of astrocytes (both transformed C1 cells and primary cultures) also induces thiol (i.e., glutathione and cysteine) depletion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, events occurring in parallel with viral envelope precursor gPr80(env) accumulation and upregulated expression of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones GRP78 and GRP94. Furthermore, ts1-infected astrocytes mobilize their thiol redox defenses by upregulating levels of the Nrf-2 transcription factor, as well its targets, the xCT cystine/glutamate antiporter, gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase, and glutathione peroxidase. Depleting intracellular thiols by treating uninfected astrocytes with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a glutathione synthesis inhibitor, or by culturing in cystine-deficient medium, also induces ROS accumulation, activates Nrf-2, and upregulates Nrf-2 target gene expression in these astrocytes. Overexpression of Nrf-2 in astrocytes specifically increases expression of the above thiol synthesis-related proteins. Further treatment with BSO or N-acetylcysteine in transfected cells modulates this expression. Thiol depletion also accelerates cell death, while thiol supplementation promotes survival of ts1-infected cells. Together, our results indicate that ts1 infection of astrocytes, along with ts1-induced gPr80(env) accumulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, thiol depletion, and oxidative stress, accelerates cell death; in response to the thiol depletion and oxidative stress, astrocytes activate their Nrf-2-mediated thiol antioxidant defenses, promoting cell survival.","['Qiang, Wenan', 'Cahill, Jodi M', 'Liu, Jinrong', 'Kuang, Xianghong', 'Liu, Na', 'Scofield, Virginia L', 'Voorhees, Jennifer R', 'Reid, Amy J', 'Yan, Mingshan', 'Lynn, William S', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Qiang W', 'Cahill JM', 'Liu J', 'Kuang X', 'Liu N', 'Scofield VL', 'Voorhees JR', 'Reid AJ', 'Yan M', 'Lynn WS', 'Wong PK']","['University of Texas, M.

However, the mechanism by which APOBEC3G is packaged into virions remains unclear. We now report that viral genomic RNA enhances but is not essential for human APOBEC3G packaging into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions. Packaging of APOBEC3G was also detected in HIV-1 Gag virus-like particles (VLP) that lacked all the viral genomic RNA packaging signals. Human APOBEC3G could be packaged efficiently into a divergent subtype HIV-1, as well as simian immunodeficiency virus, strain mac, and murine leukemia virus Gag VLP. Cosedimentation of human APOBEC3G and intracellular Gag complexes was detected by equilibrium density and velocity sucrose gradient analysis. Interaction between human APOBEC3G and HIV-1 Gag was also detected by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction did not require p6, p1, or the C-terminal region of NCp7. However, the N-terminal region, especially the first 11 amino acids, of HIV-1 NCp7 was critical for HIV-1 Gag and APOBEC3G interaction and virion packaging. The linker region flanked by the two active sites of human APOBEC3G was also important for efficient packaging into HIV-1 Gag VLP. Association of human APOBEC3G with RNA-containing intracellular complexes was observed. These results suggest that the N-terminal region of HIV-1 NC, which is critical for binding to RNA and mediating Gag-Gag oligomerization, plays an important role in APOBEC3G binding and virion packaging.","['Luo, Kun', 'Liu, Bindong', 'Xiao, Zuoxiang', 'Yu, Yunkai', 'Yu, Xianghui', 'Gorelick, Robert', 'Yu, Xiao-Fang']","['Luo K', 'Liu B', 'Xiao Z', 'Yu Y', 'Yu X', 'Gorelick R', 'Yu XF']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, 615 N.

Adult T-cell leukemia development is mainly due to the ability of the viral oncoprotein Tax to promote T-cell proliferation, whereas the appearance of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy involves the antigenic properties of Tax. Understanding the events regulating the intracellular level of Tax is therefore an important issue. How Tax is degraded has not been determined, but it is known that Tax binds to proteasomes, the major sites for degradation of intracellular proteins, generally tagged through polyubiquitin conjugation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Tax, ubiquitin, and proteasomes. We report that mono- and polyubiquitinated Tax proteins can be recovered from both transfected 293T cells and T lymphocytes. We also show that lysine residues located in the carboxy-terminal domain of Tax are the principal targets of this process. Remarkably, we further demonstrate that mutation of lysine residues in the C-terminal part of Tax, which massively reduces Tax ubiquitination, impairs proteasome binding, and conversely, that a Tax mutant that binds poorly to this particle (M22) is faintly ubiquitinated, suggesting that Tax ubiquitination is required for association with cellular proteasomes. Finally, we document that comparable amounts of ubiquitinated species were found whether proteasome activities were inhibited or not, providing evidence that they are not directly addressed to proteasomes for degradation. These findings indicate that although it is ubiquitinated and binds to proteasomes, Tax is not massively degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and therefore reveal that Tax conjugation to ubiquitin mediates a nonproteolytic function.","['Chiari, Estelle', 'Lamsoul, Isabelle', 'Lodewick, Julie', 'Chopin, Cecile', 'Bex, Francoise', 'Pique, Claudine']","['Chiari E', 'Lamsoul I', 'Lodewick J', 'Chopin C', 'Bex F', 'Pique C']","[""CNRS UPR 9051, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital St Louis, 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism']",2004/10/14 09:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['78/21/11823 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.78.21.11823-11832.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Nov;78(21):11823-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.21.11823-11832.2004.,,,,PMC523289,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sensitivity to restriction by Lv1 maps to a region of the HIV-1 CA required for interaction with the cellular protein cyclophilin A. A similar antiviral activity in mammalian cells, Ref1, inhibits reverse transcription of murine leukemia virus (MLV), but only with viral strains bearing N-tropic CA. Disruption of the HIV-1 CA-cyclophilin A interaction inhibits Lv1 restriction in some cells and, paradoxically, seems to render HIV-1 sensitive to Ref1. Lv1 and Ref1 activities are overcome by high-titer infection and are saturable with nonreplicating, virus-like particles encoded by susceptible viruses. Two compounds that disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential, As(2)O(3) and m-Cl-CCP, reduce Ref1 activity. Here we show that these drugs, as well as a third compound with similar effects on mitochondria, PK11195, attenuate Lv1 activity in rhesus macaque and African green monkey cells. Effects of PK11195 and virus-like particles on HIV-1 infectivity in these cells were largely redundant, each associated with increased HIV-1 cDNA. Comparison of acutely infected macaque and human cells suggested that, in addition to effects on cDNA synthesis, Lv1 inhibits the accumulation of nuclear forms of HIV-1 cDNA. Disruption of the HIV-1 CA-cyclophilin A interaction caused a minimal increase in total viral cDNA but increased the proportion of viral cDNA in the nucleus. Consistent with a model in which Lv1 inhibits both synthesis and nuclear translocation of HIV-1 cDNA, complete suppression of macaque or African green monkey Lv1 was achieved by the additive effect of factors that stimulate both processes.","['Berthoux, Lionel', 'Sebastian, Sarah', 'Sokolskaja, Elena', 'Luban, Jeremy']","['Berthoux L', 'Sebastian S', 'Sokolskaja E', 'Luban J']","['Department of Microbiology Department, Columbia University, 701 W. 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],,"['R01 AI036199/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI36199/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)', 'YNF83VN1RL (PK 11195)']",IM,"['*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclophilin A/metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/physiology', 'HIV-1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Virion/physiology', '*Virus Replication']",2004/10/14 09:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['78/21/11739 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.78.21.11739-11750.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Nov;78(21):11739-50. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.21.11739-11750.2004.,,,,PMC523245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the mapping of 226 avian sarcoma virus (ASV) integration sites in the human genome. The results show that the sites are distributed over all chromosomes, and no global bias for integration site selection was detected. However, RNA polymerase II transcription units (protein-encoding genes) appear to be favored targets of ASV integration. The integration frequency within genes is similar to that previously described for murine leukemia virus but distinct from the higher frequency observed with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. We found no evidence for preferred ASV integration sites over the length of genes and immediate flanking regions. Microarray analysis of uninfected HeLa cells revealed that the expression levels of ASV target genes were similar to the median level for all genes represented in the array.

Upon entry, RSV replicates in the epithelial cytoplasm, initiating compensatory changes in cellular gene expression. In this study, we have investigated RSV-induced changes in the nuclear proteome of A549 alveolar type II-like epithelial cells by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). Replicate 2D gels from uninfected and RSV-infected nuclei were compared for changes in protein expression. We identified 24 different proteins by peptide mass fingerprinting after matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MS), whose average normalized spot intensity was statistically significant and differed by +/-2-fold. Notable among the proteins identified were the cytoskeletal cytokeratins, RNA helicases, oxidant-antioxidant enzymes, the TAR DNA binding protein (a protein that associates with nuclear domain 10 [ND10] structures), and heat shock protein 70- and 60-kDa isoforms (Hsp70 and Hsp60, respectively). The identification of Hsp70 was also validated by liquid chromatography quadropole-TOF tandem MS (LC-MS/MS). Separate experiments using immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that RSV induced cytoplasmic Hsp70 aggregation and nuclear accumulation. Data mining of a genomic database showed that RSV replication induced coordinate changes in Hsp family proteins, including the 70, 70-2, 90, 40, and 40-3 isoforms. Because the TAR DNA binding protein associates with ND10s, we examined the effect of RSV infection on ND10 organization. RSV induced a striking dissolution of ND10 structures with redistribution of the component promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and speckled 100-kDa (Sp100) proteins into the cytoplasm, as well as inducing their synthesis. Our findings suggest that cytoplasmic RSV replication induces a nuclear heat shock response, causes ND10 disruption, and redistributes PML and Sp100 to the cytoplasm. Thus, a high-resolution proteomics approach, combined with immunofluorescence localization and coupled with genomic response data, yielded unexpected novel insights into compensatory nuclear responses to RSV infection.","['Brasier, Allan R', 'Spratt, Heidi', 'Wu, Zheng', 'Boldogh, Istvan', 'Zhang, Yuhong', 'Garofalo, Roberto P', 'Casola, Antonella', 'Pashmi, Jawad', 'Haag, Anthony', 'Luxon, Bruce', 'Kurosky, Alexander']","['Brasier AR', 'Spratt H', 'Wu Z', 'Boldogh I', 'Zhang Y', 'Garofalo RP', 'Casola A', 'Pashmi J', 'Haag A', 'Luxon B', 'Kurosky A']","['Division of Endocrinology, MRB 8.138, The University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Blvd., Galveston, TX 77555-1060, USA. arbrasie@utmb.edu.']",['eng'],,"['N01HV28184/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HV-28184/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI40218/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA088317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES06676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES006676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI040218/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1R24CA88317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Heat-Shock Response', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteome', 'Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']",2004/10/14 09:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['78/21/11461 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.78.21.11461-11476.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Nov;78(21):11461-76. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.21.11461-11476.2004.,,,,PMC523268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-lineage Tcl1 expression begins in thymocyte progenitors, continues in CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes, and is extinguished in mature T cells. In Tcl1-deficient mice, we found B lymphopoiesis to be compromised at the pre-B cell stage and T-cell lymphopoiesis to be impaired at the CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocyte stage. A corresponding increase was observed in thymocyte susceptibility to anti-CD3epsilon-induced apoptosis. Reduced numbers of splenic follicular and germinal center B cells were accompanied by impaired production of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG2b antibodies in response to a T-dependent antigen. The marginal zone B cells and T-cell-independent antibody responses were also diminished in Tcl1(-/-) mice.

Although Meis1 can be overexpressed in bone marrow long-term repopulating cells, it is incapable of mediating their transformation. Although overexpressing HoxA9 alone transforms murine bone marrow cells, concurrent Meis1 overexpression greatly accelerates oncogenesis. Meis1-HoxA9 cooperation suppresses several myeloid differentiation pathways. We now report that Meis1 overexpression strongly induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types in vitro through a caspase-dependent process. Meis1 requires a functional homeodomain and Pbx-interaction motif to induce apoptosis. Coexpressing HoxA9 with Meis1 suppresses this apoptosis and provides protection from several apoptosis inducers. Pbx1, another Meis1 cofactor, also induces apoptosis; however, coexpressing HoxA9 is incapable of rescuing Pbx-mediated apoptosis. This resistance to apoptotic stimuli, coupled with the previously reported ability to suppress multiple myeloid differentiation pathways, would provide a strong selective advantage to Meis1-HoxA9 coexpressing cells in vivo, leading to leukemogenesis.","['Wermuth, Peter J', 'Buchberg, Arthur M']","['Wermuth PJ', 'Buchberg AM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, 233 S 10th St, Philadelphia, PA 19107-5541, USA.']",['eng'],,"['CA-81358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-HL07780/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041012,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2004/10/14 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2004/10/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)46815-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-03-0802 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 1;105(3):1222-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-0802.

In the framework of estimating procedures based on the marginal distribution of the P-values without any assumption on gene expression changes, estimators of the FDR are necessarily conservatively biased. Indeed, only an upper bound estimate can be obtained for the key quantity pi0, which is the probability for a gene to be unmodified. In this paper, we propose a novel family of estimators for pi0 that allows the calculation of FDR. RESULTS: The very simple method for estimating pi0 called LBE (Location Based Estimator) is presented together with results on its variability. Simulation results indicate that the proposed estimator performs well in finite sample and has the best mean square error in most of the cases as compared with the procedures QVALUE, BUM and SPLOSH. The different procedures are then applied to real datasets.

Each of these has some similarities with the normal stem cells in the corresponding organs. For example, leukemia stem cells express some, but not all, markers of hematopoietic stem cells. Regarding pediatric brain tumors, putative cancer stem cells were identified from medulloblastoma and also from glioma. These tumor-derived cells self-renew under clonal conditions, and differentiate into neurons and glia as well as into abnormal cells with mixed phenotypes.

The biological effects of khat are inadequately investigated and controversial. For the first time, we show that an organic extract of khat induces a selective type of cell death having all morphological and biochemical features of apoptotic cell death. Khat extract was shown to contain the major alkaloid compounds cathinone and cathine. The compounds alone and in combination also induced apoptosis. Khat-induced apoptosis occurred synchronously in various human cell lines (HL-60, NB4, Jurkat) within 8 h of exposure. It was partially reversed after removal of khat and the effect was dependent on de novo protein synthesis, as demonstrated by cotreatment with cycloheximide. The cell death was blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, and also by submicromolar concentrations of Z-YVAD-fmk and Z-IETD-fmk, inhibitors of caspase-1 and -8, respectively. The 50% inhibition constant (IC(50)) for khat (200 microg ml(-1))-induced apoptosis by Z-VAD-fmk, Z-YVAD-fmk and Z-IETD-fmk was 8 x 10(-7) M as compared to 2 x 10(-8) M and 8 x 10(-8) M, respectively. Western blot analysis showed a specific cleavage of procaspase-3 in apoptotic cells, which was inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk. The cell death by khat was more sensitively induced in leukaemia cell lines than in human peripheral blood leukocytes. It is concluded that khat induces a rather swift and sensitive cell death by apoptosis through mechanisms involving activation of caspase-1, -3 and -8.","['Dimba, E A O', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Bredholt, T', 'Fossan, K O', 'Costea, D E', 'Francis, G W', 'Johannessen, A C', 'Vintermyr, O K']","['Dimba EA', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bredholt T', 'Fossan KO', 'Costea DE', 'Francis GW', 'Johannessen AC', 'Vintermyr OK']","['Department of Odontology - Oral Pathology and Forensic Odontology, Faculty of Dentistry and Centre for International Health, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Propylamines)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl', 'ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyltyrosyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catha/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Propylamines/chemistry', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/10/13 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602197 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602197 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2004 Nov 1;91(9):1726-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602197.,,,,PMC2409956,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant transcriptional repression by recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) is a key step in pathogenesis of myeloid leukemia. We recently reported that development of colonic cancer involves alterations in the transcriptional repression machinery by increased expression of HDAC2 upon loss of the APC tumor suppressor. Increased expression of HDAC2 is essential for prevention of apoptosis of HT-29 colonic cancer cells. We now discuss whether HDAC2 also plays a role for aberrant cell cycle regulation and expression of the p21(Cip/Waf) cell cycle inhibitor. Whereas inhibition of HDACs by valproic acid or trichostatin A increases p21 expression, selective interference with HDAC2 by siRNA transfection or reconstitution of wildtype APC does not affect p21 expression. Likewise, treatment of HT-29 cells with the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid leads to a moderate inhibition of cell cycle progression in the G1 phase whereas interference with HDAC2 expression does not. Thus, HDAC2 appears to serve a preferential role in the prevention of apoptosis and not in cell cycle control similar to the specific importance of HDAC1 for cell cycle regulation or HDAC 9 for the stress response of the heart.","['Zhu, Ping', 'Huber, Evamaria', 'Kiefer, Franz', 'Gottlicher, Martin']","['Zhu P', 'Huber E', 'Kiefer F', 'Gottlicher M']","['Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Eggenstein, Germany.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041026,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2004/10/13 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1195 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.3.10.1195 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2004 Oct;3(10):1240-2. doi: 10.4161/cc.3.10.1195.

To study the role of AML1/ETO in the pathogenesis of AML, we used the Ly6A locus that encodes the well characterized hematopoietic stem cell marker, Sca1, to target expression of AML1/ETO to the hematopoietic stem cell compartment in mice. Whereas germ-line expression of AML1/ETO from the AML1 promoter results in embryonic lethality, heterozygous Sca1(+/AML1-ETO ires EGFP) (abbreviated Sca(+/AE)) mutant mice are born in Mendelian ratios with no apparent abnormalities in growth or fertility. Hematopoietic cells from Sca(+/AE) mice have markedly extended survival in vitro and increasing myeloid clonogenic progenitor output over time. Sca(+/AE) mice develop a spontaneous myeloproliferative disorder with a latency of 6 months and a penetrance of 82% at 14 months. These results reinforce the notion that the phenotype of murine transgenic models of human leukemia is critically dependent on the cellular compartment targeted by the transgene. This model should provide a useful platform to analyze the effect of AML1/ETO on hematopoiesis and its potential cooperation with other mutations in the pathogenesis of leukemia.","['Fenske, Timothy S', 'Pengue, Gina', 'Mathews, Vikram', 'Hanson, Piia T', 'Hamm, Sarah E', 'Riaz, Noor', 'Graubert, Timothy A']","['Fenske TS', 'Pengue G', 'Mathews V', 'Hanson PT', 'Hamm SE', 'Riaz N', 'Graubert TA']","['Stem Cell Biology Section, Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],,['K08 HL03872/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041011,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Targeting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/10/13 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['0400751101 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0400751101 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Oct 19;101(42):15184-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0400751101.

No prospective reports currently provide results of the use of oral ganciclovir as pre-emptive therapy in patients with CMV reactivation during alemtuzumab treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: We designed a prospective study in 12 patients with pretreated CLL with the aim of evaluating the incidence of CMV reactivation during alemtuzumab treatment and the role of oral ganciclovir as pre-emptive therapy and in preventing CMV organ disease. RESULTS: In the 12 CLL patients being treated with alemtuzumab, 8 patients (66%) had CMV reactivation, as detected by antigenemia and/or CMV DNA. No patient showed clinical evidence of CMV disease. The alemtuzumab was discontinued and the patients were immediately treated with oral ganciclovir 1000 mg tid. After a median of 14 days of antiviral therapy all patients achieved negative CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and/or antigenemia. No patients showed further CMV reactivation up to the end of the study. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: CMV reactivaction, studied with periodic analysis of antigenemia and PCR, is frequent in previously treated CLL patients receiving alemtuzumab therapy although only sporadic cases of CMV disease have been reported. Using oral ganciclovir, the response to therapy was prompt, there was no progression to CMV disease, and no relevant clinical toxicity, thus sparing unnecessary hospitalization. Oral ganciclovir may be used as pre-emptive therapy in all patients who develop CMV reactivation during alemtuzumab treatment.","['Laurenti, Luca', 'Piccioni, Paola', 'Cattani, Paola', 'Cingolani, Antonella', 'Efremov, Dimiter', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Tarnani, Michela', 'Fadda, Giovanni', 'Sica, Simona', 'Leone, Giuseppe']","['Laurenti L', 'Piccioni P', 'Cattani P', 'Cingolani A', 'Efremov D', 'Chiusolo P', 'Tarnani M', 'Fadda G', 'Sica S', 'Leone G']","[""Divisione di Ematologia, Istituto di Ematologia, Universita' Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Largo A.

Furthermore, the outcome of transplants performed in the 1990s appears to be better than that of transplants done in the previous decade. The aims of this study were to determine whether these relationships still hold and whether the outcome of transplants is continuing to improve. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 1180 consecutive patients with leukemia (n=979) or other hematologic malignancies (n=201) undergoing HSCT in 4 time periods: before 1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, and 2001-2002. Changes during these eras include increasing patient age, more unrelated transplants, more patients with advanced disease, different graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, and different management of infections. RESULTS: The actuarial 2-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) differed significantly between the transplant eras (p<0.001) with a significant interaction with disease phase (p=0.018). In patients in first remission (n=585) TRM was 34%, 25%, 21% and 6% in the four transplant eras. The reduction in TRM was less evident in patients in second remission (n=284) (37%, 35%, 30%, 25%) and absent in relapsed patients (n=311) (TRM=45%, 41%, 29%, 51%). This is a consequence of reductions in GvHD, infections and multiorgan failure among patients in remission but not among those who relapse. The actuarial 2-year survival has improved significantly in patients in first remission (54%, 66%, 72%, 78%) but not in those in second remission (38%, 46%, 52%,45%), or relapsed patients (31%, 25%, 36%, 21%). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, TRM has been significantly reduced in first remission patients, suggesting an allograft should be considered in this phase, when appropriate, without delay. There has been no improvement in survival for patients beyond first remission, due to persisting high risk of infections and organ toxicity, a possible consequence of prolonged pre-transplant chemotherapy and neutropenia.","['Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Sormani, Maria Pia', 'Lamparelli, Teresa', 'Gualandi, Francesca', 'Occhini, Domenico', 'Bregante, Stefania', 'Raiola, Anna Maria', 'di Grazia, Carmen', 'Dominietto, Alida', 'Tedone, Elisabetta', 'Piaggio, Giovanna', 'Podesta, Marina', 'Bruno, Barbara', 'Oneto, Rosi', 'Lombardi, Anna', 'Frassoni, Francesco', 'Rolla, Davide', 'Rollandi, Gianandrea', 'Viscoli, Claudio', 'Ferro, Carlo', 'Garbarino, Lucia', 'Van Lint, Maria Teresa']","['Bacigalupo A', 'Sormani MP', 'Lamparelli T', 'Gualandi F', 'Occhini D', 'Bregante S', 'Raiola AM', 'di Grazia C', 'Dominietto A', 'Tedone E', 'Piaggio G', 'Podesta M', 'Bruno B', 'Oneto R', 'Lombardi A', 'Frassoni F', 'Rolla D', 'Rollandi G', 'Viscoli C', 'Ferro C', 'Garbarino L', 'Van Lint MT']","['Dipartimento di Emato-Oncologia, Ospedale San Martino, Genoa, Italy. andrea.bacigalupo@hsanmartino.it <andrea.bacigalupo@hsanmartino.it>']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Cause of Death', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Infection Control', 'Infections/etiology/mortality', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/mortality/surgery', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Premedication', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods/*mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/10/13 09:00,2006/06/17 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Oct;89(10):1238-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent are chromosome 13q deletions and translocations affecting the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH). Recent studies using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) have shown that gains of 11q represent one of the most frequent genomic changes in MM. However CGH is not generally used in routine clinical laboratories. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the present study, efficiency of fluorescent in situ analysis (FIS)H analysis in the detection of 11q abnormalities in MM patients was investigated. Cytogenetic and FISH studies with three different specific probes for the regions containing the genes BCL1 (11q13), ATM (11q22) and MLL (11q23) were simultaneously performed in 52 patients: 9 cases with 11q abnormalities detected by conventional cytogenetics and 43 cases without 11q abnormalities. FISH analysis identified 11q aberrations that were undetected by cytogenetics in 16 out the 43 cases (37%). RESULTS: Gains on 11q were present in 13 cases (30%) while rearrangements on 11q were observed in the remaining 3 cases. No losses were found. All 11q gains involved the three regions analyzed (BCL1, ATM and MLL genes) while only rearrangements of BCL1 were observed. In all control cases the 11q alterations were confirmed by FISH. A good overall correlation between CGH and FISH was observed. Nevertheless gains on BCL1, ATM and MLL genes were observed in 3 cases displaying a normal CGH. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In summary, chromosomal abnormalities on 11q are frequent in MM. FISH studies demonstrate a high sensitivity at detecting this abnormality and should be used in the routine evaluation of MM.","['Gonzalez, M Belen', 'Hernandez, Jesus M', 'Garcia, Juan L', 'Lumbreras, Eva', 'Castellanos, Mariana', 'Hernandez, Jose M', 'Fernandez-Calvo, Javier', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'San Miguel, Jesus F']","['Gonzalez MB', 'Hernandez JM', 'Garcia JL', 'Lumbreras E', 'Castellanos M', 'Hernandez JM', 'Fernandez-Calvo J', 'Gutierrez NC', 'San Miguel JF']","['Departamento de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario & Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Spain.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*ultrastructure', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2004/10/13 09:00,2006/06/17 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Oct;89(10):1213-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have found that Bcl-xL, as a member of the bcl-2 family of proteins that inhibit apoptosis, is essential in megakaryocytic differentiation. In this study the expression of Bcl-xL was evaluated during megakaryocytic differentiation in ET patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: To study the role of Bcl-xL in megakaryocyte differentiation, we evaluated the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on the expression of Bcl-xL. CD34+ cells from patients with ET, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV) and normal individuals were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with thrombopoietin (TPO). Immunocytochemical staining and flow cytometric analysis were used to evaluate the Bcl-xL expression during megakaryocytic differentiation of CD34+ cells. RESULTS: When exposured to si-Bcl-xL, the percentage of K562 cells induced into megakaryocytes in 72 hours was lower than the corresponding percentage of control cells. CD41a+ cells from the three groups of patients and the control group were cultured. At day 10, the percentage of Bcl-xL- cells in CD41a+ cells from ET patients was 61.0+/-28.1%, which was significantly higher than that from patients with CML (2.5+/-20.9%), PV (33.6+/-10.0%) or control subjects (15.1+/-13.0%).] INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that Bcl-xL is down-regulated early during in vitro differentiation of megakaryocytes from ET patients; this might reflect an early entry of megakaryocytes into a degenerating mature stage.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Zhao, Hui', 'Sun, Aihong', 'Lu, Shihong', 'Liu, Bin', 'Tang, Fengwu', 'Feng, Yi', 'Zhao, Lihua', 'Yang, Renchi', 'Han, Zhong Chao']","['Zhang L', 'Zhao H', 'Sun A', 'Lu S', 'Liu B', 'Tang F', 'Feng Y', 'Zhao L', 'Yang R', 'Han ZC']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Research Center for Stem Cell Engineering & Technology, Institute of Haematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, PR China.']",['eng'],,,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', '*Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*pathology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",2004/10/13 09:00,2006/06/17 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Oct;89(10):1199-206.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extracellular expression of recombinant asparaginase was obtained by fusing the gene coding for asparaginase to an efficient pelB leader sequence and an N-terminal 6x histidine tag cloned under the T7lac promoter. Media composition and the induction strategy had a major influence on the specificity and efficiency of secretion of recombinant asparaginase. Induction of the cells with 0.1 mM IPTG at late log phase of growth in TB media resulted in fourfold higher extracellular activity in comparison to growing the cells in LB media followed by induction during the mid log phase. Using an optimized expression strategy a yield of 20,950 UI/L of recombinant asparaginase was obtained from the extracellular medium. The recombinant protein was purified from the culture supernatant in a single step using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography which gave an overall yield of 95 mg/L of purified protein, with a recovery of 86%. This is approximately 8-fold higher to the previously reported data in literature. The fluorescence spectra, analytical size exclusion chromatography, and the specific activity of the purified protein were observed to be similar to the native protein which demonstrated that the protein had folded properly and was present in its active tetramer form in the culture supernatant.","['Khushoo, Amardeep', 'Pal, Yogender', 'Singh, Bhairab Nath', 'Mukherjee, K J']","['Khushoo A', 'Pal Y', 'Singh BN', 'Mukherjee KJ']","['Centre for Biotechnology, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Protein Expr Purif,Protein expression and purification,9101496,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Culture Media', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism']",2004/10/13 09:00,2005/07/27 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1046-5928(04)00261-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.pep.2004.07.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Expr Purif. 2004 Nov;38(1):29-36. doi: 10.1016/j.pep.2004.07.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They play an antimutagenic role by preventing the incorporation of promutagenic 8-oxo-dGTP into DNA. MTH1 gene expression is higher in some physiological types of mammalian cells and in numerous cancer cells, but the mechanism of that upregulation still remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that MTH1 expression might be associated with a proliferation rate of the cells. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the functional levels of MTH1 gene expression measured as the 8-oxo-dGTPase activity of its protein products in normal mouse livers and hepatectomized regenerating livers. Although the proliferation rate of the hepatocytes in the regenerating livers was much higher than that in control livers, as confirmed by immunohistochemical assay of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the 8-oxo-dGTPase activity was not different. In a second approach, we used 57 lines of human cancer cells in which 8-oxo-dGTPase activity was measured and confronted with cell population doubling time. No significant correlations between 8-oxo-dGTPase activity and proliferation rate were observed within groups of six leukemia, eight melanoma, nine lung, seven colon, six central nervous system, six ovarian, eight renal, and seven breast cancer cell lines. Thus, we conclude that the MTH1 expression manifested as the 8-oxo-dGTPase activity of its protein products in mammalian cells is not associated with proliferation rate. Our results will help in further testing of the hypothesis that MTH1 overexpression may be a specific marker of carcinogenesis and/or oxidative stress.","['Bialkowski, Karol', 'Kasprzak, Kazimierz S']","['Bialkowski K', 'Kasprzak KS']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, The Ludwik Rydygier Medical University, Karlowicza 24, 85-092 Bydgoszcz, Poland. karolb@amb.bydgoszcz.pl']",['eng'],,,['Journal Article'],,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Deoxyguanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '139307-94-1 (8-oxodeoxyguanosine triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.55 (8-oxodGTPase)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*metabolism', 'Deoxyguanine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/*enzymology/pathology/surgery', 'Mice', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/10/13 09:00,2005/03/24 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2004/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(04)00577-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.07.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2004 Nov 15;37(10):1534-41. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.07.018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After budding, Gag and its proteolytically matured MA, form a shell in the released immature and mature particles, respectively. Although the arrangement of Gag domains in vitro and their radial organisation in retroviral particles have been extensively studied, little is known concerning Gag inter-subunit interactions in authentic retroviruses. We report that human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Gag homodimerises in the cell via a disulphide bonding at cysteine 61 in the MA domain. Most Gags are homodimeric after budding and MAs are also dimeric in mature authentic virions. Molecular modelling of the MA domain indicates that non-covalent interactions at the MA dimer interface may also be important for Gag (and MA) dimerisation. In addition, all amino acids previously reported to be involved in MA-transmembrane (TM) interactions are located on the MA face opposite to the dimer interface. The model reveals that homodimerisation is compatible with a hexameric network of Gag and MA dimers that look like the hexameric networks observed for other retroviruses. These data, together with previous studies, lead us to propose a supra-molecular arrangement model in which the transmembrane glycoproteins of the virion envelope are anchored in a hexameric cage hole formed by the MA.","['Rayne, Fabienne', 'Kajava, Andrey V', 'Lalanne, Jacqueline', 'Mamoun, Robert Z']","['Rayne F', 'Kajava AV', 'Lalanne J', 'Mamoun RZ']","['INSERM U443, Equipe Retrovirus et Transfert genique, 146, rue Leo Saignat, F-33076 Bordeaux Cedex, France.']",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '48TCX9A1VT (Cystine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Capsid Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cystine/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*metabolism']",2004/10/13 09:00,2004/12/29 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(04)01142-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2004.09.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2004 Oct 29;343(4):903-16. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2004.09.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RES treatment of both cell types significantly and irreversibly inhibited their growth, associated with extensive apoptosis and increase in hypodiploid cells. Cell cycle analysis showed accumulation in G(1) phase in HSB-2 drug exposed cells, while only K562-treated cells exhibited a marked accumulation in S phase with a concomitant decrease in G(1) and G(2)/M at 24 h. Moreover, RES caused internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, even if K562 cells were found less sensitive to the drug, as compared to HSB-2 cells, which also reacted earlier to the treatment. RES-induced apoptosis was associated with an increase of Bax expression and a marked release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Interestingly, K562 cells exhibited a basal content of glutathione 10-fold that of HSB-2 cells, which increased after 24-48 h RES exposure, together with increment of glutathione reductase and peroxidase activities. However, the major resistance to apoptosis of K562 cells cannot be attributed to their higher pool of reducing power, since neither the inhibition of glutathione synthesis by buthionine sulphoximine nor glutathione depletion by diethylmaleate, sensitized these cells. In addition, glutathione enrichment of HSB-2 cells by N-acetylcysteine did not prevent the apoptotic effects of RES. Our data indicate that RES commitment to apoptosis in both cell lines is independent from the intracellular content of glutathione, while it is associated with either the enhanced expression of Bax and cytochrome c release.","['Luzi, Carla', 'Brisdelli, Fabrizia', 'Cinque, Benedetta', 'Cifone, Grazia', 'Bozzi, Argante']","['Luzi C', 'Brisdelli F', 'Cinque B', 'Cifone G', 'Bozzi A']","[""Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Via Vetoio, Coppito 2, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy.""]",['eng'],,,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2004/10/13 09:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2004/10/13 09:00'],"['2004/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(04)00466-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2004.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Nov 15;68(10):2019-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.07.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five compounds containing a 8-[2-(dialkylamino)ethoxy]-2,3-dimethoxy-5H-10H-indeno[1,2-b]indol-10-one-O-propy nyl-oxime core substituted with a phenyl, furanyl, or a methyl substituent on the propynyl side chain have been synthesized and their mechanism of action was investigated using a panel of complementary biophysical and biochemical techniques. The compounds were shown to intercalate into DNA with a preference for AT-rich sequences. They have no effect on topoisomerase I but they strongly stimulate DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II. Their capacity to stabilize topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes is comparable to that of the reference drug etoposide. The nature and orientation of the substituent on the propynyl chain modulate the DNA binding and topoisomerase II inhibitory properties of the compounds and, apparently, there is a correlation between the cytotoxic potential and the molecular action at the DNA-topoisomerase II level. The growth of human K562 leukemia cells is strongly reduced in the presence of the indenoindoles (IC(50) in the 50nM range) which maintain a high cytotoxic activity toward the adriamycin-resistant K562adr cells line in vitro. The low resistance indexes measured with the indenoindoles (RRI = 10-30) compared to adriamycin (RRI = 1000) suggest that our new compounds are weakly or not sensitive to drug efflux mediated by glycoprotein-P and/or multidrug resistance (MDR) protein pumps. Finally, we also show that these indenoindoles arrest K562 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and promote apoptosis, as indicated by the appearance of internucleosomal DNA cleavage. One compound in the series was tested for in vivo antitumor activity against the colon 38 model and at 25mg/kg it showed 100% complete tumor regression in the treated mice, without significant body weight loss.
