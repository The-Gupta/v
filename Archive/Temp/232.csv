A pair-matched case-control study with 155 astrocytoma and 166 primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) cases was performed. Cases were identified through the Childrens Cancer Group. Controls were selected by random-digit dialing and matched to cases on age, race, and telephone area code and exchange. Childhood cancers were more common in PNET relatives compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 2.5, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 1.1-4.8, P = 0.02) and with control relatives (odds ratio [OR] = 3.0, CI = 0.5-30, P = 0.29). For astrocytoma, nonsignificant excesses of brain tumor, leukemia/lymphoma, and childhood cancer occurred among case relatives compared with control relatives, but not compared with the general population. Astrocytoma cases were significantly more likely than controls to have a relative with seizures (OR = 2.5, CI = 1.2-4.9, P = 0.009), especially childhood seizures (OR = 3.4, CI = 1.2-12, P = 0.02), epilepsy (OR = 3.0, CI = 0.9-13, P = 0.08), and febrile convulsions (OR = 4.5, CI = 0.9-43, P = 0.07). A family history of stroke was not a risk factor for either type of brain tumor. These results suggest that some childhood brain tumors may result from a genetic susceptibility and that some risk factors may affect childhood astrocytoma and PNET differently.","['Kuijten, R R', 'Strom, S S', 'Rorke, L B', 'Boesel, C P', 'Buckley, J D', 'Meadows, A T', 'Bunin, G R']","['Kuijten RR', 'Strom SS', 'Rorke LB', 'Boesel CP', 'Buckley JD', 'Meadows AT', 'Bunin GR']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA.""]",['eng'],['CA 29275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Astrocytoma/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epilepsy/epidemiology', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma/epidemiology', 'Seizures/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'United States/epidemiology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00050865 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1993 Sep;4(5):455-64. doi: 10.1007/BF00050865.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average, cumulative, occupational dose through 1984 was low, only 21 mSv, but ranged up to 470 mSv, with 12 percent of the workers receiving more than 50 mSv. Mortality from most causes of death was low and there was a deficit of deaths from diseases of the circulatory system. Ionizing radiation exposures were not related to the probability of death from neoplasms generally or from any specific form of cancer. There were only two deaths from leukemia, whereas four were expected at population death rates. Larger numbers of workers, followed for longer periods of time, are needed to determine the mortality risk to workers in the nuclear power industry. The difficulties in obtaining dose information for transient workers were so great, and so time consuming, as to make questionable the practicability of studying the workers at a large number of power plants in this way.","['Jablon, S', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Jablon S', 'Boice JD Jr']","['National Cancer Institute, Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Film Dosimetry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Healthy Worker Effect', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Maryland/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Nuclear Energy', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', '*Power Plants', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Respiratory Tract Neoplasms/mortality', 'Risk Factors']",1993/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00050861 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1993 Sep;4(5):427-30. doi: 10.1007/BF00050861.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation with dbcAMP or the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin caused an increase in the level of TNF-R75 mRNA while TNF-R55 mRNA was unaffected. The half-life of transcripts for both TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 was unaffected as judged by disappearance of mRNA after inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D. Thus the transcription of the TNF-R75 gene seemed to be enhanced by activation of protein kinase A. This enhancement was not dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Incubation with PMA did not affect the mRNA level of any of the TNF receptors. Both TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 mRNA showed a prolonged half-life after incubation with the inhibitor of protein synthesis cycloheximide, indicating superinduction of the genes.

Little has been published about quantitative aspects of red blood cell and platelet transfusions. We evaluated transfusion requirements and factors associated with observed differences in 206 patients undergoing initial induction consolidation chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia. All patients were treated during a 5-year period in 12 hospitals on a common protocol of the Swiss Study Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK). Protocol 30/85 comprises a double induction and one course of consolidation. Of 206 registered patients, 199 were evaluable; 118 of 199 (59%) patients entered completed all three cycles of chemotherapy. These 118 patients received a median (range) of 18 (3-44) units of red blood cells and 12 (2-61) platelet transfusions during 112 (70-129) days of hospitalization. Patients with a hemoglobin > 10 g/l, platelets > 100 x 10(9)/l, and white blood cell counts < 5 x 10(9)/l at diagnosis received fewer transfusions than patients with less favorable blood counts during the first cycle of chemotherapy (p < 0.05). Patients with FAB subtype M3 received more platelet transfusions during the first cycle. Female patients received more platelet transfusions than male patients. In multivariate analyses the participating center was the most important single factor associated with the number of red cell and platelet concentrates given per patient and cycle (p < 0.05), the number of days in hospital (p < 0.05), and the risk of premature withdrawal from the study. These data define factors associated with transfusion requirements in patients treated for newly diagnosed AML. They include severity and subtype of disease at diagnosis, age and sex of the patients, and the participating institution. Results suggest that medical decision-making varies from center to center. The participating institution is strongly associated with differences in transfusion requirements, hospitalization time, and premature withdrawal from study. Leukemia trials tend to focus on the prospective evaluation of chemotherapy or growth factors.

The risk of second neoplasms depends on some treatment associations and on certain host-related factors.

Differences in protein patterns between normal and leukemic MNC in rats probably reflects a shift in spleen leukocyte populations and a relative induction of gene expression in leukemic MNC as compared to the normal MNC.","['Merrick, B A', 'He, C', 'Dieter, M P', 'Selkirk, J K']","['Merrick BA', 'He C', 'Dieter MP', 'Selkirk JK']","['Chemical Carcinogenesis Mechanisms Group, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Theor Electrophor,Applied and theoretical electrophoresis : the official journal of the International Electrophoresis Society,8915308,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytosol/*chemistry', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proteins/*analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Reference Values', 'Spleen/*chemistry/ultrastructure']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Appl Theor Electrophor. 1993;3(5):203-11.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA) induces within 24 h a 20% hypomethylation of newly synthesized DNA, that is followed by re-methylation before completion of the differentiative process, as measured by the appearance of benzidine-positive cells. We examined a series of mutant clones which continue to grow in the presence of an inducer. Methylcytosine content of DNA was measured by HPLC, after cell labeling with [3H]uridine. We found that one of these continuously growing clones, which was still capable of hemoglobin synthesis, showed the same degree of hypomethylation as the parental one. The re-methylation process did not occur, however, unless erythroid differentiation was reverted by the removal of the inducer. In another clone which had lost the capacity to synthesize hemoglobin, no DNA hypomethylation was detectable. These experiments show that DNA hypomethylation is an early event strictly related to cell differentiation but not to cell growth arrest.","['Palitti, F', 'Carotti, D', 'Busiello, V', 'Bendicenti, A', 'Strom, R', 'Di Girolamo, M']","['Palitti F', 'Carotti D', 'Busiello V', 'Bendicenti A', 'Strom R', 'Di Girolamo M']","['Department of Biochemical Sciences A.

D delta 2-D delta 3 rearrangements were present in five patients (14%). To investigate the TCR delta rearrangement as a tumour marker in minimal residual disease studies, presentation samples from 18 patients were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Although the size of the V delta 2-D delta 3 junction varied by only 40 bp, sequence analysis showed extensive diversity. This was derived from four factors: deletion of the 5' end of D delta 3 gene (15/18) and 3' end of V delta 2 gene (16/18); the presence of D delta 2 sequences (6/18); insertion of N nucleotides (15/18); association of P nucleotides with intact V delta 2 and D delta 3 genes (5/18). N nucleotides were the major feature, contributing to 75% of the junction. D delta 1 sequences were not involved. Twenty base oligonucleotide probes, constructed from the junctional sequences, were capable of detecting residual tumour cells at the 10(-4) sensitivity level. Cross hybridization studies confirmed the probes to be clone specific. Longitudinal studies on patients undergoing treatment were capable of detecting tumour in remission samples.","['Langlands, K', 'Eden, O B', 'Micallef-Eynaud, P', 'Parker, A C', 'Anthony, R S']","['Langlands K', 'Eden OB', 'Micallef-Eynaud P', 'Parker AC', 'Anthony RS']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03141.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Aug;84(4):648-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03141.x.,['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analysed data of 115 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), treated according to a standardized cytostatic protocol. Fifty patients had received standard (STD) platelet concentrates (PCs) and red blood cell concentrates (RBCs). Sixty-five patients had received leucocyte-depleted (L-D) components, with fewer than one million leucocytes per unit. Refractory patients (22% of the STD group and 3% of the L-D group) were excluded from further observations. There were no differences between the groups during the first cytostatic treatment period. Thereafter, significantly fewer PCs and RBCs were transfused to the L-D group. In the L-D group, granulocytopenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/l) and thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 10(9)/l) were shorter, the lowest leucocyte counts were higher, serious infections were less common (44% v 59%), and the patients spent fewer days in hospital. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) was longer in the L-D group than in the STD group. We conclude that leucocyte depletion of blood components has favourable effects on the recovery of haematopoiesis, consumption of blood components, occurrence of serious infections, and relapse-free survival in AML.","['Oksanen, K', 'Elonen, E']","['Oksanen K', 'Elonen E']","['Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Helsinki.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Component Transfusion/*methods', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03140.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Aug;84(4):639-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03140.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as recent molecular studies of human MSE indicate, a number of inconsistencies between its structure and a membrane localization, we applied the techniques of phase separation in the non-ionic detergent Triton X-114 and differential centrifugation to further investigate whether this particular esterase species is membrane-bound or associated with an intracellular organelle.

In order to characterize the genetic basis for the multiband pattern, we molecularly cloned the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes of one of the patients whose leukaemic DNA sample demonstrated three hybridizing JH bands and a loss of the germline band.

The results of the study suggest that clonal evolution occurs in some CLL, and that many of these neoplasms are indeed oligoclonal due to the accumulation of secondary genetic changes.","['Hakim, I', 'Rechavi, G', 'Brok-Simoni, F', 'Grossman, Z', 'Amariglio, N', 'Mandel, M', 'Ramot, B', 'Ben-Bassat, I', 'Katzir, N']","['Hakim I', 'Rechavi G', 'Brok-Simoni F', 'Grossman Z', 'Amariglio N', 'Mandel M', 'Ramot B', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Katzir N']","['Institute of Haematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Rearrangement/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Restriction Mapping']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03098.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Jul;84(3):436-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03098.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-two patients with different types of AL (16 AML, three BC-CML and three ALL) were studied. The patients were divided in two groups. Group 1 (eight AML, two BC-CML and one ALL) received, after myelosuppression induced by chemotherapy, TF (1 unit daily, subcutaneous) until leucocyte count was > 2.5 x 10(9)/l and platelet count > 80 x 10(9)/l. Group 2 was considered the control group and did not receive TF. Treatment with TF accelerated the recovery of neutrophils, leucocytes, platelets (P < 0.001) and haemoglobin (P < 0.01). As a logical consequence, incidence and severity of infection and haemorrhage were lesser in the TF group than in the control group. There was no evidence that TF accelerated the re-growth of leukaemic cells. It seems that TF is safe in AL, accelerating haematopoietic recovery.

By flowcytometric analysis, the intensity of TdT staining with monoclonal anti-TdT antibody was considerably weaker in TdT+ AML and myeloid+ ALL (M+ ALL) than in myeloid- ALL (M- ALL). TdT enzyme activity in TdT+ AML was on an average 10%, and in M+ ALL 25% of that measured in M- ALL. Anti-TdT antibodies precipitated a major specific protein of identical relative molecular mass (58 kD) from metabolically labelled TdT+ myeloblasts and lymphoblasts. By Northern blot analysis and ribonuclease protection assay, TdT transcript levels were significantly lower in TdT+ myeloblasts and M+ lymphoblasts than in M- ALL (P < 0.0001). The level of TdT transcription in AML was independent of the simultaneous expression of lymphoid-specific antigens, such as CD2 and CD19. Our data demonstrate that TdT expression is downregulated in association with myeloid features, not only in AML but also in ALL. This observation may provide the molecular basis for the differential therapeutic responsiveness, particularly to glucocorticoids, in these various leukaemia subtypes.","['Paietta, E', 'Racevskis, J', 'Bennett, J M', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Paietta E', 'Racevskis J', 'Bennett JM', 'Wiernik PH']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10467.']",['eng'],"['NCI CA11083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI CA14958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03095.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Jul;84(3):416-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03095.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), and low molecular-weight B-cell growth factor (LW-BCGF) could induce DNA synthesis in certain cases of My+ ALL. Whereas in My- ALL the stimulatory effects were shown only with LW-BCGF. Acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) cells were activated with multiple cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-3, G-CSF and GM-CSF. Specific receptors for IL-1 and IL-3 were strongly expressed on both My+ and My- ALL cells. These receptors, however, were weakly detectable on AML cells. Additionally we studied the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1 by leukaemic blasts and found that distinct amounts of both cytokines were released from My+ ALL cells and AML cells, but not from My- ALL cells. The profiles of cytokines and cytokine receptors expressed by My+ ALL showed both similarities and differences to those in My- ALL or AML. The proliferation of My+ ALL cells was dependent on multiple cytokines that would regulate growth and maturation in a lineage-restricted fashion. These data suggested that My+ ALL cells might originate from uncommitted haematopoietic precursor cells coexpressing features of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages.","['Komada, Y', 'Zhou, Y W', 'Zhang, S L', 'Azuma, E', 'Sakurai, M']","['Komada Y', 'Zhou YW', 'Zhang SL', 'Azuma E', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Paediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03094.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Jul;84(3):408-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03094.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation of the p53 gene is associated with tumour development and mutant p53 can promote cell proliferation. Recently wild-type p53 has been demonstrated to exist in two conformational variants: one acting as a suppressor (PAb240-/PAb1620+) and one as a promoter (PAb240+/PAb1620-) of cell proliferation. We have analysed the expression of p53 by flow cytometry in blast cells from 34 patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia in relationship to the proliferation characteristics of these cells in a clonogenic assay. Blasts from three out of 34 patients did not express p53 using the antibodies: PAb421, PAb1801, PAb240 and PAb1620. The remaining 31 samples expressed p53 detected by PAb240 which recognises mutant p53 and is predicted to recognise wild-type p53 in the promoter conformation. Blasts from 19 out of 31 cells which expressed PAb240 co-expressed PAb1620, expression of PAb1620 was associated with non-autonomous growth in vitro. In contrast, the majority of blasts with the p53 phenotype of PAb240+/PAb1620- or which lacked p53 expression exhibited autonomous growth characteristics in vitro. Furthermore expression of PAb1620 in blasts with autonomous growth cells could be detected following growth inhibition using monoclonal antibodies against autocrine growth factors. Our data demonstrate that in AML cells, p53 conformation is related to the growth characteristics of the cells and is regulated by either exogenous or autocrine haematopoietic growth factors.","['Zhu, Y M', 'Bradbury, D', 'Russell, N']","['Zhu YM', 'Bradbury D', 'Russell N']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Conformation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*analysis/chemistry']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1993.444 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1993 Nov;68(5):851-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1993.444.,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,PMC1968718,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antibody specifically reacted with medulloblastomas, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumours (SPNETs) and gliomas, but not with other neuroectodermally derived tumours (neuroblastoma and melanoma) or with other kinds of tumours (meningioma, neurinoma, leukaemia, and small cell lung cancer). No reactivity was identified with normal body tissues, including peripheral blood cells. Characterisation of the ONS-M21 antigen showed that it was a trypsin-sensitive glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 80 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The pattern of reactivity and the biochemical properties of this antigen were different from those of other markers of medulloblastoma. These results indicate that ONS-M21 detects a new tumour-associated cell surface antigen specifically expressed by medulloblastomas, SPNETs, and gliomas. This is the first report that medulloblastomas may share common cell surface antigens with gliomas, although most studies have concluded that medulloblastoma has a predominantly neuronal phenotype. The lack of reactivity with normal tissue implies that ONS-M21 has potential applications as both a diagnostic tool and a therapeutic agent.","['Moriuchi, S', 'Shimizu, K', 'Miyao, Y', 'Hayakawa, T']","['Moriuchi S', 'Shimizu K', 'Miyao Y', 'Hayakawa T']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Glioma/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Medulloblastoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1993.441 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1993 Nov;68(5):831-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1993.441.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,PMC1968709,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relative risk of solid cancers was similar between the sexes, but again significantly greater at young than at older ages of first treatment (P < 0.01). Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma relative risks, although not related to sex or age, were significantly related to histology of the original Hodgkin's disease, and were greatest after lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease (RR = 55.6; 95% CL 18.0-129.7). The relative risk of second cancers did not vary significantly according to whether or not splenectomy had been performed. Leukaemia risk was non-significantly greater after splenectomy than with no splenectomy, which accorded with previous evidence of a modest increased risk associated with this operation. If the greater relative risk of solid second cancers after treatment at young than at older ages persists with longer follow-up, the incidence rates of these second primaries in patients treated young for Hodgkin's disease will become very substantial as they age. This emphasises the need to maintain long-term follow-up surveillance of young Hodgkin's disease patients apparently cured of their disease, and to continue to develop new less carcinogenic treatment regimens.","['Swerdlow, A J', 'Douglas, A J', 'Vaughan Hudson, G', 'Vaughan Hudson, B', 'MacLennan, K A']","['Swerdlow AJ', 'Douglas AJ', 'Vaughan Hudson G', 'Vaughan Hudson B', 'MacLennan KA']","['Department of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology/surgery/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Splenectomy/*adverse effects']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1993.470 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1993 Nov;68(5):1006-11. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1993.470.,,,,,PMC1968752,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During investigations on the antiproliferative effects of genistein we observed that, with respect to direct cell counting, a tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay consistently underestimated the growth inhibitory activity of the substance. Cell proliferation was markedly inhibited by genistein in three tumour cell lines (MCF-7, human breast tumour; Jurkat cells, human T-cell leukaemia; L-929, mouse transformed fibroblasts) when cell number was evaluated by direct counting, whereas a 72-h MTT assay failed to reveal any growth-inhibitory effect. Cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide staining and flow-cytometry revealed a G2/M cell cycle arrest after genistein treatment. Genistein-treated cells displayed an increase in cell volume and in mitochondrial number and/or activity, as revealed by enhanced formazan generation and increased uptake of the vital mitochondrial dye rhodamine 123. These results suggest that alterations in cell cycle phase redistribution of tumour cells by genistein may significantly influence mitochondrial number and/or function and, consequently, MTT reduction to formazan. This may constitute an important bias in analysing the effects of genistein, and possibly other drugs that block the G2/M transition, on growth and viability of cancer cells in vitro by MTT assay.","['Pagliacci, M C', 'Spinozzi, F', 'Migliorati, G', 'Fumi, G', 'Smacchia, M', 'Grignani, F', 'Riccardi, C', 'Nicoletti, I']","['Pagliacci MC', 'Spinozzi F', 'Migliorati G', 'Fumi G', 'Smacchia M', 'Grignani F', 'Riccardi C', 'Nicoletti I']","['Istituto di Clinica Medica 1, Perugia University School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Genistein', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Rhodamines/*metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tetrazolium Salts/*metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(93)90297-S [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(93)90297-s [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(11):1573-7. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(93)90297-s.,"['0 (Formazans)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",,['Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(11):1502-3.

In vivo, mice injected intravenously with L-CDDP had plasma levels of platinum 4-fold higher than with CDDP.

Cytotoxic evaluation of both agents was tested in vitro (murine L1210 leukaemia and NIH OVCAR cell line) and in vivo (male CD2F1 mice). CDDP and L-CDDP showed similar cytotoxicity in tissue culture. At the highest dose given, 12 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), L-CDDP showed higher antitumour efficacy demonstrated by an increased life span of the mice. The CDDP treatment at the highest dose was lethal to all the tumour bearing mice. The nephrotoxicity in rats (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine evaluation) of L-CDDP administered i.p. was significantly less than with CDDP. In addition, the ability of kidney slices to transport organic anions [para-aminohippurate (PAH)] and consume O2 was substantially decreased in rats treated with free CDDP compared to L-CDDP. Accordingly, the liposomal encapsulation of CDDP attenuates its nephrotoxicity, but allows maintenance of antitumour efficacy and may be a potentially effective modality in clinical settings.","['Gondal, J A', 'Preuss, H G', 'Swartz, R', 'Rahman, A']","['Gondal JA', 'Preuss HG', 'Swartz R', 'Rahman A']","['Department of Medicine, Georgetown University Medical Center, Lombardi Cancer Research Center, Washington, D.C. 20007.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(93)90290-V [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(93)90290-v [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(11):1536-42. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(93)90290-v.,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '22840-91-1 (didimethylsulfoxide dichloroplatinum(II))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(J Virol 1992;66:2456-2463; Ref. 11) has suggested the existence of two closely related molecular subtypes of HTLV-II, which were tentatively designated HTLV-IIa and HTLV-IIb. To confirm this nucleotide sequence analysis of 986 bp of the env gene region encoding the entire surface glycoprotein, gp46, and the amino terminus of the transmembrane glycoprotein, gp21, of 10 HTLV-II isolates was carried out. The results clearly established the existence of two subtypes and demonstrated a 4.3% divergence in sequence in this region. Analysis of other gene regions of the provirus, including the pol (1544 bp), gag (448 bp), and the entire LTR (743 bp) of two representative isolates of each subtype, showed a sequence divergence of 3.8 to 5.7%, with greatest divergence occurring in the LTR. In addition to single nucleotide changes, the gag regions encoding the structural protein, p19, of the HTLV-IIb isolates were also found to have a 66-bp deletion that would be expected to result in a p19 protein having a 22-amino acid deletion in the carboxy-terminus region. Attempts to exploit this to differentiate the two subtypes serologically were unsuccessful in that recombinant p19 proteins of both subtypes were found to be antigenically cross-reactive. The finding of two molecular subtypes of HTLV-II may have important implications for a better understanding of the biological and pathogenic properties of the virus, and will be useful in characterizing the viruses present in endemic foci in American Indian populations.","['Takahashi, H', 'Zhu, S W', 'Ijichi, S', 'Vahlne, A', 'Suzuki, H', 'Hall, W W']","['Takahashi H', 'Zhu SW', 'Ijichi S', 'Vahlne A', 'Suzuki H', 'Hall WW']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, North Shore University Hospital, Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, New York 11030.']",['eng'],['CA5 1012-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', 'HTLV-II Antigens/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1993.9.721 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1993 Aug;9(8):721-32. doi: 10.1089/aid.1993.9.721.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HTLV-II Antigens)', '0 (HTLV-II gag protein p19, Human T-lymphotropic virus 2)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (human T-cell leukemia virus type-II protein gp21)']",,,,,"['GENBANK/L06853', 'GENBANK/L06854', 'GENBANK/L06855', 'GENBANK/L06856', 'GENBANK/L06857', 'GENBANK/L06858', 'GENBANK/L06859', 'GENBANK/L06860']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied a patient diagnosed as having leukemia of the large granular lymphocyte (LGL) type who was HTLV-II seropositive, to determine if the expanded cell population was infected. Two populations of CD3-CD16+ LGL were identified; one was CD8+, the other CD8-.

Treatment with chemotherapy, including alkylating agents and prophylactic radiotherapy to the central nervous system, induced a complete remission. In June 1990, a biopsy from a supraclavicular node revealed a malignancy of mono-histiocytic type with erythrophagocytosis. Soon thereafter bone marrow involvement was found. No remission was achieved and the patient died in December 1990. DNA from bone marrow and lymph node obtained 1990 showed clonal rearrangements of both the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene and the T-cell receptor gamma chain gene. This unusual case illustrates a typical secondary malignancy proven to be separate from the primary neoplasm judged by morphological appearance, immunophenotype and cytogenetic constitution. Coexistent clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes have been reported in acute non-lymphoblastic leukemias and notably in cases expressing TdT, interpreted as a predominant lymphoid commitment of the tumor cells. In the present case, however, the malignant cells had a differentiated phenotype and showed erythrophagocytosis, indicating a more mature mono-histiocytic cell type. However, also CD3 expression was found by immunohistochemistry of frozen sections which might indicate a biphenotypic malignancy.","['Lindh, J', 'Nordenson, I', 'Osterman, B', 'Rudolphi, O', 'Roos, G']","['Lindh J', 'Nordenson I', 'Osterman B', 'Rudolphi O', 'Roos G']","['Institution of Oncology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,IM,"['Adult', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02841869309096112 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 1993;32(5):525-30. doi: 10.3109/02841869309096112.,,,,,,,"['GENES, Ig']",,,,,,,,,,,

The study records the cost of the entire survival period for 40 patients and of at least 16 months' survival for the remaining 14 patients. All treatment activities were registered from the patient records and the price of each activity was estimated. As far as possible the principle of opportunity cost was used. The median survival time was 50 weeks and the average cost per patient was c. 300,000 SEK (= c. USD 50,000) in 1988 prices. A young man who achieved three remissions and lived for five years had the highest cost, c. 1 million SEK (= USD 155,000).

In order to confirm the existence of NEP in the human respiratory mucosa, inferior nasal turbinate mucosae obtained at surgery and nasal secretions induced by topical provocations with methacholine, histamine, and allergen were analyzed for: (1) NEP activity (pmol product/min/ml) by enzymatic degradation of [3H]leu-enkephalin, (2) the presence of NEP-immunoreactive material by Western blot analysis, and (3) cellular localization of NEP distribution by immunohistochemistry. NEP activity in human nasal secretions obtained after normal saline challenge was 0.15 +/- 0.06 pmol/min/ml. Secretion increased to 0.86 +/- 0.26 pmol/min/ml after methacholine provocation and 1.69 +/- 0.74 pmol/min/ml after histamine provocation. The increase in NEP activity in methacholine-induced secretions was prevented by atropine (0.13 +/- 0.06 pmol/min/ml). After methacholine, histamine, and antigen nasal provocation, the kinetics of NEP appearance correlated more closely to the glandular marker, lactoferrin, than with the vascular markers albumin and IgG. In homogenates of nasal mucosa, the membrane fraction contained significantly more NEP on a per mg protein basis than did the soluble fraction (227.6 +/- 50.52 versus 9.61 +/- 3.18 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively, P < 0.01, n = 6). NEP in the membrane fraction was detected as a single band migrating at 97 kD on Western blots using antibodies specific for NEP and the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA). Immunoreactive NEP was localized to serous cells of the submucosal glands, epithelial cells, and endothelial and myoepithelial cells of small vessels. Staining for NEP in the serous cells was of the same intensity as that in epithelial cells. These results indicate that 97 kD NEP-immunoreactive material exists in discrete locations in the nasal mucosa, including the epithelium, serous cells of the submucosal glands, and vessel walls, and that NEP activity is detected as a minor component in nasal secretions enriched by glandular products. In addition to the modulating functions of NEP on neuropeptide-mediated activities on vessels and glands, it is possible that NEP in secretions plays a role in regulating mucosal responses to luminal neuropeptides or other as yet uncharacterized NEP substrates.","['Ohkubo, K', 'Baraniuk, J N', 'Hohman, R J', 'Kaulbach, H C', 'Hausfeld, J N', 'Merida, M', 'Kaliner, M A']","['Ohkubo K', 'Baraniuk JN', 'Hohman RJ', 'Kaulbach HC', 'Hausfeld JN', 'Merida M', 'Kaliner MA']","['Allergic Diseases Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Epithelium/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nasal Mucosa/*enzymology', 'Neprilysin/immunology/*metabolism']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb/9.5.557 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1993 Nov;9(5):557-67. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb/9.5.557.,['EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This animal model has been useful in stimulating the search of answers to questions and the formation of new hypotheses related to human AIDS. The monovalent cation lithium can influence a number of immunohematopoietic cell types and cellular processes where proliferation and differentiation occur. We describe here the result of in vivo studies investigating the effect of lithium treatment on MAIDS-infected mice. Viral control and lithium-treated animals were monitored for survival and development of MAIDS pathology. MAIDS animals treated with lithium demonstrated a marked reduction in their development of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Both MAIDS control and lithium-treated virus-infected mice developed evidence of lymphoma; however, the involvement was much more massive both at the gross and microscopic levels in the MAIDS control compared with the lithium-treated mice. These data suggest that lithium may be effective in modulating murine immunodeficiency virus infection and raise important questions related to the potential role lithium may play in the pathophysiological processes associated with retroviral infections.","['Gallicchio, V S', 'Cibull, M L', 'Hughes, N K', 'Tse, K F']","['Gallicchio VS', 'Cibull ML', 'Hughes NK', 'Tse KF']","['Department of Medicine, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Lithium/*therapeutic use', 'Lymph Nodes/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000163797 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathobiology. 1993;61(3-4):216-21. doi: 10.1159/000163797.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis and review of the world literature with report of an additional case.,1301-6,"BACKGROUND: Congenital leukemia cutis is rarely reported in the dermatology literature despite various authors citing 50% of infants with congenital leukemia have skin involvement. These seemingly disparate facts prompted a review of the world literature that was performed by searching the MEDLINE database from 1966 up to and through December 1992, reviewing Index Medicus for the years prior to computerized MEDLINE search, and reviewing appropriate case report references. OBSERVATIONS: A 2-month premature male infant was born with 182 x 10(9)/L circulating monoblasts, prominent hepatosplenomegaly, and multiple firm blue and red cutaneous nodules. CONCLUSION: Approximately 175 cases of congenital leukemia have been reported with at least 41 and possibly 56 cases identified with leukemia cutis. Specific cutaneous leukemic infiltrates occur in 25% to 30% of infants with congenital leukemia and usually appear as firm blue, red, or purple nodules in a generalized distribution. In contrast to the 50% incidence of gingival and oral infiltrates reported in adult monocytic leukemia, only 1% of congenital leukemia patients have oral involvement. Congenital leukemia cutis may precede other manifestations of leukemia by as much as 4 months. Whereas leukemia cutis is associated with a poor prognosis in adult leukemics, the natural history of congenital leukemia is not altered by leukemia cutis.","['Resnik, K S', 'Brod, B B']","['Resnik KS', 'Brod BB']","['Division of Dermatology, Hahnemann University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pa.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,IM,"['Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Leukemia/*congenital/diagnosis/pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Skin/pathology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archderm.129.10.1301 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1993 Oct;129(10):1301-6. doi: 10.1001/archderm.129.10.1301.,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of evaluable patients was 32 for each group previously untreated. The rates of complete remission (CR) were 59.4% (19/32) in the IDA group and 40.6% (13/32) in the DNR group. The clinical equivalence test with delta = 10% demonstrated that the IDA group is equal or superior in remission rates (p = 0.010) compared to the DNR group. In addition, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for response means with scores of 3 (CR), 2 (PR) and 1 (NR) showed the significant superiority (p = 0.044) of the IDA group to the DNR group. The duration needed to attain less than 5% leukemic cells in bone marrow tended to be shorter in the IDA group (p = 0.072), and in the CR patients the number of days needed to reach the nadir value in leukemic cells were significantly fewer in the IDA group (p = 0.037). The nadir value of WBC was significantly lower in the IDA group (p = 0.022). As for adverse reactions, high incidences of diarrhea and stomatitis were observed in the IDA group, while the incidences of other adverse reactions were similar between the two groups. When effects of the drug on the ECG were examined, significant changes in ECG parameters were observed in the DNR group after treatment but not in the IDA group. From the above, remission induction in adult AN LL, IDA + Ara-C therapy showed better efficacy than DNR + Ara-C therapy, and IDA was considered to be a drug of first choice in the treatment of ANLL patients.","['Masaoka, T', 'Ogawa, M', 'Yamada, K', 'Kimura, K', 'Ohhashi, Y']","['Masaoka T', 'Ogawa M', 'Yamada K', 'Kimura K', 'Ohhashi Y']","['5th Dept. of Internal Medicine, Center for Adult Disease, Osaka.']",['jpn'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The protein vicinal dithiols form stable dithioarsine derivatives with the arsine oxide moieties of the gel. The adsorbed proteins were eluted, at physiological pH, by buffers containing beta-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. The dithiol proteins were identified by their specific labeling with N-iodoacetyl-3-[125I]-iodotyrosine. Cytoplasmic thiol proteins of L1210 murine leukemia lymphoblasts were separated into three classes by interaction with As-Sepharose. Proteins that did not bind to the gel consisted of monothiol proteins; proteins eluted by beta-mercaptoethanol include vicinal dithiol-containing proteins with low affinity for the arsine oxide. DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT) elutes a large group of vicinal dithiol-containing proteins with high affinity for the arsine groups. Gradient elution allowed characterization of the relative affinities of dithiol proteins for the As-Sepharose. A one-step purification of the L-triiodothyronine recombinant rat c-erb A beta 1 T3 receptor synthesized in yeast required pretreatment with DTT for binding to As-Sepharose and resulted in a 62-fold increase in specific activity.

It carries an associated high risk of the development of malignant neoplasms, particularly sarcomatous transformation of an enchondroma, as well as other malignant mesodermal and nonmesodermal neoplasms. Hematopoietic malignancies arising in Maffucci's syndrome are exceedingly rare. We report the case of a 14-year-old girl with Maffucci's syndrome who developed acute lymphoid leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient presented at 18 months of age with enchondromatosis. Maffucci's syndrome was established at 10 years of age after the appearance of multiple hemangiomas. RESULTS: At 14 years of age the patient developed fatigue, frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising, and weight loss, with circulating blasts in the peripheral blood. Bone marrow examination showed replacement of marrow spaces with leukemic blasts. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometric findings were consistent with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with myeloid antigen expression. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of acute leukemia in a patient with Maffucci's syndrome may represent predisposition to yet another malignancy and reflect further expression of a generalized mesodermal dysplasia in these patients.

This disorder raises basic questions regarding the pathogenesis of leukemia, yet its natural history is poorly documented and derives from small series and isolated case reports. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To better characterize TAM, we accumulated data on 35 cases identified through a questionnaire mailed to pediatric oncologists in the United States. These cases, pooled with two that we recently encountered, and 58 comparable cases reported in the literature comprise a series of 95 cases of TAM in DS. RESULTS: The patients in this series were notable for the high morbidity and mortality of this reportedly benign condition. Eleven percent of the patients died during the initial event, and the overall mortality for the entire series was 27%. Twenty-eight of the 85 patients (33%) who survived the initial event developed a subsequent hematologic disorder, most often acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, at a median age of 16 months. CONCLUSIONS: No initial clinical or hematologic features predicted the development of a subsequent hematologic disorder. However, those patients initially mosaic for the presence of trisomy 21 did not develop subsequent abnormalities. This series reviews questions regarding leukemogenesis in DS and underscores the importance of conducting future prospective studies of this unique hematologic disorder.","['Homans, A C', 'Verissimo, A M', 'Vlacha, V']","['Homans AC', 'Verissimo AM', 'Vlacha V']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington 05405.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'MEDLINE', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/*genetics', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 Nov;15(4):392-9.,,,['Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1994 Nov;16(4):387-8.

Intravenous methohexital with appropriate monitoring is safe and effective.,370-6,"PURPOSE: We report here our experience in using intravenous methohexital (MHX), an ultrashort-acting barbiturate, for brief unconscious sedation of pediatric oncology outpatients undergoing painful, invasive procedures. METHODS: Following published monitoring guidelines for deep pediatric sedation, 1.0 mg/kg MHX was administered immediately before the procedure, 1% xylocaine was given locally, and MHX was additionally titrated to maintain minimal response to pain during the procedure. Clinical data reported here were gathered retrospectively from permanent medical records. RESULTS: Data reported here represent 132 evaluable consecutive procedures in 33 patients ranging in age from 1.6 to 20.5 years. Patients underwent an average of 4 +/- 3 procedures and received a mean total MHX dose per procedure of 5.8 +/- 2.1 mg/kg. The mean length of time from start of sedation to full arousability was 30 +/- 12 min. Twenty-three (17.4%) procedures were associated with clinically insignificant decreases in diastolic blood pressure or heart rate below resting normal ranges for age. Eight (6.1%) procedures in six patients were associated with minor complications requiring no intervention, such as transient behavioral changes, transient myoclonus, and minimal stridor. Five procedures (3.8%) in five patients required simple suctioning to manage secretions. Only two procedures (1.5%) in two patients required brief bag-mask ventilation plus suctioning for suspected laryngospasm. None required intubation. No differences in clinical features or MHX doses were noted for patients with, as compared to those without, complications. All procedures were completed with a satisfactory level of sedation. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicates that MHX, with appropriate monitoring as described here, is a safe and effective agent for use in pediatric oncology outpatient sedation programs.","['Schwanda, A E', 'Freyer, D R', 'Sanfilippo, D J', 'Axtell, R A', 'Fahner, J B', 'Hackbarth, R M', 'Hassan, N E', 'Kopec, J S', 'Waskerwitz, M J']","['Schwanda AE', 'Freyer DR', 'Sanfilippo DJ', 'Axtell RA', 'Fahner JB', 'Hackbarth RM', 'Hassan NE', 'Kopec JS', 'Waskerwitz MJ']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, DeVos Children's Hospital at Butterworth, Grand Rapids, MI 49503.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Anesthesia, General', '*Biopsy', 'Blood Pressure', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Methohexital/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pain/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/pathology', '*Spinal Puncture', '*Suction']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 Nov;15(4):370-6.,['E5B8ND5IPE (Methohexital)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: These levels have been related to the presence of infection and to the serum content of three other cytokines, namely interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-2, and interferon-gamma. All cytokine analyses were performed using highly sensitive radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: Children with leukemia had higher mean levels of TNF alpha (63.6 +/- 12.3 pg/ml) than did children with solid tumors (21.5 +/- 4.2 pg/ml) and control patients (10.5 +/- 2.6 pg/ml). TNF alpha levels in patients did not correlate with the levels of the other cytokines or with the presence of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Children with malignant disease often have elevated TNF alpha levels. This elevation is dependent on the malignant disease process itself, and could either reflect the host immunological response or tumor cell production of TNF alpha.","['Abrahamsson, J', 'Carlsson, B', 'Mellander, L']","['Abrahamsson J', 'Carlsson B', 'Mellander L']","['Department of Pediatrics I, University of Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Interleukin-1/blood', 'Interleukin-2/blood', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Lymphoma/*blood', 'Neoplasms/*blood', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*analysis']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 Nov;15(4):364-9.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 79 episodes of fungemia in 77 patients with leukemia were documented. Candida parapsilosis fungemia was associated more frequently with the presence of a central venous line and to the use of parenteral nutrition than the other fungal species (p = 0.00026 and p = 0.01, respectively). The same fungus was isolated from both blood and surveillance cultures in 95% of Candida albicans and in 89% of Candida tropicalis fungemia (p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). The neutropenia and fungus colonization that resulted was associated significantly with the presence of invasive disease (p = 0.0024 and p = 0.0028, respectively). Conversely, central venous catheterization and parenteral nutrition appeared to be associated with episodes without deep tissue invasion (p = 0.000037 and p = 0.001, respectively). Invasive mycosis due to the fungus isolated from blood was documented in 51 patients with a mortality rate of 69%, whereas in 20 patients without invasive mycosis, mortality rate was 21% (p = 0.000059). In patients with fungemia, related or unrelated to the presence of a central venous catheter, mortality was 24% and 64%, respectively (p = 0.00042). Mortality was highest with C. tropicalis (p = 0.0017) and lowest with C. parapsilosis (p = 0.057). Severe neutropenia (polymorphonuclears < 100/mmc) appeared associated with a higher mortality rate (p = 0.012), whereas the recovery of neutropenia was related adversely to a fatal outcome (p < 0.01).

The study base consisted of everyone under age 16 years who had lived on a property located within 300 meters of any of the 220 and 400 kV power lines in Sweden during the period 1960-1985.

There were 39 leukemia and 33 central nervous system tumor cases. A total of 558 controls were selected at random from the study base. Exposure was assessed by spot measurements and by calculations of the magnetic fields generated by the power lines, taking distance, line configuration, and load into account. Information about historical loads on the power lines was used to calculate the magnetic fields for the year closest in time to diagnosis. When historical calculations were used as exposure assessment for childhood leukemia with cutoff points at 0.1 and 0.2 microtesla (microT), the estimated relative risk increased over the two exposure levels and was estimated at 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-6.3) for 0.2 microT and over; p for trend = 0.02.

One important implication of these studies is that computerized image analysis of simply prepared tongue smears enables one to recognize subvisual HIV-related changes before clinical evidence of HL appears.","['Komitowski, D D', 'Helfrich, S I', 'Schmitt, B A', 'Freese, K U']","['Komitowski DD', 'Helfrich SI', 'Schmitt BA', 'Freese KU']","['German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'HIV Seropositivity/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa/*pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Tongue/*pathology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/100.4.433 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Oct;100(4):433-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/100.4.433.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four types--RA+/RO- (RO < 15%), RA-/RO+ (RA < 15%), mixed (20% RA and 20% RO), and RA-/RO- (RA < 10% and RO < 10%)--were observed. The number of cases with RA+/RO-, RA-/RO+, mixed, and RA-/RO- types in each French-American-British subclass of AML were as follows: M1 (n = 22): 18, 4, 0, 0; M2 (n = 21): 16, 0, 5, 0; M3 (n = 14): 11, 0, 0, 3; M4: 2, 2, 1, 0; and M5: 5, 5, 6, 0, respectively. The M1 RA-/RO+ type, which was always CD7- CD34- HLA-DR-, constituted a rare and distinct M1 subtype because there was no mixed type among the M1 cases. All CD7+ AML cells were the RA+/RO- type and HLA-DR+ except one. The expression of CD45 RO antigen, found in patients with M2, M4, and M5 subtypes of AML, was thought to be associated with the maturity of blasts as monocyte or granulocyte lineage cells. CD45 antigen has tyrosine phosphatase activity in association with nonreceptor-type tyrosine kinases. It was speculated that the functional status and stage of differentiation of the granulocyte/monocyte lineage determine which type of nonreceptor-type tyrosine kinases will operate, which then select the pattern of expression of the CD45 isoform. Thus, the determination of tyrosine kinases associated with CD45 isoforms seems to be important in understanding the AML subsets defined by the pattern of CD45 RA/RO expression.","['Kawano, S', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Yoneda, N', 'Yamaguchi, N']","['Kawano S', 'Tatsumi E', 'Yoneda N', 'Yamaguchi N']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/100.4.386 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Oct;100(4):386-93. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/100.4.386.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,['Am J Clin Pathol. 2001 Dec;116(6):945-8.

Four clinically distinct subtypes defined by a combination of morphologic and immunophenotypic features.,373-85,"The authors studied 56 cases of diffuse low-grade B-cell lymphoma using frozen tissue sections and a large panel of monoclonal antibodies that distinguish subsets of normal B cells. They compared the immunophenotypes with the histologic subtypes defined by the Rappaport classification, Working Formulation, and Kiel classification to correlate antigen expression with the morphologic subtypes defined in these classification schemes and to define the contribution of immunophenotype to clinically relevant subclassification. All categories in all classifications showed some heterogeneity of antigen expression; however, antigen expression correlated better with four major subgroups defined by the Kiel classification: (1) CD5+ CD10- CD23+ CD43+: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); (2) CD5+ CD10-/+CD23- CD43+: centrocytic (mantle cell) lymphoma; (3) CD5- CD10+/- CD23-/+ CD43-: centroblastic/centrocytic (CB/CC) lymphoma; and (4) CD5- CD10- CD23-/+CD43-/+: immunocytoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type, and monocytoid B-cell lymphoma. These subgroups had distinctive clinical features. Patients with centrocytic lymphoma were predominantly male (5.5:1) and had a significantly worse probability of survival than those with either CLL or MALT-type lymphoma (P = 0.001). The group with CB/CC lymphoma had an equal male-female ratio and an intermediate prognosis. Most patients with MALT-type and nodal monocytoid B-cell lymphomas were female (2:1); the disease-free survival for patients with extranodal MALT-type lymphoma was significantly better than that for all patients with other lymphoma subtypes except CB/CC (P < 0.01). The group with non-MALT immunocytoma had a slight male predominance, a high frequency of monoclonal gammopathy, and an intermediate prognosis. In differential diagnosis, CD23 was useful in distinguishing B-cell CLL from centrocytic lymphoma (P < 0.0001); CD5 (P < 0.0001), CD6 (P < 0.005), and CD43 (P < 0.0001) distinguish centrocytic lymphoma from CB/CC lymphoma; and CD10 (P < 0.005), CD43 (P = 0.06), Leu-8 (P = 0.08), and Ig heavy chain (P = 0.01) may help distinguish CB/CC lymphoma from immunocytoma, monocytoid B-cell lymphoma, and MALT-type lymphoma. Differences in antigen expression and clinical features among these Kiel classification subgroups suggest that they represent distinct biologic entities. The Working Formulation categories do not delineate these diseases clearly.","['Zukerberg, L R', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Ferry, J A', 'Harris, N L']","['Zukerberg LR', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Ferry JA', 'Harris NL']","['James Homer Wright Pathology Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/100.4.373 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Oct;100(4):373-85. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/100.4.373.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,['Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Oct;100(4):367-8.

To evaluate the biologic activity of 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyprevitamin D3, we synthesized 19-nor analogs of 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxy(pre)vitamin D3 because the absence of a C19 methylene group prevents the isomerization of these analogs. The affinity of 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3-19-nor-D3 for the intestinal vitamin D receptor and plasma vitamin D binding protein was mildly decreased [30 and 20% of the affinity of 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3, respectively], but the affinity of 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2-19-nor-previtamin D3 was only 1 and 6% of that of 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 for the receptor and DBP, respectively. The in vitro effects on human promyeloid leukemia (HL-60 cell) differentiation and osteocalcin secretion by human osteosarcoma (MG-63) cells by 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2-19-nor-D3 were nearly identical to those of 1 alpha-25-(OH)2D3, whereas 19-nor-previtamin D3 showed poor activity (2%). The in vivo calcemic effects of both analogs, studied in vitamin D-deficient chicks treated for 10 consecutive days with the analogs, showed no activity of the previtamin D3 analog and reduced calcemic effects (< or = 10%) of 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2-19-nor-D3.

A viral etiology has also been invoked for Paget's disease, a disease of high bone turnover. Delineation of pathogenetic mechanisms of viral-associated bone diseases has been impeded by the complexity of viral and host factors. In order to consider the relationship of HTLV-I infection to skeletal changes we have evaluated the role of a single viral gene in mice transgenic for HTLV-I tax under the control of the viral promoter. Tax mice exhibited severe skeletal abnormalities characterized by high bone turnover, increases in osteoblast and osteoclast numbers and activity, and myelofibrosis. These changes were apparent as early as two months of age. Tax mRNA and protein were highly expressed in bone but not in bone marrow nor in any other tissues except, as previously reported, salivary gland and neurofibromas when they did develop. Within bone, tax protein was detected in only two cell types, mature osteoclasts and spindle-shaped cells within the endosteal myelofibrosis. These observations suggest that local expression of the tax gene, which encodes a viral regulatory protein known to influence host gene expression, can induce within the bone environment marked changes in bone cell activity, resulting in profound skeletal alterations.","['Ruddle, N H', 'Li, C B', 'Horne, W C', 'Santiago, P', 'Troiano, N', 'Jay, G', 'Horowitz, M', 'Baron, R']","['Ruddle NH', 'Li CB', 'Horne WC', 'Santiago P', 'Troiano N', 'Jay G', 'Horowitz M', 'Baron R']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['AR 40416/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Development', 'Bone and Bones/microbiology/*pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/analysis/*biosynthesis', '*Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neurofibroma/genetics/pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Osteoblasts/pathology', 'Osteoclasts/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682283715801 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1993.1580 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1993 Nov;197(1):196-204. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1580.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,['tax'],,,,,,,,,,,

On the 10th day after inoculation, 50% of the embryonic chorioallantoic membranes were harvested to assess their infection status (CAM(+) or (-)), while the rest were allowed to hatch. The hatchabilities of the embryos inoculated with subgroups A and C were about 50% and 57%, respectively. The relative sensitivities of guinea fowl to infection by viruses of subgroups A and C were observed to be 0.220 and 0.003, respectively, as compared to chickens (1.00). Mortality due to subgroup A virus-induced liver tumours (LT) was 54% and four phenotypic subclasses, namely CAM(+) LT(+), CAM(+) LT(-), CAM(-) LT(+) and CAM(-) LT(-), were observed in guinea fowl as in chickens. However, a higher incidence (31%) of conversely associated phenotypes, i.e. CAM(+) LT(-) and CAM(-) LT(+), were observed in guinea fowl. Mortality caused by subgroup A virus-induced liver tumours was first observed in inoculated guinea fowl keets during the 3rd week after hatching, and 93% of the mortality occurred within 6 weeks. The peak mortality occurred in the 4th week after hatching. The target organs for transformation were considered to be the liver and spleen because of the equal incidence of tumours in these organs.

The prevalence of NF-1 is 1/5000, but the disease may be more prevalent in children and young adults below twenty years of age. The pathophysiological mechanisms are presently unknown, although the gene defect can result in experimental inhibition of tumor suppression. NF-1 in childhood can be associated with a variety of clinical and psycho-social problems, and the diagnostic criteria may not be met at birth. More than six cafe-au-lait spots in individuals should give rise to suspicion, and axillary and inguinal freckels are considered to be pathognomonic for the disease. Neurofibromas are found in 15% of children below six years of age with NF-1. Sphenoidal dysplasia is pathognomonic (but very rare) in children with NF-1, and pseudoarthrosis of the tibia is seen in three percent of cases. Scoliosis is prevalent, and back deformities are found in 60% of all patients. Malignancies are more prevalent in patients with NF-1, and in children opticus glioma and nonlymphocytic leukaemia are the most frequent. In addition, learning difficulties are found. The treatment and clinical control of children with NF-1 is a specialist task, which requires a centrally coordinated function.

Blood formation in the BMLTC was assessed by weekly production of cells in nonadhesive BMLTC fraction and the content of granulocytic-macrophagal colony-forming cells in it. The response of hemopoietic stroma on FN sublayer was evaluated by weekly measurements of BMLTC adhesive layer cellularity. FN is demonstrated to stimulate the growth of BMLTC adhesive cell sublayer, the cellularity increase being the same in the above groups.

The conceptual problem with this approach is obvious: if the need for the transplant is based on overt or occult contamination of the marrow by leukemia, the use of autologous marrow seems destined to failure because of reinfusion of leukemia cells along with the harvested marrow. For this reason, ex vivo antileukemic treatment (""purging"") of remission marrow was developed to justify autologous transplants for leukemia. Clinical trials involving thousands of patients worldwide have demonstrated curative potential of autologous bone marrow transplants, using purged or untreated remission marrow, for selected patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Purging appears to contribute to increased leukemia-free survival, at least in a subset of patients who are at very high risk of relapse, but this has not been tested in a prospective randomized trial and remains controversial. In acute myelogenous leukemia, in which the greatest experience exists, procedure-related mortality is much less for autologous than for allogeneic transplants; however, since leukemia relapse is much more frequent for autologous than for allogeneic transplants, the long-term disease-free survival is similar. In general, autologous transplants are preferred for older individuals and those without matched related donors, whereas allogeneic transplants are preferred for younger patients with matched related donors. Leukemia relapse has greatly limited the success of autologous transplants for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Autologous transplants for the chronic leukemias are in a much earlier stage of investigation. Autologous transplantation for leukemia is a fertile area for research. Important topics include conditioning regimens with improved antileukemic efficacy, the value of purging and the best method(s) for leukemia stem cell purging or normal stem cell selection, the possibility of inducing an autologous graft versus leukemia reaction, the use of immunomodulatory cytokines for postgrafting immune system manipulation, and the use of hematopoietic growth factors for ex vivo stem cell expansion and postgrafting support of marrow recovery.","['Stuart, R K']",['Stuart RK'],"['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1993 Oct;20(5 Suppl 6):40-54.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hypothesis that greater intensity of effective drug therapy can result in higher cure rates is supported by the results obtained in bone marrow transplantation for leukemia, lymphoma, and, possibly, breast carcinoma. Stem cell infusion overcomes the first level of the dose-limiting toxicities, ie, bone marrow suppression. This predictable toxicity develops in all patients. Second organ toxicities, such as renal, hepatic, or cardiopulmonary toxicity, occur in a less predictable manner. This variation in individual patient tolerance may be related to wide variations in drug concentration between patients while receiving the same dose. This interpatient variability has been well described for many oncologic agents, but is not unique to oncologic therapy. Important but incompletely defined relationships of importance to high-dose therapy include (1) the relationship of drug dose to concentration within patient groups and for the individual patient and (2) the relationship of drug concentration, or other related parameter such as area under the concentration versus time curve, to toxicity and outcome. Assuming such relationships can be defined, the value of using improved methods to select drug doses for an individual patient to achieve therapeutic goals needs to be explored. The purpose is to optimize therapy. In the bone marrow transplantation setting, the ideal is to provide the greatest drug exposure without undo risk of life-threatening second organ toxicity. To solve these problems, we need models that predict and allow us to control therapy in a much more precise manner than is currently possible. This review examines the concept of dose intensity, defines this concept in terms of plasma drug concentrations, and reviews methods that can aid the control of therapy in the individual patient. The potential importance of this methodology to the individual patient is discussed.","['Zorsky, P E', 'Perkins, J B']","['Zorsky PE', 'Perkins JB']","['Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1993 Oct;20(5 Suppl 6):2-18.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally, these cells, collected from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, were used to restore chronic phase of the disease. More recently, PBSCs have been used principally for autologous transplantation for nonhematologic malignancies, although there are a few recorded cases of allogeneic transplantation with PBSCs. The process of obtaining peripheral blood stem cells is tedious in comparison to the process of harvesting bone marrow for transplantation, requiring multiple lengthy apheresis procedures to collect sufficient cells for transplant. Moreover, the risks associated with PBSC collection (anesthesia risk for catheter placement, risk of introducing infection during collection) are just as great as those associated with marrow harvesting. However, for the patient whose bone marrow is unharvestable due to hypocellularity or fibrosis, PBSC transplantation may reopen the option of treatment by high-dose cytotoxic therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue. Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may also afford the transplant option to the patient whose marrow has been infiltrated with disease. While it has not been demonstrated, it is hypothetically likely that the probability of tumor cell contamination of circulating blood is quite low, due to the lack of adherence necessary for colonization. Recent reports have indicated that autologous transplantation with PBSCs may result in more rapid engraftment relative to autologous transplantation with bone marrow. This has only been reported in programs wherein PBSCs are collected under mobilizing conditions. If it is the case that PBSCs produce more rapid engraftment, however, then the additional effort and cost associated with PBSC collection might be outweighed by the reduced morbidity, mortality, and cost associated with early return of granulocytes in the transplant patient. The biology of the early engraftment phenomenon should be studied, as it is possible that it is related to the mobilizing conditions under which the cells are collected and not due to an intrinsic quality of PBSCs.","['Janssen, W E']",['Janssen WE'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa 33612.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Blood/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Specimen Handling/methods', '*Stem Cells/immunology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1993 Oct;20(5 Suppl 6):19-27.,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonimmune causes are often present and include disseminated intravascular coagulation, concurrent use of amphotericin B, infection, presence of palpable spleen, use of antibacterial antibiotics, bleeding, veno-occlusive disease, and fever. Immune causes are also commonly responsible for refractoriness, with HLA alloimmunization dominating the list of immune factors. HLA antibodies can be identified in 25% to 30% of transfused leukemia patients and can be present in as many as 80% of aplastic anemia patients. Developing a consistent approach to managing these refractory patients is essential to preventing and treating bleeding manifestations. An HLA type should be obtained for all patients anticipated to have chronic transfusion requirements. Screening for lymphocytotoxic antibodies can confirm suspected HLA alloimmunization. Histocompatible platelets (cross-match compatible and HLA matched) should be provided for all patients with HLA antibodies. A number of other therapeutic modalities have been used in an effort to manage the alloimmunized patient; most of these methods have had little or no proven benefit. When bleeding develops in the alloimmunized patient, there are few therapeutic choices. If histocompatible platelets are unavailable or unsuccessful, massive platelet transfusions of pooled platelet concentrates are commonly used, although this practice is of no proven benefit. While antifibrinolytic agents have been available for over 30 years, they are only recently being applied to control bleeding in chronic thrombocytopenia. We have successfully managed bleeding episodes in thrombocytopenic bone marrow transplant recipients with the use of epsilon aminocaproic acid. A number of these patients were platelet refractory with demonstrable platelet antibodies. Platelet refractoriness continues to plague multiply transfused oncology patients. While preventative measures may ultimately benefit some patients, this problem will continue to manifest itself. A consistent approach to transfusion support needs to be implemented to best manage this challenging patient population.","['Benson, K', 'Fields, K', 'Hiemenz, J', 'Zorsky, P', 'Ballester, O', 'Perkins, J', 'Elfenbein, G']","['Benson K', 'Fields K', 'Hiemenz J', 'Zorsky P', 'Ballester O', 'Perkins J', 'Elfenbein G']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa 33612-4799.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Aminocaproic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Hemorrhage/etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology/immunology/*therapy']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1993 Oct;20(5 Suppl 6):102-9.,['U6F3787206 (Aminocaproic Acid)'],,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data are presented showing that Tax increases the in vitro DNA binding activity of multiple ATF proteins. Tax also stimulated DNA binding by other bZIP proteins, but did not affect DNA binding proteins that lack a bZIP domain. The increase in DNA binding occurred because Tax promotes dimerization of the bZIP domain in the absence of DNA, and the elevated concentration of the bZIP homodimer then facilitates the DNA binding reaction.

These agents exert their effects through several distinct mechanisms including destruction or suppression of hematopoietic stem cells, cytotoxic destruction of rapidly proliferating precursor cells, immune-mediated hematotoxicity, altered hematopoietic microenvironment, genetic mutation, and microvascular injury. Some toxins consistently produce suppression of granulopoiesis in a dose-dependent manner, whereas others produce idiosyncratic reactions. Although all types of injury tend to result in granulocytopenia, the time course of the changes varies with the type of injury. With acute destruction of the proliferative pool of granulocytes, neutropenia develops within 7 days and recovery occurs within days after discontinuing treatment. With stem cell injury, the onset of hematotoxicity is variable and damage is often permanent. Immune-mediated reactions may occur acutely or after months or years of treatment with a drug. Drugs or toxins that act as mutagens can induce a variety of hematopoietic disorders including aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, and leukemia. Therefore, the time course of onset of leukopenia after drug or chemical exposure and the rapidity of hematopoietic recovery give clues to the mechanism by which granulopoiesis is suppressed.","['Weiss, D J']",['Weiss DJ'],"['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul 55108.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/toxicity', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Estrogens/toxicity', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Sulfonamides/toxicity']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/019262339302100204 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 1993;21(2):135-40. doi: 10.1177/019262339302100204.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In plateau-phase culture, lowering the dose rate from 30 Gy/h to 13 mGy/h resulted in an increase in cell survival and a marked decrease in induced mutation frequency.

The CPT-11 Research Group for Hematological Malignancies].,1047-55,"A nationwide multi-center cooperative phase II clinical study of irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) was conducted to evaluate its efficacy in intractable malignant lymphoma and acute leukemia. In malignant lymphoma, one course of CPT-11 consisted of intravenous drip infusion at a dose of 40 mg/m2 once daily for 3 consecutive days, performed once a week. In acute leukemia, one course of CPT-11 consisted of intravenous drip infusion at a dose of 15 to 20 mg/m2 a day twice daily for 7 consecutive days (1 cycle), performed every 2 to 4 weeks. Among the 79 patients with malignant lymphoma and 50 patients with acute leukemia enrolled in the study, 66 and 41 patients, respectively, completed treatment. These patients had all undergone chemotherapy prior to treatment. Among the malignant lymphomas, the response rate in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), including 9 CRs, was 42% (26/62, 95% CI: 30-54%); of these there was a response rate of 39% (5/13), including 1 CR, in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) as well. In Hodgkin's disease (HD), on the other hand, there were no cases in which efficacy was demonstrated (0/4). The overall response rate in malignant lymphoma was 39% (26/66), and the response rate even among the recurrent intransigent cases was 42% (16/38). The 50% survival time (MST) in the 74 eligible cases of malignant lymphoma was 153 days. In acute leukemia, on the other hand, partial remission was observed in 2 of 17 cases (12%) of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), but no cases of remission were observed in the 24 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The overall remission rate in acute leukemia was 5% (2/41, 95% CI: 1-14%). The principal adverse effects were myelosuppression in malignant lymphoma and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain, in both malignant lymphoma and acute leukemia, and there was little organ damage to the heart, liver or kidney. Myelosuppression and gastrointestinal adverse effects were severe in some of the patients, so caution is required. Based on the above findings, CPT-11 appears to be efficacious in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Ota, K', 'Ohno, R', 'Shirakawa, S', 'Masaoka, T', 'Okada, K', 'Ohashi, Y', 'Taguchi, T']","['Ota K', 'Ohno R', 'Shirakawa S', 'Masaoka T', 'Okada K', 'Ohashi Y', 'Taguchi T']",['Nagoya Memorial Hospital.'],['jpn'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

No expression of c-jun was detected in a differentiation-competent F-MEL cell line (745A) either before or after treatment with DMSO. By contrast, c-jun expression was constitutive in a F-MEL cell line (TFP10) resistant to DMSO-induced differentiation and increased with DMSO. We have investigated the possible role of c-jun in conferring this resistance by stably transfecting either sense or antisense c-jun constructs into both differentiation-sensitive 745A and defective TFP10 cell lines. Inhibition of c-jun expression by antisense transcripts in the TFP10 cells restored their ability to undergo erythroid differentiation when exposed to DMSO while expression of junB or junD antisense vectors failed to do so. In addition, c-jun overexpression in the 745A cells resulted in decreased DMSO-induced differentiation. These results indicate a correlation between the level of c-jun expression and the ability of F-MEL cells to undergo DMSO-induced differentiation and suggest that c-Jun may be an important negative regulator in this process.","['Francastel, C', 'Groisman, R', 'Pfarr, C M', 'Robert-Lezenes, J']","['Francastel C', 'Groisman R', 'Pfarr CM', 'Robert-Lezenes J']","['INSERM U268, Hopital Paul-Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/*genetics', '*Genes, jun', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'RNA, Antisense/genetics/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Jul;9(7):1957-64.,"['0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,['c-jun'],,,,,,,,,,,

The breakpoints have been mapped to three cluster regions in the PML gene, and to RARA gene intron 2. We have examined the distribution of breakpoints within RARA gene intron 2. An extremely restricted region (ERR) of 50 bp within RARA gene intron 2 was identified as the cluster region of breakpoints by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of DNA from APL patients. To study experimentally the mechanism involved in the translocation, ERR was tested in NIH3T3 cells by in vitro transfection-recombination assay, in which target sequences were placed either downstream of the SV40 promoter or upstream of the neo gene. Cells were conferred resistance to G418 only when the promoter was fused to the neo gene by recombination of two target sequences during transfection. The molecular junctions were analysed in five clones, and all of them were shown to be confined within a 20 bp region in a 148 bp DNA fragment containing ERR. This suggests that ERR might be the illegitimate recombination hot spot in mammalian cells.","['Tashiro, S', 'Kotomura, N', 'Tanaka, K', 'Suzuki, K', 'Kyo, T', 'Dohy, H', 'Niwa, O', 'Kamada, N']","['Tashiro S', 'Kotomura N', 'Tanaka K', 'Suzuki K', 'Kyo T', 'Dohy H', 'Niwa O', 'Kamada N']","['Department of Hematology, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Jul;9(7):1939-45.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",,,,,,"['PML', 'RARA']",,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous study on a large series of T-ALL we demonstrated an apparent preferential occurrence of tal-1 deletions in CD3- and CD3+ alpha beta lineage T-ALL with TcR-delta gene deletions on one or both alleles. In the present study we investigated whether accessibility of the tal-1 deletion breakpoint regions influences the preferential occurrence in specific T-ALL subgroups. Because DNA methylation is assumed to determine accessibility of DNA for recombination, the methylation status of the tal-1 deletion type 1 breakpoint regions (sildb and taldb1) was studied. Although the sildb were completely demethylated in all T-ALL, preferential (de)methylation configurations of the taldb1 were observed in the analysed 119 T-ALL. Most TcR-alpha beta + T-ALL contained completely demethylated taldb1 (77%), whereas in most TcR-gamma delta + T-ALL partial or complete methylation occurred (42% and 47%, respectively). In T-ALL subgroups defined by different TcR-delta gene configurations also preferential taldb1 (de)methylation patterns were seen, which was most prominent in T-ALL with both TcR-delta genes deleted (84% complete demethylation). The previously observed preferential occurrence of tal-1 deletion type 1 in TcR-alpha beta + vs CD3- T-ALL and in T-ALL with both vs one TcR-delta genes deleted, disappeared when we retricted to T-ALL with completely demethylated taldb1. Moreover, all T-ALL with a tal-1 deletion type 1 (n = 15) contained completely demethylated taldb1. We therefore conclude that complete demethylation of taldb1 is a prerequisite for tal-1 deletions type 1 and that the differences in tal-1 deletion frequencies observed in the various T-ALL subgroups are caused by differences in the (de)methylation status of taldb1 in these subgroups.","['Breit, T M', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Breit TM', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Jul;9(7):1847-53.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (STIL protein, human)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,,,,"['sil', 'tal-1']",,,,,,,,,,,

MEM 43, MEM 59, MEM 57 and OKT 3 stimulated markedly the NK activity in fresh isolated PMNC of normal individuals, whereas the cytotoxicity in 3-day cultivated PMNC was enhanced only by MEM 57 and OKT 3. In comparison to interleukin-2 (IL-2), MEM 57 and OKT 3 induced less PMNC cytotoxicity but more cell proliferation.

Out of 7111 acute leukemias with clonal karyotypic aberrations, 2414 AMLs and 1078 ALLs had one of the selected primary chromosome rearrangements, and 40 and 49% of these AMLs and ALLs, respectively, displayed additional abnormalities. The type and frequency of these secondary changes were ascertained and then correlated with both the primary abnormality and the morphology or immunophenotype of the acute leukemia. The distribution of the secondary changes was clearly nonrandom. The most frequent numerical changes were -Y, -X, -7, +8, and +22 in AML and +X, +6, -7, +8, and +21 in ALL. The most common structural aberrations were del(5q), del(7q), and del(9q) in AML and dup(1q), i(7q)(q10), and der(22)t(9;22) in ALL. Some secondary changes were common to both disease groups, e.g. -7, +8, and +21, but several anomalies were restricted to either AML, such as -X, -5, and del(9q), or ALL, e.g. +X, i(7)(q10), and i(9)(q10). The type and frequency of the secondary aberrations varied within the AMLs and ALLs, not only among the different primary abnormality subgroups but also among the AML morphologies and the immunophenotypic maturation degrees of the ALLs. In general, the type of primary abnormality, rather than the differentiation stage of the acute leukemia, appeared to be instrumental in determining the type of secondary changes accruing. This conclusion was based on the finding that several primary abnormalities characterizing acute leukemias of the same morphology or immunophenotype displayed different patterns of secondary anomalies. The nonrandom, and sometimes quite specific, patterns of secondary aberrations strongly indicate that they are responsible for important phenotypic features of the tumor cell population, presumably closely associated with tumor progression. The molecular pathogenetic consequences of the secondary anomalies are unknown, but since most secondary changes are monosomies, trisomies, deletions, or isochromosomes resulting in genomic imbalances, one may hypothesize that gene dosage alterations rather than specific gene rearrangements are essential for tumor evolution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Johansson, B', 'Mertens, F', 'Mitelman, F']","['Johansson B', 'Mertens F', 'Mitelman F']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):953-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a novel methodology for detection and characterization of clone specific DNA sequences in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was developed. Junctional regions of rearranged TCR-gamma IgH genes in specimens of bone marrow aspirates of patients with ALL (precursor-B-ALL ten, T-ALL two, null-ALL one; ALL not classified one), of a patient with lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia, of a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ten healthy volunteers were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were transcribed into complementary RNA (cRNA). Conformational polymorphisms of cRNA molecules were analyzed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A specific cRNA banding pattern for rearranged TCR-gamma or IgH genes was observed in all patients with lymphocytic leukemia. In contrast, analysis of DNA from healthy volunteers yielded a smear of confluent polymorphisms representing multiple different cRNA molecules. In two patients with precursor-B-ALL, cRNA banding patterns of junctional regions of rearranged TCR-gamma genes were analyzed in sequential bone marrow aspirates. The banding patterns disappeared after chemotherapy and achievement of blast clearance. This novel and rapid molecular assay offers several advantages as compared to Southern blot analyses and previous PCR based methodologies for the detection of clonal lymphocytic populations. With this methodology, studies on the clonal evolution of lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g. the prognostic significance of the emergence of additional clones) can be performed more easily than with any other traditional molecular method.","['Koch, O M', 'Volkenandt, M', 'Goker, E', 'Buer, J', 'Probst, M', 'Banerjee, D', 'Danenberg, P V', 'Bertino, J R']","['Koch OM', 'Volkenandt M', 'Goker E', 'Buer J', 'Probst M', 'Banerjee D', 'Danenberg PV', 'Bertino JR']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['NCI-P30-CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):946-52.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,"['IGH', 'TCR-&ggr;']",,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore reviewed our experience in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who were treated during the first US trial of a new experimental drug, all-trans retinoic acid (RA). The purpose of the review was to evaluate parameters of patient morbidity and financial cost associated with the use of all-trans RA compared with standard chemotherapy for induction of complete remission in newly-diagnosed patients with APL. We retrospectively compared outcomes of consecutive patients treated during the first 2 years of our studies that used all-trans RA for remission induction (1990-1992) with an identical number of patients consecutively treated with standard chemotherapy (cytosine arabinoside plus an anthracycline) during the immediately preceding period (1985-1990). Responding patients in both groups received post-remission chemotherapy. Evaluation parameters included transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets, use of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal drugs, duration of fever, time to remission, length of hospital stay, hospital charges, and both overall and relapse-free survival. Thirty patients were evaluated in each group. Complete remission was achieved in 26 patients (87%) treated with all-trans RA, and 24 patients (77%) treated with chemotherapy (p = 0.5). In the chemotherapy group, there were five early deaths (four from hemorrhage, one from sepsis); one other patient was resistant to treatment and died at 6 months. Four patients in the all-trans RA group died prior to response from complications of the 'retinoic acid syndrome'.

Newly diagnosed patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy for consolidation, and previously treated patients received extended all-trans RA therapy, or a radionuclide-conjugated monoclonal antibody as post-remission treatment. Unlike studies in Europe, full-dose chemotherapy was not given during induction for patients who developed leukocytosis. Overall, 43 of 49 newly diagnosed patients (88%) and 25 of 30 previously treated patients (83%) achieved complete remission. We did not encounter de novo resistance to all-trans RA in any patient who was positive for PML/RAR-alpha rearrangements by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Ten patients died during induction from intracranial or pulmonary hemorrhage (six patients) or the 'retinoic acid syndrome' (four patients). The use of leukapheresis or low-dose chemotherapy (hydroxyurea or cytosine arabinoside) for drug-induced leukocytosis did not decrease early mortality. Compared to historical controls, early mortality was not affected by treatment with all-trans RA; however, both relapse-free and overall survival were significantly increased. Maintenance therapy with all-trans RA was associated with short remission duration, and relapses while taking the drug were universally associated with resistance to further retinoid treatment. We conclude that the use of all-trans RA for remission induction, with or without full-dose chemotherapy, has significantly increased the survival of patients with APL. While early mortality has not yet been reduced, the avoidance of full-dose chemotherapy during induction has significantly reduced early morbidity. The major outstanding clinical issue is the development of strategies that maximize safety in high-risk patients for whom intracranial hemorrhage remains the major cause of death.","['Warrell, R P Jr', 'Maslak, P', 'Eardley, A', 'Heller, G', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Frankel, S R']","['Warrell RP Jr', 'Maslak P', 'Eardley A', 'Heller G', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Frankel SR']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000764/FD/FDA HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1994/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):929-33.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,['PML/RAR-&agr;'],,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with no recurrence of leukaemia at 2 years had overall 82% chance of being alive in complete remission at 9 years following transplantation regardless of the nature of the leukaemia, the status at transplant, and the type of transplant. The incidence of late relapses continuously decreased with time. The latest relapses in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) were observed following BMT at 6.6 years in a patient transplanted in first remission (CR1) and at 3.7 years in a patient transplanted in second remission (CR2), and following ABMT at 6 years and 5.1 years respectively. The latest relapses in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were observed following BMT at 4 years in a patient transplanted in first remission (CR1) and at 6.8 years in a patient transplanted in second remission (CR2), and following ABMT at 5.3 years and 4.5 years respectively. Several factors predictive for late relapse or death were identified. Patients allografted experienced a lower frequency of late relapse than patients autografted. Of the numerous other prognostic factors studied, female sex in AML, the use of total body irradiation (TBI) in ALL and status in CR1, rather than CR2-3, for both ALL and AML allografted were correlated with a lower relapse incidence. The use of TBI in ALL was also associated with a better LFS and survival. The absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allografted AML correlated with better LFS and better survival, but had no influence on the relapse incidence. This study indicates that patients alive and well at 2 years post transplant have a very high probability of being cured, but the possibility of late relapse still remains.","['Frassoni, F', 'Labopin, M', 'Gluckman, E', 'Prentice, H G', 'Gahrton, G', 'Mandelli, F', 'Carella, M', 'Herve, P', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Goldman, J']","['Frassoni F', 'Labopin M', 'Gluckman E', 'Prentice HG', 'Gahrton G', 'Mandelli F', 'Carella M', 'Herve P', 'Gratwohl A', 'Goldman J', 'et al.']","['Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):924-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This agent is a novel and very promising therapy for this disease characterized cytogenetically by a translocation t(15;17)(q21;q22) involving the alpha retinoic acid receptor on chromosome 17 and the PML gene on chromosome 15. Clinical trials have demonstrated that ATRA followed by or combined with conventional chemotherapy may be more beneficial than chemotherapy for inducing complete remission. Unfortunately, ATRA as a single agent, does not appear able to maintain patients in remission (median 5 months), and when relapse occurs resistance to a second induction of ATRA therapy is observed in almost all cases. Recently our laboratory investigated whether specific features of the AML3 cells at relapse could explain the in vivo resistance observed. We have demonstrated that AML3 patients' cells (from four patients) at relapse show high levels of CRABP, a cytosolic retinoic acid binding protein and this protein was not detected prior to ATRA therapy. Relapse-AML3 cells (n = 12) showed reduced differentiation induction when compared with 'virgin'-AML3 cells. Results from this study suggest that CRABP could modulate ATRA cellular concentrations reaching the nucleus. This induced ATRA hypercatabolytic state should be monitored during consolidation therapy and at relapse by evaluating CRABP and RA metabolite levels, in order to detect ATRA resistance in patients with AML3.","['Cornic, M', 'Delva, L', 'Castaigne, S', 'Lefebvre, P', 'Balitrand, N', 'Degos, L', 'Chomienne, C']","['Cornic M', 'Delva L', 'Castaigne S', 'Lefebvre P', 'Balitrand N', 'Degos L', 'Chomienne C']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Centre Hayem, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):914-7.,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein I, cellular)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein II, cellular)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,34,,,['PML'],,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, no resistance to this drug has been recorded during induction when the usual presence of PML/RAR alpha was confirmed by molecular study (some M3 cases do lack rearrangement of PML/RAR alpha). Paradoxically, a hypercoagulable clotting tendency may occur in these patients during the first month of ATRA treatment. Leucocyte activation (retinoic acid syndrome), often secondary to hyperleukocytosis, is prevented by early addition of chemotherapy when WBCs exceed defined limits, and is successfully treated by high dose corticosteroids. Routine acquired progressive in vivo resistance to all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) requires consolidation of ATRA-induced complete remission (CR) with intensive chemotherapy. Prevention of relapses using maintenance therapy is questionable and has not been tested in randomized trials.

The unifying model offers a reasonable explanation of the situations summarized above. The clear implication of the disappearance of stem cell clones as a result of the stochastic effect is a requirement for multiple stem cells to ensure long-term repopulation in cell replacement or gene therapy. The necessary multiplicity may not be great, possibly 3-fold according to the results of Lemishka, and the scheme shown in Figure 1, but should be considered in the design and interpretation of experimental and therapeutic strategies.

Samples from 45 cases in chronic phase (CP), 41 in acute phase, and four CML cell lines were examined for mutations in the NF1-GRD by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and allele specific restriction analysis (ASRA). No mutations were detected in the exon where frequent mutations have recently been reported in human tumors, namely the FLR exon. We also examined for point mutations of the N-ras gene but found no mutations either. In 23 samples from CML cases and four CML cell lines, expression of two types of the NF1-GRD transcripts, type I and type II, were examined by NF1-GRD-specific polymerase chain reaction-based densitometric analysis and by the quantitative assay with coamplification of the NF1-GRD and beta-actin transcripts. Consequently, although expression level of type I transcripts varied among the samples, type II expression was increased in CML cell lines and a minor increase in type II expression was observed in the samples in acute phase compared with CP. However, this difference in type II expression between CP and acute phase was so small that changes of NF1-GRD transcripts as well as NF1-GRD or N-ras mutations might not be responsible for the progression of CML.","['Nakai, H', 'Misawa, S', 'Horiike, S', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Seriu, T', 'Shimazaki, C', 'Fujii, H', 'Maekawa, T', 'Furukawa, T', 'Abe, T']","['Nakai H', 'Misawa S', 'Horiike S', 'Taniwaki M', 'Seriu T', 'Shimazaki C', 'Fujii H', 'Maekawa T', 'Furukawa T', 'Abe T', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Codon', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/analysis/genetics', 'Exons', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'RNA Splicing', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):1027-33.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)']",,,,,,"['N-ras', 'NF1', 'NF1-GRD', 'p53', 'ras']",,,,,,,,,,,

Residual disease was determined by monotypy of surface light-chain expression and by dual-color staining with CD5 and CD19 markers. Samples were analyzed on flow cytometer. Total CD19+ cells above 25%, the CD5+CD19+/total CD19+ cells ratio above 0.25, clonal excess above 0.4 were considered positive for residual disease. According to these immunological criteria, only four cases achieved phenotypic remission. Our data confirm that dual marker analysis is more sensitive than clonal excess and may predict an early relapse. Ig gene rearrangements were studied by Southern blot analysis using IGHJ and IGKC probes in fifteen cases. All 12 cases that retained a detectable rearrangement displayed a phenotypic residual disease. Conversely, in two cases, DNA analysis failed to detect the residual disease characterized by flow cytometry. In conclusion, this study suggests that in B-CLL, dual marker analysis is sensitive in predicting an early relapse in sequential evaluations of residual disease, whereas rearranged bands are undetectable when the proportion of malignant cells is low.","['Lenormand, B', 'Bizet, M', 'Fruchart, C', 'Tilly, H', 'Daliphard, S', 'Thouret, F', 'Canipel, C', 'Callat, M P', 'Piguet, H', 'Lefranc, M P']","['Lenormand B', 'Bizet M', 'Fruchart C', 'Tilly H', 'Daliphard S', 'Thouret F', 'Canipel C', 'Callat MP', 'Piguet H', 'Lefranc MP', 'et al.']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Charles Nicolle, Rouen, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):1019-26.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In controls, a mean of 4.3 +/- 1% of the 700 cells examined showed only one FISH signal for chromosome 7, and the finding of > 6.3% (mean +2 standard deviations) of cells with one FISH signal was considered to indicate the presence of a clone with -7. By CC, clonal -7 was found in 11 patients, whereas two patients had -7 in only one mitose (non-clonal -7). In eight of the 11 cases of clonal -7 by CC, interphase FISH confirmed -7. In the remaining three patients, 5.1%, 6.3% and 18.4% respectively of the cells had one signal. Those three patients had, in addition to -7 by CC, a marker chromosome which was shown to be constituted of chromosome 7 pericentromeric material by FISH analysis on metaphase spreads (metaphase FISH). Of the two patients with non-clonal -7 by CC, one had a -7 clone by interphase FISH whereas the other patient had normal FISH results. Five of the 67 patients with no -7 mitose by CC had clonal -7 by interphase FISH, with one chromosome 7 signal in 14.4 to 39% of the cells examined. At least three mitoses with -7 were found in two of them by metaphase FISH. Three of the five patients were reexamined 12 to 17 months later: CC and metaphase FISH found no -7, whereas interphase FISH still showed a -7 clone. Three of the patients with clonal -7 by CC and by FISH were reexamined in complete hematological remission after intensive therapy. CC found no -7 and interphase FISH was normal in all three patients. Our findings suggest that interphase FISH may improve the detection of -7 in MDS. Conventional cytogenetics should still be performed in parallel to FISH, however, because of possible false negative FISH results when a pericentromeric chromosome 7 marker is present in patients with -7. Larger numbers of cases with minor -7 clones, detectable by FISH only, and longer follow-up in those cases will be necessary to determine the significance of this finding, the evolution of this minor clone, and the outcome of the patients.","['Flactif, M', 'Lai, J L', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Fenaux, P']","['Flactif M', 'Lai JL', 'Preudhomme C', 'Fenaux P']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Humaine, Faculte de Medecine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Lille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Bone Marrow/chemistry/ultrastructure', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):1012-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FISH data were compared with cytogenetic results. Both methods were in agreement in 25/50 MDS and 20/20 ANLL cases. Trisomy 11 was found neither by cytogenetic study nor by FISH. In 11 MDS patients the percentage of abnormal cells was higher by FISH than by classical cytogenetic analysis. FISH revealed monosomy 7 which was undetectable by karyotypic study in 5-22% cells from 15 MDS patients.

The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[1,25(OH)2D3(C)] induces leukemic cells, including HL-60, to differentiate and/or no longer proliferate, but it causes hypercalcemia. Development of vitamin D analogs that are more potent in their abilities to affect leukemic cells without causing greater hypercalcemia, may be useful therapeutically. A novel analog [1,25(OH)2-16ene-D3(HM)] has a double bond between C-16 and C-17; it appears to be an extremely effective antileukemic agent with the same or fewer effects on serum calciums. We define the potency of this compound and compare it with seven, previously reported, potent analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3. HM inhibited clonal growth of HL-60 cells by 50% at 1.5 x 10(-11) M. This was about equipotent to 1,25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-D3(V), about 100-fold more potent than many of the other analogs, and 1000-fold more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3. The rank order of leukemic inhibitory activity was: 1,25(OH)2-16ene-D3(HM) > or = 1,25(OH)2- 16ene-23yne-D3(V) > 1,25(OH)2-23ene-D3(EX) = 1,24(OH)2-22ene-24-cyclopropyl-D3(BT) = 22-oxa- 1,25(OH)2D3(EU) = 1,25(OH)2-24-homo-D3(ER) > 1,25(OH)2D3(C) > 1,25(OH)2-24- dihomo-D3(ES). The rank order of their effects on induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells, as measured by superoxide production and nonspecific esterase activity, was similar to their antiproliferative activities. In contrast, each analog slightly stimulated proliferation of normal human myeloid clonal growth. Serum calcium levels were the same or slightly less when either 1,25(OH)2-16ene-D3(HM) or 1,25(OH)2D3 (0.0625, 0.125, or 0.25 microgram) was given intraperitoneally to mice for 5 weeks. HM bound to 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors about 1.5-fold more avidly than 1,25(OH)2D3. In fact, this vitamin D3 appears to be the most avid binder to 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors that has been identified to date. In contrast, HM had a greater than 50-fold lower affinity for the D-binding proteins as compared with 1,25(OH)2D3, thus increasing the availability of the compound for target tissues. Further differentiation experiments showed that HM was more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3 in the presence of serum, but was equipotent in serum-free conditions. Taken together, our experiments suggest that 1,25(OH)2-16ene-D3(HM) may be more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3(C) because of its higher affinity to the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors and its low affinity to the D-binding protein present in serum. HM is an ideal compound for clinical studies including patients with preleukemia and other neoplasia, as well as several skin disorders, such as psoriasis.","['Jung, S J', 'Lee, Y Y', 'Pakkala, S', 'de Vos, S', 'Elstner, E', 'Norman, A W', 'Green, J', 'Uskokovic, M', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Jung SJ', 'Lee YY', 'Pakkala S', 'de Vos S', 'Elstner E', 'Norman AW', 'Green J', 'Uskokovic M', 'Koeffler HP']","[""Pusan Women's Junior College, Korea.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cholecalciferol/*analogs & derivatives/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vitamin D-Binding Protein/metabolism']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90081-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jun;18(6):453-63. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90081-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Vitamin D-Binding Protein)', '124409-58-1 (1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-vitamin D3)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DMSO-induced differentiation had no effect on the steady-state concentration of 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), even though the activity of the oxidative segment of the pentose phosphate pathway (OPP) increased two-fold and the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were enhanced 3-6 times. [14C]-formate incorporation, on the other hand, showed that undifferentiated HL60 cells produced purines by the de novo pathway at six-fold the rate of the differentiated cells and at three times the rate measured in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) separated from human blood. This is consistent with significantly higher activities (two to five-fold) of the key regulatory enzymes of the de novo purine synthesis pathway (PRPP synthetase, amido-phosphoribosyl transferase and adenylosuccinate synthase) in the undifferentiated cells. Labelling the cells with [14C]-hypoxanthine showed that there was an active salvage pathway in the HL60 cells which remained unaltered by differentiation. The activities of the salvage enzymes were also the same, although hypoxanthine was taken up at twice the rate by the undifferentiated cells. Human PMNs had an active salvage pathway, but their rate was five times lower than that of the HL60 cells, consistent with much lower activities (three to eight-fold) of the salvage pathway enzymes. These observations suggest that regulation of the synthesis and activities of the purine nucleotide synthesis enzymes may play an important role in the regulation of differentiation of myeloid cells.","['Ahmed, N', 'Weidemann, M J']","['Ahmed N', 'Weidemann MJ']","['Division of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Life Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Luminol', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pentose Phosphate Pathway', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90080-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jun;18(6):441-51. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90080-9.,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '5EXP385Q4F (Luminol)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the effects of genistein on in vitro growth, cell-cycle progression and chromatin structure of Jurkat cells, a T-cell leukemia line with a constitutively increased tyrosine phosphorylation pattern. Exposure of in vitro cultured Jurkat cells to genistein resulted in a dose-dependent, growth inhibition. Cell-cycle analysis of genistein-treated cells revealed a G2/M arrest at low genistein concentrations (5-10 micrograms/ml), while at higher doses (20-30 micrograms/ml) there was also a perturbation in S-phase progression. The derangements in cell-cycle control were followed by apoptotic death of genistein-treated cells. Immunocytochemical analysis of cells stained with a FITC-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody showed that 30 micrograms/ml genistein effectively inhibit tyrosine kinase activity in cultured Jurkat cells. Our results indicate that the natural isoflavone genistein antagonizes tumor cell growth through both cell-cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis and suggest that it could be a promising new agent in cancer therapy.","['Spinozzi, F', 'Pagliacci, M C', 'Migliorati, G', 'Moraca, R', 'Grignani, F', 'Riccardi, C', 'Nicoletti, I']","['Spinozzi F', 'Pagliacci MC', 'Migliorati G', 'Moraca R', 'Grignani F', 'Riccardi C', 'Nicoletti I']","['Istituti di Medicina Interna e Scienze Oncologiche, Universita di Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90079-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jun;18(6):431-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90079-5.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Isoflavones)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that sera from 6 of 28 patients with LGL leukemia were positive for HTLV-I/II using a whole virus ELISA; moreover, the ELISA-negative sera were near the positive cut-off value. Therefore, we performed additional studies on these sera using commercially available assays which can confirm and distinguish HTLV-I from HTLV-II infection. Serum from only one patient was confirmed positive using conventional criteria (HTLV-II+). Sera from 25 patients (89%) had indeterminate reactivity on Western blot assays. Of these, sera from 21 (84%) reacted to gag protein p24; 12 (48%) reacted with recombinant env protein p21e, and 10 (40%) reacted with both. We could not detect HTLV-I/II pol or pX gene sequences in these patients using polymerase chain reaction analyses, with the exception of the HTLV-II-infected patient described previously.

Chronic myeloid leukemia is the most common such translocation-induced leukemia.

Therefore, we have investigated the effects produced by certain structural modifications of bcr-abl antisense oligonucleotides. For assay purposes we used K562 cells which have the bcr exon 3/abl exon 2 junction and BV173 cells which have the bcr exon 2/abl exon 2 junction. We have found that 5'-capping with a dimethoxytrityl group and 3'-capping with an amino-2-hydroxypropyl group confer antiproliferative activity. The enhancement of activity by capping appears at least partly attributable to exonuclease resistance since stability in serum-containing medium is increased.","['Thomas, M', 'Kosciolek, B', 'Wang, N', 'Rowley, P']","['Thomas M', 'Kosciolek B', 'Wang N', 'Rowley P']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, New York 14642.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', '*Oncogenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90075-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jun;18(6):401-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90075-2.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,"['abl', 'bcr']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, this stimulation was mainly detected at 42 to 48 h of treatment, whereas later virus release declined rapidly. During the first 48 h, TPA had no effect on cell growth, but later, the number of viable cells was profoundly lower in the TPA-treated than in the untreated cultures. This shift in virus release and cell number resulted from self-fusion of a large proportion of the virus-producing cells, which seemed to consequently enter into a dying process. This fusion, which resulted in syncytium formation, was strongly inhibited by anti-HTLV-I env monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, no self-fusion was detected in three different uninfected T-cell lines similarly treated with TPA. On the other hand, stimulation of virus production by 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) treatment failed to induce self-fusion in the infected cells. Moreover, no syncytium was detected when these 3-MC-treated infected cells were cocultured with any of the TPA-treated uninfected cells. The effects of TPA on virus production and syncytium formation were both abolished by three different protein kinase C inhibitors. Taken together, these data suggest that the self-fusion observed in these experiments required both enhanced virus production and protein kinase C-phosphorylated viral or/and virally induced cellular component(s).","['Wolfson, M', 'Lev, M', 'Avinoah, I', 'Malik, Z', 'Lochelt, M', 'Flugel, R M', 'Dombrovski, A', 'Aboud, M']","['Wolfson M', 'Lev M', 'Avinoah I', 'Malik Z', 'Lochelt M', 'Flugel RM', 'Dombrovski A', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Giant Cells/drug effects/*microbiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*microbiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.7.4695-4699.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Jul;68(7):4695-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.7.4695-4699.1994.,"['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,PMC236401,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no evidence that purified Tax can bind to DNA in the absence of cellular factors, suggesting that Tax most likely regulates transcription via interaction with cellular factors. Since HTLV-I is a documented agent of adult T-cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis, disorders of the immune and nervous systems, respectively, characterization of cellular factors of lymphoid and neuroglial origin which interact with the 21-bp repeat elements is essential to understanding of the mechanisms involved in basal and Tax-mediated transcription in cells of immune and nervous system origin. Utilizing electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses, we have detected both 21-bp repeat-specific and glial cell-specific DNA-protein complexes. Several 21-bp repeat-specific DNA-protein complexes were detected when nuclear extracts derived from cells of lymphoid (Jurkat, SupT1, and H9), neuronal (IMR-32 and SK-N-MC), and glial (U-373 MG, Hs683, and U-118) origin were used in reactions with each of the three 21-bp repeat elements. In addition, a glial cell-specific DNA-protein complex was detected when nuclear extracts derived from U-373 MG, Hs683, and U-118 glial cell lines reacted with the promoter-distal and central 21-bp repeat elements. Furthermore, EMS analyses performed with nuclear extracts derived from lymphocytic and glial cell origin and a 223-bp fragment of the HTLV-I long terminal repeat encompassing the three 21-bp repeat elements (designated Tax-responsive elements 1 and 2, TRE-1/-2) have also resulted in the detection of glial cell type-specific DNA-protein complexes. Competition EMS analyses with oligonucleotides containing transcription factor binding site sequences indicate the involvement of a cyclic AMP response element binding protein in the formation of DNA-protein complexes which form with all three 21-bp repeat elements and the glial cell-specific DNA-protein complex as well as the involvement of Sp1 or an Sp1-related factor in the formation of the 21-bp repeat III-specific DNA-protein complexes.","['Tillmann, M', 'Wessner, R', 'Wigdahl, B']","['Tillmann M', 'Wessner R', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey 17033.']",['eng'],['CA 54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuroglia/*microbiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Protein Binding', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.7.4597-4608.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Jul;68(7):4597-608. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.7.4597-4608.1994.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",,,,PMC236387,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sheep are highly sensitive to BLV experimental infection and develop B-cell pathologies similar to those in cattle in 90% of the cases. BLV tropism for B cells has been well documented, but the infection of other cell populations may also be involved in the BLV-induced lymphoproliferative syndrome. We thus looked for BLV provirus in other leukocyte populations in sheep and cattle by using PCR. We found that while B cells harbor the highest proviral load, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, and granulocytes, but not CD4+ T cells, also bear BLV provirus. As previously described, we found that persistent lymphocytosis in cows is characterized by an expansion of the CD5+ B-cell subpopulation but we did not confirm this observation in sheep in which the expanded B-cell population expressed the CD11b marker. Nevertheless, BLV could be detected both in bovine CD5+ and CD5- B cells and in sheep CD11b+ and CD11b- B cells, indicating that the restricted BLV tropism for a specific B-cell subpopulation cannot explain its expansion encountered in BLV infection. Altogether, this work shows that BLV tropism in leukocytes is wider than previously thought. These results lead the way to further studies of cellular interactions among B cells and other leukocytes that may intervene in the development of the lymphoproliferative syndrome induced by BLV infection.","['Schwartz, I', 'Bensaid, A', 'Polack, B', 'Perrin, B', 'Berthelemy, M', 'Levy, D']","['Schwartz I', 'Bensaid A', 'Polack B', 'Perrin B', 'Berthelemy M', 'Levy D']","['URA-Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Immuno-Pathologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Ecole Nationale Veterinaire, Maisons-Alfort, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification', 'Leukocytes/*microbiology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/microbiology', 'Lymphocytosis/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Sheep']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.7.4589-4596.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Jul;68(7):4589-96. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.7.4589-4596.1994.,['0 (DNA Primers)'],,,,PMC236386,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MuLV(MAHIV) is infectious but grows at a reduced rate compared with wild-type MuLV. We found that the partial defect in replication of the chimeric virus is at a late stage in the viral life cycle. The MuLV(MAHIV) Gag proteins are distributed aberrantly within cells and are not associated with cellular membranes. Unlike MuLV, HIV-1 is able to integrate into growth-arrested cells. Incorporation of the HIV-1 MA, which is known to play a role in infection of nondividing cells, does not enable MuLV(MAHIV) to be expressed in growth-arrested cells. While it possesses no amino acid homology, we found that the HIV-1 MA can efficiently replace the MuLV matrix protein in infection.","['Deminie, C A', 'Emerman, M']","['Deminie CA', 'Emerman M']","['Program in Molecular Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98104.']",['eng'],"['AI08587/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI30927/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'HIV Antigens/genetics/*physiology', 'HIV-1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Half-Life', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Viral Proteins', 'Virion', 'Virus Replication', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.7.4442-4449.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Jul;68(7):4442-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.7.4442-4449.1994.,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p17 protein, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1)']",,,,PMC236369,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study derives new risk estimates using data from follow-up through 1987 (whereas the earlier assessment only had follow-up available through 1978), and using new exposure estimates for this cohort developed by Paustenbach et al. (1992) that account for a number of factors that were unknown or not fully evaluated in earlier exposure assessments. There was a significant excess of acute myelocytic or acute monocytic leukemia (AMML, the only forms of acute nonlymphatic leukemia observed) in this cohort, and this end point also exhibited a strong dose-response trend. AMML was the only hematopoietic or lymphatic cancer that was clearly linked to benzene exposure. However, quantitative estimates of risk based on modeling either AMML or all leukemia differed by only 20%. Differences between the two Pliofilm plant locations in the occurrence of AMML were not statistically significant (.12 < or = p < or = .21) after differences in levels of benzene exposure were taken into account. The Paustenbach et al. exposures predicted a quadratic dose response, based on a measure of exposure that weighted intensity of exposure more heavily than duration of exposure. The best-fitting quadratic models predicted an additional lifetime risk of a benzene-related death from 45 yr of exposure to 1 ppm of between 0.020 and 0.036 per thousand. Statistical confidence intervals (90%) on these estimates were barely wide enough to include risk estimates based on linear dose response models.

LIF induced a dose-dependent increase in p24 antigen production in the chronically infected promonocytic cell line U1. The magnitude and time kinetics of the LIF effects were similar to interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), other cytokines known to induce HIV replication in this cell line. To characterize mechanisms responsible for these LIF effects, levels of HIV mRNA, activation of the DNA binding protein nuclear factor (NF)-kB, signal transduction pathways, and potential interactions with other cytokines were analyzed. LIF increased steady-state levels of HIV mRNA at 2.0, 4.3, and 9.2 kB. This was detectable by 24 h and persisted until 72 h. The DNA binding protein NF-kB is a central mediator in cytokine activation of HIV transcription. NF-kB levels were higher in unstimulated U1 cells as compared to the parent cell line U937. In both cell lines LIF increased NF-kB activity. Induction of NF-kB and HIV replication by cytokines are at least in part dependent on reactive oxygen intermediates. The oxygen radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine, but not an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, inhibited LIF-induced HIV replication. LIF induces the production of other cytokines in monocytes but its effects on HIV replication were not inhibited by antibodies to IL-1, TNF, or IL-6.

Infection by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) causes the apparent disappearance of these domains, an effect that requires the expression of the immediate early protein ICP0. Previously, we have shown that there are a number of cellular antigens in the ND10. In this report, we show that one of these proteins is PML, a member of the C3HC4 zinc-binding domain family which also includes ICP0. The C3HC4 domain of ICP0 is essential for the apparent release of PML from the ND10, although the interaction of ICP0 with ND10 is determined by a small region near its carboxy terminus. PML and other ND10 proteins are not lost after removal from ND10 but deposited at the nuclear envelope or nuclear envelope modifications during later parts of the replication cycle. ICP0 is required for the onset of low multiplicity infections, and has been implicated in the process of reactivation from HSV latency. Therefore, the interaction between ICP0 and the ND10 domains, specifically PML, may be important for the outcome of virus-cell interactions.","['Maul, G G', 'Everett, R D']","['Maul GG', 'Everett RD']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],['CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Herpes Simplex/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Zinc Fingers']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-75-6-1223 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1994 Jun;75 ( Pt 6):1223-33. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-75-6-1223.,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",,,,,,"['ICP0', 'PML']",,,,,,,,,,,

Polyreactivity is dependent on somatically generated sequences in the third complementarity-determining region of the antibody heavy chain.,5988-96,"SMI is a previously characterized IgM kappa polyreactive (natural) autoantibody. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains of SMI are respectively encoded by a nonmutated VH1 gene, designated 51p1, and a conserved nonmutated V kappa gene, designated Humkv325. These V genes seem to be over-represented in the autoimmune and fetal B cell repertoires, and to be frequently expressed in malignant B cells during certain lymphoid proliferations such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Polyreactive natural autoantibodies are thought to rely mainly on the use of such V genes in germ-line configuration. However, this model underestimates the contribution of the somatically generated heavy chain third complementarity-determining region (HCDR3) to autoantibody specificity. We used oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to permute the sequence of the SMI-HCDR3 to generate a family of mutant proteins, each of which differed from the original SMI-IgM kappa by one amino acid residue. This allowed us to examine the relative contribution of selected amino acid residues in this region to the binding affinity of SMI against a panel of self-Ags. We found that a single amino acid substitution within the HCDR3 could dramatically alter the specificity of this autoantibody. Some substitutions abrogated the reactivity with all the tested Ags, whereas others changed the affinity or spectrum of reactivity for certain self-Ags. These results demonstrate that the autoantibody-binding activity of these conserved autoantibody-associated germ-line V genes is dependent upon heavy chain junctional sequences that are generated somatically during Ig gene rearrangement.","['Martin, T', 'Crouzier, R', 'Weber, J C', 'Kipps, T J', 'Pasquali, J L']","['Martin T', 'Crouzier R', 'Weber JC', 'Kipps TJ', 'Pasquali JL']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, Central Hospital, University Hospitals of Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],['CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jun 15;152(12):5988-96.,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we studied the effects of HTLV-I-infected cell supernatants on HUVEC, fibroblasts, and glioma cells. The HTLV-I-infected cell supernatants (HUT102 and MT-2) strongly inhibited the proliferation of HUVEC, although they enhanced the proliferation of the fibroblasts. Regarding the glioma cells, only the MT-2 supernatant showed weak inhibitory effects on the proliferation. However, the HTLV-I-uninfected cell supernatants showed no effects on these target cells. The biologic activities of both HUT102 and MT-2 supernatants were found to be dose dependent and were reduced by heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 5 min, but not at 56 degrees C for 30 min. These activities were not dependent on the concentrations of HTLV-I viral particles and were only minimally affected by the presence of anti-HTLV-I Abs. A bioassay of various cytokines revealed that the activity of TNF was much higher in the HUT102 and MT-2 supernatants than in the HTLV-I-uninfected cell supernatants (MOLT-4, Jurkat, and K-562). rTNF-alpha and rTNF-beta also showed strong inhibitory effects on HUVEC as well as on the enhancement of the fibroblast growth. With the use of Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, we obtained the highest activities from the 60- through 70-kDa fractions of the HUT102 supernatant and some activities from the 20- through 30-kDa fractions. The biologic activities of both the whole HUT102 supernatant and its active fractions were completely blocked by anti-TNF-beta mAb, although they were not blocked by anti-TNF-alpha mAb. In a Western blot assay, the 25- and 27-kDa bands of TNF-beta were shown clearly in the HUT102 supernatant, although no TNF-alpha bands appeared. These findings suggest that TNF-beta is present in either its oligomeric or monomeric form in the HTLV-I-infected cell supernatants and is also mainly responsible for the supernatants' effects on HUVECs and fibroblasts.","['Yu, F', 'Itoyama, Y', 'Kira, J', 'Fujihara, K', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Kitamoto, T', 'Suzumura, A', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Nakajima, Y', 'Goto, I']","['Yu F', 'Itoyama Y', 'Kira J', 'Fujihara K', 'Kobayashi T', 'Kitamoto T', 'Suzumura A', 'Yamamoto N', 'Nakajima Y', 'Goto I']","['Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Glioma/pathology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jun 15;152(12):5930-8.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible involvement of adult T cell leukemia-derived factor and glutathione in transferrin receptor expression.,5633-42,"The proliferative response of PBMC to PHA, Con A, OKT3 mAb and IL-2-dependent proliferation of PHA-blasts was examined in a thiol-free environment (cultured in a L-cystine- and GSH-free medium). [3H]TdR incorporation assay and cell cycle analysis revealed that stimulated PBMC could not enter the S phase when deprived of these thiol compounds. In thiol-free cultures, an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration and IL-2R alpha-chain/p 55 (Tac) induction was still observed, whereas transferrin receptor induction was markedly reduced, suggesting that the proliferative response of mitogenically stimulated PBMC was arrested in the late G1 phase in which transferrin receptor is induced. In GSH-depleted cultures, a similar reduction of the proliferative response of PBMC and PHA-blasts was observed when the concentration of L-cystine was lowered, in a dose-dependent manner. Each reduction or loss of proliferative response was partially restored by supplementation of 2-ME or adult T cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF)/human thioredoxin which is considered to be an endogenous dithiol-reducing factor. L-Cystine transport analysis showed that mitogenically stimulated PBMC and PHA blasts incorporated L-cystine, whereas resting PBMC did not. Furthermore, ADF as well as 2-ME exhibited an enhancing activity on the L-cystine transport in PHA blasts. Together with the fact that L-cystine transport is a limiting step in glutathione synthesis, these findings suggest that GSH and ADF might cooperate in the thiol-mediated redox regulation process and might also play key roles in cell cycle (late G1 to S) progression of activated lymphocytes.","['Iwata, S', 'Hori, T', 'Sato, N', 'Ueda-Taniguchi, Y', 'Yamabe, T', 'Nakamura, H', 'Masutani, H', 'Yodoi, J']","['Iwata S', 'Hori T', 'Sato N', 'Ueda-Taniguchi Y', 'Yamabe T', 'Nakamura H', 'Masutani H', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Biological Responses, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cystine/metabolism', '*Cytokines', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jun 15;152(12):5633-42.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '48TCX9A1VT (Cystine)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunofluorescence microscopy of these ezrin, radixin, or moesin ""single-suppressed"" MTD-1A cells revealed that the ERM family members are colocalized at cell-cell adhesion sites, microvilli, and cleavage furrows, where actin filaments are densely associated with plasma membranes. The ezrin/radixin/moesin antisense PONs mixture induced the destruction of both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, as well as the disappearance of microvilli. Ezrin or radixin antisense PONs individually affected the initial step of the formation of both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, but did not affect the microvilli structures. In sharp contrast, moesin antisense PONs did not singly affect cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, whereas it partly affected the microvilli structures. These data indicate that ezrin and radixin can be functionally substituted, that moesin has some synergetic functional interaction with ezrin and radixin, and that these ERM family members are involved in cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, as well as microvilli formation.","['Takeuchi, K', 'Sato, N', 'Kasahara, H', 'Funayama, N', 'Nagafuchi, A', 'Yonemura, S', 'Tsukita, S', 'Tsukita, S']","['Takeuchi K', 'Sato N', 'Kasahara H', 'Funayama N', 'Nagafuchi A', 'Yonemura S', 'Tsukita S', 'Tsukita S']","['Department of Information Physiology, National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*physiology', '*Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', '*Microfilament Proteins', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microvilli/drug effects/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Thymoma/ultrastructure', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.125.6.1371 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1994 Jun;125(6):1371-84. doi: 10.1083/jcb.125.6.1371.,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Etv5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ezrin)', '144131-77-1 (moesin)', '144517-21-5 (radixin)']",,,,PMC2290919,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mo-MuLV PR appears to act similarly to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) PRs, except for peptides having substitutions at P4 and P2 positions. Mo-MuLV PR shows a strong preference for the analogs having hydrophobic residues, such as Val or Ile at P4, and Ile and Leu at P2, in contrast to HIV-1 and HIV-2 PRs, which prefer smaller or more polar residues at both positions. We built a molecular model of Mo-MuLV PR on the basis of the crystal structure of the related HIV PR. Although the overall structure of Mo-MuLV PR is predicted to be close to that of HIV-1 PR, almost all of the residues forming the subsites are different. The increased hydrophobicity due to the Pro12 insertion and the presence of more aromatic residues in the S4 subsite of Mo-MuLV PR compared to HIV-1 and HIV-2 PRs can be correlated with the observed differences using P4-substituted analogs of VSQNYPIVQ. The preference of Mo-MuLV PR for larger hydrophobic residues at the P2 position can be correlated with the larger size of its S2 subsite, due in part to the presence of Val39, Ala57, and His84 in Mo-MuLV PR, instead of Ile32, Ile50, and Met76, respectively, as occurs in HIV-2 PR.","['Menendez-Arias, L', 'Weber, I T', 'Soss, J', 'Harrison, R W', 'Gotte, D', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Menendez-Arias L', 'Weber IT', 'Soss J', 'Harrison RW', 'Gotte D', 'Oroszlan S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis, Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/biosynthesis/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Primers', 'Genes, Viral', 'HIV Protease/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'HIV-1/enzymology/genetics', 'HIV-2/enzymology/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Substrate Specificity']",1994/06/17 00:00,1994/06/17 00:01,['1994/06/17 00:00'],"['1994/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)89462-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jun 17;269(24):16795-801.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HIV Protease)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (protease, Moloney murine leukemia virus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The final step in sialyl Lewis x synthesis is catalyzed by alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases acting on sialylated glycoconjugate precursors. Cultured human leukocytic cell lines express an alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase gene termed Fuc-TIV or ELFT but do not express the other three cloned human alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase genes to any significant degree. The physiological role of Fuc-TIV/ELFT in sialyl Lewis x biosynthesis is uncertain, however, since it can catalyze the synthesis of this determinant in some, but not all, transfected cell lines in a manner that is dependent upon the glycosylation phenotype of the host cell. We report here the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a new human leukocyte alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase, termed Fuc-TVII, capable of synthesizing the sialyl Lewis x moiety. The cDNA sequence predicts a 341-amino acid-long type II transmembrane protein typical of mammalian glycosyltransferases. When expressed in mammalian cells, the Fuc-TVII cDNA directs the synthesis of cell surface sialyl Lewis x moieties but not the Lewis x, Lewis a, sialyl Lewis a, or VIM-2 determinants. Fuc-TVII can efficiently utilize alpha-2,3-sialyllactosamine in vitro to form the sialyl Lewis x tetrasaccharide but does not utilize lactosamine to form the Lewis x moiety.

A biochemical assay has been designed to detect 3'-->5'-exonucleases in cell extracts that remove the 3'-araCMP lesion in an oligonucleotide template-primer and permit subsequent extension by DNA pol alpha. The major 3'-->5'-exonuclease activity in human myeloblast extracts has been purified, and gel filtration chromatography of the purified enzyme indicates that the exonuclease has an apparent native molecular mass of 52 kDa. Incubation of the enzyme with a 5'-32P-labeled araCMP template-primer results in exonucleolytic degradation of the primer exclusively in the 3'-->5' direction, demonstrating that the enzyme is a 3'-->5'-exonuclease. The products of the 3'-->5'-exonuclease reaction are 5'-mononucleotides. The apparent rate of araCMP removal by the exonuclease is approximately the same as the rate of deoxynucleoside monophosphate (dNMP) removal. Furthermore, the apparent rates of 3'-terminal excision are approximately the same whether the oligomer is hybridized to a complementary oligonucleotide, or not, indicating that the enzyme has both single- and double-stranded 3'-->5'-exonuclease activity. The enzyme does not possess 5'-->3'-exonuclease activity, nor is it associated with DNA polymerase activity. In addition, the enzyme does not cleave 3'-phosphoryl-terminated DNA, and it does not cleave RNA.

IFN-gamma greatly increased the levels of the mRNAs encoding LMP2 and LMP7, putative immuno-proteasome subunits encoded by genes within the class II MHC region, and these two subunits synthesized were assembled completely into the proteasomal multi-subunit complex in various types of human cells. The subunit organization of proteasome changed in response to IFN-gamma stimulation, due to assembly of newly synthesized subunits through up- and down-expressions of at least 6 proteasome genes including LMP2/LMP7 without change in the structure of pre-existing proteasomes. Interestingly, IFN-gamma dramatically stimulated the trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like activities of the multifunctional proteasome and depressed the peptidylglutamyl-peptide-hydrolyzing activity, without affecting the activity for ATP-, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These results indicate that IFN-gamma modifies not only the structural organization of the proteasome, but also its functions. Based on these findings, we discuss the role in the antigen processing/presentation pathway of proteasomes with functional diversity acquired through alteration of their subunit assembly in response to IFN-gamma stimulation.","['Aki, M', 'Shimbara, N', 'Takashina, M', 'Akiyama, K', 'Kagawa, S', 'Tamura, T', 'Tanahashi, N', 'Yoshimura, T', 'Tanaka, K', 'Ichihara, A']","['Aki M', 'Shimbara N', 'Takashina M', 'Akiyama K', 'Kagawa S', 'Tamura T', 'Tanahashi N', 'Yoshimura T', 'Tanaka K', 'Ichihara A']","['Department of Urology, School of Medicine, University of Tokushima.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitins/pharmacology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124327 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1994 Feb;115(2):257-69. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124327.,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '144416-78-4 (LMP-2 protein)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (LMP7 protein)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In their previous study, the authors found that after transient retinal ischemia, the expression of thioredoxin in rat retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer increased markedly. The present investigation is to determine intracellular ADF localization in RPE after transient ischemia and in cultured human RPE cells after oxidative insult by H2O2. METHODS: The authors employed immunoelectron microscopy to examine ADF localization in RPE. Labeling density analysis was performed to supplement the main observation in the experiment of transient retinal ischemia. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to verify the protective role of recombinant ADF (rADF) against H2O2. RESULTS: In immunogold electron microscopy, sparse ADF-positive labeling was seen in the cytosol and mitochondria in normal rat RPE and in untreated cultured RPE cells. After oxidative stress, it was concentrated in mitochondria in both groups. MTT assay proved that rADF protected cultured RPE from the toxicity of H2O2. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the induction of ADF/hTx in mitochondria of RPE after oxidative stresses and its protective effect on cultured RPE exposed to H2O2. The data indicate the possibly important role of ADF/hTx in the protection of retinal cells from the oxidative stresses associated with retinal ischemic disease and probably with regular visual activity.","['Gauntt, C D', 'Ohira, A', 'Honda, O', 'Kigasawa, K', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Masutani, H', 'Yodoi, J', 'Honda, Y']","['Gauntt CD', 'Ohira A', 'Honda O', 'Kigasawa K', 'Fujimoto T', 'Masutani H', 'Yodoi J', 'Honda Y']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytokines', 'Humans', 'Ischemia/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retinal Vein Occlusion/metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1994 Jun;35(7):2916-23.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All these effects were greatly reduced by the presence of 5-10 mM caffeine. In addition, caffeine partially prevented the increase in the number of topoisomerase-DNA cleavable complexes caused by the topoisomerase inhibitors, as determined by SDS/CIK precipitation assays; it caused chromatin condensation, as determined by flow cytometry assays, and interacted with mAMSA in solution, as suggested by spectrophotometric assays. Pulse treatment with caffeine greatly inhibited RNA synthesis but not DNA or protein synthesis, as indicated by labelled precursor incorporation assays. The transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-I-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzymidazole reduced the mAMSA- and VP-16-produced growth inhibition in a similar manner.

In contrast, normal resting cells do not express this inducible receptor. Patients with ATL were treated with different forms of IL-2R-directed therapy to exploit the difference in IL-2R expression between normal and malignant cells. Using the unmodified anti-Tac monoclonal antibody, 7 of 19 patients with ATL treated have undergone a remission (2 cases complete), with no toxicity observed. Unmodified murine monoclonal antibodies are limited by their immunogenicity and poor effector functions. Genetic engineering was used to produce humanized anti-Tac that contains the complementarity-determining regions from the mouse with the remainder of the molecule derived from human IgG1-kappa. This antibody is less immunogenic than the murine version, has improved pharmacokinetics, and, in contrast with the parent antibody, manifests ADCC with human mononuclear cells. To enhance its effector function, anti-Tac was armed with toxins or with alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides. In a clinical trial with 90Y-anti-Tac at the doses used (5, 10, and 15 microCi), 11 of the 17 patients with ATL underwent a partial or sustained a complete remission.

Future residential studies must concentrate on exposure assessment that is enhanced by developing models of historical exposure, assessment of the relation between magnetic fields and wire codes, and consideration of alternate exposure indices. Study design issues deserving attention include possible biases in random digit dialing control selection, consideration of the temporal course of exposure and disease, and acquisition of the necessary information to assess the potential value of ecologic studies. Highest priorities are comprehensive evaluation of exposure patterns and sources and examination of the sociology and geography of residential wire codes. Future occupational studies should also concentrate on improved exposure assessment with increased attention to nonutility worker populations and development of historical exposure indicators that are superior to job titles alone. Potential carcinogens in the workplace that could act as confounders need to be more carefully examined. The temporal relation between exposure and disease and possible effect modification by other workplace agents should be incorporated into future studies. The most pressing need is for measurement of exposure patterns in a variety of worker populations and performance of traditional epidemiologic evaluations of cancer occurrence. The principal source of bias toward the null is nondifferential misclassification of exposure with improvements expected to enhance any true etiologic association that is present. Biases away from the null might include biased control selection in residential studies and chemical carcinogens acting as confounders in occupational studies.","['Savitz, D A']",['Savitz DA'],"['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599-7400.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/analysis', '*Research Design']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.93101s483 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1993 Dec;101 Suppl 4:83-91. doi: 10.1289/ehp.93101s483.,,,,51,PMC1519709,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little information exists regarding the efficacy of gallium in combination with other agents. Since alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) can modulate the action of certain chemotherapeutic drugs, we examined its influence on the growth inhibitory effects of gallium in CCRF-CEM cells. IFN-alpha and gallium as single agents had only minimal to moderate antiproliferative effects. In combination, however, both drugs synergistically inhibited cell growth, causing cell death accompanied by DNA fragmentation. At lower concentrations (120 microM), gallium inhibited cellular iron uptake but did not increase transferrin receptor expression, nor did it block cellular proliferation. The addition of IFN-alpha to this concentration of gallium significantly increased the gallium-induced block of iron uptake, resulting in an increase in transferrin receptors and an inhibition of cell growth. In contrast, IFN-alpha did not enhance the effects of the iron chelator deferoxamine on iron uptake or cell growth. Our studies suggest that gallium and IFN-alpha synergistically inhibit DNA synthesis through a mechanism that includes inhibition of cellular iron uptake and depletion of intracellular iron below the critical level needed to maintain DNA synthesis.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Wereley, J P', 'Riaz-ul-Haq']","['Chitambar CR', 'Wereley JP', 'Riaz-ul-Haq']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],['R01 CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gallium/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage', 'Iron/*pharmacokinetics', 'Iron Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Transferrin/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jun 15;54(12):3224-8.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regenass et al., Cancer Res., 52:4712-4718, 1992). From an ongoing effort to synthesize derivatives with increased enzyme specificity and potency and improved antitumor efficacy, we have now identified CGP 48664, a 4-amidinoindan-1-one 2'-amidinohydrazone (J. Stanek et al., J. Med. Chem., 36:2168-2171, 1993). The compound displays potent inhibition of SAMDC (50% inhibitory concentration, 5 nM), modest inhibition of diamine oxidase (50% inhibitory concentration, 4 microM), and no detectable inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase. CGP 48664 inhibits the growth of a panel of human and mouse tumor cell lines, including one which expresses the multidrug resistance phenotype, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging between 0.3 and 3 microM. CGP 48664 does not seem to utilize the polyamine transport carrier system since it competes poorly with spermidine for uptake into L1210 cells (Ki 161 microM) and inhibits the growth of polyamine transport-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. Relative to MGBG or previously described MGBG analogues, CGP 48664 accumulates to much lower intracellular concentrations. Treatment of the L1210 cell for 48 h with 3 microM CGP 48664 decreases SAMDC activity to < 10% of control and initiates a compensatory 3-fold rise in ornithine decarboxylase. Consistent with SAMDC inhibition, putrescine pools increase 10-fold, whereas spermidine and spermine pools fall to < 10% of control. In contrast to MGBG, CGP 48664 displays attenuated antimitochondrial activity as indicated by a lack of effect on pyruvate oxidation and mitochondrial DNA levels under treatment conditions which inhibit cell proliferation. Specificity of drug action was indicated further by prevention of L1210 cell growth inhibition by exogenous spermidine or spermine. More convincingly, Chinese hamster ovary cells made approximately 1000-fold resistant by chronic exposure to the analogue were found to selectively overexpress SAMDC mRNA due to gene amplification. The new SAMDC inhibitor showed potent antitumor activity against syngeneic tumors (B16 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma) and nude mouse human tumor xenografts (T-24 bladder carcinoma, SK MEL-24 melanoma, and MALME-3M melanoma). On the basis of its novel structure, its apparent specificity of action, and its potent antitumor activity, CGP 48664 is the candidate drug for further preclinical development.","['Regenass, U', 'Mett, H', 'Stanek, J', 'Mueller, M', 'Kramer, D', 'Porter, C W']","['Regenass U', 'Mett H', 'Stanek J', 'Mueller M', 'Kramer D', 'Porter CW']","['Research Department, CIBA-GEIGY, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Amidines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Indans/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Polyamines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jun 15;54(12):3210-7.,"['0 (Amidines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Indans)', '0 (Polyamines)', ""149400-88-4 (4-amidinoindan-1-one 2'-amidinohydrazone)"", 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cytokines are critical for coordinating immune responses and immune reconstitution after BMT, there are still gaps in our knowledge about the expression of mRNA for cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after BMT. Therefore, we systematically studied cytokine gene expression by PBMC from 11 allogeneic and four autologous BMT recipients from 111 to 837 days after BMT and compared the results with PBMC from seven normal controls tested in parallel. PBMC were examined for mRNA expression for IL-2r alpha, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-7 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR). PBMC from 11 allogeneic recipients constitutively expressed mRNA for IL-2r alpha in 2 of 11 and IL-2 in 1 of 9 samples tested whereas the same PBMC constitutively expressed mRNA for IL-3 in 8 of 11, IL-4 in 3 of 7, IL-6 in 6 of 7 and IL-7 in 3 of 6 samples tested.

Six patients had a persistent decrease in the QRS amplitudes. They were all asymptomatic but had abnormal systolic function at the time of the study. BMT patients differed from their controls in the mean values of both the systolic and diastolic indices of myocardial function shown by RNCA and ECHO. Treatment was associated with decreased myocardial contractility. Isovolumic relaxation time and deceleration time were longer in BMT patients than in controls.

With the dual aim of in vitro purging and generation of effectors which could mediate graft-versus-leukemia effects in vivo, IL-2 activation of human bone marrow in long-term cultures (LTC) was tested. Marked cytotoxicity was seen against A375 (melanoma), K562 (CML) and Daudi (lymphoma) cell lines in IL-2 (1000 U/ml) stimulated cultures. Hematopoietic progenitor cell number in these cultures was assessed by day 14 clonogenic assays. In 1-week-old IL-2 stimulated cultures a higher number of clonogenic cells was seen than control LTCs without IL-2. However, thereafter accelerated decrease in the number of clonogenic cells was seen in IL-2 cultures. In vitro purging efficacy was tested by elimination of A375 and K562 cells mixed with normal marrow at 1:10 and 1:100 ratios and co-cultured for 10 days. In IL-2 stimulated cultures, A375 cells capable of proliferation were not detectable at both mixing ratios. K562 elimination was complete only at 1:100 ratio. After 10 days in culture, no Ph1-positive metaphases were seen in IL-2 stimulated BM cultures of 4 patients with CML.

The activity of donor lymph node cells for the induction of lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) correlated with the intensity of GVL effect induced by intact donor bone marrow. The results indicate that GVL effect against radiation-induced leukemias could be consistently induced in MHC-incompatible allogeneic BMT whereas the intensity of GVL effect induced in MHC-compatible allogeneic BMT varied among different leukemias and the donor-host strain combinations used.","['Aizawa, S', 'Sado, T', 'Kamisaku, H', 'Nemoto, K', 'Yoshida, K']","['Aizawa S', 'Sado T', 'Kamisaku H', 'Nemoto K', 'Yoshida K']","['Division of Physiology and Pathology, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Experimental/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Feb;13(2):109-14.,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed records of 206 patients who underwent ABMT for lymphoma at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN) between 1974 and 1993. Of 206 patients who underwent ABMT for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's disease (HD), 9 patients developed an MDS or secondary acute leukemia between 5 and 60 months (median 34 months) post-BMT. Two patients had relapsed after transplant and received additional therapy before the diagnosis of MDS. They were censored from the statistical analysis, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 14.5% +/- 11.6% (95% confidence interval) at 5 years. Three patients (15.2% +/- 18.0%) had HD, and four (14.0% +/- 14.7%) had NHL. In vitro BM purging had no affect on the incidence of MDS, although patients receiving peripheral blood stem cells had a projected MDS incidence of 31% +/- 33% versus 10.5% +/- 12% if BM cells were used (p = .0035). The patients had received a median of 14 cycles (range, 6 to 40) of chemotherapy before autologous transplantation; Five of nine patients received radiation therapy before BMT conditioning, and all patients received radiation before the diagnosis of MDS. No BM cytogenetic abnormalities were evident pretransplant in three of three patients studied, and all nine had normal pretransplant BM morphology. All patients had morphologic BM findings typical of MDS, and six of six studied had clonal cytogenetic abnormalities. At the diagnosis of MDS, all nine patients were without clinical, radiographic, or autopsy evidence of recurrent lymphoma; Three of the nine patients have died from complications of cytopenias at 23, 36, and 45 months after transplant (3 to 10 months after the diagnosis of MDS), whereas 6 survive 8 to 63 months after transplantation (1 to 34 months post-MDS).

Its deregulation is thought to perturb the G1-S transition of the cell cycle and thereby to contribute to tumor development. As suggested by previously published studies, rearrangement of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of CCND1 may contribute to its activation in some lymphoid tumors. To define further the prevalence of such rearrangements, we report here the result of the molecular study of 34 MCL and six t(11q13)-associated leukemias using a set of probes specific to the different parts of the CCND1 transcript. We also sequenced the entire cDNA of the overexpressed CCND1 transcripts in a t(11q13)-associated leukemia. DNA from four of these 40 patients showed rearrangement of the 3' UTR of CCND1 coexisting with major translocation cluster (MTC) rearrangement. Southern blot and sequence analyses showed that, as a result of these rearrangements, the 3' AU-rich region containing sequences involved in mRNA stability and in translational control is eliminated. Moreover, the finding that the CCND1 mRNA half-life was greater than 3 hours (normal tissues, 0.5 hours) in three t(11q13)-associated cell lines stresses the importance of posttranscriptional derangement in the activation of CCND1. Finally, we did not observe any mutation in the coding frame of the CCND1 cDNA analyzed.","['Rimokh, R', 'Berger, F', 'Bastard, C', 'Klein, B', 'French, M', 'Archimbaud, E', 'Rouault, J P', 'Santa Lucia, B', 'Duret, L', 'Vuillaume, M']","['Rimokh R', 'Berger F', 'Bastard C', 'Klein B', 'French M', 'Archimbaud E', 'Rouault JP', 'Santa Lucia B', 'Duret L', 'Vuillaume M', 'et al.']","['Laboratoire de Cytogenetique Moleculaire, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclins/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78867-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 15;83(12):3689-96.,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,['GENBANK/Z23022'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we examined 170 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 7 cases of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL), 25 cases of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and 22 cases of splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) with defined cytogenetic abnormalities by DNA blot using both 5' and 3' BCL2 probes to search for rearrangement of the BCL2 locus. Translocation t(14;18) (q32.3;q21.3) was detected cytogenetically in 3 cases of B-CLL. All had breakpoints in the 3' region of BCL2, mapping between the major breakpoint region (MBR) and the minor cluster region (mcr), the breakpoint clusters commonly detected in B-NHL. In 2 of the 3 cases, the breakpoint within BCL2 was mapped to a 1.0-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment indicating a clustering of breakpoints. Two cases of B-CLL had cytogenetically detectable t(2;18)(p11;q21.3) or t(18;22)(q21.3;q11). Both had rearranged the 5' region of the BCL2 gene to the corresponding lg light-chain gene. Molecular cloning of the t(18;22)(q21.3;q11) showed that the translocation disrupted the BCL2 promoter region and the first untranslated BCL2 exon. Nevertheless, high levels of BCL2 protein were seen in this case. Only 2 other cases in whom cytogenetic analysis was not successful showed rearrangement of the 5' region of BCL2, an overall incidence of 2.3%. No cases of B-PLL, HCL, or SLVL showed either 5' or 3' BCL2 rearrangement. These data confirm the cytogenetic observations that translocations involving the BCL2 locus in all forms of leukemia of mature B cells are rare, and limited to a minor subset of B-CLL. BCL2 translocations in B-CLL involve hot spots of recombination of both the 5' and 3' regions of the BCL2 gene, which are distinct from those commonly seen in B-NHL, suggesting distinct pathogenic mechanisms.","['Dyer, M J', 'Zani, V J', 'Lu, W Z', ""O'Byrne, A"", 'Mould, S', 'Chapman, R', 'Heward, J M', 'Kayano, H', 'Jadayel, D', 'Matutes, E']","['Dyer MJ', 'Zani VJ', 'Lu WZ', ""O'Byrne A"", 'Mould S', 'Chapman R', 'Heward JM', 'Kayano H', 'Jadayel D', 'Matutes E', 'et al.']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78866-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 15;83(12):3682-8.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,,,['BCL2'],,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that MMP-9 was constitutively released from the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 as determined by zymographic analysis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) enhanced the enzyme release threefold to fourfold and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator and differentiation inducer 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) eightfold to ninefold. Gelatinase induction by TNF-alpha and TPA was inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was required. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to TNF-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) decreased the basal MMP-9 release of these cells. In addition, these antibodies also significantly interfered with the TPA-induced enzyme release. Agents that inhibit TNF-alpha expression in HL-60 cells, such as pentoxifylline and dexamethasone, completely abrogated both the constitutive and TPA-evoked MMP-9 release. Diethyldithiocarbamate, which is known to stimulate TNF-alpha production in HL-60 cells, exerted a positive effect on MMP-9 release in untreated cells but was inhibitory in TPA-treated HL-60 cells. The PKC inhibitor staurosporine at low concentrations (100 ng/mL) caused a significant augmentation of MMP-9 release in untreated cultures that was blocked by the addition of anti-TNF-alpha. High concentrations (2 mumol/L) of staurosporine completely abolished the extracellular enzyme activity both in untreated and TPA-stimulated cells. These results suggest, that TNF-alpha is required for basal and PKC-mediated MMP-9 release in HL-60 leukemia cells. Thus, MMP-9 secretion may be regulated by TNF-alpha not only in a paracrine but also in an autocrine fashion. This may potentiate the matrix degradative capacity of immature leukemic cells in the processes of bone marrow egress and the evasion of these cells into peripheral tissue.","['Ries, C', 'Kolb, H', 'Petrides, P E']","['Ries C', 'Kolb H', 'Petrides PE']","['Institute for Clinical Hematology, GSF Forschungszentrum fur Umwelt und Gesundheit, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Ditiocarb/pharmacology', 'Gelatinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Pentoxifylline/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/*physiology']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78861-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 15;83(12):3638-46.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '99Z2744345 (Ditiocarb)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ph1 and the resulting BCR-ABL fused genes are markers for this type of leukemia. In CML, the product of the fused BCR-ABL gene is typically a protein of approximately 2,000 amino acids termed P210 BCR-ABL. We have developed an assay for the BCR-ABL protein involving Western blotting of circulating white blood cells (WBC) with an anti-ABL monoclonal antibody that can detect P210 BCR-ABL and P145 ABL in peripheral blood cells from chronic phase Ph1-positive leukemia patients. This assay was used to analyze the BCR-ABL protein content of circulating WBC from CML patients before and after various treatments. In parallel to changes in percentages of Ph1-positive blood cells as determined by cytogenetic analyses of bone marrow samples, BCR-ABL protein expression in blood cells decreased or increased as patients entered remission or underwent relapse.

For this purpose, murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were generated against Pre-Alp, a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, and MoAb R34.34 was selected for further characterization. R34.34 recognized a molecule expressed on normal B-cell precursors (BCP) but not on mature B cells. The antibody also reacted with T lymphocytes, a subpopulation of monocytes from peripheral blood, and a subset of CD34+ cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that R34.34 recognizes an 80-kD molecular weight antigen. Antibody R34.34 was further found to be directed against an epitope interfering with binding of interleukin-7 (IL-7) to Pre-Alp cells. Expression cloning from a Pre-Alp cDNA library showed that R34.34 antigen is CDw127, the 75- to 80-kD IL-7 receptor. Proliferation of the B-lineage ALL cell lines Reh and Mieliki was inhibited by IL-7, and this effect was specifically reverted by MoAb R34.34. In addition, antibody R34.34 specifically inhibited IL-7-dependent proliferation of normal BCP, Pre-Alp cells, and peripheral T cells. These results imply that both inhibitory and proliferative effects of IL-7 can be mediated through the same receptor on various lineages. R34.34 antibody should be important for the analysis of signal transduction through CDw127.","['Pandrau-Garcia, D', 'de Saint-Vis, B', 'Saeland, S', 'Renard, N', 'Ho, S', 'Moreau, I', 'Banchereau, J', 'Galizzi, J P']","['Pandrau-Garcia D', 'de Saint-Vis B', 'Saeland S', 'Renard N', 'Ho S', 'Moreau I', 'Banchereau J', 'Galizzi JP']","['Schering-Plough Laboratory for Immunological Research, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7', 'Signal Transduction']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78858-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 15;83(12):3613-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) Relapse Study Group.,3468-72,"Presymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) treatment in children with a late isolated first bone marrow (BM) relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was based on intermediate-dose systemic and intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) in the multicenter trial, ALL-REZ BFM 85. Because this was associated with an excess of overt second CNS relapses, cranial radiotherapy (cRT) plus prolonged triple IT therapy with MTX, cytarabine, and prednisone was instituted during the course of the subsequent trial, ALL-REZ BFM 87. Results of children with or without cRT, but otherwise identical chemotherapy, are presented here. Between April 1985 and March 1990, 93 children with their first late isolated BM relapse of ALL were entered on protocols ALL-REZ BFM 85M and ALL-REZ BFM 87. An intensive 6-month phase of multiagent chemotherapy that included 8 courses of systemic MTX (1 g/m2) plus IT MTX was followed by 2 years of conventional maintenance therapy with daily 6-thioguanine and biweekly MTX. Children with bone marrow transplantation excluded, 73 were in complete remission at the end of intensive polychemotherapy, 40 of whom received fractionated cRT plus triple IT therapy during the following 6 months; 11 did not receive cRT but prolonged triple IT; 22 received neither cRT nor prolonged triple IT. Except for a higher percentage of children who had received cRT in front-line protocols (29 of 33 v 20 of 40), the patient groups without or with salvage cRT were comparable. Of 33 children without salvage cRT, 26 relapsed, compared with 21 of 40 who had received cRT (P < .05). The difference was solely attributable to second relapses with CNS involvement (10 of 33 v 1 of 40; P < .01). Estimated 6-year event-free survival rates were .18 for children without cRT and .46 for children with cRT (P < .01). In patients without cRT, no impact of prolonged IT therapy could be shown. The data suggest that second CNS prophylaxis with cRT and prolonged triple IT therapy in children with late isolated BM relapse of ALL is effective in preventing CNS relapses, in reducing the overall relapse rate, and in increasing the overall survival rate.","['Buhrer, C', 'Hartmann, R', 'Fengler, R', 'Schober, S', 'Arlt, I', 'Loewke, M', 'Henze, G']","['Buhrer C', 'Hartmann R', 'Fengler R', 'Schober S', 'Arlt I', 'Loewke M', 'Henze G']","[""Children's Hospital, Rudolf Virchow Medical Center, Berlin Free University, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78842-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 15;83(12):3468-72.,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of genomic instability of microsatellites has indicated a new mechanism for human carcinogenesis in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and sporadic cancer and this instability has been shown to be related to inherited predisposition to cancer. This study was conducted to determine whether such microsatellite instability is associated with the evolution of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to the blast crisis. Nineteen CML patients clinically progressing from the chronic phase to accelerated phase or blast crisis and 20 other patients in the CML chronic phase were studied. By polymerase chain reaction assay, DNAs for genomic instability in five separate microsatellites in chromosome arms 5q (Mfd27), 17p (Mfd41), 18q (DCC), 3p (CI3-9), and 8p (LPL) were examined. Differences in unrelated microsatellites of chronic and blastic phase DNAs in 14 of 19 patients (73.7%) were demonstrated. Somatic instability in five microsatellites, Mfd27, Mfd41, DCC, CI3-9, and LPL, was detected in 2 of 19 (10.5%), 8 of 19 (42.1%), 11 of 19 (57.9%), 4 of 17 (23.5%), and 4 of 17 (23.5%) cases. In 10 of 19 cases (52.6%), genetic instability in at least two of five microsatellites was observed and was categorized as replication error (RER+) phenotype. CML evolution cases with myeloid, lymphoid, and mixed phenotypes and the blast crisis and accelerated phase showed somatic instability in a number of microsatellites. No alterations in leukemic cells at the chronic phase could be detected in any microsatellites. These data indicate instability of microsatellites (RER+) but not familial predisposition to possibly be a late genetic event in the evolution of CML to blast crisis. In the microsatellite of the DCC gene, complicated alterations in band patterns caused by instability as well as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were observed in 13 of 19 cases (68.4%): instability in 9 cases, instability plus LOH in 2 cases, and only LOH in 2 cases. These highly frequent alterations in microsatellites, including instability and LOH, suggesting that secondary events due possibly to loss of fidelity in replication and repair machinery may be significantly associated with CML evolution.","['Wada, C', 'Shionoya, S', 'Fujino, Y', 'Tokuhiro, H', 'Akahoshi, T', 'Uchida, T', 'Ohtani, H']","['Wada C', 'Shionoya S', 'Fujino Y', 'Tokuhiro H', 'Akahoshi T', 'Uchida T', 'Ohtani H']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, School of Medicine, Kitasato University, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA, Satellite/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, DCC', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78839-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 15;83(12):3449-56.,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)']",,['Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):3236.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and reports in the literature form the basis of this report. RESULTS: CLL has traditionally been treated with alkylating agents and corticosteroids. In this study, fludarabine has shown marked cytoreductive ability in both previously treated patients and untreated patients. In the former group, there has been a 55% response rate in 374 patients, and 79% in the untreated CLL group. Fludarabine has also been very active in the management of low-grade lymphomas, with two-thirds of patients with follicular lymphoma and half of those with other indolent lymphomas responding. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is also sensitive to the effects of fludarabine. Combination regimens were developed incorporating the substantial effectiveness of fludarabine and mitoxantrone where in the previously treated low-grade lymphoma group 25 of 28 patients (89%) responded. Fludarabine has the effect of increasing the triphosphate form of cytosine arabinoside in acute and chronic leukemic cells. This modulation has now been translated into therapy for acute leukemia and combined with cisplatinum in refractory CLL. Fludarabine inhibits DNA repair and enhances cross-linking of DNA by cisplatinum. The combination of fludarabine, ara-C, and cis-platinum is now being used in refractory CLL. Fludarabine is a radiation sensitizer, inhibiting repair of DNA damage. Studies are ongoing with this combination. CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine is a potent molecule with a wide range of biochemical effects. Optimal use of this drug alone and in combination is continuing to be explored.","['Keating, M J', 'McLaughlin, P', 'Plunkett, W', 'Robertson, L E', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Gandhi, V', 'Gregoire, V', 'Yang, L', 'Cabanillas, F']","['Keating MJ', 'McLaughlin P', 'Plunkett W', 'Robertson LE', ""O'Brien S"", 'Gandhi V', 'Gregoire V', 'Yang L', 'Cabanillas F']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

The Kaplan Memorial Lecture.,5-16,"The aim of this review is to examine critically, in Hodgkin's disease and in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, (a) whether combined modality treatment is superior to optimal radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone in most stages of the disease; (b) whether its indications could be further expanded by the use of new drug regimens and newer radiation techniques that can now substantially reduce the risk of long-term iatrogenic morbidity; and (c) whether it may become a necessary approach in the future because staging laparotomy and even lymphangiography are progressively falling into disuse. In conclusion, for the next decade or so, I do not foresee a departure from complex treatment programs. Although fewer patients are being referred to major research centers, the treatment of malignant lymphomas is not ready as yet to be relegated to the care of the single physician in a private office or local hospital.","['Bonadonna, G']",['Bonadonna G'],"['Division of Medical Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/annonc/5.suppl_2.s5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1994;5 Suppl 2:5-16. doi: 10.1093/annonc/5.suppl_2.s5.,,,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the ability of these retroviral peptides to form ordered conformations using 1H-NMR, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and intrinsic viscosity measurements. One dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the 60 amino acid peptide could form a stable, folded structure that was long-lived, as shown by the ability to protect amide-protons in D20. Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 42, N-terminal 20 amino acids, and middle 20 amino acid sections could also form stable structures. The C-terminal segment did not protect any protons in D20. Interestingly, self assembly of the N-terminal 42 and C-terminal 16 amino acid peptides into a structure very close to that of the 60 amino acid domain was observed. The circular dichroism results reveals a large negative cotton effect at 198 nm that is characteristic of the proline-rich beta-turn helixes which consist predominantly of trans-proline. The intrinsic viscosity results suggest a non-random coil structure that is rod shaped. Our conclusion is that PRN60 forms a beta-turn helix and that this region of FeLV-gp70 is a separate folding domain of the retroviral surface unit glycoprotein. The unique conformational properties of PRN60 and its critical role as the predominant target for neutralizing antibody responses suggest that this peptide is a reasonable candidate for producing a synthetic peptide vaccine for FeLV.","['Fontenot, J D', 'Tjandra, N', 'Ho, C', 'Andrews, P C', 'Montelaro, R C']","['Fontenot JD', 'Tjandra N', 'Ho C', 'Andrews PC', 'Montelaro RC']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, PA 15261.']",['eng'],"['CA43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-26874/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Biomol Struct Dyn,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,8404176,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Proline/*analysis/chemistry', '*Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*chemistry/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/immunology', 'Viscosity']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07391102.1994.10508035 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomol Struct Dyn. 1994 Feb;11(4):821-36. doi: 10.1080/07391102.1994.10508035.,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relation between netropsin binding to A+T rich region of M.MuLV LTR end and inhibition of insertion is strongly suggested from the inability of the drug to inhibit the insertion of HIV U3 LTR end which displays a G+C rich sequence. Selective inhibition of integration of viral DNA appears to be feasible using drugs recognizing LTR end sequences.","['Carteau, S', 'Mouscadet, J F', 'Goulaouic, H', 'Subra, F', 'Auclair, C']","['Carteau S', 'Mouscadet JF', 'Goulaouic H', 'Subra F', 'Auclair C']","['Laboratoire de Physicochimie et Pharmacologie des Macromolecules Biologiques, CNRS URA 147, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Integrases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*drug effects/enzymology/genetics', 'Netropsin/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1994/05/18 00:00,1994/05/18 00:01,['1994/05/18 00:00'],"['1994/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)90311-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90311-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 May 18;47(10):1821-6. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90311-5.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '64B3O0RD7N (Netropsin)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records were reviewed, and the patients or their relatives were interviewed. Median follow-up after laparotomy was 15.7 years (range = 2.5-28 years). RESULTS: Ten episodes of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) were documented in nine patients (6.8%). None of 25 patients who received pneumococcal vaccine before splenectomy developed OPSI. Patients with advanced (stages III-IV) or recurrent Hodgkin's disease were at higher risk of OPSI than those with early disease, and those who received combined modality oncologic therapy were at greater risk than those receiving less intensive treatment. Surgical complications included small bowel obstruction in 13 patients (9.8%), necessitating repeat laparotomy in 9 patients (6.8%), atelectasis in 17 patients, abscess in 3 patients, and 1 wound dehiscence. No deaths occurred as a result of surgical complications. Causes of death in the 29 patients who died included Hodgkin's disease (12 patients), acute treatment-related morbidity (1 patient), leukemia (5 patients), bone marrow failure (3 patients), solid malignancy (2 patients), intercurrent disease (4 patients), unknown causes (1 patient), and OPSI (1 patient). CONCLUSION: With presplenectomy pneumococcal vaccination and modern surgical techniques, the long-term risks of laparotomy with splenectomy are acceptable if knowledge of the pathologic extent of abdominal Hodgkin's disease would alter treatment regimens.","['Jockovich, M', 'Mendenhall, N P', 'Sombeck, M D', 'Talbert, J L', 'Copeland, E M 3rd', 'Bland, K I']","['Jockovich M', 'Mendenhall NP', 'Sombeck MD', 'Talbert JL', 'Copeland EM 3rd', 'Bland KI']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Surg,Annals of surgery,0372354,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Bacterial Vaccines', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Laparotomy/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Splenectomy/adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",1994/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000658-199406000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg. 1994 Jun;219(6):615-21; discussion 621-4. doi: 10.1097/00000658-199406000-00004.,['0 (Bacterial Vaccines)'],,,31,PMC1243206,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary function of the metal is catalytic and zinc is thus necessary for both its peptidase and its epoxide hydrolase activity. However, at concentrations of zinc exceeding a 1:1 molar ratio (metal:enzyme), we found that zinc acted as an inhibitor with IC50 values of 10 microM for the epoxide hydrolase activity, i.e., the conversion of leukotriene A4 to leukotriene B4, and 0.1 microM for the peptidase activity. The inhibition of both enzyme activities could be reversed by treating the enzyme with chelating agents such as EDTA or dipicolinic acid. Several divalent cations, other than zinc, were also found to inhibit leukotriene A4 hydrolase although with different specificity and potency for the two enzyme activities. Thus, CdSO4 and HgCl2 were effective inhibitors (IC50 approximately 10 microM) of the epoxide hydrolase activity, whereas CoCl2 or MnCl2 were not inhibitory even at concentrations of 1 mM. On the other hand, the peptidase activity was inhibited by CdSO4, NiSO4, HgCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, and PbNO3, listed in decreasing order of potencies (IC50 0.5-10 microM). In addition, zinc in micromolar concentrations inhibited leukotriene B4 formation in intact human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187 and cell homogenates incubated with arachidonic acid. However, this effect was not related to inhibition of leukotriene A4 hydrolase but rather to a direct or indirect inhibitory effect on the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase in isolated leukocytes. In these cells, 15-lipoxygenase activity was also inhibited by zinc (IC50 5 microM), whereas leukotriene C4 synthase activity in human platelets and rat basophilic leukemia cells was significantly affected only at concentrations > or = 1 mM.","['Wetterholm, A', 'Macchia, L', 'Haeggstrom, J Z']","['Wetterholm A', 'Macchia L', 'Haeggstrom JZ']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/enzymology/metabolism', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', '*Cadmium Compounds', 'Cations, Divalent/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Endopeptidases/*blood/metabolism', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Leukotriene B4/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Mercuric Chloride/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sulfates/pharmacology', 'Zinc/*pharmacology', 'Zinc Compounds/pharmacology', 'Zinc Sulfate']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(84)71236-7 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1994.1236 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1994 Jun;311(2):263-71. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1994.1236.,"['0 (Cadmium Compounds)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '53GH7MZT1R (Mercuric Chloride)', '7733-02-0 (Zinc Sulfate)', '947UNF3Z6O (cadmium sulfate)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'V38765PUZ6 (leukotriene A4 hydrolase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a prospective, randomized, open trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral roxithromycin (150 mg twice daily) as additional antibacterial prophylaxis in 131 adult patients with acute leukemia and bone marrow transplant recipients receiving oral ofloxacin. In comparison with patients given ofloxacin alone, fewer patients receiving ofloxacin plus roxithromycin developed bacteremia caused by viridans group streptococci (incidence, 9 versus 0%; P = 0.03), while the incidence of bacteremia caused by other organisms, the incidence of febrile episodes from any cause, the risk of infection-associated complications (including prolonged or secondary fever, pneumonia, septic shock, need for mechanical ventilation, and/or infection-related death), and antimicrobial usage for therapy were comparable between both groups. Adverse events possibly related to the study drugs were slightly more common among the patients receiving the combination treatment (P = 0.05).

Stimulation of the oxidase during infection leads to a burst of metabolic acid generation. Potentially deleterious cytosolic acidification is prevented by the simultaneous activation of homeostatic H+ extrusion mechanisms, including a recently described H+ conductance. Studies in granulocytes from chronic granulomatous disease patients have suggested a relationship between the oxidase and the H+ conductive pathway. In this report we compared the expression of the H+ conductance and the NADPH oxidase during granulocytic differentiation of dimethyl sulfoxide-induced HL-60 cells. Patch-clamp determinations demonstrated that the H(+)-selective current detectable in differentiated HL-60 cells is virtually absent in uninduced cells. The H+ conductance was also estimated fluorimetrically, measuring changes in the cytosolic pH of suspended cells. Imposition of an inward protonmotive force failed to induce significant cytosolic acidification. In contrast, a sizable conductive H+ extrusion was detected in acid-loaded differentiated cells, consistent with the rectifying properties of the current measured electrophysiologically. By the spectroscopic method, the H+ conductance was not detectable in uninduced cells, developing gradually during granulocytic differentiation. Development of the conductive pathway was found to parallel the biochemical and functional appearance of the NADPH oxidase. These findings suggest that the H+ extrusion mechanisms required for the maintenance of the intracellular pH during granulocyte activation develop pari passu with the acid generating systems and suggest a functional and possibly structural association between the H+ conductance and the NADPH oxidase.","['Qu, A Y', 'Nanda, A', 'Curnutte, J T', 'Grinstein, S']","['Qu AY', 'Nanda A', 'Curnutte JT', 'Grinstein S']","['Division of Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['AI-24838/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electric Conductivity/drug effects/physiology', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1994.266.5.C1263 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1994 May;266(5 Pt 1):C1263-70. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1994.266.5.C1263.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Peptides)', ""85138-49-4 (2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein)"", 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular pathogenesis of B-CLL is largely unknown. Although initial reports on small panels of cases had suggested a role for Bcl-1 and Bcl-2 oncogene activation in B-CLL, later investigations failed to confirm these data. Among tumor suppressor genes, p53 mutations have been reported in a fraction of cases. In this study, we have attempted a conclusive definition of the involvement of dominantly acting oncogenes (Bcl-1 and Bcl-2) and tumor suppressor loci (p53, 6q-) in 100 cases of B-CLL selected for their CD5 positivity and Rai's stage (0 to IV). Rearrangements of Bcl-1 and Bcl-2 and deletions of 6q and 17p were analyzed by Southern blot using multiple probes. Mutational analysis (single strand conformation polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing) was used to assay p53 inactivation. No alterations of Bcl-1 or Bcl-2 were detected in the 100 cases tested. Mutations of p53 were found in 10/100 cases without any significant association with clinical stage. Deletions of 6q were present in 4/100 cases. Overall, our data indicate that: 1) contrary to previous reports, Bcl-1 and Bcl-2 rearrangements are not involved in CD5+ B-CLL pathogenesis and 2) p53 mutations are present in 10% of cases at all stages of the disease.","['Gaidano, G', 'Newcomb, E W', 'Gong, J Z', 'Tassi, V', 'Neri, A', 'Cortelezzi, A', 'Calori, R', 'Baldini, L', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Gaidano G', 'Newcomb EW', 'Gong JZ', 'Tassi V', 'Neri A', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Calori R', 'Baldini L', 'Dalla-Favera R']","['Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['CA-44029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cyclin D1', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1994 Jun;144(6):1312-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,PMC1887466,,"['Bcl-1', 'Bcl-2', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,

Partial purification of pp90rsk by affinity chromatography demonstrated an increase in S6 peptide phosphorylation when comparing irradiated with control cells. IR-induced activation of pp90rsk was further confirmed in immune-complex kinase assays. In contrast to these findings, there was no detectable induction of pp70S6K. Previous work has demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase activates pp90rsk. The present results further show that IR treatment is associated with induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and that this event is temporally related to activation of pp90rsk and early response gene expression.

Progeny from mating endogenous late-feathering (LF), K/k+ males carrying an endogenous virus gene (ev21) with virgin early-feathering (EF) k+/w females were examined for the presence of infectious endogenous virus EV21 using an enzyme-labeled immunoassay for viral capsid antigen p27. All 177 LF chicks expressed EV21, p27, and 171 of 175 EF chicks did not express p27. Blood from the four p27-positive EF chicks revealed only infectious Subgroup E ALV as determined by subgroup-specific virus assays. Southern blot DNA hybridizations, however, ruled out germline integration of EV21 among the four infected EF progeny. Virus EV21 was not shed in albumens of the dams. Moreover, antibodies against ALV Subgroups A and E were not detected in dams 17 wk after the first insemination. Chicks infected with EV21 were found only in the first two of six hatches. Data suggested direct infection of the embryos from viremic semen rather than congenital infection through infected hens. Direct male transmission of EV21 to progeny may be the basis for persistence of refractory lines noted in some ALV eradication programs. Based on the absence of recombinants among 352 progeny, ev21 and K appear to be less than .3 cM apart.","['Smith, E J', 'Fadly, A M']","['Smith EJ', 'Fadly AM']","['USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, East Lansing, Michigan 48823.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/microbiology/*transmission', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Chick Embryo/*microbiology', 'Chickens/genetics/*microbiology', 'Feathers/growth & development', 'Female', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Male', 'Michigan', 'Phenotype', 'Poultry Diseases/genetics/microbiology/transmission', 'Semen/*microbiology', 'Sex Factors']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.3382/ps.0730488 [doi]', 'S0032-5791(19)51939-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 1994 Apr;73(4):488-94. doi: 10.3382/ps.0730488.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is presently unknown what molecular force is responsible for this A-pressure. In this manuscript, we demonstrate a correlation between this 'A-pressure' and the amino acid-usage of the lentivirus family. We compared the amino acid composition of the Gag and Pol proteins of the human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) with that of the second group of human retroviruses; the human T-cell leukemia viruses type I and II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II). Differences in total amino acid content correlate with the preference for A-rich codons in the HIV genome. A pair-wise comparison of homologous amino acid positions in the Pol proteins indicates that both conservative and non-conservative changes can be accounted for by this A-bias.

These patients received cyclophosphamide and four received etoposide in addition to other agents. There were 1,062 eligible patients entered on IRS III between 1984 and 1991. Following surgery, treatment consisted of multiagent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in select clinical groups. Median follow-up time is 3.7 years (range 0-7.4 years). Incidence densities and odds ratios for AML were calculated for various treatment groups. Five cases of secondary AML have been reported through August 1992. A single case of osteogenic sarcoma was reported in the same period and a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome has occurred since that time. Median time to development of AML was 39 months. Incidence density of AML for patients receiving neither cyclophosphamide nor etoposide was 0, for those receiving cyclophosphamide but no etoposide it was 7.6, and when both agents were given, it was 51.6. The odds ratios of AML for the latter two groups indicated a risk of AML which was seven times higher in the patients who received both agents. A history of breast cancer was present in all five families of patients with AML and several other cancers had occurred in three families. Preliminary analysis suggests a possible causal role for low-dose etoposide in addition to that assumed for cyclophosphamide in the early development of AML among pediatric patients treated for rhabdomyosarcoma.","['Heyn, R', 'Khan, F', 'Ensign, L G', 'Donaldson, S S', 'Ruymann, F', 'Smith, M A', 'Vietti, T', 'Maurer, H M']","['Heyn R', 'Khan F', 'Ensign LG', 'Donaldson SS', 'Ruymann F', 'Smith MA', 'Vietti T', 'Maurer HM']","[""Mott Children's Hospital, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0238.""]",['eng'],"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Extremities', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Odds Ratio', 'Osteosarcoma/chemically induced', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Spinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950230206 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1994;23(2):99-106. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950230206.,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cases of t-AML generally have a shorter latency period than t-AML following alkylator therapy, are associated with chromosomal translocations (especially involving chromosome band 11q23), and usually present as M4 or M5 FAB subtype. Although the epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide and teniposide) have been most often implicated, similar cases of t-AML occur following therapy with other classes of Topo-II inhibitors (e.g., anthracyclines). There is wide variation in published studies in the estimates of risk of t-AML following epipodophyllotoxin therapy. These varying estimates may reflect a number of factors, including: small sample size leading to large confidence intervals around risk estimates; varying susceptibility of different patient populations; varying schedules of epipodophyllotoxin administration; different cumulative doses of epipodophyllotoxins; and administration of epopodophyllotoxins with additional agents that may alter the leukemogenic effect of the epipodophyllotoxins. Available data suggest that children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) treated with high cumulative doses of epipodophyllotoxins using either weekly or twice-weekly schedules of administration have a relatively high risk of developing t-AML (5-12% cumulative risk). On the other hand, germ cell patients treated with relatively low cumulative doses of etoposide (usually 1,500-2,500 mg/m2) appear to have a low risk for developing t-AML. There is inadequate experience at this time with higher cumulative doses of etoposide (e.g., 4,000-5,000 mg/m2 as used for pediatric solid tumors) given on a daily x 5 schedule to allow estimates of risk to be developed for this schedule and cumulative dose. The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a monitoring plan designed to obtain reliable estimates of the risk of t-AML following epipodophyllotoxin treatment. Twelve Cooperative Group clinical trials that use epipodophyllotoxins at either low (< 1,500 mg/m2), moderate (1,500-3,999 mg/m2), or higher cumulative doses (> 4,000 mg/m2) are being prospectively monitored for cases of t-AML occurring among patients entered onto the trials.","['Smith, M A', 'Rubinstein, L', 'Ungerleider, R S']","['Smith MA', 'Rubinstein L', 'Ungerleider RS']","['Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, DCT, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/adverse effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Podophyllotoxin/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950230205 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1994;23(2):86-98. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950230205.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",,,131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better define the occurrence of these events a registry of cases with synchronous or asynchronous LCH and malignancy was developed with the cooperation of the Histiocyte Society. In 1991 the Histiocyte Society surveyed its members requesting information on cases in which LCH was associated with malignancy. The questionnaire was mailed to all members of the society and specifically requested information on the clinical and laboratory features of the cases, disease evolution, and response to therapy. Retrospective reporting was allowed. With this initial data, an ongoing registry of LCH patients with associated malignancy was begun of such cases, including evolution and response to therapy. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled during the first year of registry, of whom 4 patients had the association of LCH with a malignant lymphoma and 10 cases had an association of LCH with other types of solid tumor. The remaining 13 patients had the association of LCH with acute leukemia. In five cases, LCH was associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia FAB L1 (ALL). In four cases the ALL preceded the LCH by 6 months to 1 year. In four of five patients the LCH was localized; in two instances the LCH was treated with chemotherapy. In all cases the leukemia was treated according to local standard ALL protocols and in one case autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) was performed at relapse. Three patients are free of leukemia, one of whom has persistent localized LCH of the skin. Two patients died of the ALL, one of whom was free of the LCH at the time of death. In eight instances LCH was reported in association with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Six of these patients had a generalized form of LCH. In seven the diagnosis of LCH preceded the diagnosis of leukemia by more than 2 years (median 4 years). In the remaining patient both diagnoses were made concurrently. In all seven cases in whom LCH was the initial diagnosis the treatment consisted of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Seven patients died from the AML, five without evidence of LCH.

We report a case of isolated bone recurrence, review all previously reported cases, and suggest that PCR elucidation of clonal disease may provide a better understanding of these extremely rare extramedullary events.","['Murray, J C', 'Gmoser, D J', 'Barnes, D A', 'Oshman, D', 'Hawkins, H K', 'Gresik, M V', 'Dreyer, Z E']","['Murray JC', 'Gmoser DJ', 'Barnes DA', 'Oshman D', 'Hawkins HK', 'Gresik MV', 'Dreyer ZE']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Metatarsal Bones/*pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950230217 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1994;23(2):153-7. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950230217.,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-three patients had received transfusions of packed red blood cells or fresh whole blood (1-11 units; median: 2 units) but none had evidence of either hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which was measured every 3 months during maintenance therapy, had values more than three times the upper limit of the normal range in 25% of the measurements in more than half of the patients. However, by 3 months after the completion of maintenance therapy, ALT had normalized in all patients and remained normal in all but two patients until the time of this study.

DESIGN: A review of treatments in adult ALL from the English literature. RESULTS: Features signaling high risk for systemic relapse (older age, high WBC count at diagnosis, non-T-cell immunophenotype, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive karyotype, and longer time to achieve remission) are found in 60% to 70% of patients with adult ALL. These patients have a potential cure rate of 20% to 25%, compared with 60% to 70% for low-risk patients. Induction regimens with vincristine, anthracyclines, and corticosteroids appear to be optimal. Intensification-consolidation therapy increased cure rates modestly in adult ALL; higher-dose schedules of mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate, and asparaginase may be beneficial. Maintenance therapy with 6-MP and methotrexate is suggested based on the worse outcome of patients in whom such maintenance was omitted. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is indicated for patients in first remission with high-risk for relapse; autologous BMT for patients in first remission remains investigational. Patients with mature B-cell ALL require short-term, dose-intensive therapy that alternates hyperfractionated doses of cyclophosphamide with high-dose cytarabine (ara-C) and methotrexate. Patients with T-cell ALL may benefit from ara-C/cyclophosphamide combinations during maintenance therapy. CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal chemotherapy should be administered in patients at risk for CNS relapse. CONCLUSION: Potential strategies to improve the prognosis of high-risk patients with ALL include increasing the dose-intensity of remission induction and consolidation-intensification therapies with growth factor support; discovering and using new anti-ALL drugs; improving autologous BMT results; translating biologic studies of leukemia cell characteristics, karyotype-related molecular aberrations, abnormal oncogenic expression, and minimal residual disease into clinically relevant therapies; and using investigational treatment strategies in high-risk patients.","['Preti, A', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Preti A', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Hematology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.6.1312 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Jun;12(6):1312-22. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.6.1312.,,,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data base used for this study was a French BMT registry for childhood AML. Twenty-three children were conditioned with busulfan and 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (Bu-Cy 120 group). Nineteen received busulfan and 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (Bu-Cy200 group). During the same time period, 32 patients were prepared with total-body irradiation (TBI group) most often in combination with 120 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: The probability of relapse was 54%, 13%, and 10% for the Bu-Cy120, Bu-Cy200, and TBI groups, respectively (P < .05 in the univariate analysis, log-rank test, 2 df). In the multivariate analysis, a conditioning regimen with Bu-Cy120 was significantly associated with a higher risk of relapse (P = .02; relative risk, 3.62). The probability of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 0% for Bu-Cy120, 5% for Bu-Cy200, and 10% for TBI. Kaplan-Meier estimations of event-free survival (EFS) were 46% +/- 24%, 82% +/- 18%, and 80% +/- 14%, respectively, for the three groups, with median follow-up durations of 28 months (range, 3 to 78), 31 months (4 to 68), and 48 months (2 to 73). In the multivariate analysis, two factors adversely affected EFS: a conditioning regimen with Bu-Cy120 (P = .07) and a long interval from diagnosis to BMT (> or = 120 days, P = .08).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 25, 1989 and February 1, 1991, 291 patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and performance status 0 or 1 were randomized to receive cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) every 28 days, vinblastine 5 mg/m2 IV per week times five, then every 2 weeks; and either hydrazine sulfate 60 mg three times per day orally or placebo. The concurrent use of corticosteroids, medroxyprogesterone, or other appetite stimulants was not permitted. Treatment groups were comparable for known prognostic variables. The primary end point of this study was survival; however, the influence of hydrazine sulfate on nutritional status, performance status, and quality of life was also assessed. RESULTS: Analysis of 266 eligible patients showed a median survival duration of 7.78 months for the hydrazine sulfate-treated group compared with 7.70 months for the placebo-treated group (P = .65, log-rank). Objective response rates were similar for the two groups, with 4% complete responses, 20% partial responses, and 2% regressions in those treated with hydrazine sulfate; 3% complete responses, 23% partial responses, and 2% regressions in those who received placebo. The major toxicity was severe or life-threatening neutropenia, which occurred in 65% of hydrazine sulfate patients and 63% of placebo patients. There were no differences noted between the two groups in degree of anorexia, weight gain or loss, or overall nutritional status. Sensory and motor neuropathy occurred significantly more often in patients treated with hydrazine sulfate. Quality of life was significantly worse in patients who received hydrazine sulfate. CONCLUSION: This study suggests no benefit from the addition of hydrazine sulfate to an effective cytotoxic regimen.","['Kosty, M P', 'Fleishman, S B', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Coughlin, K', 'Kornblith, A B', 'Scalzo, A', 'Morris, J C', 'Mortimer, J', 'Green, M R']","['Kosty MP', 'Fleishman SB', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Coughlin K', 'Kornblith AB', 'Scalzo A', 'Morris JC', 'Mortimer J', 'Green MR']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Ida M. and Cecil H.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Hematology service of a 1,500-bed Spanish university hospital. RESULTS: Of a total of 178 episodes of significant bacteremia or fungemia in 101 patients, 53% affected patients with acute leukemia. Gram-positive microorganisms were found to be the cause in 70% of the monomicrobial episodes. The most frequently isolated microorganism was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (35%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (11%). Most blood-stream infections occurred during an episode of neutropenia (59%). A total of 34 patients died during hospitalization; in 14, infection was the cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: A marked increase in the incidence of bacteremias caused by gram-positive microorganisms has been observed in our hospital over the last 10 years, especially in patients with hematological malignancies.

Implantation of C6 glioma cells engineered to secrete CNTF either subcutaneously or into the peritoneal cavity of adult mice, or systemic injections of purified rat or human recombinant CNTF, resulted in a rapid syndrome of weight loss resulting in death over a period of 7-10 d. This weight loss could not be explained by a reduction in food intake and involved losses of both fat and skeletal muscle. CNTF also induced the synthesis of acute phase proteins such as haptoglobin. Implantation of C6 lines expressing a nonsecreted form of CNTF, or the parental C6 line itself, did not result in wasting effects. Analysis of this CNTF-induced wasting indicates similarities with the previously described cachectins, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 6, and leukemia inhibitory factor, but does not involve the induction of these cytokines.","['Henderson, J T', 'Seniuk, N A', 'Richardson, P M', 'Gauldie, J', 'Roder, J C']","['Henderson JT', 'Seniuk NA', 'Richardson PM', 'Gauldie J', 'Roder JC']","['Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Division of Neurobiology and Molecular Immunology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'Cachexia/*chemically induced', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI117276 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1994 Jun;93(6):2632-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI117276.,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,PMC294503,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether this sexual dichotomy exists at higher irradiation doses (25-47 gray), the onset of puberty was identified in 46 GH-deficient children (30 males) previously irradiated for a brain tumor not involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and compared with the normal pubertal standards of Marshall and Tanner. Age at irradiation was at least 2 SD below the mean age of pubertal onset in normal children. There was a significant linear association between age at irradiation and age at onset of puberty. The onset of puberty occurred at an early age in both sexes (mean, 8.51 yr in girls and 9.21 yr in boys plus 0.29 yr for every year of age at irradiation). For example, the estimated age at onset of puberty in a boy irradiated at 2 yr of age would be 9.79 yr, and that for a boy irradiated at 9 yr of age would be 11.82 yr. In the context of GH deficiency, which is usually associated with a delay in the onset of puberty, this is abnormal. At each age of irradiation, the estimated age at the onset of puberty was approximately 0.7 yr earlier in girls than boys. A similar trend was seen for bone age, which was abnormally early at the time of pubertal onset (mean, 7.39 yr in girls and 8.66 yr in boys plus 0.25 yr for every year of age at the time of irradiation). At the doses of irradiation employed in the treatment of brain tumors, radiation-induced early puberty is not restricted to girls. The clinical consequence of early puberty in the management of poor growth associated with radiation-induced GH deficiency is to foreshorten the time available for treatment with GH.","['Ogilvy-Stuart, A L', 'Clayton, P E', 'Shalet, S M']","['Ogilvy-Stuart AL', 'Clayton PE', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Astrocytoma/radiotherapy', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Ependymoma/radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Glioma/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/radiotherapy', 'Probability', 'Puberty, Precocious/*etiology', 'Radiation Injuries/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Factors']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.78.6.8200926 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1994 Jun;78(6):1282-6. doi: 10.1210/jcem.78.6.8200926.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1994 Jun;78(6):1280-1.

To investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of CDF/LIF binding sites in the developing rat nervous system, we localized binding of iodinated native rat CDF/LIF by radioautography. We find that specific CDF/LIF binding sites are present in distinct regions of the nervous system at defined developmental stages. CDF/LIF binding is detectable in all sensory ganglia examined, both neural crest- and placode-derived, and in all sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia examined. In the central nervous system, in contrast, binding is restricted to specific regions in the motor, sensory, and limbic systems. These in vivo results not only support culture studies which suggest CDF/LIF involvement in development of specific populations of neurons, but also suggest new roles played by CDF/LIF.","['Qiu, L', 'Bernd, P', 'Fukada, K']","['Qiu L', 'Bernd P', 'Fukada K']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Health Science Center at Brooklyn, State University of New York 11203.']",['eng'],['NS26175/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Binding Sites', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Nervous System/*embryology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tissue Distribution']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/dbio.1994.1167 [doi]', 'S0012-1606(84)71167-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1994 Jun;163(2):516-20. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1994.1167.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human peripheral gamma delta T cells, coexpressing the V gamma 9/V delta 2 chains of the T cell receptor, lyse Daudi cells but not Raji cells. Here, we have screened four other Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (HH514, DG75, Ramos, and Wilson), as well as cells derived from a fresh Burkitt's lymphoma, to see if any of them can be recognized by human gamma delta T cells. Leukemia-derived lines MOLT-4, CEM, and K562 have also been included in these studies. Among the Burkitt's lymphomas tested, only Daudi, DG75, and HH514 could be lysed by V gamma 9/V delta 2+ T cell clones derived from the peripheral blood of healthy donors. These T cell clones were also able to lyse the NK sensitive leukemia lines K562 and MOLT-4. When bulk cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were cultured with different Burkitt's lymphoma or leukemia cell lines, only Daudi stimulated the outgrowth of gamma delta T cells. Similarly, only Daudi cells could stimulate proliferation of gamma delta T cell clones, and the response was enhanced significantly in the presence of interleukin-2. These data and our prior observations showing the use of the V gamma 9/V delta 2 TCR type by Daudi-reactive human gamma delta T cells indicate that Daudi cells are not representative of other Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines.","['Kaur, I', 'de Jong, J', 'Schell, K', 'Hank, J', 'Fisch, P', 'Sondel, P M']","['Kaur I', 'de Jong J', 'Schell K', 'Hank J', 'Fisch P', 'Sondel PM']","['Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53792.']",['eng'],"['CA-05436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(84)71152-X [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1994.1152 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1994 Jun;156(1):54-61. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1994.1152.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that both unsensitized and IgE-sensitized RBL cells are activated upon exposure to epsilon BP-coated surfaces. Activation of RBL cells by the lectin epsilon BP can be significantly inhibited by appropriate saccharides. Exposure of RBL cells to epsilon BP-coated surfaces caused cell spreading similar to that caused from adherence to fibronectin-coated surfaces. However, epsilon BP by itself caused mediator release whereas fibronectin only potentiated antigen-mediated activation of RBL cells. Under appropriate conditions, epsilon BP, therefore, has the potential to activate mast cells culminating in augmentation of an inflammatory response.","['Zuberi, R I', 'Frigeri, L G', 'Liu, F T']","['Zuberi RI', 'Frigeri LG', 'Liu FT']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['AI-19747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-20958/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-32834/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antigens, Differentiation/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Galectin 3', 'Immunoglobulin E/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008874984711488 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1994.1148 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1994 Jun;156(1):1-12. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1994.1148.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Lectins)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous immunohistochemical studies suggested a T-cell nature of proliferating cells; the term nasal T-cell lymphoma (NTL-LMG) has since been used widely. The authors' previous study in Asian countries showed the clustering of Mongolian patients with NTL-LMG, but the frequency varied with geographic area; it was much higher in Korea and southwest Japan (Okinawa) than in Shanghai and Honshu, Japan. Recently an etiologic role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) for the development of NTL-LMG has been postulated. METHODS: In this study, the presence of EBV and human T-cell lymphocytic leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) genomes were examined in NTL-LMG patients from Southwest Japan (Okinawa, 10 patients), another Japanese district (Honshu, 21 patients), and Shanghai, China (5 patients). All of the tissues from different geographic sites were analyzed at one central location. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed that proliferating large cells were positive for CD43 and/or CD45RO, identical with reported NTL-LMG cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed the presence of EBV genome in the NTL-LMG lesions, but the frequency varied according to the geographic area: 67% in Okinawa, 33% in Honshu, and 100% in Shanghai. In situ hybridization provided positive signals in the nuclei of proliferating cells. Expression of latent membrane protein in the proliferating cells of cases positive for EBV by PCR and in situ hybridization was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the EBV may play a role in the development of NTL-LMG. However, the variation of frequency of EBV genome in different geographic locations suggests that EBV infection may not be an indispensable condition for the disease.","['Mishima, K', 'Horiuchi, K', 'Kojya, S', 'Takahashi, H', 'Ohsawa, M', 'Aozasa, K']","['Mishima K', 'Horiuchi K', 'Kojya S', 'Takahashi H', 'Ohsawa M', 'Aozasa K']","['Department of Pathology, Nara Medical College, Kashihara, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antigens, CD', 'Base Sequence', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Granuloma, Lethal Midline/*microbiology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/complications/epidemiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Leukosialin', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nose Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1', 'Sialoglycoproteins/analysis']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940615)73:12<3041::aid-cncr2820731224>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Jun 15;73(12):3041-6. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940615)73:12<3041::aid-cncr2820731224>3.0.co;2-k.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After CR was achieved, patients received three courses of idarubicin (12 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) followed by three courses of mitoxantrone (5 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) and etoposide (250 mg/m2 daily for 3 days). Maintenance was with 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate. RESULTS: A CR was achieved in 14 patients (82%), the disease was refractory in 2 patients, and one patient died during induction. Three patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplant during CR. After a median follow-up of 26 weeks, six patients remain in CR. Median CR duration is 40 weeks (range 8-56+). Patients treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy in first salvage, when compared to a historic control group treated with chemotherapy alone, had a significantly better CR rate (87% vs. 57%; P = 0.04) and a lower induction death rate (7% vs. 29%; P = 0.08), resulting in longer median survival (26 vs. 17 weeks; P = 0.13). Four patients developed the ""retinoic acid syndrome"", which was fatal in one case. Three patients developed thrombotic events. CONCLUSIONS: ATRA followed by chemotherapy is effective treatment for patients with APL who relapse after conventional therapy, and it may be superior to chemotherapy alone.","['Cortes, J E', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Robertson, L E', 'Koller, C', 'Hirsh-Ginsberg, C', 'Stass, S', 'Keating, M', 'Estey, E']","['Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Robertson LE', 'Koller C', 'Hirsh-Ginsberg C', 'Stass S', 'Keating M', 'Estey E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940615)73:12<2946::aid-cncr2820731211>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Jun 15;73(12):2946-52. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940615)73:12<2946::aid-cncr2820731211>3.0.co;2-q.,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These DGGE experimental conditions were applied to the analysis of the p53 gene in acute leukemias. Forty adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 21 with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) were investigated. Eleven of the AML patients were investigated at the time of the initial diagnosis and at relapse. In contrast with most reports based on amplified fragments analyzed by single-strand conformation electrophoresis and focusing on exons 5 to 8, we analyzed the whole coding sequence of the gene. Two of the 40 AML patients displayed a point mutation in exon 7; it was either an A to G substitution that converted Tyr-234 to Cys, or a G to A change that converted Arg-248 to Gln. The screening procedure led to the discovery of several intronic and exonic polymorphisms. These results confirm the low incidence of p53 mutations in acute leukemias and suggest a limited role of the p53 protein in leukemogenesis. The computerized modeling and electrophoresis parameters presented here provide a powerful tool for the exhaustive characterization of p53 mutants in all kinds of malignancies.","['Pignon, J M', 'Vinatier, I', 'Fanen, P', 'Jonveaux, P', 'Tournilhac, O', 'Imbert, M', 'Rochant, H', 'Goossens, M']","['Pignon JM', 'Vinatier I', 'Fanen P', 'Jonveaux P', 'Tournilhac O', 'Imbert M', 'Rochant H', 'Goossens M']","['INSERM U 91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Exons', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Software']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/humu.1380030207 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 1994;3(2):126-32. doi: 10.1002/humu.1380030207.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to investigate the antileukemic activity of PME. Leukemic specimens from untreated patients that contained greater than or equal to 75% blasts were used.

At both 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C, the recovery of normal peripheral blood cells was approximately 28% following incubation with 50 mM PME. At 37 degrees C, 50 mM PME caused greater than one log reduction of leukemic cells in 13/16 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 7/9 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and 8/8 in blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-BC) specimens.

Thirteen marrows from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were studied as fresh and eight as cryopreserved samples. Marrows from five normal donors were studied as both fresh and cryopreserved samples. Although the number of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) recovered after cryopreservation was always lower than that originally stored, no significant difference was observed between the clonogenic potential of fresh and cryopreserved BMMC from either the leukemic or the normal samples. When grown in long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC), the cultures initiated with cryopreserved BMMC failed to form a confluent stroma, and the duration of nonadherent and progenitor cell production was significantly lower than that from fresh samples. However, when these cryopreserved samples were recharged onto preformed irradiated stroma, the duration of the cultures improved significantly. We conclude that it is the bone marrow stromal cells rather than the clonogenic progenitors which are sensitive to the effects of cryopreservation. Thus cryopreservation does not appear to influence the activity of AML progenitor cells. Our results also indicate that frozen marrow can be used for LTBMC experiments if cultured on a preformed stromal layer.","['Zaheer, H A', 'Gibson, F M', 'Bagnara, M', 'Gordon-Smith, E C', 'Rutherford, T R']","['Zaheer HA', 'Gibson FM', 'Bagnara M', 'Gordon-Smith EC', 'Rutherford TR']","[""Department of Cellular and Molecular Sciences, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, England, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', '*Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530120206 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1994 Mar;12(2):180-6. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530120206.,,,['Stem Cells. 1994 Mar;12(2):225-6.

FA patients are characterized by pancytopenia, congenital malformations, growth delay and an increased susceptibility to the development of malignancies, particularly acute myelogenous leukemia. FA cells show chromosomal fragility, slow growth and increased sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. FA can be caused by defects in any one of at least four genes. Two general hypotheses have been proposed to explain the underlying defect: loss of a DNA repair function or of a step in the defense toward oxygen toxicity. After many attempts to clone the FA genes, the first one, that defective in group C, has been cloned by complementation of the increased sensitivity of FA(C) cells to mitomycin C and diepoxybutane.

THP-1 cells treated with M-CSF decreased Latex Bead phagocytosis, but the cells incubated with 12-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) enhanced phagocytosis 2.5-fold. Binding activity of 125I-M-CSF to THP-1 cells was higher than that in THP-1 cells elicited with TPA. THP-1 cells incubated with M-CSF before TPA treatment were designated MT macrophages, and those incubated with M-CSF after TPA treatment were called TM macrophages. When these cells were incubated with beta-VLDL, the cholesterol ester content in MT macrophages was less than in TM macrophages. The uptake of [3H]cholesterol oleate-beta-VLDL in MT macrophages was the same as in TM macrophages. The released radioactivity from [3H]cholesterol oleate-beta-VLDL loaded MT macrophages was higher than that from TM macrophages. Acid cholesterol esterase activity and ACAT activity were the same in both types of macrophages. Neutral cholesterol esterase activity was higher in MT than in TM macrophages. These results suggested that beta-VLDL-induced cholesterol ester deposition in THP-1 cells-derived macrophages was suppressed by M-CSF, when M-CSF acted at the stage of monocytes (THP-1 cells), and that the reduction of cholesterol ester might be due to enhanced release of cholesterol from the cells with high neutral cholesterol esterase activity.","['Ishii, I', 'Yanagimachi, M', 'Shirai, K', 'Saito, Y', 'Hirose, S']","['Ishii I', 'Yanagimachi M', 'Shirai K', 'Saito Y', 'Hirose S']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, Chiba University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cholesterol, VLDL/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Latex', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Sterol Esterase/metabolism', 'Sterol O-Acyltransferase/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tritium']",1994/06/02 00:00,1994/06/02 00:01,['1994/06/02 00:00'],"['1994/06/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/02 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(94)90201-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(94)90201-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1994 Jun 2;1212(3):278-84. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(94)90201-1.,"['0 (Cholesterol, VLDL)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Latex)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.3.1.26 (Sterol O-Acyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.1.13 (Sterol Esterase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, PDGF-B chain transcript was detected in all of the five patients with myeloid blasts and with fibrosis, in one of the three patients with myeloid blasts and without fibrosis, and in none of the three lymphoid crisis patients without fibrosis. In the patients with myeloid blasts and with fibrosis, PDGF protein, PDGF-AB and/or PDGF-BB, was found to be secreted from blast cells. In addition, the PDGF activity in the culture of myeloid blasts from two patients with fibrosis was also growth stimulatory for human marrow fibroblasts.

One of these bioactive substances is endothelin (ET)-1, a peptide with potent vasoconstrictive activity produced by vascular endothelial cells. We have previously reported the production of ET-1 by several types of human cancer, especially pancreatic cancer cells. To elucidate whether these cancer cells might share biological characteristics with vascular endothelial cells, we investigated the production of three ET isoforms in pancreatic cancer cells, using a specific radioimmunoassay. Further, we also investigated whether these cells produce thrombomodulin (TM), another product of endothelial cells functioning as a modulator of procoagulant activity. ET-1 was detected in 11 of 12 pancreatic cancer cell lines (92%) while ET-2 and ET-3 were detectable in only one cell line. Gel filtration analysis confirmed the presence of ET-1. Moreover, TM was detected in the cell lysates of 11 of the 12 cell lines (92%) and it was released into the culture medium in the majority (58%) of these cell lines. TM mRNA was also detected in these cells. In addition, TM was demonstrated immunocytochemically along the cell surface.

Three of the 13 TSP/HAM sera and 1 of the 17 asymptomatic sera contained HTLV-I-specific IgM antibodies, whereas 6 and 5 sera, respectively, contained IgA antibodies. By correlating the ability of patient sera to inhibit HTLV-I-induced syncytia with their antibody reactivity in ELISA to 42 synthetic peptides, together corresponding to the entire envelope glycoprotein of HTLV-I, a number of putative neutralizing domains were identified. Eight synthetic peptides representing the regions with the highest coefficient of correlation between neutralizing titer and ELISA reactivity were employed to specifically adsorb potentially neutralizing antibodies, and were also used directly, without sera, in the syncytium-neutralizing test. By those techniques, three novel and two previously described domains that seemed to contain neutralizing epitopes were identified.

Apoptosis was correlated to an arrest of cell growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and to an induction of differentiation through the monocytic pathway in HL-60 and U-937 cells. Time course studies demonstrated DNA fragmentation after few hours incubation with the drug, while morphological signs appeared later (days 2 or 3). Northern blot analysis and flow cytometric studies have shown that cell death induced by MAG=3but was not associated to an overexpression of c-myc and p53.

In mammalian cells, HSPs belonging to the 70 kDa family (HSP70) have a regulatory role in several cellular processes, and have been shown to be involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Although many types of HSP70 inducers have been identified, only a few compounds, all belonging to the flavonoid group, have been shown to inhibit HSP70 induction. Because inhibitors of HSP70 synthesis could be an important tool with which to study the function of this protein, we have investigated the effect of quercetin, a flavonoid with antiproliferative activity which is widely distributed in nature, on HSP70 synthesis in human K562 erythroleukaemia cells after treatment with severe or mild heat shock and with other inducers. Quercetin was found to affect HSP70 synthesis at more than one level, depending on the conditions used. Indeed, after severe heat shock (45 degrees C for 20 min) treatment with quercetin, at non-toxic concentrations, was found to inhibit HSP70 synthesis for a period of 3-4 h. This block appeared to be exerted at the post-transcriptional level and to be cell-mediated, as the addition of quercetin during translation of HSP70 mRNA in vitro had no effect. After prolonged (90 min) exposure at 43 degrees C, however, quercetin was found to inhibit also HSP70 mRNA transcription. Pretreatment of K562 cells with quercetin had no effect on HSP70 expression, and quercetin needed to be present during induction to be effective. Under all conditions tested, the quercetin-induced block of HSP70 synthesis was found to be transient and, after an initial delay, synthesis of HSP70 reached the control rate and continued at the same level for several hours after the time at which HSP70 synthesis had been turned off in control cells. Finally, inhibition of HSP70 synthesis by quercetin appeared to be dependent on the temperature used and on the type of stressor.","['Elia, G', 'Santoro, M G']","['Elia G', 'Santoro MG']","['Institute of Experimental Medicine, CNR, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3000201 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 May 15;300 ( Pt 1):201-9. doi: 10.1042/bj3000201.,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",,,,PMC1138143,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENT: A 63-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia in hematologic remission experienced a succession of acute clinical neuropathies (left median, right radial, and left sciatica) several months before hematologic relapse of leukemia. Electrophysiologic tests localized the abnormalities of the left median and right radial nerves to the arms, and a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the right arm revealed focal swelling of the radial nerve proximal to the elbow. The patient refused treatment for leukemic relapse and died about 6 months after the onset of the neuropathies. An autopsy revealed leukemic infiltrates in multiple nerves without appreciable involvement of the cauda equina or many of the proximal nerves.

Clinically one finds the onset of breast cancer at an early age, an excess of bilaterality, and patterns of multiple primary cancer such as combinations of breast and ovarian carcinoma in the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. In addition to HBOC, one sees a variety of putative breast cancer-prone genotypes inclusive of hereditary site-specific breast cancer, and the Li-Fraumeni (SBLA) syndrome that is characterized by cancers involving all three germinal layers including sarcomas, brain tumors, leukemia, lymphoma, and adrenal cortical carcinoma in addition to often markedly early-onset breast cancer. Breast cancer is also associated with autosomal dominantly inherited Cowden's disease and autosomal recessively inherited ataxia-telangiectasia. Examples of pedigrees depicting clinical examples of these several HBC syndromes are presented in order to describe HBC's heterogeneity.

Furthermore, PTP1C is phosphorylated on serine residues upon PMA treatment. While the enzyme localizes entirely in the cytosolic fraction in untreated cells, 30-40% is found in a particulate fraction following differentiation. Immunofluorescent staining of differentiated cells before and after digitonin treatment indicates that the bound enzyme localizes on the plasma membrane.

Besides a characteristic set of facial and physical features, DS is associated with congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract, an increased risk of leukemia, immune system defects, and an Alzheimer-like dementia. Moreover, DS is a model for the study of human aneuploidy. Although usually caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21, subsets of the phenotypic features of DS may be caused by the duplication of small regions of the chromosome. The physical map of chromosome 21 allows the molecular definition of the regions duplicated in these rare cases of partial trisomy. As a first step in identifying the genes responsible for individual DS features and their pathophysiology, a panel of cell lines derived from 16 such individuals has been established and the molecular break points have been determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blot dosage analysis of 32 markers unique to human chromosome 21. Combining this information with detailed clinical evaluations of these patients, we have now constructed a ""phenotypic map"" that includes 25 features and assigns regions of 2-20 megabases as likely to contain the genes responsible. This study provides evidence for a significant contribution of genes outside the D21S55 region to the DS phenotypes, including the facies, microcephaly, short stature, hypotonia, abnormal dermatoglyphics, and mental retardation. This strongly suggests DS is a contiguous gene syndrome and augurs against a single DS chromosomal region responsible for most of the DS phenotypic features.","['Korenberg, J R', 'Chen, X N', 'Schipper, R', 'Sun, Z', 'Gonsky, R', 'Gerwehr, S', 'Carpenter, N', 'Daumer, C', 'Dignan, P', 'Disteche, C']","['Korenberg JR', 'Chen XN', 'Schipper R', 'Sun Z', 'Gonsky R', 'Gerwehr S', 'Carpenter N', 'Daumer C', 'Dignan P', 'Disteche C', 'et al.']","['Ahmanson Department of Pediatrics, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],"['5 R29 HG00037/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD17749-11/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-50025-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Phenotype']",1994/05/24 00:00,1994/05/24 00:01,['1994/05/24 00:00'],"['1994/05/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/24 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.11.4997 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 May 24;91(11):4997-5001. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.11.4997.,,,,,PMC43917,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported that the IL-2-independent adult T-cell leukemia line HuT-102 secretes a cytokine, provisionally designated IL-T, that stimulates T-cell proliferation and lymphokine-activated killer cell activity. Stimulation of proliferation of the cytokine-dependent human T-cell line Kit-225 mediated by HuT-102-conditioned medium or by 3200-fold-purified IL-T was not blocked by the addition of antibodies against IL-2 or IL-2R alpha subunit. However, IL-T-mediated stimulation of this human T-cell line was inhibited by addition of Mik-beta 1, an antibody that binds specifically to IL-2R beta subunit. In addition, the activation of large granular lymphocytes to lymphokine-activated killer cells mediated by IL-T-containing conditioned medium was not blocked by antibodies directed toward IL-2 or IL-2 alpha but was inhibited by an antibody to IL-2R beta, suggesting the requirement of this receptor subunit for IL-T action. This conclusion was confirmed using an IL-3-dependent murine myeloid precursor cell line, 32D, that expresses IL-2R alpha and IL-2R gamma, but not IL-2R beta. Neither IL-2 nor IL-T stimulated 32D cell proliferation. However, after transfection with the gene encoding human IL-2R beta, 32D beta cells proliferated on addition of either cytokine. The IL-T-mediated stimulation of 32D beta proliferation was inhibited by an anti-IL-2R beta antibody but not by an anti-IL-2 antibody. Thus, the IL-T-mediated stimulation of T-cell and lymphokine-activated killer cell activation requires the expression of the IL-2R beta subunit.","['Bamford, R N', 'Grant, A J', 'Burton, J D', 'Peters, C', 'Kurys, G', 'Goldman, C K', 'Brennan, J', 'Roessler, E', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Bamford RN', 'Grant AJ', 'Burton JD', 'Peters C', 'Kurys G', 'Goldman CK', 'Brennan J', 'Roessler E', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/chemistry/*immunology', 'Interleukin-3/immunology', 'Interleukins/chemistry/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/chemistry/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/24 00:00,1994/05/24 00:01,['1994/05/24 00:00'],"['1994/05/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/24 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.11.4940 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 May 24;91(11):4940-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.11.4940.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,PMC43905,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, during late-phase ATL, leukemic cells no longer produce IL-2 yet continue to express high-affinity IL-2 receptors. During studies to define pathogenic mechanisms that underlie this IL-2-independent proliferation, we demonstrated that the ATL cell line HuT-102 secretes a lymphokine, provisionally designated IL-T, that stimulates T-cell proliferation and the induction of lymphokine-activated killer cells. Conditioned medium from HuT-102, when added to the IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 line, yielded a stimulation index of 230. Since CTLL-2 was purported to be IL-2-specific, we performed a number of studies to exclude IL-2 production by HuT-102. Stimulation of CTLL-2 cells by HuT-102-conditioned medium was not meaningfully inhibited by addition of an antiserum to IL-2. Furthermore, uninduced HuT-102 cells did not express mRNA encoding IL-2 as assessed by Northern blot analysis. No biological activity on CTLL-2 cells was mediated by purified IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, thus differentiating these factors from IL-T. Based on preliminary biochemical data, IL-T is a protein with a pI value of 4.5 and a molecular mass in SDS gels of 14 kDa. In addition to its action on CTLL-2 cells, 3200-fold-purified IL-T stimulated proliferation of the human cytokine-dependent T-cell line Kit-225. Furthermore, addition of IL-T enhanced cytotoxic activity of large granular lymphocytes (i.e., induced lymphokine-activated killer cells). Thus, IL-T is a lymphokine that plays a role in T-cell proliferation and induction of lymphokine-activated killer cells. Furthermore, IL-T may contribute to IL-2-independent proliferation of select ATL cells and lines.","['Burton, J D', 'Bamford, R N', 'Peters, C', 'Grant, A J', 'Kurys, G', 'Goldman, C K', 'Brennan, J', 'Roessler, E', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Burton JD', 'Bamford RN', 'Peters C', 'Grant AJ', 'Kurys G', 'Goldman CK', 'Brennan J', 'Roessler E', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Culture Media', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/24 00:00,1994/05/24 00:01,['1994/05/24 00:00'],"['1994/05/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/24 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.11.4935 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 May 24;91(11):4935-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.11.4935.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,PMC43904,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that the apoptotic process in FVA cell populations deprived of Epo is asynchronous as a result of a heterogeneity in Epo dependence among individual cells. Here we investigated whether apoptosis in FVA cells correlated with cell cycle phase or stabilization of p53 tumor suppressor protein. DNA analysis in nonapoptotic FVA cell subpopulations cultured without Epo demonstrated little change in the percentages of cells in G1,S, and G2/M phases over time. Analysis of the apoptotic subpopulation revealed high percentages of cells in G1 and S, with few cells in G2/M at any time. When cells were sorted from G1 and S phases prior to culture without Epo, apoptotic cells appeared at the same rate in both populations, indicating that no prior commitment step had occurred in either G1 or S phase. Steady-state wild-type p53 protein levels were very low in FVA cells compared with control cell lines and did not accumulate in Epo-deprived cultures; however, p53 protein did accumulate when FVA cells were treated with the DNA-damaging agent actinomycin D. These data indicate that erythroblast apoptosis caused by Epo deprivation (i) occurs throughout G1 and S phases and does not require cell cycle arrest, (ii) does not have a commitment event related to cell cycle phase, and (iii) is not associated with conformational changes or stabilization of wild-type p53 protein.","['Kelley, L L', 'Green, W F', 'Hicks, G G', 'Bondurant, M C', 'Koury, M J', 'Ruley, H E']","['Kelley LL', 'Green WF', 'Hicks GG', 'Bondurant MC', 'Koury MJ', 'Ruley HE']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.']",['eng'],['NIDDK-31513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Damage', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/physiology', '*Genes, p53', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Protein Conformation', 'S Phase/drug effects/physiology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/*biosynthesis/chemistry']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.6.4183-4192.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Jun;14(6):4183-92. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.6.4183-4192.1994.,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,PMC358784,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,

BCL3 protein acts as an I kappa B in that it can specifically inhibit the DNA binding of NF-kappa B factors. Here, we demonstrate that BCL3 is predominantly a nuclear protein and provide evidence that its N terminus is necessary to direct the protein into the nucleus. In contrast to I kappa B alpha (MAD3), BCL3 does not cause NF-kappa B p50 to be retained in the cytoplasm; instead, in cotransfection assays, it alters the subnuclear localization of p50. The two proteins colocalize, suggesting that they interact in vivo. Further immunofluorescence experiments showed that a mutant p50, lacking a nuclear localization signal and restricted to the cytoplasm, is brought into the nucleus in the presence of BCL3. Correspondingly, a wild-type p50 directs into the nucleus a truncated BCL3, which, when transfected alone, is found in the cytoplasm. We tested whether BCL3 could overcome the cytoplasmic retention of p50 by I kappa B alpha. Results from triple cotransfection experiments with BCL3, I kappa B alpha, and p50 implied that BCL3 can successfully compete with I kappa B alpha and bring p50 into the nucleus; thus, localization of NF-kappa B factors may be affected by differential expression of I kappa B proteins. These novel properties of BCL3 protein further establish BCL3 as a distinctive member of the I kappa B family.","['Zhang, Q', 'Didonato, J A', 'Karin, M', 'McKeithan, T W']","['Zhang Q', 'Didonato JA', 'Karin M', 'McKeithan TW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.']",['eng'],"['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55356/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.6.3915-3926.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Jun;14(6):3915-26. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.6.3915-3926.1994.,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,PMC358758,,['BCL3'],,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a multicenter study by the Infections in Hematology Study Group of the Paul Ehrlich Society].,114-23,"BACKGROUND: Severe infections are the predominant cause of treatment failure in patients with high grade malignant hematological disorders undergoing intensive chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter trial of the Paul Ehrlich Society (PEG) study group, febrile neutropenic patients with acute leukemias or other high grade hematological malignancies were randomized for a three phase sequential antimicrobial intervention comparing different widely applied regimes for empirical therapy. Patients with clinically documented infections were treated according to a modification depending on the respective source of infection, whereas in patients with microbiologically documented infections, treatment could be adapted to the sesceptibility patterns of detected pathogens. Criteria for evaluation as well as time points for response assessment and treatment escalation were strictly prescribed by the study protocol. RESULTS: Of 1573 evaluable patients, 50.9% had fever of unknown origin (FUO) throughout the study period, 17.1% had lung infiltrates, 14.1% primary bacteremia or fungemia (B/F), 12.6% other clinically documented (CDI) and 5.3% other clinically as well as microbiologically documented infections (CMDI). Cumulative response rate (CR) in patients with FUO was 91.3%, a significant difference between various regimens could not be detected in either of the three treatment phases. Patients with lung infiltrates had a significantly worse treatment outcome as compared to patients with other documented infections or with FUO (61.3% vs 82.9% vs 91.3%). Gram-positive pathogens dominated in case of microbiologically documented infections (MDI), whereas the proportion of fungal infections increased dramatically in MDI with pathogens detected only after more than six days under study. Of numerous prognostic factors analyzed, only the trend in white blood cell counts had a significant impact on treatment outcome. CONCLUSION: Infection-related mortality in neutropenic patients with high grade hematological malignancies can be markedly reduced by a systematically escalating interventional antimicrobial therapy. Early systemic antifungal treatment, especially in patients with lung infiltrates, might further improve treatment results.","['Maschmeyer, G', 'Link, H', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Meyer, P', 'Helmerking, M', 'Eisenmann, E', 'Schmitt, J', 'Adam, D']","['Maschmeyer G', 'Link H', 'Hiddemann W', 'Meyer P', 'Helmerking M', 'Eisenmann E', 'Schmitt J', 'Adam D']","['Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Robert-Rossle-Klinik, Abt.

Since the cellular mechanisms of Al toxicity are not completely understood we used cultured Friend erythroleukemia cells (FEC) as a model system of Al-induced anemia. In this system Al accumulation leads to decreased cell growth and hemoglobin synthesis despite increased iron (Fe) uptake by transferrin (Tf) endocytosis. In FEC we evaluated the effect of Al on the cellular and subcellular accumulation of Fe, ferritin concentration, the uptake of Fe by ferritin, the exit of cellular Fe, and membrane lipid peroxidation. FEC were grown in media with or without the addition of Al-Tf and studies were done at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after plating. The highest concentration of intracellular Al was found in mitochondria with lesser amounts in the nucleus, and the least was in cytosol. The rate of Fe uptake was higher in Al-loaded FEC without a proportionally increased rate of exit. This resulted in higher concentrations of Fe in Al-loaded FEC. Subcellular fractionation following the uptake of 59Fe, 125I-Tf in Al-loaded FEC showed increased uptake of 59Fe in the nuclear and mitochondrial compartments with no increase in the cytosol. Al-loaded FEC showed decreased ferritin content and decreased uptake of 59Fe by ferritin. Increased membrane lipid peroxidation occurred in Al-loaded FEC at 96 hours as assessed by cellular malonyldialdehyde accumulation. These results indicate that Al disrupts Fe metabolism in FEC by increasing cellular Fe content with increased compartmentalization of Fe in the mitochondria and nuclei, decreased ferritin content, and decreased uptake of Fe by ferritin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Abreo, K', 'Glass, J', 'Jain, S', 'Sella, M']","['Abreo K', 'Glass J', 'Jain S', 'Sella M']","['Department of Medicine, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport.']",['eng'],['DK-37866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,IM,"['Aluminum/*toxicity', 'Ferritins/metabolism', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0085-2538(15)58394-4 [pii]', '10.1038/ki.1994.85 [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 1994 Mar;45(3):636-41. doi: 10.1038/ki.1994.85.,"['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent experimental findings provide some support for the hypothesis that exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields reduces the pineal gland's nocturnal production of the hormone melatonin, thereby increasing susceptibility to sex hormone-related cancers such as breast cancer. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to assess the evidence that cancer of the female breast might be associated with exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields. METHODS: Records of women who had breast cancer as the underlying cause of their death (ICD-9 174) and control subjects (four per case) were selected from computer files of U.S. mortality data for the years 1985-1989. Women 20 years and older at the time of their death were eligible for inclusion if they were residents of and died in one of the 24 states that provided death certification records with occupation and industry codes to the National Center for Health Statistics for at least 1 year during the study interval. Data from death certificates were used to classify the case and control subjects with regard to potential occupational exposure to electric and magnetic fields. Control subjects were a random sample of women who died of any other underlying cause, excluding leukemia and brain cancer. RESULTS: The data analysis contrasted 68 women with breast cancer and 199 controls, all with electrical occupations, with 27,814 women with breast cancer and 110,750 controls, all of whom had other occupations. Electrical workers had excess mortality from breast cancer relative to other employed women [odds ratio (OR) = 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.82]). Adjusted ORs for specific electrical occupations were 1.73 (95% CI = 0.92-3.25) for electrical engineers, 1.28 (95% CI = 0.79-2.07) for electrical technicians, and 2.17 (95% CI = 1.17-4.02) for telephone installers, repairers, and line workers. There was no excess of breast cancer, however, in seven other occupations held more frequently by women and also involving potentially elevated electrical exposures, including telephone operators, data keyers, and computer operators and programmers. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the limitations inherent in death certification data and the design of this study, any conclusions regarding the hypothesis that exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields causes breast cancer among women must be limited. Nevertheless, our findings are broadly consistent with that hypothesis and encourage further investigation with improvements in study design and data quality.","['Loomis, D P', 'Savitz, D A', 'Ananth, C V']","['Loomis DP', 'Savitz DA', 'Ananth CV']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina School of Public Health, Chapel Hill 27599-7400.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'United States']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/86.12.921 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Jun 15;86(12):921-5. doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.12.921.,,,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Feb 1;87(3):227-8.

Considering the higher stability of phosphorothioate over phosphodiester, the probe stability and tumor localization was compared with both derivatives. METHODS: The 15-mer oligonucleotide sequence was synthesized, aminolinked [sense and antisense phosphodiester (O) and monothioester (S)] and coupled with diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA)-isothiocyanate and aliquots were lyophilized to make a DTPAAHON kit. The radionuclide 111In was chelated to DTPAAHON derivatives, and free 111In was separated by gel filtration. The radiolabeled antisense and sense probes were injected intravenously in mammary tumor-bearing BALB/c mice (1 x 10(6) cells, 8 days postinoculation). RESULTS: The highest uptake was observed at 2 hr with both thio and oxo derivatives of RASON probes, and small tumors could be imaged noninvasively. Tumor uptake and tumor/blood and tumor/muscle ratios for the sense probe (control) were significantly lower (p < 0.001) than those of the antisense probe. CONCLUSION: The radiolabeled antisense probe may provide a new sensitive tool for noninvasive imaging of c-myc oncogene mRNA for a variety of malignant tumors at an earlier stage.","['Dewanjee, M K', 'Ghafouripour, A K', 'Kapadvanjwala, M', 'Dewanjee, S', 'Serafini, A N', 'Lopez, D M', 'Sfakianakis, G N']","['Dewanjee MK', 'Ghafouripour AK', 'Kapadvanjwala M', 'Dewanjee S', 'Serafini AN', 'Lopez DM', 'Sfakianakis GN']","['Department of Radiology, University of Miami, School of Medicine, Florida 33101.']",['eng'],"['NHLBI HL47201/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS22603-08/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,IM,"['Animals', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', '*Indium Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*diagnostic imaging/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Tissue Distribution']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1994 Jun;35(6):1054-63.,"['0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,['J Nucl Med. 1994 Jun;35(6):1064-6.

Ante mortem following BMT, the incidence and significance of ICH is not well defined. The records of 471 bone marrow transplantation recipients over 11 years at the Hadassah University Hospital Bone Marrow Transplantation Department were reviewed. The relevant data of all patients with ICH were analysed. A resolute diagnostic and treatment protocol for subdural haematomas had been employed. The indication for transplantation in 273 of the patients was leukaemia. Thirteen of these patients developed subdural haematomas within 42 days of the transplant, and nine of these haematomas were bilateral. None of the 198 patients with other malignancies or nonmalignant indications for BMT (predominantly aplastic anaemia and beta thalassaemia major) had subdural haematomas. One thalassaemia patient and three leukaemia patients had intracerebral haematomas. There was no mortality or major morbidity from the subdural haematomas, which were all successfully resolved. In contrast, all of the patients with intracerebral haematomas consequently died. Subdural haematomas occur in approximately 5% of patients with leukaemia following BMT, but the clinical outcome is relatively benign.

Low basal expression of the human Fc gamma R1b gene is specifically upregulated by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). A 181-bp region of 5' flanking sequence contains several key regulatory motifs that include the extended gamma response region (XGRR) and the PIE region. The XGRR contains the 39-bp gamma response region originally defined in the highly homologous Fc gamma R1a gene. The XGRR is in close proximity to the 21-bp PIE motif that is conserved in the promoters of some other myeloid genes. The PIE motif contains a consensus site for the macrophage and B cell transcription factor, PU.1, and is adjacent to the cluster of transcription start sites. An active transcription initiator, Inr, consensus spans the start sites and appears to direct transcription initiation of this TATA-less gene. In this study, we demonstrate that the PIE region contains a functional PU.1 site that binds a human PU.1-like protein and that associated factors present in myeloid extracts also bind in this PIE region. Mutational analysis reveals an absolute requirement for an intact PU.1 box for both basal and IFN-gamma inducible expression of this gene. In addition, mutations in the Inr greatly reduce basal and inducible transcription. Insertion of a strong TATA box downstream from the Inr or at -30 bp from the transcription start sites restores basal and inducible activity in the presence of a mutated PU.1 site. We also demonstrate that indeed, when the XGRR is positioned in the context of a heterologous TATA containing promoter, it is able to respond equivalently to either IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma. However, IFN-alpha responsiveness does not occur in the context of the physiological Fc gamma R1b TATA-less basal promoter. Our results suggest that a human PU.1-like factor acts as a ""bridging factor"" between the upstream IFN-gamma enhancer and the Inr dependent preinitiation complex. These findings indicate that the structure of the basal promoter in combination with restricted activators like PU.1 are important in regulating the expression of this gene.","['Eichbaum, Q G', 'Iyer, R', 'Raveh, D P', 'Mathieu, C', 'Ezekowitz, R A']","['Eichbaum QG', 'Iyer R', 'Raveh DP', 'Mathieu C', 'Ezekowitz RA']","[""Division of Infectious Diseases and Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['MO1 RR-02171/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI-23786/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, IgG/*biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.179.6.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Jun 1;179(6):1985-96. doi: 10.1084/jem.179.6.1985.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (v-Spi-1 protein, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,PMC2191524,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated whether p21ras and p120GAP are regulated by p210bcr/abl, and whether this activation is functionally significant for CML cell proliferation. We report that transient expression of p210bcr/abl in fibroblast-like cells induces simultaneous activation of p21ras and inhibition of GTPase-promoting activity of p120GAP, and confirm these data showing that downregulation of p210bcr/abl expression in CML cells with bcr/abl antisense oligodeoxynucleotides induces both inhibition of p21ras activation and stimulation of GTPase-promoting activity of p120GAP. Tyrosine phosphorylation of two p120GAP-associated proteins, p190 and p62, which may affect p120GAP activity, also depends on p210bcr/abl tyrosine kinase expression. Direct dependence of these effects on the kinase activity is proven in experiments in which expression of c-MYB protein in fibroblast-like cells or downregulation of c-MYB expression resulting in analogous inhibition of CML cell proliferation does not result in the same changes. Use of specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to downregulate p21ras expression revealed a requirement for functional p21ras in the proliferation of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML primary cells. Thus, the p210bcr/abl-dependent regulation of p120GAP activity is responsible, in part, for the maintenance of p21ras in the active GTP-bound form, a crucial requirement for CML cell proliferation.","['Skorski, T', 'Kanakaraj, P', 'Ku, D H', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Canaani, E', 'Zon, G', 'Perussia, B', 'Calabretta, B']","['Skorski T', 'Kanakaraj P', 'Ku DH', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Canaani E', 'Zon G', 'Perussia B', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.']",['eng'],"['CA-37155/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Oncogenes/drug effects', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.179.6.1855 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Jun 1;179(6):1855-65. doi: 10.1084/jem.179.6.1855.,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,,,PMC2191514,,"['abl', 'bcr', 'c-MYB']",,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of a proliferative response to ovine GM-CSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, the absence of other cell antigens found in mature macrophages, and low-efficiency phagocytosis suggested that the cells may be at an intermediate to late stage of myelomonocytic differentiation.","['John, H A', 'Deane, D', 'Haig, D']","['John HA', 'Deane D', 'Haig D']","['Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh, Scotland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*cytology/metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sheep', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.55.6.785 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1994 Jun;55(6):785-92. doi: 10.1002/jlb.55.6.785.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for IL-8 binding as a dimer and oligomer to IL-8 receptor B.,763-70,"By chemical cross-linking experiments we show that at physiologically relevant concentrations IL-8 and NAP-2 monomers are in an equilibrium with dimers and even oligomers (KD approximately 300-800 nM). Oligomerization seems to be more prevalent for IL-8 than for NAP-2. The form in which IL-8 and NAP-2 bind to their specific receptors was analyzed in binding experiments with COS-1 cells expressing IL-8 receptor A or B in recombinant forms. Both receptors were cloned from the human myeloid leukemic cell line AML-193. Type A receptor had high affinity for IL-8 (KD approximately 4 nM) and low affinity for NAP-2 (KD > or = 700 nM), whereas the type B receptor was of equally high affinity (KD approximately 2 nM) for both IL-8 and NAP-2. However, IL-8 receptor B could bind specifically three to four times more IL-8 than NAP-2, and NAP-2 was a weak competitor for IL-8 binding to the same receptor. In addition, IL-8, but not NAP-2, could be cross-linked to dimers when bound to IL-8 receptor B. We suggest from these findings that IL-8, but not NAP-2, binds as a dimer and oligomer to IL-8 receptor.","['Schnitzel, W', 'Monschein, U', 'Besemer, J']","['Schnitzel W', 'Monschein U', 'Besemer J']","['Sandoz Forschungsinstitut, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Peptides/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Thromboglobulin']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.55.6.763 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1994 Jun;55(6):763-70. doi: 10.1002/jlb.55.6.763.,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (PPBP protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)', '69344-77-0 (connective tissue-activating peptide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific in vivo and in vitro anti-TT antibody (Ab) production were measured by ELISA. We studied donors' and recipients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mixed E- (non-T cells) and E+ cells (T cells) spontaneously and after stimulation by TT in the absence or presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and IL-6. Five of the 12 patients and all donors and controls responded with in vivo anti-TT Ab. In vitro anti-TT Ab production correlated with the in vivo response. All seven of the nonresponders were either fully engrafted or mixed chimeras (donor T cells but autologous B cells and monocytes). We could not identify a T-cell defect in four of the five nonresponders who were tested. In contrast, E- cells from three of three responders cooperated with fresh donor E+ cells even when they shared only one HLA haplotype. In three of seven nonresponders, in vitro anti-TT Ab production was restored after the addition of IL-4 or IL-6 but not IL-2. Our results suggest that the humoral immunodeficiency that exists post mismatched T cell-depleted BMT is either a B-cell, a monocyte, or a B-cell/T-cell cooperation defect which, in some patients, may be correctible with the addition of a cytokine. Also, it is not necessary to engraft donor B cells to achieve normal antibody responses and the ability to respond does not appear to correlate with pretransplant chemotherapy.","['Benkerrou, M', 'Wara, D W', 'Elder, M', 'Dror, Y', 'Merino, A', 'Colombe, B W', 'Garovoy, M', 'Cowan, M J']","['Benkerrou M', 'Wara DW', 'Elder M', 'Dror Y', 'Merino A', 'Colombe BW', 'Garovoy M', 'Cowan MJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco 94143-1278.']",['eng'],"['MO1RR0271/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01AI29510/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DAO4331/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*biosynthesis', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/*immunology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01541342 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 1994 Mar;14(2):98-106. doi: 10.1007/BF01541342.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of alpha-spectrin deficiency are apparent in the cells' irregular shape and fragility in culture.

These mechanisms are regulated by the activities of both protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Recent studies have identified a novel protein-tyrosine phosphatase, termed Syp, that is widely expressed in various tissues. Syp encodes a cytoplasmic phosphatase that contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. Since SH2 domains have been shown to target the association of signal-transducing molecules to activated tyrosine kinases, experiments were performed to determine whether Syp might form specific complexes with p210bcr-abl, a fusion protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and, thus, possibly alter or mediate p210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase activity. We found that Syp was highly and constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in three different murine cell lines transfected with a p210bcr-abl expression vector. Furthermore, p210bcr-abl, Syp, and Grb2 formed stable complexes in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Complex formation between p210bcr-abl and Syp was mediated in vitro by the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of Syp. Last, p210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase was effectively dephosphorylated by Syp in vitro. These results suggest an interaction between Syp and BCR-ABL protein, which might play a role in cellular transformation of BCR-ABL.","['Tauchi, T', 'Feng, G S', 'Shen, R', 'Song, H Y', 'Donner, D', 'Pawson, T', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Tauchi T', 'Feng GS', 'Shen R', 'Song HY', 'Donner D', 'Pawson T', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL46549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL49202/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transfection']",1994/05/27 00:00,1994/05/27 00:01,['1994/05/27 00:00'],"['1994/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)36617-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 May 27;269(21):15381-7.,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nucleus, a perinuclear region which included the Golgi apparatus (Golgi region), and the remaining cytoplasm were spatially resolved with the Cameca IMS-3f ion microscope in cryogenically prepared cells. In resting cells the nucleus contained about 0.60 mM, the Golgi region about 1.2 mM, and the remaining cytoplasm about 1.0 mM total calcium. Antigen stimulation of rat basophilic leukemia cells resulted in a significant loading of calcium in all three cellular compartments. Antigen stimulation in the absence of extracellular calcium resulted in a significant loss of total calcium from all three intracellular compartments. Influx and efflux of calcium were measured simultaneously in resting and stimulated cells by using stable 44Ca in the extracellular solution, and by imaging mass 40 to determine the native intracellular calcium (40Ca) and mass 44 to localize the 44Ca that entered the cell from extracellular solution. After a 10-min incubation, 0.240 fmol of the total calcium per cell had been replaced with 44Ca, which amounts to about 33% of the total cell calcium. If antigen was present during this incubation there was an additional loss of 0.229 fmol of 40Ca and an added gain of 0.476 fmol of 44Ca per cell, which corresponds to a net increase in total intracellular calcium of 0.247 fmol.","['Chandra, S', 'Fewtrell, C', 'Millard, P J', 'Sandison, D R', 'Webb, W W', 'Morrison, G H']","['Chandra S', 'Fewtrell C', 'Millard PJ', 'Sandison DR', 'Webb WW', 'Morrison GH']","['Department of Chemistry, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],['GM 24314/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Ions', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Microscopy/methods', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/27 00:00,1994/05/27 00:01,['1994/05/27 00:00'],"['1994/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)36590-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 May 27;269(21):15186-94.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Ions)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A membrane- and microfilament-associated 58-kDa protein (p58) in the MAT-C1 microvilli has been implicated in the stabilization of the microvilli and microfilament-membrane interactions. This protein is associated with a high M(r) glycoprotein complex containing the (proto)oncogene p185neu and other signal transduction components in a putative microfilament-associated signal transduction particle. Amino acid sequences were obtained from two trypsin peptides of p58. Screening a MAT-C1 cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide derived from the larger peptide and polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA ends permitted the isolation of overlapping cDNAs encoding the 427-amino acid open reading frame of p58. In vitro transcription and translation using a full-length cDNA gave a protein of approximately 55 kDa, which reacts with anti-p58 antiserum and reconstitutes into a complex with actin and glycoproteins from the membrane-microfilament interaction site. When COS-7 cells were transfected with the full-length cDNA, p58 was localized in a punctate distribution. In addition, the transfected cells exhibited fewer microfilament cables than untransfected neighboring cells. The amino acid sequence showed a surprising similarity to mammalian retroviral Gag proteins and included regions corresponding to p15, p12 and the N-terminal 80% of p30. Comparisons of p58 and the corresponding regions of the Gag proteins for Moloney murine leukemia virus indicated that about 60% of their amino acid residues were identical. These studies suggest that p58 is the product of an endogenous retroviral gene whose expression as a cellular protein alters the properties of the tumor cell to provide a selective advantage for tumor growth in the animal.","['Juang, S H', 'Huang, J', 'Li, Y', 'Salas, P J', 'Fregien, N', 'Carraway, C A', 'Carraway, K L']","['Juang SH', 'Huang J', 'Li Y', 'Salas PJ', 'Fregien N', 'Carraway CA', 'Carraway KL']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Florida 33101.']",['eng'],"['CA 14395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 33795/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Microfilament Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Microvilli/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/27 00:00,1994/05/27 00:01,['1994/05/27 00:00'],"['1994/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)36575-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 May 27;269(21):15067-75.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (membrane and microfilament-associated protein p58, rat)']",,,,,['GENBANK/U15425'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A viral transactivator of HTLV-1, Tax1, in a human T-cell line (Jurkat), was sufficient to stimulate transcription of the TIMP-1 gene. Deletion and mutation analysis of the TIMP-1 gene promoter showed that the AP-1 binding site in the 38-base pair sequence conserved between the human and mouse genes was essential for activation by Tax1. The transactivator of HTLV-2 also stimulated the promoter through the same cis-element. The reported growth-promoting activity of TIMP-1 against erythroid cells and potentially against HTLV-1-infected T-cells may modulate the clinical course of adult T-cell leukemia.","['Uchijima, M', 'Sato, H', 'Fujii, M', 'Seiki, M']","['Uchijima M', 'Sato H', 'Fujii M', 'Seiki M']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1994/05/27 00:00,1994/05/27 00:01,['1994/05/27 00:00'],"['1994/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)36557-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 May 27;269(21):14946-50.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,['GENBANK/D26513'],['TIMP-1'],,,,,,,,,,,

HCV-specific antibodies were also detected in one out of three untransfused children with ALL but in none of the untransfused children with malignancies other than ALL. HCV-specific seropositivity influenced the management of children with ALL during maintenance therapy. In fact, as a result of abnormal liver function tests, maintenance therapy had to be suspended significantly more often in the case of HCV-seropositive patients with ALL than in HCV-seronegative ones. Despite the high morbidity during maintenance therapy, chronic liver disease (CLD) was uncommon in both groups: five children with ALL (17.2% of HCV-seropositive children) and one child with a malignancy other than ALL (25%) had CLD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dibenedetto, S P', 'Ragusa, R', 'Sciacca, A', 'Di Cataldo, A', 'Miraglia, V', ""D'Amico, S"", 'Lo Nigro, L', 'Ippolito, A M']","['Dibenedetto SP', 'Ragusa R', 'Sciacca A', 'Di Cataldo A', 'Miraglia V', ""D'Amico S"", 'Lo Nigro L', 'Ippolito AM']","['Division of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, University of Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Hepatitis Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis C/*epidemiology/etiology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Liver Diseases/etiology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01954518 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1994 Apr;153(4):271-5. doi: 10.1007/BF01954518.,['0 (Hepatitis Antibodies)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is demonstrated herein that empty and drug-loaded small (0.1-micron diameter) liposomes accumulate efficiently into the peritoneal cavity of normal and ascitic L1210 tumor-bearing animals following i.v. administration. In normal mice injected with 100 nm DSPC/chol liposomal doxorubicin (drug-to-lipid ratio of 0.2; wt/wt) approximately 2.8 micrograms drug could be recovered from the peritoneal cavity following peritoneal lavage at 24 h. Although this represents only 0.7% of the injected doxorubicin dose, this level of drug is 2 orders of magnitude greater than that achieved following administration of an equivalent dose of free drug (20 mg/kg). The drug levels achieved within the peritoneal cavity are dependent on the physical characteristics (size, drug-to-lipid ratio and lipid composition) of the liposomes employed. Optimal delivery is obtained employing 100 nm DSPC/chol liposomal doxorubicin, a vesicle system that is known to retain entrapped drug following i.v. administration and exhibits extended circulation lifetimes. Analysis of drug and liposome distribution within the peritoneal cavity of normal mice indicates that as much as 50% of the measured doxorubicin and liposomal lipid is cell-associated. Flow cytometric analysis of the peritoneal cells demonstrated that cell-associated doxorubicin resides almost exclusively within resident peritoneal macrophages. The increased delivery of doxorubicin to the peritoneal cavity of normal mice following i.v. administration of small (0.1-micron) liposomal doxorubicin is correlated with a pronounced (> 90%) and prolonged (> 14-day) suppression of resident peritoneal cells. Liposomal drug accumulation increased dramatically in animals with an established L1210 ascitic tumor. More than 5% of the injected dose was found in the peritoneal cavity of these animals 24 h after treatment with DSPC/chol liposomal doxorubicin as compared with a value of 0.03% of the injected dose achieved with free drug. It is proposed that accumulation of liposomes into the peritoneal cavity of normal and tumor-bearing mice may serve as a useful model for characterizing factors mediating the transfer of liposomes from the vascular compartment to extravascular sites.","['Bally, M B', 'Masin, D', 'Nayar, R', 'Cullis, P R', 'Mayer, L D']","['Bally MB', 'Masin D', 'Nayar R', 'Cullis PR', 'Mayer LD']","['Division of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/analysis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Liposomes/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685931 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1994;34(2):137-46. doi: 10.1007/BF00685931.,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for complex interstitial breaks in a case of refractory anemia with excess blasts.,8-12,"Interstitial loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-) is an anomaly frequently seen in myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Although the limits of the interstitial deletions vary among patients, there is a critical region of overlap at 5q31 that is consistently deleted in most cases. The order of genes in the critical 5q31 region is centromere, interleukin gene cluster, an anonymous polymorphic locus D5S89, early growth response factor, CSF1 receptor, telomere. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of specific 5q31 probes to metaphases with del(5) (q11q31) from a patient with secondary refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation demonstrates that the interstitial deletion is not contiguous. The 5q- chromosome has lost the D5S89 and CSF1R loci while retaining some of the sequences in between. A probe derived from a 300-kbp yeast artificial chromosome containing the D5S89 locus is interrupted on the normal chromosome 5 of this patient. Data presented in this report are consistent with (i) presence of a critical gene within the YAC and (ii) more than a single interstitial break within the 5q- chromosome. These results, while pinpointing one of the critical 5q31 loci, also provide evidence for a second telomeric locus.","['Nagarajan, L', 'Zhao, L', 'Lu, X', 'Warrington, J A', 'Wasmuth, J J', 'Siciliano, M', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Liang, J C']","['Nagarajan L', 'Zhao L', 'Lu X', 'Warrington JA', 'Wasmuth JJ', 'Siciliano M', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Liang JC']","['Department of Hematology, Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG 00320/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(94)90021-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(94)90021-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1994 May;74(1):8-12. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(94)90021-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight of the 11 MDS cases have been either refractory anemia (RA) or RA with excess of blasts, and four of the 14 AML cases have had preleukemic myelodysplastic cases phase, with the +19 accruing during the time of leukemic transformation.

METHODS: Using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay, the authors determined sIL-2R in the serum of 135 patients with ATL diagnosed and subclassified according to the Japan Lymphoma Study Group criteria and in the serum of healthy HTLV-1 seropositive persons. Also included were patients in the preleukemic state of ATL (pre-ATL), which is characterized by only slight blood changes but does not fit the diagnostic criteria of ATL. In the five subjects who finally advanced to overt ATL, the authors prospectively performed serial measurements of the receptor. RESULTS: Serial measurements of sIL-2R levels taken until overt ATL developed showed that these levels in the initial samples were higher than those of control subjects, even when subjects were asymptomatic or in the pre-ATL state. The serial levels of the five subjects gradually increased despite being in a clinically stable condition, finally reaching markedly high levels at the time ATL became overt. The mean sIL-2R levels of the smoldering, chronic, acute, and lymphoma subtypes of ATL were 1680 U/ml, 6680 U/ml, 45,940 U/ml, and 34,620 U/ml, respectively (P < 0.01). The sIL-2R levels of each subtype at the time of diagnosis were more correlated with tumor burden, malignant behavior, and prognosis than lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In the low, moderate, and high sIL-2R subgroups, the median survival time and percent survival probability at 2 years was 30.2 months (46.0%), 16.5 months (25.0%), and 7.7 months (15.3%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Serial measurements of sIL-2R levels are of clinical importance because changes of the levels correlate with disease progression, especially in early phase of ATL. The data suggest that sIL-2R may be more useful than LDH. In addition, emphasis may be placed on sIL-2R as an indicator of ATL progression status and prognosis for survival. The value of this marker in clinical practice should be confirmed prospectively.","['Kamihira, S', 'Atogami, S', 'Sohda, H', 'Momita, S', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Kamihira S', 'Atogami S', 'Sohda H', 'Momita S', 'Yamada Y', 'Tomonaga M']","['Blood Transfusion Service, Nagasaki University Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Carrier State/pathology', 'HTLV-I Infections/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/mortality/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis', 'Solubility', 'Survival Rate']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940601)73:11<2753::aid-cncr2820731117>3.0.co;2-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Jun 1;73(11):2753-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940601)73:11<2753::aid-cncr2820731117>3.0.co;2-x.,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively investigated 32 patients with CML post-BMT by assessing T-cell chimerism and minimal residual disease using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodologies. Patients were studied between 1 and 24 months post-BMT. Thirty patients received a T-cell-depleted marrow grafts and 2 received unmanipulated marrow. All but 1 patient were conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI)+thiotepa+cyclophosphamide (Cy). The other patient received TBI+Cy as conditioning. The T cells were exclusively of donor origin in 12 of 16 patients who were tested at 1 month post-BMT, but were mixed chimeric in 11 of these patients by > or = 3 months. Once mixed T-cell chimerism was documented, no patient returned to having all donor T-cells. At a median follow-up of 12 months, minimal residual disease was present in 18 of 22 patients with mixed T-cell chimerism and in 3 of 10 patients with full donor chimerism. The actuarial molecular relapse rate at 24 months for the two groups is 91% and 33%, respectively (P < .02). The finding of BCR-ABL mRNA within the first 6 months of transplant or on two consecutive assays was highly predictive of subsequent cytogenetic or hematologic relapse (P = .032 and P < .02, respectively). Ten patients, 9 with mixed T-cell chimerism, have relapsed (4 clinical, 6 cytogenetic) at a median of 12 months post-BMT. These data suggest that mixed T-cell chimerism may be a marker for abrogation of graft-versus-leukemia activity that is thought to be pivotal in eradicating minimal residual disease after BMT for CML.","['Mackinnon, S', 'Barnett, L', 'Heller, G', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Mackinnon S', 'Barnett L', 'Heller G', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78930-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 1;83(11):3409-16.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further characterize effector mechanisms that may be involved in this GVL phenomenon, we have previously established an in vitro model to identify allogeneic T-cell clones that selectively mediate cytotoxicity against a patient's leukemic cells, but not against nonleukemic lymphocytes from the same patient. We have modified this in vitro model to test whether the Ph1 chromosome and the P210 fusion protein it controls have a detectable role in leukemia-specific recognition by allogeneic T-cell clones. In this report, T-cell lines reactive with allogeneic Ph1 chromosome-bearing (Ph1+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines were derived and selected to be minimally reactive with Ph1 negative (Ph1-) lymphoid lines from the same patient. However, after prolonged culture, these same T-cell lines also mediated significant destruction of the Ph1- target cells from the same patients. These T-cell lines specifically recognized cells from the allogeneic CML patient to which they were sensitized, and were not contaminated by an outgrowth of natural killer cells. Furthermore, subclones could be derived from these T-cell lines, and some of these subclones again showed selective killing of the allogeneic Ph1+ leukemia cell lines, and not of the Ph1- cell line from the same patient. Analyses of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes showed the alloreactive T-cell lines and the Ph1+ selective subclones derived from them to be of the same clonal origin. This suggests that the same T cells reacting with antigens expressed on the nonleukemic Ph1- targets can at times selectively and preferentially kill the allogeneic Ph1+ cells. As the same TCR that recognizes Ph1+ cells also can recognize the Ph1- targets, it appears that the Ph1+ chromosome does not play a detectable role in recognition by these allogeneic T-cell clones. This in vitro observation may provide a model for evaluating the relationship between GVL and graft-versus-host disease effects.","['Oettel, K R', 'Wesly, O H', 'Albertini, M R', 'Hank, J A', 'Iliopolis, O', 'Sosman, J A', 'Voelkerding, K', 'Wu, S Q', 'Clark, S S', 'Sondel, P M']","['Oettel KR', 'Wesly OH', 'Albertini MR', 'Hank JA', 'Iliopolis O', 'Sosman JA', 'Voelkerding K', 'Wu SQ', 'Clark SS', 'Sondel PM']","['Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin, Madison.']",['eng'],"['CA-05436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78928-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 1;83(11):3390-402.,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using primers framing this mutation in exon 9 of the RAR alpha gene, we showed that polymerase chain reaction products amplified from either mRNA or genomic DNA templates from the RA-res subline were completely resistant to FokI digestion whereas those from wild-type (wt) HL-60 cells could be digested to completion. The lack of a normal allele in the RA-res cells was confirmed by mixing experiments and hybridization analyses. Southern blot analysis of DNA from the RA-res and wt cells versus control placental DNA indicated that the RAR alpha gene is not haploid. The independent isolation of the same RAR alpha mutation in different laboratories suggests either that the mutation exits in a small subpopulation in the wt line or that this is a mutational ""hot spot."" Furthermore, the results indicate that if a dominant negative mode of resistance is involved in the RA-res subline, this must involve interference with the function of heterologous receptor proteins such as the retinoid X receptors. The lack of any normal RAR alpha in this subline may facilitate studies of the mode of action of retinoids.","['Li, Y P', 'Said, F', 'Gallagher, R E']","['Li YP', 'Said F', 'Gallagher RE']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY 10467.']",['eng'],"['R01-CA42047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA56771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78914-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 1;83(11):3298-302.,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, despite an initial good response, most patients that received continuous treatment with all-trans RA relapse and develop RA-resistant disease. The 9-cis RA is a high-affinity ligand for retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and also binds efficiently to retinoic acid receptors (RARs); all-trans RA is a ligand for RARs. Both alone are able to induce differentiation of wild-type HL-60 cells. We found that neither all-trans RA nor 9-cis RA (< 2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced differentiation of RA-resistant HL-60 cells into either mature granulocytes or monocytes. However, morphologic differentiation of the RA-resistant HL-60 cells was induced by 10(-6) mol/L all-trans RA combined with various concentrations (10(-12) to 10(-6) mol/L) of 9-cis RA. Electron microscopic examination also confirmed that the combination of both retinoids induced RA-resistant HL-60 cells to differentiate to mature granulocytes. Functional analysis of differentiation (NBT reduction activity) confirmed the necessity of both analogs to induce differentiation. Also, expression of myeloid-specific differentiation antigens (CD11b and CD14) as well as migration inhibitory factor-related protein (MRP)-8/14 mRNAs were upregulated only in the presence of both retinoids in a dose-dependent manner. In these conditions 3H-thymidine incorporation was inhibited and numbers of viable cells were decreased, suggesting that all-trans RA with 9-cis RA may inhibit cell growth and induce differentiation of RA-resistant HL-60 cells into mature granulocytes. These studies suggest that 9-cis RA in combination with all-trans RA is an effective inducer of RA-resistant HL-60 cells and may have implications for both the biology of retinoids and clinical treatment of RA-resistant acute myelogenous leukemia, including APL patients.","['Kizaki, M', 'Nakajima, H', 'Mori, S', 'Koike, T', 'Morikawa, M', 'Ohta, M', 'Saito, M', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Kizaki M', 'Nakajima H', 'Mori S', 'Koike T', 'Morikawa M', 'Ohta M', 'Saito M', 'Koeffler HP', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/genetics', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Calgranulin A', 'Calgranulin B', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78913-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 1;83(11):3289-97.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Calgranulin B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date APL is the only AML that is sufficiently sensitive to all-trans retinoic acid's (ATRA) differentiating effect. In vivo ATRA alone achieves complete remission in most APL patients. However, failure or partial responses are observed and the molecular basis of the absence of ATRA response in these patients has not been determined. To gain insights in the cell growth and differentiation of APL cells, expression of hematopoietic growth factors (HGF) shown to be produced by leukemic cells (interleukin-1 beta [IL-1 beta], IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], and IL-3) was studied in 16 APL samples. Twelve APL cases expressed IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha, but not G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3. These cases achieved complete remission with ATRA therapy. The four remaining patients (either TNF alpha negative or G-CSF, GM-CSF or IL-3 positive) did not achieve complete remission with ATRA. In all cases, in vivo response to ATRA therapy was correlated to the in vitro differentiation effect of all-trans retinoic acid 10(-6) mol/L. Thus, ATRA differentiation induction was strongly correlated to the HGF expression (P < .0001). These results suggest that the presence or absence of HGF's expression by APL cells may contribute to the therapeutic effect of ATRA in this disease.","['Dubois, C', 'Schlageter, M H', 'de Gentile, A', 'Guidez, F', 'Balitrand, N', 'Toubert, M E', 'Krawice, I', 'Fenaux, P', 'Castaigne, S', 'Najean, Y']","['Dubois C', 'Schlageter MH', 'de Gentile A', 'Guidez F', 'Balitrand N', 'Toubert ME', 'Krawice I', 'Fenaux P', 'Castaigne S', 'Najean Y', 'et al.']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78910-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jun 1;83(11):3264-70.,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis was made after an episode of cerebral thrombosis in one patient, during a study for headache and dizziness in another, and fortuitously in the three remainders. All patients had splenomegaly and varying degrees of thrombocytosis. The cytogenetic exam was normal in all four cases. A woman patient was treated with interferon during a pregnancy. Fetal growth was retarded, and the newborn showed bone and genital malformations. No environmental leukemogen factor was found.

Patients with VOD usually present with jaundice, hepatomegaly, weight gain, and ascites. This complication is usually associated with a high mortality rate. We report here the frequency and treatment of VOD in our autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) patient population. Three of 15 (20%) children (median age 9 years) developed VOD and were treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Two of these three patients were prepared for BMT with busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, 200 mg/kg), while the other child received cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C 18 g/m2), Cytoxan (3,600 mg/m2) and total body irradiation (TBI, 1,400 y). VOD developed between days 7-24 posttransplant. Clotting studies obtained pretransplant and during VOD included prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen, fibrin-degradation product (FDP), proteins C and S, and platelet count. There was no correlation between the incidence of VOD and coagulation status. All patients had normal pretransplant clotting studies. However, protein C levels were noted to be consistently low for those patients at the time of VOD. All three patients received rt-PA at a dose of 0.25-0.5 mg/kg for 4 days. This dose produced increased levels of FDP but did not significantly prolong PT nor PTT. Two of the patients had dramatic responses and had complete resolution of VOD within 6-12 days from the start of therapy. The other patient died of fulminant hepatic failure. It seems that rt-PA is effective in VOD of the liver, which may be associated with low protein C level.","['Yu, L C', 'Malkani, I', 'Regueira, O', 'Ode, D L', 'Warrier, R P']","['Yu LC', 'Malkani I', 'Regueira O', 'Ode DL', 'Warrier RP']","['Department of Pediatrics, Louisiana State University Medical Center School of Medicine, New Orleans.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Ascites/etiology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Pleural Effusion/etiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*therapeutic use']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830460307 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1994 Jul;46(3):194-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830460307.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We made serial analyses of various hemostatic parameters in seven newly diagnosed APL patients. In all patients at diagnosis, plasma fibrinogen/fibrin degradation product (fragment-E), cross-linked fibrin degradation product (D-dimer fragment), thrombin-antithrombin III complex and plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex were elevated, indicating the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Antithrombin III (ATIII) levels were normal in all patients except for the patient with congenital ATIII deficiency. In four patients subsequently treated with ATRA without anticoagulant therapy, these hemostatic markers returned to near-normal levels by day 7 of treatment, indicating that DIC was essentially resolved. By contrast, in three patients who received conventional chemotherapy with a continuous low-dose heparin, improvement of coagulopathy was slower than in patients treated with ATRA. These results suggest that ATRA therapy exerts the rapid improvement in abnormal hemostatic markers in APL patients without any anticoagulant therapies, by inducing differentiation of leukemic cells and, in turns no massive release of procoagulant or fibrinolytic substances from these cells.","['Kawai, Y', 'Watanabe, K', 'Kizaki, M', 'Murata, M', 'Kamata, T', 'Uchida, H', 'Moriki, T', 'Yokoyama, K', 'Tokuhira, M', 'Nakajima, H']","['Kawai Y', 'Watanabe K', 'Kizaki M', 'Murata M', 'Kamata T', 'Uchida H', 'Moriki T', 'Yokoyama K', 'Tokuhira M', 'Nakajima H', 'et al.']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/complications/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/analysis', 'Hemostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830460305 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1994 Jul;46(3):184-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830460305.,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study of these biopsy specimens revealed various benign conditions, such as white pulp hyperplasia, myeloid metaplasia, storage disease, and granulomatous processes and abscesses. Malignant neoplasms were represented by non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphomas, leukemias, malignant histiocytoses and metastases. sFNAB was the only diagnostic procedure employed for the morphologic assessment of 60 benign and of 2 malignant cases. In all the other cases sFNAB gave the first diagnosis that was confirmed on surgical specimens. In 2 cases splenic bleeding occurred; one of them required splenectomy.

CASE REPORT: Fatal TA-GVHD due to the transfusion of HLA-matched platelets from an unrelated HLA-homozygous donor is reported. A 61-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and myelodysplastic syndrome was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia in November 1991. Induction chemotherapy resulted in aplasia, which was followed by a normocellular marrow with mild dysplasia and continued karyotypic abnormalities. High-dose chemotherapy was given in a second attempt to achieve complete remission. HLA-matched platelets were ordered when platelet refractoriness developed. The patient was HLA-heterozygous for HLA-A and -B antigens (A2, 29; B37, 44). Over the next 7 days, four unirradiated HLA-matched plateletpheresis units were transfused; one was probably homozygous for both HLA-A and -B antigens (A2, -; B44, -) and was transfused first, and three were probably homozygous for an HLA-B antigen (A2, 29; B44, -) and were white cell reduced. No blood relatives served as donors. Seven days after the first HLA-matched platelet transfusion, fever, chills, and diarrhea developed; 2 days later, a rash was present. Liver enzymes increased markedly. Renal and respiratory failure ensured. A skin biopsy was consistent with GVHD. Despite immunosuppressive therapy, the patient died 19 days after the first HLA-matched platelet transfusion. CONCLUSION: TA-GVHD has been recognized in immunocompromised, HLA-heterozygous patients receiving blood from blood relatives who are HLA-homozygous. patients receiving blood from either blood relatives or non-blood relatives who are HLA-homozygous. This HLA-heterozygous patient received transfusions of unirradiated, class I HLA-homozygous platelets, which were specifically ordered as HLA-matched, and his death was attributed to TA-GVHD. Consideration should always be given to providing irradiated blood for immunosuppressed patients, especially when HLA-matched platelets are used, to prevent TA-GVHD.","['Benson, K', 'Marks, A R', 'Marshall, M J', 'Goldstein, J D']","['Benson K', 'Marks AR', 'Marshall MJ', 'Goldstein JD']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['*Blood Donors', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Fatal Outcome', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/*blood/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Transfusion Reaction']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1994.34594249057.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1994 May;34(5):432-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1994.34594249057.x.,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An infection was documented microbiologically in 28% and clinically in 30% of the episodes. Blood cultures were positive in 19% of the febrile episodes. The rate of blood culture positivity was unrelated to the type of hematological malignancy, to neutropenia and to the presence of infection foci. 21% (26/126) of the patients died of sepsis-related causes. Sepsis-related death occurred in 23% of the blood culture positive febrile episodes, with a median survival time of 2 days. Infection prophylaxis did not reduce either the rate of blood culture positivity or the rate of sepsis-related deaths.

This paper reports on a detailed characterization of the expression of a panel of markers for various types of immature and mature haematopoietic cells in the HMC-1. We also studied the potential of HMC-1 to differentiate upon treatment with conditioned media from the human T-cell line Mo, retinoic acid or DMSO. HMC-1 was found to express several mast cell-related markers. A high expression of Kit, the receptor for stem-cell factor, was detected. The majority of the cells were stained with a MoAb against the mast cell-specific serine protease tryptase. Of particular interest was the finding that beta-tryptase mRNA, but not alpha-tryptase mRNA, was expressed in HMC-1. Using enzyme-histochemistry we were able to show that the beta-tryptase was enzymatically active, indicating that tryptase can form active homotetramers. Both heparin and chondroitin sulfate were found to be present in approximately equal amounts. HMC-1 lacked surface expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor, which was confirmed by the absence of mRNA of the alpha- and beta-chains of the IgE-receptor complex. However, a strong expression of the gamma-chain of the IgE-receptor complex was detected. A positive staining of the monocyte/macrophage marker CD68 was obtained, as well as a strong hybridization signal for the eosinophilic/basophilic-related differentiation marker the Charcot-Leyden crystal. Treatment of HMC-1 with conditioned media from the human T-cell line Mo, retinoic acid or DMSO induced only moderate changes in the surface or intracellular expression of the studied markers. The agents tested neither induced any of the monocyte/granulocyte markers examined, nor expression of the Fc epsilon RI alpha-chain.","['Nilsson, G', 'Blom, T', 'Kusche-Gullberg, M', 'Kjellen, L', 'Butterfield, J H', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Nilsson, K', 'Hellman, L']","['Nilsson G', 'Blom T', 'Kusche-Gullberg M', 'Kjellen L', 'Butterfield JH', 'Sundstrom C', 'Nilsson K', 'Hellman L']","['Department of Pathology, University of Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chymases', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans/analysis', 'Histamine/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mast Cells/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis', 'Tryptases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1994.tb03404.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1994 May;39(5):489-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1994.tb03404.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Src related protein tyrosine kinase p53/56lyn present in RBL-2H3 cells could play a role in this reaction. Here we have isolated the cDNA for rat Lyn and found it to be very homologous at the amino acid level to both the human and mouse proteins. A bacterially expressed maltose binding protein-Lyn (MBP-Lyn) fusion protein was already tyrosine phosphorylated and had tyrosine kinase activity. In a filter-binding assay, MBP-Lyn fusion protein (at 0.1 microM) specifically bound to several proteins of RBL-2H3 cells. In lysates of IgE receptor-activated cells, there was increased binding of MBP-Lyn to 65, 72, 78 and 110 kDa tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. The 72, 78 and 110 kDa tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were precipitated by a fusion protein containing the Lyn Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain. The 72 kDa Lyn binding protein was different from p72syk. Furthermore, paxillin, a cytoskeletal protein, was identified as one of the Lyn binding proteins. Thus Fc epsilon RI mediated signal transduction in RBL-2H3 cells may result from the interaction of p53/56lyn with paxillin, pp72, pp110 and other proteins.","['Minoguchi, K', 'Kihara, H', 'Nishikata, H', 'Hamawy, M M', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Minoguchi K', 'Kihara H', 'Nishikata H', 'Hamawy MM', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paxillin', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*src-Family Kinases']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(94)90039-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1994 May;31(7):519-29. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(94)90039-6.,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pxn protein, rat)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,,,,['GENBANK/L14951'],['lyn'],,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction of sequences from Friend murine leukemia virus (clone FB29) into the genome of CasBrE results in a marked shortening of the incubation period. The FB29 sequences which influence the incubation period were previously localized to the 5' leader sequence of the viral genome (M. Czub, F. J. McAtee, and J. L. Portis, J. Virol. 66:3298-3305, 1992). In the current study, we constructed a series of chimeric viruses consisting of the genome of CasBrE containing various segments of the leader sequence from FB29. A 41-nucleotide element (positions 481 through 521) near the 3' end of the leader was found to have a strong influence on the incubation period. This element influenced the kinetics of virus replication and/or spread in nonneuronal tissues, a property which was shown previously to determine the extent of central nervous system infection (M. Czub, F. J. McAtee, and J. L. Portis, J. Virol. 66:3298-3305, 1992). Curiously, this sequence had no demonstrable effect on virus replication in vitro in a fibroblastic cell line from Mus dunni. This segment encodes 14 of the unique 88-amino-acid N terminus of pr75gag, the precursor of a glycosylated form of the gag polyprotein which is expressed at the cell surface. Previous in vitro studies of mutants of Moloney murine leukemia virus lacking expression of glycosylated Gag failed to reveal a function for this protein in virus replication. We mutated the Kozak consensus sequence around the initiation codon for this protein in the chimeric virus CasFrKP, a virus which induces neurologic disease with a short (18- to 23-day) incubation period.

In contrast, there was a marked slowing of the replication kinetics in vivo and a dramatic attenuation of neurovirulence.

In contrast to Gag, glycoGag is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum and is absent from virions. Since glycoGag has been described to be dispensable ex vivo, we investigated the in vivo effects of a glycoGag- mutation in the Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV). F-MuLV induces severe early hemolytic anemia and subsequent erythroleukemia within 2 months after inoculation of newborn mice. We obtained a glycoGag- F-MuLV, strain H5, by inserting an octanucleotide linker downstream of the CUG codon leading to the reading of a stop codon in all reading frames upstream of the Gag AUG. F-MuLV H5 did not induce severe early hemolytic anemia, and latency of erythroleukemia was significantly increased most likely because of an approximately 1-week delay in the in vivo spreading. Accordingly, induction of recombinant polytropic viruses was also significantly delayed. Close examination of ex vivo spreading kinetics also showed a slower dissemination of F-MuLV H5. Western blot (immunoblot) performed after inoculation of newborn mice with this glycoGag- virus indicated the emergence of new glycoGag+ viruses. PCR analyses with F-MuLV-specific primers demonstrated in vivo pseudoreversions restoring the glycoGag reading frame. Our results demonstrated that glycoGag expression is positively selected and essential for full spreading and pathogenic abilities.","['Corbin, A', 'Prats, A C', 'Darlix, J L', 'Sitbon, M']","['Corbin A', 'Prats AC', 'Darlix JL', 'Sitbon M']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, INSERM U363, Universite Paris V, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Precursors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/etiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/etiology', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Virulence']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.6.3857-3867.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Jun;68(6):3857-67. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.6.3857-3867.1994.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Nonstructural Proteins)']",,,,PMC236891,,['gag'],,,,,,,,,,,

The nucleotide sequence of the U3 regions of two such CWD recombinants was nearly identical to that of the endogenous ecotropic virus parent Emv-1, but they shared three nucleotide substitutions immediately 3' of the enhancer core. These substitutions were found in recombinant proviruses from about one-third of spontaneous CWD lymphomas as determined by an oligonucleotide hybridization assay of proviral fragments that had been nucleotide substitutions in the CWD viruses were inherited from an endogenous polytropic provirus that is absent in the other highly leukemic strains. On the basis of the results of these and previous studies, we propose that CWD recombinants acquire pathogenic U3 region sequences through recombination with an endogenous polytropic virus or Bxv-1 and that the pathogenicity of these sequences may be related to a sequence motif that is known to bind members of the basic helix-loop-helix class of transcription factors.","['Massey, A C', 'Lawrenz-Smith, S C', 'Innes, D J', 'Thomas, C Y']","['Massey AC', 'Lawrenz-Smith SC', 'Innes DJ', 'Thomas CY']","['Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville 22908.']",['eng'],"['AI 07957/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.6.3773-3783.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Jun;68(6):3773-83. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.6.3773-3783.1994.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,PMC236882,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a population based case-control study, the association with local environmental factors was investigated. PARTICIPANTS: For each patient younger than 40 years of age (n = 14) diagnosed between 1975 and 1989, four age and sex matched controls were selected via local general practitioners. METHODS: All parents of patients and controls completed a questionnaire on their lifestyle, living conditions, and health, for several years preceding each individual diagnosis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, matched, and, if necessary, stratified for neighbourhood. MAIN RESULTS: Increased ORs were recorded for intensive use of petroleum products and pesticides by the patients themselves and their fathers: OR petroleum products: 8.0 (95% CI 2.2, 129.9) and 9.0 (1.0, 66.1) respectively; OR pesticides: 6.0 (0.6, 49.3) and 3.2 (1.0, 10.1) respectively. Swimming in a local pond was also significantly associated with the disease: OR = 5.3 (1.3, 17.4). In the 1970s this pond had been polluted by petroleum products and pesticides. CONCLUSIONS: The increased incidence of childhood haematopoietic malignancies in Aalsmeer may have been associated with several specific local environmental factors. Interpretation of the results, however, should take into account the fact that confidence intervals were wide because of the limited number of cases.","['Mulder, Y M', 'Drijver, M', 'Kreis, I A']","['Mulder YM', 'Drijver M', 'Kreis IA']","['Community Health Service Amstelland De Meerlanden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pesticides/adverse effects', 'Petroleum/adverse effects', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'Swimming', 'Water Pollution, Chemical/adverse effects']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.48.2.161 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1994 Apr;48(2):161-5. doi: 10.1136/jech.48.2.161.,"['0 (Pesticides)', '0 (Petroleum)']",,,,PMC1059926,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DACH can exist as the trans-1R,2R, trans-1S,2S or cis isomer, and we have examined whether specific isomers coordinated to a platinum(IV) center can modulate antitumor activities in murine tumor models in vivo. Ten isomeric series of DACH-Pt(IV) complexes were synthesized, each series containing a different combination of axial and equatorial ligands and varying only by the isomeric form of the DACH ligand. Among the ten series, seven clearly indicated superiority of the (R,R)-DACH-Pt(IV) complex against leukemia L1210/0 cells, while in three the R,R and S,S configurations gave similar efficacies which were better than that of the corresponding cis analog. In three out of the ten series, the antitumor activities of the S,S and cis complexes were similar, in six the cis analogs were the least effective, and in the remaining one the cis analog was superior to S,S.

In this study we show that the human mast cell leukemia line HMC-1 is a source of multiple chemokines, including I-309, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, RANTES, and interleukin-8. I-309 and MCP-1 transcripts are expressed at low levels in unstimulated HMC-1. However, phorbol ester treatment up-regulates these and other chemokine transcript levels and also up-regulates chemokine protein synthesis and secretion. Induction of chemokine transcripts in HMC-1 requires de novo protein synthesis. We compared the effects of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids on the expression of chemokine genes in HMC-1 to their effects in activated T-cells. We find that methyl-prednisolone reduces MCP-1 but not other chemokine transcripts in HMC-1, even though there are distinct and more general effects on chemokine transcripts in activated T-cells. These effects are attributed to inhibition of transcription rather than transcript stability. Our results suggest that human mast cells may be a source of multiple chemokines, that glucocorticoids may inhibit the expression of only a subset of these chemokines, and that mast cells and T-cell chemokine expression may occur via distinct regulatory pathways.","['Selvan, R S', 'Butterfield, J H', 'Krangel, M S']","['Selvan RS', 'Butterfield JH', 'Krangel MS']","['Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cytokines/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/13 00:00,1994/05/13 00:01,['1994/05/13 00:00'],"['1994/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)36731-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 May 13;269(19):13893-8.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective isolation of dm DNAs with standard molecular biological techniques is difficult, and thus, detailed studies to elucidate their structure, site of chromosomal origin, and chromosomal reintegration patterns have been limited. In those instances in which a gene has been localized on dms, characterization of the remainder of the DNA, which far exceeds the size of the gene identified, has remained inconclusive, dms seen in the acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 have been shown to harbor the c-myc protooncogene. In this paper, we report the successful isolation of the dm-specific DNAs from these cells by the microdissection/polymerase chain reaction technique and demonstrate that the dm DNAs derived from a single discrete normal chromosome segment 8q24.1-q24.2 reintegrate at various specific locations in the leukemic cells. The microdissected dm DNA detects multiple abundantly expressed transcripts distinct from c-myc mRNA on Northern blots. By devising a ""transcript selection"" strategy, we cloned the partial genomic sequence of a gene from the microdissected DNA that encodes two of these RNAs. This strategy will be generally applicable for rapid cloning of unknown amplified genes harbored on dms. With DNA from 20 microdissected dms, we constructed a genomic library of about 20,000 recombinant microclones with an average insert size of about 450 bp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Sen, S', 'Sen, P', 'Mulac-Jericevic, B', 'Zhou, H', 'Pirrotta, V', 'Stass, S A']","['Sen S', 'Sen P', 'Mulac-Jericevic B', 'Zhou H', 'Pirrotta V', 'Stass SA']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['RR5511/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping/*methods', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Extrachromosomal Inheritance', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Micromanipulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(84)71104-9 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1994.1104 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1994 Feb;19(3):542-51. doi: 10.1006/geno.1994.1104.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,

Higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, or longer incubation at the hyperthermic temperature, change the mode of cell death from apoptosis to the passive necrosis. Stress treatments cause a severe drop in the intracellular NAD concentration. 3-Aminobenzamide (3-ABA), a specific inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP), a nuclear enzyme which is activated by breaks in DNA to catabolize intracellular NAD, is capable of relieving such a drop. This suggests that breaks in DNA have been induced by both oxidative stress and heat shock, thereby activating PARP. Upon stress, NAD concentration has a first initial sharp drop; then, for mild stress treatments, it recovers, just when apoptosis begins to be detectable (8 h of recovery). At 20 h, when the apoptotic ladder-like pattern of DNA is visible, NAD concentration has dropped again, probably because of a second PARP activation due to the extensive DNA degradation that accompanies apoptosis. The presence of 3-ABA, concomitantly with the preservation of the intracellular NAD content, reduces the extent of apoptosis upon oxidative stress and strongly enhances cell survival, thus suggesting a role for PARP in triggering stress-induced apoptosis. All apoptotic U937 cells have a reduced NAD content, independently of the inducing agent; however, upon treatments which do not cause immediate DNA breaks, the drop in NAD concentration occurs only after the apoptotic ladder is detectable and can be ascribed to the activation of PARP by the free ends of DNA formed during the endonucleolytic degradation. Moreover, in these instances the inhibition of PARP, although effective in blocking the drop in NAD concentration, has no effect on apoptosis, thus being only circumstantial.","['Nosseri, C', 'Coppola, S', 'Ghibelli, L']","['Nosseri C', 'Coppola S', 'Ghibelli L']","['Dipartimento di Biologia, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/*pathology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71156-6 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1156 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Jun;212(2):367-73. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1156.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The haematological findings were anaemia (mean Hgb 6.35 g%), leucocytosis (mean WBC count 88,507/mm3) and thrombocytopenia (mean platelet count 31,700/mm3). Of the patients eligible for evaluation treated with chemotherapeutic agents, only 38.4% of ALL and 6.2% of AML achieved complete remission. Twenty-seven patients with ALL died from one day to 84 (median 1.0) months after diagnosis. Ten are lost to follow-up from two weeks to 36 (median 2.5) months, one is still alive 40 months after diagnosis. Thirty-nine of the AML patients died from one day to nine (median 0.3) months after diagnosis. Five are lost to follow-up from two weeks to two and a half (median 2.0) months. The causes of death were sepsis and bleeding, separately or in combination. Increasing numbers of acute leukaemia patients are being referred to this centre. Therefore, attempts should be made to equip it for the treatment of such cases.","['Shamebo, M']",['Shamebo M'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Addis Abeba University.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ethiopia,Ethiop Med J,Ethiopian medical journal,0373223,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Ethiopia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Population Surveillance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ethiop Med J. 1994 Jan;32(1):17-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two distant relatives of ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M, mimic ciliary neurotrophic factor with respect to its actions on cells of the nervous system. In contrast to ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M also display a broad array of actions on cells outside of the nervous system. The overlapping activities of leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M and ciliary neurotrophic factor can be attributed to shared receptor components. The specificity of ciliary neurotrophic factor for cells of the nervous system results from the restricted expression of the alpha component of the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor complex, which is required to convert a functional leukemia inhibitory factor/oncostatin M receptor complex into a ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor complex. The recent observation that the alpha component of the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor complex is expressed by very early neuronal precursors suggested that ciliary neurotrophic factor may act on even earlier precursors, particularly on cells previously thought to be targets for leukemia inhibitory factor action. Here we show the first example of ciliary neurotrophic factor responsiveness in cells residing outside of the nervous system by demonstrating that embryonic stem cells express a functional ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor complex, and that ciliary neurotrophic factor is similar to leukemia inhibitory factor in its ability to maintain the pluripotentiality of these cells.","['Conover, J C', 'Ip, N Y', 'Poueymirou, W T', 'Bates, B', 'Goldfarb, M P', 'DeChiara, T M', 'Yancopoulos, G D']","['Conover JC', 'Ip NY', 'Poueymirou WT', 'Bates B', 'Goldfarb MP', 'DeChiara TM', 'Yancopoulos GD']","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York 10591.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/physiology', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Transplantation Chimera']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1993 Nov;119(3):559-65.,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '42013-48-9 (2-phenyl-5,5-dimethyltetrahydro-1,4-oxazine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells of the human promyelocytic HL-60 line, treated in vitro with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, which selectively triggers apoptosis of S-phase cells, were chosen as a model. The method based on analysis of changes in DNA denaturability was the most sensitive in terms of detection of the earliest changes in chromatin of cells undergoing apoptosis; the increased sensitivity of DNA to denaturation in S-phase cells was measured as early as 100 min after addition of camptothecin. DNA cleavage, assayed either by the univariate measurement of DNA content following extraction of low molecular weight DNA, or by labeling DNA strand breaks with biotinylated dUTP, was detected in S-phase cells after 120 min incubation with camptothecin.

An order of TCR gene rearrangements was observed in T-ALL, with the rearrangement of delta gene preceding that of gamma gene. Both genes were also found frequently rearranged and/or deleted in high proportions of the ALL of B cell lineage. However, the patterns of gene rearrangements were somewhat different between the T and B lineage ALLs. In contrast, the IgH gene rearrangements were observed only in the B lineage ALL. The immunogenotype analysis of ALL proved to be a useful marker of the clonality and provided us with important information on early human lymphoid differentiation.

The drugs are used in maximally tolerated doses, and the toxicity of the drugs precludes significant dose increments. The cellular target is the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase II which, in the presence of these drugs, causes an extensive fragmentation of DNA. The cell kill can be antagonized by distinct drug types. We have demonstrated previously that the intercalating drug aclarubicin and the cardioprotecting agent ICRF-187 antagonize the cytotoxicity of etoposide in vitro. We have studied possible ways of using this antagonism as a means of differentially protecting normal tissue. Here we demonstrate that the intercalating agent chloroquine prevents the introduction of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks and thereby antagonizes the cytotoxicity of etoposide. This interaction depends on the extracellular pH. Chloroquine, in contrast to etoposide, is a weak base and therefore does not enter the cell if the extracellular fluid is acidic, as is the case in most solid tumors. We propose that such a pH-dependent drug interaction may be useful in directing topoisomerase II drug effects toward solid tumors. Thus, by lowering the extracellular pH (pHe) from neutral (pHe = 7.4) to acidic (pHe = 6.0), [3H]chloroquine accumulation was decreased 5-fold in a human small cell lung cancer cell line, OC-NYH, and in murine leukemia L1210 cells. In parallel, the antagonism exhibited by chloroquine on etoposide cytotoxicity was pHe dependent. Thus, no protection by chloroquine was observed at pHe = 6.5, whereas at pHe = 7.4, etoposide cytotoxicity was almost completely antagonized with a 460-fold protection or more than eight doublings of the cell population.

In this work, two methods are used to increase the circulation longevity of liposomal formulations of vincristine. The first involves incorporation of the ganglioside GM1, which acts to increase the circulation longevity of liposomal carriers, while the second approach relies on a modification of the vincristine encapsulation procedure which enhances drug retention. It is shown that these approaches are synergistic and increase the circulation half-life of vincristine from approximately 1 h to greater than 12 h. This results in a dramatic improvement in the therapeutic activity of liposomal vincristine as measured using a murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia model.

The expression of GM-CSF and IL-2 is inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. Earlier studies on the IL-2 gene expression showed that overexpression of calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, can stimulate transcription from the IL-2 promoter through the NF-AT-binding site. In this study, we obtained evidence that transfection of the cDNAs for CN A (catalytic) and CN B (regulatory) subunits also augments transcription from the GM-CSF promoter and recovers the transcription inhibited by CsA. The constitutively active type of the CN A subunit, which lacks the auto-inhibitory and calmodulin-binding domains, acts in synergy with PMA to activate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter. We also found that the active CN partially replaces calcium ionophore in synergy with PMA to induce expression of endogenous GM-CSF and IL-2. By multimerizing the regulatory elements of the GM-CSF promoter, we found that one of the target sites for the CN action is the conserved lymphokine element 0 (CLE0), located at positions between -54 and -40. Mobility shift assays showed that the CLE0 sequence has an AP1-binding site and is associated with an NF-AT-like factor, termed NF-CLE0 gamma. NF-CLE0 gamma binding is induced by PMA/A23187 and is inhibited by treatment with CsA. These results suggest that CN is involved in the coordinated induction of the GM-CSF and IL-2 genes and that the CLE0 sequence of the GM-CSF gene is a functional analogue of the NF-AT-binding site in the IL-2 promoter, which mediates signals downstream of T cell activation.","['Tsuboi, A', 'Masuda, E S', 'Naito, Y', 'Tokumitsu, H', 'Arai, K', 'Arai, N']","['Tsuboi A', 'Masuda ES', 'Naito Y', 'Tokumitsu H', 'Arai K', 'Arai N']","['Department of Molecular Biology, DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, California 94304-1104.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcineurin', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.5.1.119 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1994 Jan;5(1):119-28. doi: 10.1091/mbc.5.1.119.,"['0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",,,,PMC301014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zinc concentrations of 10(-4)M do not influence the in vitro release of ROS by polymorphonuclears but moderately activate the monocytes. Following treatment with orally administered zinc aspartate, monocytes from leukemia patients reveal an increased capacity to release ROS after in vitro stimulation.

Gene transfer efficiency averaged 50% in both fetal myoblasts and adult satellite cells, as revealed by beta-gal staining. The reporter gene was stably integrated, faithfully inherited, and expressed at significant levels in myogenic cells for at least 10 generations under clonal growth conditions, and throughout the culture life span upon differentiation into myotubes. Comparable gene transfer efficiency was obtained in myogenic cells from muscle biopsies of patients affected by a number of genetic or acquired myopathies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Transduced normal human satellite cells were injected into regenerating muscle of immunodeficient mice, where they formed new muscle fibers in which the product of the reporter gene was detectable for 2 months after injection. These results show that retroviral vectors can be used to transfer foreign genes with high efficiency into normal or abnormal primary human myogenic cells, leading to stable expression into mature muscle. Satellite cells engineered in this way might represent an effective tool for gene therapy of muscular dystrophies as well as for systemic delivery of recombinant gene products for correction of inherited and acquired disorders. The human-mouse model described here will allow in vivo testing of such gene therapy approaches.","['Salvatori, G', 'Ferrari, G', 'Mezzogiorno, A', 'Servidei, S', 'Coletta, M', 'Tonali, P', 'Giavazzi, R', 'Cossu, G', 'Mavilio, F']","['Salvatori G', 'Ferrari G', 'Mezzogiorno A', 'Servidei S', 'Coletta M', 'Tonali P', 'Giavazzi R', 'Cossu G', 'Mavilio F']","['Institute of Histology, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy.']",['eng'],['A.013/Telethon/Italy'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Muscles/cytology/embryology/*metabolism', 'Muscular Diseases/therapy', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Virus Integration', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1993.4.6-713 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1993 Dec;4(6):713-23. doi: 10.1089/hum.1993.4.6-713.,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],,,,,,['&bgr;-gal'],,,,,,,,,,,

We found that IL-4 and IFN-gamma, but not IL-2, production by stimulated HUT78 cells was inhibited by TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 1 also reduced the accumulation of IL-4 and IFN-gamma specific mRNA in stimulated HUT78 cells. However, IL-2 and IL-7 co-stimulated IL-4 and IFN-gamma production, whereas IL-1, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor had no effect. Because IL-2 is an important helper cytokine for the production of IL-4 and IFN-gamma, we investigated whether signal transduction through the IL-2 receptor is impaired by TGF-beta 1. We found that tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-2 in HUT78 cells was strongly inhibited by a short preincubation with TGF-beta 1. Evidence for an antagonistic role for TGF-beta 1 and IL-2 comes from the finding that high doses of IL-2 could partially overcome TGF-beta 1 mediated inhibition of IL-4 and IFN-gamma production. Similar to its effect on HUT78 cells, TGF-beta 1 also inhibited IL-4 and IFN-gamma production by freshly isolated T cells as well as by human T cell clones. Taken together, our experiments show that the IL-2 dependent cytokines IL-4 and IFN-gamma are both negatively controlled by TGF-beta under conditions where IL-2 production is unaffected by a mechanism which partially involves an inhibition of IL-2/IL-2R signal transduction. These data identify TGF-beta and IL-2 as mutual antagonists in the regulation of IL-4 and IFN-gamma production.","['Holter, W', 'Kalthoff, F S', 'Pickl, W F', 'Ebner, C', 'Majdic, O', 'Kraft, D', 'Knapp, W']","['Holter W', 'Kalthoff FS', 'Pickl WF', 'Ebner C', 'Majdic O', 'Kraft D', 'Knapp W']","['Institute of Immunology-Vienna International Research Cooperation Center at SFI, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/6.3.469 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1994 Mar;6(3):469-75. doi: 10.1093/intimm/6.3.469.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the effect of extracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) on the cytotoxicity and biochemical pharmacology of tetraplatin in L1210 leukemia cells. Parent L1210/0 cells were exposed to tetraplatin for 2 hr with or without GSH in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and cytotoxicity was assessed by a soft agar clonogenic assay. GSH (10 or 100 microM) increased tetraplatin (10 microM)-induced cell kill by about 2 logs; concentrations of the thiol 10-fold below or above these levels increased cell kill to a lesser degree. GSH-mediated increases in the cytotoxicity of tetraplatin were also observed against cisplatin-resistant L1210/DDP and tetraplatin-resistant L1210/DACH cells. An equimolar concentration of 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-platinum(II) dichloride [DACH-Pt(II)Cl2] alone was as cytotoxic as the combination of tetraplatin and GSH. Intracellular accumulations of tetraplatin in both L1210/0 and L1210/DDP cells were increased by GSH, whereas in L1210/DACH cells platinum uptake decreased in the presence of the thiol. Reactions between tetraplatin and salmon sperm DNA in the presence or absence of GSH (1 or 100 microM), performed at 37 degrees in HBSS, revealed that levels of total and interstrand DNA-platinum adducts were minimal in the absence of GSH, whereas in the presence of GSH DNA adducts of tetraplatin were substantial and similar to those seen with DACH-Pt(II)Cl2. Tetraplatin (10 microM) incubated at 37 degrees in HBSS with GSH (10 microM-1 mM) was reduced chemically to the DACH-Pt(II) species within 5 min; a 200-microM tetraplatin solution required a GSH concentration of at least 100 microM for substantial reduction to occur. This chemical reduction of tetraplatin appears to be a prerequisite for its biological activity. Thus, extracellular GSH can modulate the biological activity of tetraplatin, and the combination may prove useful in specific clinical applications, such as intracavitary platinum therapy.","['Kido, Y', 'Khokhar, A R', 'Siddik, Z H']","['Kido Y', 'Khokhar AR', 'Siddik ZH']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA-41581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-50380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biotransformation/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutathione/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/29 00:00,1994/04/29 00:01,['1994/04/29 00:00'],"['1994/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)90542-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90542-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Apr 29;47(9):1635-42. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90542-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '52691-24-4 (dichloro-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum complex)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A time-course experiment showed that DNA single-strand breaks preceded DNA double-strand breaks. Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA extracted from selenite-treated cells displayed a nucleosomal fragmentation pattern that is characteristic of apoptotic cell death. The involvement of a Ca2+,Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease responsible for DNA double-strand fragmentation was implied by the observation that two inhibitors of endonuclease activity, i.e. aurintricarboxylic acid and zinc, blocked selenite-induced DNA double-strand breaks. These inhibitors also prevented selenite-induced cell death as defined by loss of ability to exclude trypan blue dye. Selenite treatment severely impaired the colony-forming ability of cells capable of trypan blue exclusion.

A range of problems prevent their clinical application, however, because each specific cancer may not yet have a known unique antigen. In turn, this serves to impede the development of specific antibodies. Regarding thyroid cancer, no reports of targeted therapy have appeared since specific antigens remain to be identified. Monoclonal antibodies A2B5, HISL-19 and 4F2 bind to neuroendocrine tumors (A2B5, HISL-19) and severe malignant tumors (4F2) indicating rapid growth, enabling these tumors to express common anti-genetic determinants to our monoclonal antibodies. The immunohistochemical study for thyroid cancers revealed that A2B5 and HISL-19 only react with medullary carcinoma and that 4F2 only reacts with anaplastic carcinoma. When 131I-labeled A2B5 was injected into the rat bearing insulinoma, the antigen of which is common to medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, clear accumulation of radiolabeled antibody corresponding to the transplanted tumor was observed by scintiscanning. Furthermore, the biochemical study undertaken to identify anti-genetic protein using the Western blotting procedure demonstrated new HISL-19 antigen in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, which is not recognized in benign endocrine tumor, and 4F2 antigen in anaplastic carcinoma. Since these antigens do not circulate in the blood stream, the administered antibody reaches the targeted lesion without decreasing antibody titer. Although many problems remain, such as the effect on normal cells and affinity to the targeted lesion, our current aim is to establish an efficient and effective chemotherapy using monoclonal antibodies in medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma arising in the thyroid.","['Shimizu, K', 'Mimura, T', 'Harada, T', 'Tanaka, S']","['Shimizu K', 'Mimura T', 'Harada T', 'Tanaka S']","['Second Dept. of Surgery, Nippon Medical School.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Recent reports demonstrated that ionizing radiation in the dose range of 2-50 Gy results in expression of NF-kappa B in human KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells and human B-lymphocyte precursor cells; the precise mechanism involved and the significance are not yet known. The present report demonstrates that even lower doses of ionizing radiation, 0.25-2.0 Gy, are capable of inducing expression of NF-kappa B in EBV-transformed 244B human lymphoblastoid cells. These results are in a dose range where the viability of the cells remains very high. After exposure to 137Cs gamma rays at a dose rate of 1.17 Gy/min, a maximum in expression of NF-kappa B was seen at 8 h after a 0.5-Gy exposure.

This analysis was done for myeloid leukemia and for the presence of selected solid tumors. Myeloid leukemia was absent in the control group and was rarely found in irradiated animals. However, a positive significant trend was found in the dose ranges 0-0.17 Gy and higher. Epithelial tumors were induced at doses from 0.17 Gy on. Tumor occurrence was evaluated further as final incidences with age adjustment for the differences in mortality rates. Survival and incidence data for selected classes of tumors after 0.17, 0.36 and 0.71 Gy were compared with those from a previous experiment at corresponding doses given acutely (dose rate between 0.05 and 0.25 Gy/min).

All-cause mortality was 19% lower than national rates among workers monitored for external radiation exposure and 18% lower among nonmonitored workers. Cancer mortality was also lower than national rates and was similar in the two groups of workers [rate ratio (RR) = 0.96]. Of 29 specific cancer sites examined, only for cancers of the pleura and uterus were there statistically significant excesses of mortality in monitored workers relative to nonmonitored workers [RR = 7.08, two-sided P (2P) = 0.008 and RR = 3.02, 2P = 0.003, respectively]. There was little association between cumulative external radiation and risk of death from all cancers combined 10 or more years after exposure [z for trend = +0.11, one-sided P (1P) = 0.5]. A positive association was observed for leukemia (assuming a 2-year lag between external radiation and increasing risk of death) (1P = 0.009) but not for other cancers associated with external radiation in previous analyses (lung, uterus, prostate and multiple myeloma, all 1P > or = 0.1). Positive associations (1P < or = 0.05) were also observed for melanoma and other skin cancers (1P = 0.03) and ill-defined and secondary cancers (1P = 0.04), but these results are difficult to interpret and, given the number of associations examined, may be chance findings. Estimates of excess relative risk per sievert were -0.02 (95% CI = -0.5-+0.6) for all cancers except leukemia and +4.18 for leukemia (95% CI = +0.4-+13.4). The positive estimates for leukemia contrast with negative values found for workers in the United States, although the confidence intervals obtained in the two studies overlap. While our estimates of risk are compatible with those derived from studies of A-bomb survivors, the statistical uncertainty associated with them is such that the data are consistent with risks ranging from no additional risk to twice the risk for cancers other than leukemia and, for leukemia, from one-fifth to three times the risk in A-bomb survivors.","['Carpenter, L', 'Higgins, C', 'Douglas, A', 'Fraser, P', 'Beral, V', 'Smith, P']","['Carpenter L', 'Higgins C', 'Douglas A', 'Fraser P', 'Beral V', 'Smith P']","['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk', 'United Kingdom']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1994 May;138(2):224-38.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major drawback of cord blood has been the risk of transfusion reactions in ABO blood group incompatibility and drastic reduction in the stem cell pool if the cord blood is manipulated to remove red cells prior to cryopreservation or after thawing. This report describes an erythrocyte depletion method employing 3% gelatin-induced erythrocyte sedimentation for the selective removal of red cells from cord blood. The red cell-depleted fraction was shown to be enriched in progenitor cells and in cells secreting hematopoietic cytokines interleukin 3, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin 6; a major source for cytokines was from cord T cells. This preparative technique was employed to separate out red cells from cord blood of an infant delivered by cesarean section who had an 8-year-old sibling with leukemia. Histocompatibility testing of cord cells revealed complete matching with the patient. A cord cell transplant of cryopreserved and thawed cells consisting of 4 x 10(7) nucleated cells per kg was administered to the patient following myeloablative chemotherapy. The patient's quick hematologic recovery and 9-month disease-free period to date suggest that 3% gelatin separation of erythrocytes is a simple method that can be successfully used for transplanting cord cells for malignant/nonmalignant diseases.","['Pahwa, R N', 'Fleischer, A', 'Than, S', 'Good, R A']","['Pahwa RN', 'Fleischer A', 'Than S', 'Good RA']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Schneider Children's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center, NY.""]",['eng'],"['AG05628-09/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 128281/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 11124/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Cesarean Section', 'Child', 'Female', '*Fetal Blood', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Platelet Count', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",1994/05/10 00:00,1994/05/10 00:01,['1994/05/10 00:00'],"['1994/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.10.4485 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 May 10;91(10):4485-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.10.4485.,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],,,,PMC43810,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used M1 myeloid leukemia cells and genetically engineered M1 variants as a model system to study apoptosis induced by two distinct apoptotic stimuli. This includes apoptosis induced by activation of wild type p53 function of a temperature sensitive p53 transgene expressed in M1 cells, which do not express endogenous p53, and apoptosis induced by TGF beta 1. It is shown that the kinetics of apoptosis induced by p53 is more rapid than apoptosis induced by TGF beta 1. It is also shown that ectopic expression of Bcl-2, at levels which blocked TGF beta 1-induced apoptosis of M1 cells, delayed, but did not block, p53-induced apoptosis. Both p53 and TGF beta 1 down-regulated endogenous Bcl-2 expression, but only p53 up-regulated Bax expression, where bax has been identified as a p53 immediate early response gene. Thus, the p53-mediated up-regulation of Bax may provide at least a partial explanation for the more rapid rate of apoptosis induced by p53 compared to by TGF beta 1, as well as for the ineffectiveness of ectopoic Bcl-2 to abrogate p53-mediated apoptosis. These findings provide first insights to the molecular mechanisms which mediate p53-induced apoptosis, identifying bax and bcl-2 as p53 regulated genes, and serve as a paradigm of how the intracellular balance of Bcl-2 to Bax is differentially altered by distinct death stimuli.","['Selvakumaran, M', 'Lin, H K', 'Miyashita, T', 'Wang, H G', 'Krajewski, S', 'Reed, J C', 'Hoffman, B', 'Liebermann, D']","['Selvakumaran M', 'Lin HK', 'Miyashita T', 'Wang HG', 'Krajewski S', 'Reed JC', 'Hoffman B', 'Liebermann D']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140.']",['eng'],"['1RO1CA43618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA51162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genes, p53/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Jun;9(6):1791-8.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,"['bax', 'bcl-2', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,

Since homeodomains mediate DNA-binding, a potential model for the action of E2A-PBX1 is that it disrupts the transcriptional regulation of genes normally controlled by PBX1 or its closely-related family members PBX2 or PBX3. Using a binding site selection assay, we identified a consensus nucleotide sequence ATCAATCA specifically bound by the PBX1 homeodomain and those of its closely-related family members PBX2 and PBX3. An endogenous protein with the properties of PBX3b specifically bound to this sequence in nuclear extracts of precursor B cells. Transfection of reporter genes containing PBX binding sites linked to a minimal promoter demonstrated transactivation by E2A-PBX1 fusion protein dependent upon presence of the homeodomain.

To gain understanding of eps15 function as well as its role in normal and neoplastic proliferation, we cloned the human eps15 coding sequence and studied expression of the human RNA and protein, evolutionary conservation, and chromosomal location. The close structural similarity of human eps15 with the murine homologue is indicated by 89% and 90% identity of nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences, respectively. Using the human eps15 coding sequence as probe, we demonstrate that eps15 is member of a gene family that is highly conserved during evolution. An essential function of eps15 in cell growth regulation is underscored by our observation of ubiquitous expression at the transcript and the protein level in normal and malignant human cells.

The first domain binds a consensus sequence of GA(C/T)AAGATAAGATAA in binding and amplication reactions or GATA repeat containing regions of genomic DNA. The experiments described here, establish a consensus sequence for the carboxyl domain of zinc fingers consisting of GAAGATGAG. Unlike the first domain, the consensus sequence established for the carboxyl domain is identical to that which would be predicted by the current rules relating to C2H2 zinc fingers and DNA recognition. Substitution of sequences in finger 8 with those in finger 9, demonstrate that the individual fingers bind the predicted region of the consensus sequence. In an attempt to engineer binding of constructs containing the carboxyl domain, a variety of mutations were made in the middle finger that would be predicted to change the consensus sequence in specific ways.

Nevertheless, up to 17% of cases of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia may have a preleukemic phase. In young patients, the goal of treatment is eradication of the preleukemic malignant clone and reconstitution of normal hematopoiesis. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has proved to be capable of this, but the optimal conditioning treatment to achieve eradication remains to be defined. Between May 1989 and June 1993, eight consecutive pediatric patients with MDS received a marrow transplant from an HLA-identical, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) non-reactive sibling. Diagnosis at time of presentation was refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) in two patients, RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) in three, and juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML, the pediatric counterpart of adult chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) in the remaining three children. Conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan, cyclophosphamide and melphalan, three alkylating agents potentially capable of killing also dormant preleukemic stem cells. The preparative regimen was very well tolerated, and all patients engrafted promptly. Six out of eight patients (75%) are alive and well with a median observation time of 20 months (range 8-34 months). Serial karyotype monitoring and molecular analyses have demonstrated a full chimerism of donor cells and the complete disappearance of trisomy 8 detected before transplant in three cases. All surviving patients have a Karnofsky score of 100%. One boy, affected by RAEB-t with monosomy 7 resistant to treatment with low-dose ara-C, relapsed 11 months after BMT, evolved in AML and died from progressive leukemia. Another patient with RAEB died on day +95 after BMT due to interstitial pneumonia of unclear etiology. This study confirms that allogeneic BMT is the treatment of choice in pediatric patients with MDS, and suggests that the employed conditioning regimen is a safe and effective means for eradicating the preleukemic malignant clone. Particularly noteworthy is that the three children with JCML obtained a complete remission and one of them is now a long-term survivor.","['Locatelli, F', 'Pession, A', 'Bonetti, F', 'Maserati, E', 'Prete, L', 'Pedrazzoli, P', 'Zecca, M', 'Prete, A', 'Paolucci, P', 'Cazzola, M']","['Locatelli F', 'Pession A', 'Bonetti F', 'Maserati E', 'Prete L', 'Pedrazzoli P', 'Zecca M', 'Prete A', 'Paolucci P', 'Cazzola M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Preleukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):844-9.,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plasma from those T-ALL patients with a high R24-positive lymphoblast count (> 60,000/mm3) had a significant increase in total GD3 and each of the GD3 subspecies groups, and a disproportionate increase in GD3L resulted in an increased ratio GD3L/GD3U in these samples. In contrast, total GD3, GD3 subspecies, and GD3L/GD3U was not increased in plasma from those cases with low R24-positive blast count (< 20,000/mm3) or in pre-B ALL plasma. The altered GD3 content in R24-positive T-ALL plasma was reversible, since total GD3 and GD3L/GD3U in plasma from a patient in remission from R24-positive T-ALL was near that of controls. Resorcinol staining of TLC-separated gangliosides confirmed the results observed with R24 detection methods. The results strongly suggest that GD3 is shed in vivo from T-ALL blasts in patients with R24-positive T-ALL, resulting in both qualitative and quantitative changes in circulating GD3 in these patients.","['Merritt, W D', 'Der-Minassian, V', 'Reaman, G H']","['Merritt WD', 'Der-Minassian V', 'Reaman GH']","[""Center for Cancer and Transplantation Biology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C. 20010.""]",['eng'],"['R03-CA53543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R10-CA13539-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Child', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Gangliosides/*blood/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):816-22.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '62010-37-1 (ganglioside, GD3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells treated with 5 nM D3 showed little response, but differentiated maximally with 5 nM D3 and 10 nM RA. The D3 analogs MC903, EB1089 and KH1060 were more potent inducers of monocyte differentiation. The extent to which analog activity was increased after cotreatment with RA was inversely related to potency. Twenty-four hour treatment with 10 nM RA primed cells for response to 5 nM D3; the reverse sequence being ineffective. Priming with 10 nM RA, or subsequent treatment with D3 (5 nM), did not alter expression of mRNAs encoding receptors for D3 (VDR), RA (RAR alpha) or 9-CIS RA (RXR alpha, beta, gamma). That RA promotes both neutrophil and monocyte differentiation has implications for the use of RA and D3 in treatment of leukemias and provides insight into mechanisms whereby RAR, VDR and RXR facilitate monocyte differentiation.","['Brown, G', 'Bunce, C M', 'Rowlands, D C', 'Williams, G R']","['Brown G', 'Bunce CM', 'Rowlands DC', 'Williams GR']","['Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Calcitriol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):806-15.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to its inflammatory effects, MIP-1 alpha inhibits proliferation of immature hematopoietic progenitors both in vitro and in vivo. Because the gene coding for MIP-1 alpha is expressed in peripheral blood cells obtained from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we sought to evaluate the effect of MIP-1 alpha on AML precursors. We studied bone marrow samples from 21 AML patients using both the AML blast colony assay and the delta suspension culture assay. We found that recombinant human (rh) MIP-1 alpha significantly inhibits early and mature AML progenitors with sample-to-sample variability, by up to 79% at concentrations ranging from 40 to 1600 ng/ml. These results were obtained in the presence of fetal calf serum either alone or with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or interleukin-3. In contrast, rhMIP-1 alpha (400 ng/ml) did not significantly affect normal colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), or burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) proliferation. These data prompted us to delineate the inhibitory mechanism of MIP-1 alpha. Consequently, we used the thymidine suicide technique to measure DNA synthesis in AML progenitors and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to quantify intracellular levels of interleukin-1 beta in AML blasts following incubation with MIP-1 alpha. We found that whereas MIP-1 alpha prevented AML progenitors from entering the proliferative phase of the cell cycle, it had no effect on interleukin-1 beta levels. Taken together, our data suggest that MIP-1 alpha may have clinical benefits in therapy for AML and should be considered for evaluation in a clinical setting.","['Ferrajoli, A', 'Talpaz, M', 'Zipf, T F', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg, C', 'Estey, E', 'Wolpe, S D', 'Estrov, Z']","['Ferrajoli A', 'Talpaz M', 'Zipf TF', 'Hirsch-Ginsberg C', 'Estey E', 'Wolpe SD', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['CA 5516401A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Child', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monokines/*pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):798-805.,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we studied further the effects of TPA alone on the induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Based on morphology by electron microscopy, identification of internucleosomal DNA cleavage by gel electrophoresis and quantitation of DNA fragmentation by a filter binding assay, we observed that neither morphologic changes nor DNA damage were identified in TPA-differentiated HL-60 cells as long as they kept the adherent phenotype characteristic of this differentiation pathway. However, adherent TPA-treated HL-60 cells that secondarily detached from the flask demonstrated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation associated with morphologic changes characteristic of apoptosis. Similarly, HL-60 cells that never became adherent after TPA treatment underwent rapid apoptosis. Granulocytic differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) treatment also induced apoptosis although more slowly. Interestingly, in both TPA- and RA-treated cells, apoptotic bodies appeared to be phagocytosed by differentiated cells from the same lineage. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was also identified in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate by sodium butyrate and dimethylsulfoxide treatment, suggesting that apoptosis could be the common mode of death of terminally differentiated HL-60 cells.","['Solary, E', 'Bertrand, R', 'Pommier, Y']","['Solary E', 'Bertrand R', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):792-7.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some malignant cells bcl-2 expression has been demonstrated to be regulated by specific trophic factors which act to suppress apoptosis. Here we have investigated the effect of exogenous and autocrine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on both bcl-2 expression and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. Blasts from 31 patients with AML were studied, this included 21 patients whose cells exhibited variable degrees of autonomous growth in culture and ten patients with non-autonomous growth. Blasts with autonomous growth expressed significantly higher levels of bcl-2 protein, the intensity of fluorescence expressed as soluble fluorochrome per cell was 40.9 +/- 3.6 x 10(3) (mean +/- SD); this compared with an intensity of bcl-2 expression of 19.3 +/- 2.4 x 10(3) for blasts with non-autocrine growth (p < 0.0001 by Mann-Whitney analysis). Blasts with non-autocrine growth rapidly lost viability following 48 h of culture due to the onset of apoptosis. In these cells apoptosis was suppressed by the addition of GM-CSF and bcl-2 protein expression was found to be significantly upregulated. In contrast blasts from patients with autonomous growth and autocrine GM-CSF production failed to show any features of apoptosis in culture. In these cells bcl-2 expression was significantly downregulated following neutralization of autocrine GM-CSF by antibodies. We conclude that bcl-2 expression in AML cells is regulated by GM-CSF, and suggest that the previously demonstrated negative prognostic effect of autocrine growth as a determinant of treatment outcome in AML is in part due to the effect of autocrine GM-CSF in upregulating bcl-2 expression.","['Bradbury, D', 'Zhu, Y M', 'Russell, N']","['Bradbury D', 'Zhu YM', 'Russell N']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Up-Regulation']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):786-91.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is uncertain whether morphologically undetectable leukemia is present in the bone marrow at the time of CNS relapse, or whether the CNS acts as a 'sanctuary' site to allow reseeding of the marrow at a later time. We examined DNA from bone marrow samples from six patients with T-cell ALL with isolated CNS relapse using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect minimal residual disease. One of these PCR assays was based on amplification of leukemia-specific TCR-delta gene rearrangements, while the other assay relied upon detection of the c-tal deletion. In four patients, where bone marrow samples were taken at the time of CNS relapse, residual disease was detectable in every sample at a level below morphological detection. In addition, three patients had residual disease detected in their subsequent bone marrow when CNS disease was not evident. Our findings, although preliminary, suggest that relapse of leukemia in the CNS reflects resurgence of the disease in the bone marrow that is first detected clinically in the CNS. The concomitant molecular detection of bone marrow leukemia at time of 'isolated' CNS relapse in children with T-cell ALL explains subsequent bone marrow relapse in some of these children, and argues for intensive systemic therapy of these patients.","['Neale, G A', 'Pui, C H', 'Mahmoud, H H', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Crist, W M', 'Rivera, G K', 'Goorha, R M']","['Neale GA', 'Pui CH', 'Mahmoud HH', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Crist WM', 'Rivera GK', 'Goorha RM']","[""Dept of Virology and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recurrence', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",1994/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):768-75.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighteen of the 26 AMLs tested (70%) were susceptible to normal LAK cells, and nine of the 13 cases studied (70%) were also lysed by autologous LAK effectors generated at CR.

""Illegitimate"" rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene and incomplete rearrangements involving V delta 2 and D delta 3 segments of the T-cell receptor delta (TcR delta) gene are seen in some cases of AML, and AML post-SMD, and can be detected by a sensitive PCR method. In order to analyse clonality in additional cases in MDS, we looked for Ig H and TcR delta gene rearrangement by PCR in 95 cases of MDS.

Twenty-five of the 90 cases of MDS with negative PCR findings, in addition to the five cases with positive PCR findings underwent Southern blot analysis of Ig H and TcR delta genes, and PCR analysis of V delta 1 and J delta 1 segments of the TcR delta gene.

In patients with positive PCR findings for Ig H or V delta 2 D delta 3 rearrangements, the proportion of rearranged cells was evaluated at 1-5% in four cases, and 5-10% in the remaining patient. Because the analysis was performed on total circulating leukocytes or total nucleated marrow cells, the nature of the clonal population in positive cases (lymphoid cells? myeloid cells? blasts?) could not be determined.

Peripheral mononuclear cells (PMC) from most patients with acute leukemia in complete remission (CR) do not exhibit cytotoxic activity against fresh-frozen ATC, although they have adequate cytotoxic activity against K562 cells. When the large granular lymphocyte (LGL) fraction was used in this study, we observed lysis of ATC in 17 (43.6%) of 39 patients with acute leukemia (12 (42.9%) of the 28 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 5 (45.5%) of the 11 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)). With regard to prognosis, the lytic activity of the LGL fraction did not reflect the duration of CR. The median CR duration in AML patients was 13 months for the lysis-positive group and 11 months for the lysis-negative group. No significant correlation was also found between lytic activity of the LGL fraction and overall survival in each patient. However, the lysis-positive group tended to have a longer survival, the median overall survival being 48 months for the lysis-positive group vs 12 months for the lysis-negative group. The prolonging of overall survival in the lysis-positive group was attributed to a high rate of induction of second remissions in this group.

In this study, a high-sensitivity immunofluorescence technique is used to determine the expression of a number of cytokine receptors on a total of 115 leukaemic samples. The results show that many leukaemic samples express low levels of cytokine receptors, and that malignancies of a particular type are heterogeneous with respect to receptor expression. In vitro culture experiments show, as expected, that receptor expression is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for responsiveness to cytokines.

To investigate whether this effect is mediated by direct contact or through the action of soluble factors, using a method we have recently described, the growth parameters of ALL bone marrow blast cells from eight newly diagnosed patients were determined with the lipophilic fluorescent probe PKH 26 GL. The viability of ALL cells and the rate of cell division in cultures containing either medium alone; stromal cell conditioned medium; stromal cell layers allowing direct contact, or in 0.4 microns microporous membrane cultures suspended above stromal cell layers were examined. In all eight samples an improved maintenance of ALL cells in a viable state in cultures containing bone marrow stromal cells was observed. The survival of leukaemic cells was equivalent in 0.4 microns microporous membrane cultures suspended above stromal cell layers and in cultures of leukaemic cells in direct contact with stromal cell layers. It was thus demonstrated that this effect was mediated by the action of soluble factor(s) present in these cultures. However, the improved maintenance of ALL cells in a viable state was observed in only one of the eight cases when ALL cells were cultured in stromal cell conditioned medium alone. The highest rate of cell division of leukaemic cells was observed in ALL cells in direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells. The activities of stromal cell derived soluble factors could not be reproduced by recombinant forms of likely candidate factors including IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, SCF, TNF alpha, TGF beta, LIF, NGF or a mixture of these factors when examined in cultures of the same patient samples.

Results show that there are six distinct reproducibly phosphorylated proteins referred to as Pp1-Pp6 identifiable in the basal patterns of the resting granulocytes.

This study shows that human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMo) also respond to MDHM with increases in IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha expression, both at the mRNA and protein level. The induced expression of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA in the monocytic THP-1 cell line increased as quickly as in primary cells. In contrast to PBMo, THP-1 and 14 other monocytic/myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines did not secrete measurable amounts of the cytokines upon treatment with MDHM. IL-1 beta and IL-6 genes contain AP-1 binding sites as regulatory elements, the AP-1 protein being composed of c-jun and c-fos gene products. In THP-1 cells c-jun mRNA expression increased after incubation with MDHM while positive c-fos expression remained unaffected. Although these data suggest AP-1 regulated cytokine mRNA expression, results from PBMo are not in accordance with this notion. In the primary cells MDHM-induced elevation of cytokine mRNA levels was preceded by a downregulation of c-fos expression while positive c-jun expression was not modulated. c-myc mRNA expression, constitutively high in THP-1 cells, was induced in MDHM-stimulated PBMo. In conclusion, MDHM-stimulated induction of cytokine mRNA expression was accompanied by different proto-oncogene responses in PBMo and THP-1 cells. These differences may represent different regulatory pathways of the two cell systems. Alternatively, these data support the notion that neither AP-1 nor the c-myc protein are involved in the MDHM-induced increase in IL-1 beta, IL-6 or TNF alpha mRNA levels. Furthermore, the present results demonstrate clearly that mycoplasma products can have a profound impact on the activation status of eukaryotic cells.","['Quentmeier, H', 'Schumann-Kindel, G', 'Muhlradt, P F', 'Drexler, H G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Schumann-Kindel G', 'Muhlradt PF', 'Drexler HG']","['DSM-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Mycoplasma fermentans', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90015-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 May;18(5):319-25. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90015-9.,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with this benign condition live many years after treatment and are at risk for late effects. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to investigate the risk of death from cancer following radiotherapy for peptic ulcer. METHODS: A mortality study was conducted of 3609 patients with peptic ulcer; 1831 were treated with radiation and 1778 were treated by other means. Extensive methods were used to trace patients. Radiation doses to specific organs were reconstructed from the original radiotherapy records. RESULTS: Nearly 70% of patients were found to have died. The average period of observation was 21.5 years (maximum 51 years). Compared with the general population, patients treated with or without radiation were at significantly increased risk of dying of cancer and non-malignant diseases of the digestive system. Risk of death due to heart disease was slightly higher following radiotherapy. Cancers of the stomach, pancreas, lung, and prostate were increased in both irradiated and nonirradiated patients. Radiotherapy was linked to significantly high relative risks (RRs) for all cancers combined (RR = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-1.8), for cancers of the stomach (RR = 2.77; 95% CI = 1.6-4.8), pancreas (RR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.0-3.4), and lung (RR = 1.70; 95% CI = 1.2-2.4), and for leukemia (RR = 3.28; 95% CI = 1.0-10.6). Radiation combined with surgery, or given to treat gastric ulcer, appeared to increase the risk of stomach cancer 10-fold, which was greater than the sum of individual effects. Patients with gastric ulcers were at higher risk for stomach cancer than patients with duodenal ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with peptic ulcer are at increased risk of dying of cancer, related in part to lifestyle factors and treatment. Radiotherapy and surgery together appear to induce carcinogenic processes that greatly enhance the development of stomach cancer. The risk of radiation-induced stomach cancer was 0.25 extra deaths per 10,000 persons per year per Gy, somewhat lower than reported in other studies. High-dose radiation may have increased the risk of pancreatic cancer, a condition rarely found elevated in irradiated populations, but misclassified death notices may have contributed to the excess. Cancer mortality remained high for up to 50 years, indicating that radiation damage may persist to the end of life.","['Griem, M L', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Stovall, M', 'Shefner, D', 'Lubin, J H']","['Griem ML', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Stovall M', 'Shefner D', 'Lubin JH']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Chicago, Ill 60637.']",['eng'],"['N01CP41011/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CP85604/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CP95614/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Peptic Ulcer/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk Factors']",1994/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/86.11.842 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Jun 1;86(11):842-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.11.842.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 42 platinum(II) complexes having a seven-membered ring structure in this series have been prepared and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, FAB-MS, and elemental analysis. All members of the series were designed to have a 1,3-dioxolane ring moiety in their carrier ligands to increase water solubility. The solubility of platinum complexes was related to the nature of leaving ligands and 2-substituents in the 4,5-bis(aminomethyl)-1,3-dioxolane carrier ligands. In general, compounds having two different R1 and R2 substituents in the 4,5-bis(aminomethyl)-1,3-dioxolane moiety were more water-soluble than those having the same substituents. Most members of this series showed the excellent antitumor activity against murine L1210 leukemia cells transplanted in mice and were superior to cisplatin and carboplatin. The (4R,5R)-stereoisomer 1a-h exhibited the higher antitumor activity than the corresponding (4S,5S)-stereoisomer 2a-h in the (1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) complexes. The (glycolato)-platinum(II) complexes were highly cytotoxic toward four human stomach cancer cell lines, SNU-1, SNU-5, SNU-16, and NCI-N87, and among them, complexes 3d-g were even more cytotoxic than cisplatin. The (malonato)platinum(II) complex 1m and the (glycolato)platinum(II) complexes 3d-g were selected for further studies based on the greater in vivo and in vitro antitumor activity and desirable physical properties. The complexes 3e-g were almost equally cytotoxic to cisplatin toward human stomach cancer cell lines, KATO-III and MKN-45, and a human non-small cell lung cancer cell line, PC14. In contrast with cisplatin and carboplatin, five complexes selected significantly increased in life span in mice transplanted with cisplatin-resistant L1210 cells.

Qualitative and quantitative differences in the mediation of early and late cellular response.,14575-83,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a 17-kDa protein produced by monocytes and a wide variety of other cell types in response to endotoxin and other cytokines. In contrast, lymphotoxin (LT) is a 25-kDa glycoprotein produced only by lymphocytes activated by mitogens. These two cytokines are 28% identical in their amino acid sequences. As they have common cell surface receptors, it is generally assumed that all cellular responses mediated through TNF are also mediated by LT and vice versa. In this report we tested this assumption, comparing the effect of TNF and LT on mediation of early (activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B) and late (reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium, NBT) cellular responses in the human myelomonoblastic leukemic cell line ML-1a. Both qualitative and quantitative differences were found. LT was found to display 5-10 times more potent antiproliferative effects against murine fibroblasts than TNF. However, in ML-1a cells at concentrations wherein TNF activated NF-kappa B, LT did not. Higher concentrations (1,000-10,000 fold) of LT could activate NF-kappa B, but the activated complex was short lived (less than 1 h versus greater than 6 h when activated by TNF) and required longer treatment (15 min versus less than 5 min). TNF induced NBT-reducing activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas LT was essentially inactive. Since both TNF and LT have been shown to bind to a common receptor, we tested whether the TNF-induced effects could be blocked by LT. LT inhibited both the early and late TNF-mediated cellular responses. By using receptor-blocking antibodies we found that both p60 and p80 forms of TNF receptors were functional for NBT-reducing activity, but TNF-dependent NF-kappa B activation required only the p60 receptor. Furthermore, we found that both TNF and LT bound with higher affinity to the p80 than to the p60 receptor. Thus, our overall results indicate that there are qualitative and quantitative differences in the action of TNF and LT, and these could be noted quite early in their signaling.","['Chaturvedi, M M', 'LaPushin, R', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Chaturvedi MM', 'LaPushin R', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.

Bone Marrow Transplantation Team.,309-18,"The impact of prophylaxis with 400 mg/day fluconazole on fungal colonization at different body sites was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study among patients with leukaemia and those undergoing bone marrow transplantation. The study drug was given throughout the period of neutropenia and samples were obtained at weekly intervals. Of the 23 patients in each group, 11 of those given fluconazole and 12 placebo recipients were colonized at entry. The commonest sites were the oropharynx and rectum and Candida albicans was the most frequent isolate. Fluconazole led to a marked reduction in colonization by the second week of treatment to 29% compared with 68% for those given the placebo. Two-weeks after stopping the study regimen there was little change with yeast being isolated from 33% and 81% respectively. Fluconazole was particularly effective in reducing the carriage of C. albicans in the oropharynx from 46% to 0-10% and in maintaining this throughout prophylaxis. Recovery of Candida (Torulopsis) glabrata from the perianal region steadily increased to around 30% in both patient groups and while Candida krusei species were found exclusively in patients given fluconazole, other candida were more common in the placebo group. These results demonstrate that by rapidly reducing the colonization of the alimentary tract, fluconazole eliminates the major reservoir for infection with yeasts other than C. glabrata and C. krusei during the critical period of neutropenia.","['Chandrasekar, P H', 'Gatny, C M']","['Chandrasekar PH', 'Gatny CM']","['Infectious Diseases/Hematology-Oncology Liaison Unit, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Candida/isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/prevention & control', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mycoses/prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/complications/*microbiology', 'Oropharynx/*microbiology', 'Premedication', 'Rectum/*microbiology', 'Yeasts/*isolation & purification']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jac/33.2.309 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 1994 Feb;33(2):309-18. doi: 10.1093/jac/33.2.309.,['8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methods used in sequence were DEAE cellulose chromatography, sephadex G-200 gel filtration, hydroxylapatite ion-exchange and affinity chromatography on sepharose CL-6B. The recovery of enzyme was 60%. The purified enzyme showed optimal pH at 8.0 and optimal temperature at 50 degrees C. The Km value of purified enzyme was 1.8 x 10(-5) M. LD50 of purified enzyme in mice by intravenous route was 4,80,000 IU/Kg and repeated treatment at 20,000 IU/Kg by intravenous route did not elicit bone marrow depression or damage to intestinal mucosa. The plasma half life was 14-24 hours and clearance time was 4-5 hours. Purified enzyme shows significant antitumor activity on experimental animal models.","['Maladkar, N K', 'Singh, V K', 'Naik, S R']","['Maladkar NK', 'Singh VK', 'Naik SR']","['Biochemistry Division, Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd., Primpri, Pune, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,Hindustan Antibiot Bull,Hindustan antibiotics bulletin,2985097R,IM,"['Asparaginase/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification', 'Fermentation', 'Pectobacterium carotovorum/*enzymology']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hindustan Antibiot Bull. 1993 Feb-May;35(1-2):77-86.,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Injection of antibody to CD4 or CD8 did not affect the early inhibitory action of IFN alpha/beta on FLC multiplication but did decrease survival time. Light- and electron-microscope examination of the livers of IFN-treated, FLC-injected mice confirmed the early inhibition of FLC multiplication in the liver and spleen.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The method involves the harvest of autologous venous-derived endothelial cells, the efficient genetic modification of the cells through the use of recombinant retroviruses, and the subsequent implantation of the genetically modified cells on the surface of balloon-denuded arterial segments. With a rabbit model, freshly isolated endothelial cells were transduced with a recombinant retrovirus encoding the bacterial enzyme beta-galactosidase. The autologous transduced cells were then implanted on the surface of balloon-denuded ileofemoral arterial segments at different cell densities; after 1 to 14 days, the animals were killed, and the vessel segments were examined. Cells expressing the bacterial gene product, as determined by in situ staining for beta-galactosidase, were found to be present on the surface of 28 of the 32 arteries seeded with genetically modified cells. Vessels examined at 4 to 7 days after seeding displayed 40% to 90% coverage with transduced cells, even when seeded at subconfluent density, and an intact endothelial cell monolayer, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy studies. Vessels examined at 14 days after seeding revealed more variable staining for beta-galactosidase yet, again, in most cases, an intact endothelial cell monolayer. CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate the feasibility of generating segments of arterial vessels containing genetically modified cells in a rapid and efficient fashion. Further studies are now necessary to determine whether the local expression of specific polypeptides within a region of vessel for a finite period of time will be clinically useful.","['Conte, M S', 'Birinyi, L K', 'Miyata, T', 'Fallon, J T', 'Gold, H K', 'Whittemore, A D', 'Mulligan, R C']","['Conte MS', 'Birinyi LK', 'Miyata T', 'Fallon JT', 'Gold HK', 'Whittemore AD', 'Mulligan RC']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge Center, MA 02142.']",['eng'],"['HL-41484/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-43771/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM-07560/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology', 'Femoral Artery/injuries', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Iliac Artery/injuries', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.cir.89.5.2161 [doi]'],ppublish,Circulation. 1994 May;89(5):2161-9. doi: 10.1161/01.cir.89.5.2161.,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN-alpha alone had no effect on either the IL-2 production or apoptosis of MOLT-16 cells, but significantly increased both the IL-2 production and apoptosis in the MOLT-16 cells after phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation as determined by CTLL-2 assay and by flow cytometric analysis using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Since IL-2 has been shown to induce apoptosis in some systems, we next evaluated whether the apoptosis in MOLT-16 cells was due to endogenous IL-2 production upon PHA stimulation. However, the addition of exogenous IL-2 to unstimulated cultures of MOLT-16 did not induce DNA fragmentation, a characteristic feature of apoptosis, as determined by DNA electrophoresis and by flow cytometric analysis with PI-stained cells. Furthermore, anti-IL-2 antibody did not prevent PHA-induced DNA fragmentation in MOLT-16 cells. Thus, we conclude that both PHA-induced IL-2 production and apoptosis are outcomes of T cell activation and that IFN-alpha may exert immunoregulatory effects on T cell activation by augmenting both processes.","['Dao, T', 'Ariyasu, T', 'Holan, V', 'Minowada, J']","['Dao T', 'Ariyasu T', 'Holan V', 'Minowada J']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Inc., Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(84)71124-5 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1994.1124 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1994 May;155(2):304-11. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1994.1124.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caloric restriction delayed and inhibited tumour growth and improved host survival; inclusion of soyabean during restriction enhanced this effect. Dietary restriction both in the absence and presence of soyabean improved the proliferative response of peripheral blood lymphocytes. This was accompanied by increased cytolytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and elevation in serum immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM). Levels of vitamins A and E, which is found to be low in tumour bearing animals, decreased further when maintained in the restricted diet without soyabean, but was raised to normal levels following addition of soyabean in the diet. These observations imply that tumour growth is arrested possibly by insufficient nutrition available due to dietary restriction, for actively proliferating tumour cells and by improvement in host immune mechanism in the presence of soyabean in the diet.","['Mukhopadhyay, P', 'Gupta, J D', 'Sanyal, U', 'Das, S', 'Senyal U [corrected to Sanyal, U ]']","['Mukhopadhyay P', 'Gupta JD', 'Sanyal U', 'Das S', 'Senyal U [corrected to Sanyal U]']","['Department of Experimental Leukaemia, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Calcutta, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascites', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Energy Intake', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Soybeans']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-3835(94)90044-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(94)90044-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1994 Apr 1;78(1-3):151-7. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(94)90044-2.,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],,,,,,,,,['Cancer Lett 1995 Jan 6;88(1):121'],,,,,,,,

In mixing experiments four log elimination of tumor cell lines was observed after 1 hr of incubation with BPD-MA or DHE followed by white light exposure. By comparison, using the same concentration of BPD-MA or DHE, the mean recovery of normal BM progenitors was 4-5.2% for granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit (CFU-GM) and 5-9.8% for burst forming unit erythroid (BFU-E).

One of the most striking characteristics of this disease is its remarkable responsiveness to alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) therapy. Interferons constitute a heterologous family of multifunctional cytokines displaying anti-viral, anti-proliferative and immunoregulatory properties. These activities have been extensively studied in hairy cells, but the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in hairy cell leukemia remains unknown. Our approach to investigate the mode action of IFN-alpha in HCL has been to identify abnormalities which occur in these tumor cells and then to ascertain whether these abnormalities can be rectified by IFN-alpha treatment. A high level of free Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of hairy cells was identified. Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ are believed to be a pivotal signal in regulating cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell death. These high Ca2+ levels in hairy cells could be reduced upon treatment with IFN-alpha either in vitro or in vivo, probably acting by reducing Ca2+ influx into the leukemic cells. Moreover, the effect of IFN-alpha on [Ca2+]i seems to be correlated with down-regulation of CD20 phosphorylation, a B cell specific phosphoprotein involved in Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. The possible origins and implications of Ca2+ deregulation and the possible mechanisms or sites of action of IFN-alpha in tumor cells from HCL are explored in this review.","['Genot, E']",['Genot E'],"['Unite 365 INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409073778 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Feb;12(5-6):373-81. doi: 10.3109/10428199409073778.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that the release of CD9 antigen is an active process and is associated with active cell growth. In addition, the difference of carbohydrate moiety, and hence glycosylation, in the CD9 antigen derived from lymphoblasts and neuroblasts was verified using lectin affinity chromatography. The lectin affinity of the carbohydrate moiety of lymphoblast CD9 antigen would indicate the presence of N-linked oligosaccharide chains having groups of N-acetyl glucosamine residues, a mannose core and a terminal D-galactose. The soluble CD9 antigen is specifically detected in plasma from ALL patients at the time of diagnosis, in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with central nervous system involvement, and spent medium from CD9-positive leukemic blasts obtained at the time of diagnosis.

Current evidence supports the hypothesis that the restriction of primitive haemopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) to the bone marrow involves developmentally regulated adhesive interactions between HPC and the stromal cell microenvironment. This review examines the expression and function of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) on human HPC and marrow stromal cells. These data demonstrate that a broad range of CAMs representing at least three adhesion molecule superfamilies (integrins, selectins, immunoglobulin gene superfamily) participate in these adhesive interactions. We discuss the potential contribution of these various adhesion molecules to homing of HPC to the bone marrow, their retention within the extravascular haemopoietic compartment and their egress into the peripheral circulation. It is likely that each process is mediated not by a single binding event but requires the coordinated participation of multiple receptor-ligand pairs.","['Simmons, P J', 'Zannettino, A', 'Gronthos, S', 'Leavesley, D']","['Simmons PJ', 'Zannettino A', 'Gronthos S', 'Leavesley D']","['Matthew Roberts Laboratory, Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409073776 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Feb;12(5-6):353-63. doi: 10.3109/10428199409073776.,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrins)']",,,122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a need for decision models both for predicting the natural course of the disease and the outcomes of different treatment alternatives. In 102 consecutive patients with MDS or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) following MDS, pre-treatment variables were studied in relation to the response to treatment with low-dose ara-C. Thirty patients (29%) responded with either a complete remission or a significant rise in the hemoglobin level. For the remaining 71%, the treatment was ineffective and in some cases hazardous. The factors associated with a poor response to treatment could be divided into two groups: one included low platelet counts and the presence of chromosomal aberrations, both signs of progressive MDS with a short survival, and the other comprised morphological findings, indicating ineffective hemopoiesis. Patients with platelet counts > 150 x 10(9)/l had a response rate of 55%, compared to 24% in patients with subnormal platelet counts. Logistic regression identified low bone marrow cellularity, absence of ring sideroblasts and < 2 chromosomal aberrations as predictors of a favourable response in patients with platelet counts < 150 x 10(9)/l.

Together with new insights into the understanding of APL pathogenesis, such investigations also provided the availability of a novel leukemia-specific marker to be used for both diagnostic and monitoring studies. The chromosome breakpoints of the t(15;17) have been shown to involve the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-a) gene and the newly described PML gene on chromosomes 17 and 15, respectively. Rearrangements of these loci are found in virtually 100% of APLs, including the microgranular variant subtype and cases displaying apparently normal karyotypes. In cases with ambiguous morphology, molecular diagnosis may therefore enable the prompt administration of APL-specific therapies, such as all-trans retinoic acid. Significantly, clinical response to this differentiating agent is predictable based on the presence of the specific PML/RAR-a rearrangement. Appropriate oligoprimers complementary to PML and RAR-a sequences nearby the DNA breakpoints may be successfully used in PCR experiments to amplify the PML/RAR-a hybrid gene and sensitively detect minimal residual disease. Preliminary PCR studies indicate that this approach might indeed prove a very important and reliable prognostic indicator in the follow up monitoring of APL patients. Early identification of impending relapse by PCR may suggest the use of additional treatment in patients at risk and significantly increase the probability of cure of the disease.","['Lo Coco, F', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Biondi, A']","['Lo Coco F', 'Pelicci PG', 'Biondi A']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409073773 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Feb;12(5-6):327-32. doi: 10.3109/10428199409073773.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although T-cell depletion of the BM graft has evolved as the most effective method to prevent severe acute GVHD, this beneficial effect is counterbalanced by an increased rate of graft failure and relapse of the disease. To find an approach to T-cell depletion that may avoid these extreme risks, we gave BM recipients a fixed low number of 1 x 10(5) donor T cells per kilogram of recipient's body weight in the graft. This corresponds with 99% T-cell depletion and is achieved by the addition of T cells to the graft that was previously depleted of T cells. A total of 70 patients with hematologic malignancies or aplastic anemia, including 40 patients with standard-risk leukemias, received BM grafts, depleted of T cells according to this approach, from HLA-identical siblings. The preparative regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. The patients also received a short course of cyclosporine posttransplant. Graft failure did not occur. Acute GVHD, only grade I or II, was seen in 70% of the patients and was limited to the skin in all patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 31% of the patients and, with the exception of 1 patient, was limited to the skin as well. Relapse occurred in 3 of 40 (8%) patients with standard-risk leukemias, resulting in a projected survival at 5 years of 80%. Patients with standard-risk diseases had a procedure-related mortality of 11%. Quality of life, determined 1 year after BM transplant, was good in almost all patients with standard-risk diseases. Thus, this approach of T-cell depletion may be an approach that avoids the development of severe acute and chronic GVHD without damaging the function or antileukemic effect of the graft and that has a low transplant-related morbidity and mortality.","['Verdonck, L F', 'Dekker, A W', 'de Gast, G C', 'van Kempen, M L', 'Lokhorst, H M', 'Nieuwenhuis, H K']","['Verdonck LF', 'Dekker AW', 'de Gast GC', 'van Kempen ML', 'Lokhorst HM', 'Nieuwenhuis HK']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69230-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 15;83(10):3090-6.,,,['Blood. 1994 Nov 15;84(10):3597-8.

Autologous marrow transplantation has been used with success for some patients without such a sibling. Alternatively, the option of performing a transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor has been made possible by the recent development of large registries of HLA-typed volunteers. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes for patients with advanced leukemia treated by unrelated or autologous marrow transplantation. Forty-three patients with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia were transplanted from a closely HLA-matched unrelated donor. Results were compared with those of a disease-, disease-stage-, and age-matched cohort of 77 patients treated with autologous marrow transplantation at the same institution during the same period. Myeloid reconstitution with peripheral granulocyte counts greater than 10(9)/L was achieved in 93% of unrelated recipients and 70% of autologous recipients at a median of 24 and 36 days after transplantation, respectively (P = .0001). The cumulative proportions of patients discharged alive (79% v 77%) and times from transplant to first hospital discharge (35 v 34 days) were not different between unrelated and autologous recipients (P = .65). For patients transplanted in complete remission, relapse occurred after transplantation in 27% of the unrelated and in 55% of the autologous recipients (P = .08). For patients transplanted in relapse, the corresponding posttransplant relapse rates were 48% and 63%, respectively (P = .72). Forty percent of unrelated recipients and 28% of autologous recipients died in remission. Leukemia-free survivals were 33% for unrelated and 25% for autologous recipients transplanted in remission (P = .45), and 12% for unrelated and 5% for autologous recipients transplanted in relapse (P = .75). Unrelated donor transplants appear no less effective than autologous transplants to achieve long-term survival and may be more effective in eradicating leukemia in patients who have failed conventional chemotherapy. Further studies are warranted to assess the relative effectiveness of unrelated and autologous transplantation performed earlier in the course of the disease.","['Busca, A', 'Anasetti, C', 'Anderson, G', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Buckner, C D', 'Doney, K', 'Martin, P J', 'Petersdorf, E', 'Sanders, J E', 'Hansen, J A']","['Busca A', 'Anasetti C', 'Anderson G', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Buckner CD', 'Doney K', 'Martin PJ', 'Petersdorf E', 'Sanders JE', 'Hansen JA']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69228-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 15;83(10):3077-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the bone marrow, only donor-type cells were found in children with either CC (n = 8) or MTLC (n = 2), and a mixture of donor- and recipient-type cells was found in children with SMC (n = 7). The persistence of host-type hematopoiesis (SMC) was significantly related to a lower age of the recipient, the type of conditioning regimen, a lower total body irradiation dose, T-cell depletion of the bone marrow graft, and the use of cyclosporine A for acute graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. No significant differences were found between patients with (SMC) or without (CC/MTLC) persistent host-type hematopoiesis with respect to the duration of the leukemia-free interval, the overall survival, or the leukemia-free survival.

Two types of genomic rearrangements underlie fusion of E2A with HLF. In type I rearrangements, an insertion that codes for a portion of the chimera not found in either wild type protein occurs between E2A exon 13- and HLF exon 4-encoded sequences. This insertion is derived from a cryptic exon created at the junction between chromosomes 17 and 19, and includes intronic portions of both E2A and HLF with intervening nontemplated N nucleotides. Type II rearrangements arise from more 5' breakpoints in E2A and result in fusion cDNAs with E2A exon 12 spliced directly to HLF exon 4. Analysis of the genomic structure of HLF shows that these different modes of protein fusion result from selective constraints to maintain the proper HLF reading frame, because a direct E2A exon 13 to HLF exon 4 splice would lead to translation of a truncated E2A protein lacking any contribution from HLF. These features underscore the requirement for DNA binding and/or dimerization conferred by the bZIP portion of the E2A-HLF chimera in t(17;19)-ALL.","['Hunger, S P', 'Devaraj, P E', 'Foroni, L', 'Secker-Walker, L M', 'Cleary, M L']","['Hunger SP', 'Devaraj PE', 'Foroni L', 'Secker-Walker LM', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['1 F32 CA 09184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'G-Box Binding Factors', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69215-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 15;83(10):2970-7.,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-Box Binding Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation juxta-poses the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on chromosome 15 and the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17, resulting in the formation of a chimeric mRNA transcript. We describe a patient with the microgranular variant form of APL, with no detectable cytogenetic abnormality of either chromosomes 15 or 17, who nevertheless had juxtaposition of PML and RARA genes and expressed a chimeric transcript. Conventional cytogenetics showed the karyotype 46,XY,d-er(3)t(3;8)(p25;q12). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with paints for chromosomes 8, 15, and 17 confirmed the presence of structurally intact chromosomes 15 and 17 and trisomy for chromosome 8q. Nevertheless, FISH using cosmid probes for PML and RARA showed their juxtaposition on one chromosome 15 homolog. Both genes were also present on their normal homologs; in addition, part of the RARA gene was still present on the remaining chromosome 17. DNA analysis by Southern blotting, performed with a variety of probes including PML, RARA and retinoic acid receptor-beta (RARB), showed a rearrangement in PML. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the existence of hybrid transcripts of 276, 455 bp and 623 bp, from PML-RARA on the der(15) chromosome, consistent with alternate exon splicing of the long form of the transcript occurring in 50% to 60% of patients with APL. Our results show that APL patients with cytogenetically normal chromosomes 15 and 17 may, nevertheless, have involvement of both PML and RARA genes defining a subgroup of APL, t(15;17)-negative/PML-RARA-positive which is analogous to Philadelphia chromosome-negative/BCR-ABL-positive CML. In this case, the presence of chimeric transcripts suggests that treatment with all-trans RA may be warranted in APL, even in the absence of detectable cytogenetic change, showing the usefulness of RT-PCR or FISH to aid diagnosis.","['Hiorns, L R', 'Min, T', 'Swansbury, G J', 'Zelent, A', 'Dyer, M J', 'Catovsky, D']","['Hiorns LR', 'Min T', 'Swansbury GJ', 'Zelent A', 'Dyer MJ', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69212-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 15;83(10):2946-51.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a cohort of 69 patients with HCL entered in a protocol using IFN as the primary treatment, and followed thereafter for a median of 91 months (range, 0.2 to 109 months), 13 patients (19%) developed a second neoplasm. Six neoplasms were of hematopoietic origin, whereas the remaining seven were adenocarcinomas. The expected number of second tumors in this cohort is three (based on calculations from the National Cancer Institute's SEER data), so the excess frequency (observed:expected) is 4.33. However, the excess frequency is even greater for the hematopoietic neoplasms; the expected frequency is 0.15, whereas six hematopoietic tumors occurred, for an observed:expected ratio of 40. In general, the second neoplasms have behaved aggressively, and the median survival after diagnosis of the second neoplasm was only 8.8 months. Although we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that IFN therapy has some direct oncogenic effect, we suspect that increased frequency of second tumors is related to prolonged survival of patients who are immunocompromised because of HCL and thus prone to develop second tumors. If so, the frequency of second neoplasms in patients with HCL may be even greater in the future with continued improvements in therapy.","['Kampmeier, P', 'Spielberger, R', 'Dickstein, J', 'Mick, R', 'Golomb, H', 'Vardiman, J W']","['Kampmeier P', 'Spielberger R', 'Dickstein J', 'Mick R', 'Golomb H', 'Vardiman JW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Hospitals and Clinics, IL.']",['eng'],['CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Rate']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69210-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 15;83(10):2931-8.,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,['Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):3242-4.

To determine whether T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient samples possess p53 mutations, we screened peripheral blood-and bone marrow-derived leukemia samples, taken at diagnosis and at relapse, for p53 mutations. Exons 4 through 9 and selected intron regions of the p53 gene were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. p53 mutations were found in 0 of 15 T-ALL diagnosis samples, as compared with 10 of 36 (28%) T-ALL relapse samples. To determine whether p53 mutations play a role in the recurrence (relapse) of T-ALL, two special groups of T-ALL patients were studied: (1) a group of 8 relapse patients whose disease was refractory to chemotherapeutic treatment, and (2) a group of 6 ""paired"" T-ALL cell samples from patients for whom we possess both diagnosis and relapse samples. Three of 8 relapsed patients (37.5%) whose disease was refractory to the reinduction of remission by chemotherapy possessed missense mutations of the p53 gene. All 3 cases had mutations in exon 5. Among the paired samples, 3 of 6 patients harbored p53 mutations at disease recurrence, but possessed only wild-type p53 alleles at diagnosis. One case had mutation on exon 4, 1 case in exon 5, and 1 case in exon 8 with loss of heterozygosity. These data clearly indicate that recurrence of T-ALL is associated with missense mutations in p53. Our results indicate that (1) mutations of p53 do occur in T-ALL in vivo, and such mutations are associated with the relapse phase of the disease; and (2) p53 mutation is involved in the progression of T-ALL. This conclusion is supported by our observation that the introduction of T-ALL-derived mutant p53 expression constructs into T-ALL cell lines further increases their growth rate in culture, enhances cell cloning in methylcellulose, and increases tumor formation in nude mice.","['Hsiao, M H', 'Yu, A L', 'Yeargin, J', 'Ku, D', 'Haas, M']","['Hsiao MH', 'Yu AL', 'Yeargin J', 'Ku D', 'Haas M']","['Department of Biology/Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0063.']",['eng'],"['R01CA56075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA28439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Recurrence']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69209-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 15;83(10):2922-30.,,,,,,,['P53'],,,,,,,,,,,

AML can be induced by therapy with cytostatic drugs and radiation. The alkylating agents reacting directly with DNA induce AML which often presents as myelodysplasia with unbalanced aberrations, primarily loss of chromosome material. Cytostatic agents targeting DNA-topoisomerase II, frequently administered together with alkylating agents or cisplatin, induce the same type of leukemia. In addition, they often induce another type with a more rapid onset and with specific balanced chromosome aberrations rarely observed after therapy with alkylating agents alone. All of the most important chromosome aberrations found in de novo AML are now also found in therapy-related AML (t-AML); thus, t-AML may serve as a model in the search for mechanisms leading to the development of AML in general. Unbalanced chromosome aberrations with partial deletions or with loss of whole chromosomes may develop as a result of alkylation of DNA or other cellular targets. Balanced chromosome aberrations, on the other hand, may develop as illegitimate recombinations related to the activity of DNA-topoisomerase II. The balanced translocations contribute to malignant transformation by the formation of abnormal chimeric genes, whereas deletions may contribute by the loss of putative tumor suppressor genes. In either situation, the chromosome changes provide the altered cells with a proliferative advantage compared with normal cells.","['Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Rowley, J D']","['Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Hematology L 4132, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69190-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 15;83(10):2780-6.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1993) J. Immunol. 150, 3525-3533), we described that the enrichment of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(n - 3)) reduces both arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4(n - 6)) release and platelet-activating factor (PAF) synthesis in human eosinophilic leukemia cells, Eol-1. Since no DHA release was observed in response to Ca-ionophore stimulation, we presumed that the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) responsible for AA release and PAF synthesis can not hydrolyze the DHA moiety of phospholipids. In the present paper, we examined whether DHA-containing diacyl- and alkenylacylglycerophosphoethanolamine (DHA-diacylGPE and DHA-alkenylacyGPE) are susceptible to the action of AA-preferential 85 kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) from rabbit platelets in comparison with AA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5(n - 3)) derivatives. When diacylGPE was used as a substrate, DHA release was almost negligible under the assay condition that allowed AA and EPA to be liberated at the rates of 4.3 mumol/min per mg protein and 2.5 mumol/min per mg protein, respectively. On the other hand, 14 kDa type II PLA2 hydrolyzed DHA-diacylGPE as well as AA-diacylGPE and EPA-diacylGPE. When DHA-diacylGPE and AA-diacylGPE were mixed at equimolar concentrations, DHA release by cPLA2 was not observed and AA release was reduced to 32% in the case without DHA-diacylGPE. This indicated that DHA-diacylGPE is a poor substrate but possesses the inhibitory activity for cPLA2. cPLA2 does not clearly discriminate between AA-alkenylacylGPE and AA-diacylGPE. As in the case using diacylGPE as a substrate, DHA-alkenylacylGPE was completely discriminated from AA-alkenylacylGPE by cPLA2. The roles of DHA and cPLA2 in the synthesis of lipid mediators will be discussed in relation to the new aspects of the substrate specificity of cPLA2 provided here.","['Shikano, M', 'Masuzawa, Y', 'Yazawa, K', 'Takayama, K', 'Kudo, I', 'Inoue, K']","['Shikano M', 'Masuzawa Y', 'Yazawa K', 'Takayama K', 'Kudo I', 'Inoue K']","['Sagami Chemical Research Center, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*metabolism', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Plasmalogens/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Time Factors']",1994/05/13 00:00,1994/05/13 00:01,['1994/05/13 00:00'],"['1994/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(94)90255-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(94)90255-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1994 May 13;1212(2):211-6. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(94)90255-0.,"['0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Plasmalogens)', '0 (phosphatidal ethanolamines)', '1190-00-7 (glycerophosphoethanolamine)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is the initial step in phorbol ester-induced signal transduction. By virtue of preferential down-regulation of individual isoforms and generation of proteolytically derived kinase activities, the signal transduced by sustained activation of this pathway may differ substantially from that generated initially upon application of the phorbol ester. To examine the effect of chronic phorbol ester-induced activation of this pathway, the relationship between PKC activity/content and AP-1 binding activity and gene expression was studied in the U937 cell. Phorbol ester-induced differentiation of the U937 cell into a monocyte/macrophage-like cell requires sustained activation of the PKC pathway. AP-1 binding activity was enhanced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and in a temporally dependent manner, with conversion of a high to low mobility band shift occurring after a 12-h exposure to TPA. After a 72-h exposure, AP-1 binding activity was maximally increased by 1 nM TPA and remained elevated to a similar degree even after treatment with 600 nM TPA. Enhanced AP-1 binding activity was dependent upon continuous exposure to TPA and was not secondary to differentiation. A 72-h treatment with one nM TPA maximally increased expression of c-jun, krox-24, and jun-B mRNA transcripts. Exposure to higher TPA concentrations decreased the content of these transcripts. Maximal expression of collagenase and plasminogen activator receptor transcripts required exposure to much higher TPA concentrations (100 nM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Ways, D K', 'Qin, W', 'Garris, T O', 'Chen, J', 'Hao, E', 'Cooper, D R', 'Usala, S J', 'Parker, P J', 'Cook, P P']","['Ways DK', 'Qin W', 'Garris TO', 'Chen J', 'Hao E', 'Cooper DR', 'Usala SJ', 'Parker PJ', 'Cook PP']","['Department of Medicine, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, North Carolina 27858.']",['eng'],['CA 43823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Collagenases/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genes, jun', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/analysis/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis/metabolism']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1994 Feb;5(2):161-9.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,"['c-jun', 'jun-B', 'krox-24']",,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this difference, sera from individuals infected with Melanesian strains cross-react with T cells infected with cosmopolitan strains of HTLV-I, indicating an overall conservation of the B cell immunoprevalent epitopes. Neutralizing antibodies against HTLV-I in sera from virus-infected Africans and Melanesians were assayed by determining their ability to block the formation of syncytia in cocultures of 8166 and T cell lines harboring either cosmopolitan or Melanesian HTLV-I isolates. All six African sera blocked the formation of syncytia with cells infected with HTLV-IC91-PL, a viral isolate from the United States. Similarly, all six Melanesian sera inhibited syncytium formation with cells infected with HTLV-IMEL3, a virus isolate from the Solomon Islands. Although most of these sera inhibited syncytium formation in cell cultures carrying the cosmopolitan as well as the Melanesian HTLV-I strains, neutralizing antibody titers tended to be higher against the homologous virus.

Neither activation nor inhibition of colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor's PTK activity with CSF-1 or genistein respectively affected the phosphorylation of S6. However, vanadate which is a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor showed enhancement of S6 phosphorylation. Dimethylsulfoxide which does not affect either PTK or PKC demonstrated no change in S6 phosphorylation. PKC activation by acute 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment induced monocytic differentiation and S6 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the more prominent phosphorylation of S6 protein was observed in PKC-depleted cells by prolonged TPA treatment. Our results suggest that PTK/PTP play a lesser role in S6 phosphorylation of HL-60 cells than PKC does. In addition, two different mechanisms seem to be involved in TPA-induced S6 phosphorylation during HL-60 differentiation: PKC activation by acute TPA treatment and PKC depletion which may lead to the synthesis of some endogenous protein responsible for the differentiation by chronic TPA treatment.","['Kim, I S', 'Lee, S B', 'Cho, K C']","['Kim IS', 'Lee SB', 'Cho KC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Catholic University Medical College, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3346/jkms.1993.8.6.413 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 1993 Dec;8(6):413-9. doi: 10.3346/jkms.1993.8.6.413.,"['0 (Ribosomal Protein S6)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,PMC3053872,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferons alpha and gamma: indications in systemic diseases].,557-62,"Interferon alpha (INF-alpha)--In systemic diseases, most indications for INF-alpha result from its effect on haematological or hepatological manifestations. The spectacular effect of INF-alpha in chronic myeloid leukemia has led to its use for the treatment of hypereosinophilia syndrome and systemic mastocytosis. Over the last 6 years, we have treated 7 patients with the hypereosinophilia syndrome who were resistant to corticotherapy and had markers of myeloproliferation. Although both hydroxyurea and INF-alpha can be effective alone, their combination led to a decrease in the eosinophilia count to 1,000/ml, a decrease which was long-lasting in most cases. INF-alpha is also used in histiocytosis X alone or in combination with retinoids or with etoposide and has been found effective in several observations. In carcinoid syndromes whether treated priorly or not with a 5-fluoro-uracil-streptozoticin combination, INF-alpha leads to an objective response in two-thirds of the patients. Several multicentric protocols are currently assessing the efficacity of INF-alpha in mixed cryoglobulinaemias. In most observations these cryoglobulinaemias are seen in patients with markers of hepatitis C (mainly HCV) and the early results are encouraging. Temporary improvement has been reported in discoid or subacute lupus in 8 out of 10 cases. Haemangiomas of the infant, when life-threatening and corticoresistant, may be a good indication for INF-alpha.

Unstimulated fibroblasts did not produce significant amounts of LIF, whereas recombinant interleukin-1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) were dose-dependent stimulators of LIF production. TGF-beta and rIL-1 alpha also interacted in a synergistic fashion to further increase LIF elaboration. Under all conditions alterations in LIF production were associated with comparable alterations in LIF mRNA accumulation. The kinetics of mRNA induction, however, differed with rIL-1-induced LIF mRNA being readily detected after 2 h, TGF-beta 1 induction peaking after 16-24 h, and the induction caused by rIL-1 alpha plus TGF-beta 1 being most prominent after 2-4 h and decreasing with additional incubation. Protein synthesis was not required for LIF induction. In addition, even though A23187 was an effective stimulator of LIF production, the calmodulin antagonists W-7 and trifluoperazone dichoride (TFP) did not significantly alter the LIF-stimulatory effects of IL-1 and TGF-beta. PKC did appear to play an important role in this induction, however, since LIF was induced by PMA and cytokine induction of LIF production was markedly diminished by chronic phorbol ester preincubation, staurosporine, and H-7, but not by HA1004. These studies demonstrate that 1) rIL-1, TGF-beta, TNF, agents that increase intracellular calcium and agents that activate PKC, stimulate lung fibroblast LIF production; 2) rIL-1 and TGF-beta interact in a synergistic fashion to further increase fibroblast LIF production; and 3) rIL-1 and TGF-beta stimulate lung fibroblast LIF production via a pretranslational activation pathway that is largely PKC-dependent and protein synthesis-, cyclic nucleotide-, and calmodulin-independent. Cytokine-stimulated LIF production may play an important role in homeostasis and repair in the human lung.","['Elias, J A', 'Zheng, T', 'Whiting, N L', 'Marcovici, A', 'Trow, T K']","['Elias JA', 'Zheng T', 'Whiting NL', 'Marcovici A', 'Trow TK']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['HL-36708/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-41216/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,IM,"['Cytokines/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lung/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajplung.1994.266.4.L426 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1994 Apr;266(4 Pt 1):L426-35. doi: 10.1152/ajplung.1994.266.4.L426.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlation of tumor volume with concentration of tumor-derived soluble interleukin-2 receptor in body fluids of the host mice.,1089-97,"Increased serum concentration of soluble alpha-chain receptor for interleukin-2 (sIL-2R) has been noted in patients with a variety of inflammatory conditions and lymphoid malignancies including T cell leukemia and lymphoma. Elevated sIL-2R serum levels seen in lymphoid malignancies appear to correlate with the clinical stage of disease. However, because sIL-2R is produced by normal activated lymphocytes, it has been uncertain whether serum sIL-2R in such conditions is derived from tumor cells or normal immune cells responding to the tumor. To address this question, we used a model of human (CD30+) anaplastic, large T cell lymphoma transplanted into immunodeficient SCID mice. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of tumor RNA showed that the tumor, designated mJB6, contains mRNA for alpha-chain of human IL-2R. Furthermore, 15 to 25% of tumor cells stained with anti-human IL-2R alpha-chain mAb. Solid phase ELISA analysis of serum samples from mice bearing mJB6 lymphoma showed high concentrations of human sIL-2R. None of the control mice without lymphoma or with human nonlymphoid tumors (prostatic carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and glioblastoma multiforme) showed detectable human sIL-2R. The sIL-2R serum titers of mJB6-bearing mice correlated strongly with tumor volume (P < 0.0001). Tumors as small as 0.4 to 0.8 mm3 could be detected by this method. The sensitivity of sIL-2R ELISA exceeded at least 150 times the sensitivity of conventional radioisotopic tumor detection. Total resection of mJB6 tumors resulted in complete clearance of sIL-2R from the murine serum within 48 hours with a half-life of 6 hours. Accordingly, partial resection led to a significant decrease in sIL-2R followed by gradual increase with tumor regrowth. sIL-2R was also detected in the urine of mJB6-transplanted mice. As in serum, urine concentrations of sIL-2R were proportional to tumor mass (P < 0.02). Based on these findings we postulate that malignant cells are a major source of serum sIL-2R in patients with lymphoid tumors. In addition, our data further support monitoring sIL-2R concentration in body fluids as a sensitive method to detect change in tumor volume in such patients.","['Wasik, M A', 'Sioutos, N', 'Tuttle, M', 'Butmarc, J R', 'Kaplan, W D', 'Kadin, M E']","['Wasik MA', 'Sioutos N', 'Tuttle M', 'Butmarc JR', 'Kaplan WD', 'Kadin ME']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/blood/*metabolism/surgery/urine', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1994 May;144(5):1089-97.,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,PMC1887350,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two registers have been set up. They include all personnel of the atomic reactor (register A) and of the radiochemical processing plant (register B). The operation of these installations started in 1948, and two cohorts were formed; cohort I includes those who started employment between 1948 and 1953, cohort II those who started employment from 1954 to 1958. The predominant contribution to the occupational exposure was from external gamma-radiation. Adverse radiation situations prevailed during the first years at both facilities, and this resulted in substantial exposures of the personnel. Significant increases of the total cancer mortality rates and the proportion of malignancies of the haematopoietic and the lymphatic system were seen in the internal comparison only in cohort I of male workers from facility B. In the same cohort there was a statistically significant excess of the standardized mortality rates from malignancies of the haematopoietic and the lymphatic system over the population rates in the Soviet Union. Our estimate for the excess relative leukemia risk is 1.45/Gy, which is 2.7 times less than the relative excess risk of 3.92/Gy that was observed for the A-bomb survivors over age 20 ATB (Shimizu et al. 1987).","['Koshurnikova, N A', 'Buldakov, L A', 'Bysogolov, G D', 'Bolotnikova, M G', 'Komleva, N S', 'Peternikova, V S']","['Koshurnikova NA', 'Buldakov LA', 'Bysogolov GD', 'Bolotnikova MG', 'Komleva NS', 'Peternikova VS']","['Public Health Ministry of the Russian Federation, Biophysics Institute Branch N1, Chelyabinsk-65.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Male', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'USSR/epidemiology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0048-9697(94)90068-X [pii]', '10.1016/0048-9697(94)90068-x [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 1994 Mar 1;142(1-2):19-23. doi: 10.1016/0048-9697(94)90068-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, HGFs are able to increase the percentage of leukemic cells in the S phase. In consequence, HGFs have been used in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) to recruit quiescent clonogenic blasts to improve the cytotoxic effects of cell cycle specific drugs. The clinical results are divergent and do not allow definite conclusions. However, in vitro, the efficacy of HGFs to enhance cytosine arabinoside (ara-C)-mediated cytotoxicity has been reported. Whether the HGFs-mediated increase in the antileukemic activity of ara-C is caused by changes in the cell cycle status of AML blasts or by other mechanism(s) is currently debated.","['Viallard, J F', 'Puntous, M', 'Grosset, C', 'Lacombe, F', 'Reiffers, J']","['Viallard JF', 'Puntous M', 'Grosset C', 'Lacombe F', 'Reiffers J']","['Laboratoire de Greffe de Moelle, Universite de Bordeaux II, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1994;36 Suppl 1:S103-5.,['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)'],,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Internationally accepted diagnostic categories were used. Six hundred seventy-eight cases were found, giving an age standardised incidence rate of 114.2 per million childhood years. The incidence of different cancers by sex was strikingly similar to the Manchester Children's Tumour Registry, from a noncontiguous region, with three exceptions. In the South-West, there was a higher rate of soft tissue sarcoma in boys (P = 0.01) and lower rates of sympathetic nervous system and germ-cell tumours in girls (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively). There was no significant variation in cancer incidence among the five counties or with time. The incidence rate in counties of high radon exposure was not higher than with low radon exposure. The overall incidence in counties with urban districts was not significantly increased compared to those without, although there was a nonsignificant trend towards a higher incidence of leukaemia (P = 0.08). The incidence and type of childhood cancer are similar to those in a noncontiguous region. Geographical and temporal incidence are remarkably stable.

Fifteen were classified as Askin's tumors or Ewing's sarcoma, which we now consider as a single entity of primitive neuroectodermal origin. They are infrequent but highly aggressive tumors that involve the chest wall in children. Five patients presented with metastatic disease; despite chemotherapy and radiotherapy, all succumbed to progressive disease. Ten patients with localized disease received combined modality therapy including surgical resection (three after initial chemotherapy), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery involved resection of the mass and up to three ribs, with prosthetic mesh reconstruction in one patient. Six of the 10 patients with localized disease are continuously disease-free 3.5 to 9 years (median, 5 years) following diagnosis. No patient had local recurrence. Of the four whose treatment failed, one died (free of disease) from complications after resection of an extensive primary tumor. In the second patient, acute monocytic leukemia developed shortly after relapse in a distant bone site. The patient died during induction for the leukemia. In the other two patients, hilar and carinal lymph node relapse occurred 68 and 80 months after initial treatment. One of the patients is considered in second remission (now 105 months later) after further chemotherapy (Adria-VAC) and radiation; the other succumbed to secondary relapse 17 months after second remission was achieved through chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.

All patients received empiric antibiotic therapy after cultures were obtained. Antibiotic therapy was discontinued if no infection was found, culture results were negative for 48 hours, and the patient was afebrile for 24 hours. In 83 episodes without documented infection, antibiotic therapy was stopped with absolute neutrophil counts < 0.5 x 10(9)/L (< 500/mm3); 50 episodes occurred in patients with solid tumors, leukemia in remission, and other hematologic conditions (group 1), and 33 in patients with active leukemia (group 2). Fever recurred before neutropenia resolved in 6% of group 1 and 45% of group 2 episodes; five patients in group 2 had documented infection. Recurrent fever risk correlated with absolute neutrophil count and monocyte count at the time antibiotic therapy was stopped, in both groups, as did increasing absolute neutrophil count and increasing leukocyte count in group 2. We conclude that discontinuing antibiotic therapy is safe in febrile episodes without documented infections before neutropenia resolves in patients with high potential for bone marrow recovery.

In an investigation of non-covalent protein binding, we studied AlS2Pc in the presence of human serum albumin (HSA) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. On addition of excess concentrations of HSA, small red shifts in the fluorescence and absorbance spectra were observed, together with an increase in fluorescence polarization anisotropy, consistent with binding of the phthalocyanine. Fluorescence decays could be resolved into two lifetimes for bound AlS2Pc with a dominant component of 5.5 ns and a minor component of 1 ns. Fluorescence imaging and time-resolved microfluorometry were carried out on intracellular AlS2Pc using leukaemic K562 cells. Microscopic imaging with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera revealed that AlS2Pc fluorescence predominated in a discrete perinuclear region which was then probed selectively by a focused laser spot for fluorescence lifetime measurements.

Our previous investigations showed that the alpha-chain of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R alpha) secretion is enhanced in both acute and chronic type ATL. This finding suggested increased levels of IL-2R alpha in c-ATL that might differentiate it from MF. In this study, we report several observations on IL-2R alpha levels in MF and c-ATL. 1) Plasma levels of IL-2R alpha determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were higher in patients with c-ATL (tumor group, 17,571 +/- 5,919 U/ml; non-tumor group, 4,546 +/- 1,788 U/ml) than those of patients with MF (tumor group, 2,352 +/- 861 U/ml; plaque group, 530 +/- 174 U/ml). 2) The percentages of IL-2R alpha-positive cells in skin lesions of c-ATL were 30.5 +/- 13.4% in the non-tumor group and 62.7 +/- 12.0% in the tumor group, which were significantly higher than those of MF, plaque group (12.7 +/- 5.9%), and tumor group (3.4 +/- 2.3%). 3) Further, there was a significant correlation between plasma IL-2R alpha levels and the number of IL-2R alpha-positive cells in skin lesions in patients with c-ATL (r = 0.654, p < 0.0001) and MF (r = 0.537, p < 0.01) on an individual basis; whereas no increased IL-2R alpha levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were observed in patients with either MF or c-ATL. 4) Skin lesions of c-ATL had much higher levels of IL-2R alpha genomic RNA than those of MF in their initial stages when measured by DNase/reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction and liquid hybridization analysis. These findings suggest that increased plasma IL-2R alpha levels in patients with either MF or c-ATL may be linked to cellular IL-2R alpha levels in the skin lesions, and thus reflect the difference between MF and c-ATL.","['Oishi, M', 'Johno, M', 'Ono, T', 'Honda, M']","['Oishi M', 'Johno M', 'Ono T', 'Honda M']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/blood/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis/genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/*chemistry']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(94)90402-2 [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12374344 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1994 May;102(5):710-5. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12374344.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Astrocyte-enriched cultures, prepared from 8- to 9-wk-old embryonic brains, expressed LIF mRNA and secreted LIF protein. LIF synthesis was significantly increased by the cytokines IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta 1, but not by IFN-gamma, IL-6, or LPS. No major differences in basal and cytokine-inducible LIF production were detected among astrocyte populations obtained from different brain areas. LIF synthesis was lower in serum-free than in serum-containing astrocyte cultures. A role for protein kinase C in the regulation of astrocyte LIF production was suggested by the findings that phorbol esters induced both LIF mRNA and protein and that the cytokine-induced LIF increase was partially antagonized by relatively selective inhibitors of protein kinase C such as H7 and staurosporine. Human leptomeningeal fibroblasts also expressed LIF gene and protein. Astrocytes produced LIF and responded to cytokines with increased LIF synthesis only after being subcultured, and not when grown in primary cultures in close contact with neurons. Our findings suggest that in vivo induction of astrocyte LIF secretion might occur in pathologic conditions as a consequence of both alterations of neuronal-glial interactions and a local increase in the level of inflammatory cytokines.","['Aloisi, F', 'Rosa, S', 'Testa, U', 'Bonsi, P', 'Russo, G', 'Peschle, C', 'Levi, G']","['Aloisi F', 'Rosa S', 'Testa U', 'Bonsi P', 'Russo G', 'Peschle C', 'Levi G']","['Laboratory of Organ and System Pathophysiology, National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Astrocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Brain/embryology/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Meninges/metabolism', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 May 15;152(10):5022-31.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor T cells residing in the spleen and ascites of hosts were identified and quantified by use of Ab to the Thy-1 allele. The results demonstrated that on day 7 after transfer, donor T cells in greater numbers than input (1.2-fold) could be recovered. By day 35, donor T cells had decreased to approximately 10% of T cells input. Administration of IL-2 at doses of 2,500 or 25,000 U/day for 7 days preferentially increased the growth of Ag-activated donor T cells rather than host lymphocytes, and increased both the short term growth on day 7 (6.6-fold and 14.5-fold greater than input, respectively) and the long term survival on day 35 (0.75-fold and 3.15-fold of input, respectively) of donor T cells. The combination of CY pretreatment plus low dose IL-2 (2,500 U/day) increased donor T cell growth over and above that of either manipulation alone. However, with higher dose IL-2 to 25,000 U/day, donor T cell growth was equivalent in CY-pretreated and normal hosts (18-fold vs 16-fold increase, respectively; p > 0.05). With either dose of IL-2 there was no significant difference in the survival of donor T cells on day 35 in CY-pretreated vs normal hosts. Functional assay confirmed that specific cytolytic function of donor T cells could be maintained in hosts without previous immunosuppression. Accordingly, established disseminated FBL-3 leukemia could be cured without CY treatment, in a regimen using 10(7) cultured immune T cells plus IL-2 (25,000 U/day x 7 days). Thus, adoptively transferred donor T cells can be grown to large numbers and survive long term in vivo with maintenance of substantial function without the necessity of previous host immunosuppression.","['Chen, W', 'Cheever, M A']","['Chen W', 'Cheever MA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 May 15;152(10):4767-74.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genes fall into two classes that are distinguished by their dependence on protein synthesis for the induction by serum, i.e., primary and secondary genes. While 11 of these genes encode known proteins, 4 other genes have not been described to date. The former genes encode proteins of diverse functions, including the monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MONAP), calmodulin, tropomyosin, tenascin, collagenase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2a, the 'sperm-specific' cleavage signal-1 protein, metallothionein IIa and the mitochondrial chaperonin hsp-60. Interestingly, one of the unknown genes contains a large open reading frame for a polypeptide that is highly homologous to a previously unidentified long open reading frame in the opposite strand of the gene coding for the transcription factor HTF-4. We also studied the regulation of these serum-induced genes during cell cycle progression in normally cycling WI-38 and HL-60 cells separated by counterflow elutriation as well as in serum-stimulated HL-60 cells. Our results clearly show that, in contrast to the prevailing opinion, the expression of most genes induced after mitogen stimulation is not subject to a significant regulation in normally proliferating cells. This supports the hypothesis that the progression into S from either G0 or G1 are distinct processes with specific patterns of gene expression.","['Wick, M', 'Burger, C', 'Brusselbach, S', 'Lucibello, F C', 'Muller, R']","['Wick M', 'Burger C', 'Brusselbach S', 'Lucibello FC', 'Muller R']","['Institut fur Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung (IMT), Philipps-Universitat Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzymes/*biosynthesis', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lung', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'S Phase', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1994 Jan;107 ( Pt 1):227-39.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,"['GENBANK/Z24724', 'GENBANK/Z24725', 'GENBANK/Z24726', 'GENBANK/Z24740', 'GENBANK/Z24749']","['mig-1', 'mig-2-ig-3', 'mig-4']",,,['J Cell Sci. 1994 Mar;107 ( Pt 3):preceding table of contents.

The human myeloid leukemia cell lines, HL-60, U937, and THP-1, express similar levels of immunochemically detectable MNDA. Although, the level of MNDA mRNA in primary monocytes is very low it was up-regulated at 6 h following the addition of interferon alpha. The effect of interferon alpha on the MNDA mRNA is also observed in the cell lines HL-60, U937, and THP-1. The MNDA mRNA level in primary granulocytes was unaffected by addition of interferon alpha and other agents including interferon gamma, endotoxin, poly (I).poly (C), and FMLP. The MNDA mRNA level in the myeloid cell lines was also unaffected by the latter four agents. Induction of differentiation in the myeloid cell lines with phorbol ester induces monocyte differentiation which was accompanied by a decrease in MNDA mRNA level. This reduced level of mRNA could then be elevated with subsequent interferon alpha treatment. The effects of phorbol ester on MNDA mRNA appeared to be associated with induced differentiation since inhibiting cell proliferation did not alter the level of MNDA mRNA and cell cycle variation in MNDA mRNA levels were not observed. The ability of interferon alpha to up-regulate MNDA mRNA in phorbol ester treated myeloid cell lines is consistent with the observations made in primary monocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Briggs, R', 'Dworkin, L', 'Briggs, J', 'Dessypris, E', 'Stein, J', 'Stein, G', 'Lian, J']","['Briggs R', 'Dworkin L', 'Briggs J', 'Dessypris E', 'Stein J', 'Stein G', 'Lian J']","['Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240540208 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1994 Feb;54(2):198-206. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240540208.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (MNDA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Jurkat T cells the first signal can be provided by the phorbol ester TPA and the second by the calcium ionophore A23187. We have isolated a cDNA from Jurkat T cells representing mRNA induced by TPA but inhibited by simultaneous treatment of the cells with antibody, lectin, or A23187. Sequencing revealed identity of the Jurkat clone to a cDNA, termed ETR101, recently isolated from HL60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells and shown to be an immediate early gene expressed upon TPA stimulation of these cells [Shimizu et al.: J Biol Chem 266:12157, 1991]. The gene is also induced very rapidly upon TPA treatment of Jurkat cells and is superinduced by co-treatment with cycloheximide. The predicted amino acid sequence encoded by ETR101 has weak homology to JunB and JunD, therefore it is of some interest that these three genes share the chromosomal localization, 19p13.2. The divergent effects of TPA treatment upon cell proliferation and differentiation in different circumstances allow some speculation about a possible role for the ETR101 gene product upon cellular differentiation.","['Scott, J L', 'Dunn, S M', 'Zeng, T', 'Baker, E', 'Sutherland, G R', 'Burns, G F']","['Scott JL', 'Dunn SM', 'Zeng T', 'Baker E', 'Sutherland GR', 'Burns GF']","['Cancer Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Newcastle, Royal Newcastle Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240540202 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1994 Feb;54(2):135-44. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240540202.,"['37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,['GENBANK/S69623'],"['ETR101', 'JunB', 'JunD']",,,,,,,,,,,

These electrophiles were selected for study because of their known ability to undergo rapid intracellular conversion to glutathione conjugates. CDNB produced typical inhibitor kinetics and was a moderate inhibitor of both system I (IC50 = 4.8 microM) and system II (IC50 = 7.5 microM) with methotrexate as the substrate. However, a complex response was observed when cholate was employed as an alternative substrate for system I. Cholate efflux was stimulated initially at low levels of CDNB, but then slowed to a net inhibition as CDNB concentrations exceeded 10 microM. The latter characteristics for CDNB were not observed with ethacrynic acid, which produced a comparable inhibition of efflux system I regardless of the substrate employed (IC50 = 4.6 microM). Efflux measurements in an L1210/C7 variant which lacks system I confirmed that CDNB stimulates the activity of a substantial and unique efflux activity for cholate (system III). The inhibition of system I and II by CDNB and ethacrynic acid was not reversed by a wash step but required inhibitor removal and subsequent incubation at 37 degrees C. This slow reversal was attributed to a time-dependent clearance of inhibitory glutathione conjugates. A correlation between efflux systems for anions and anionic glutathione conjugates was demonstrated further by the ability of prostaglandin A1 and indomethacin, two potent inhibitors of methotrexate and cholate efflux, to inhibit the efflux of 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione. These results support the hypothesis that efflux systems for methotrexate and cholate in L1210 cells are part of a family of efflux pumps which function in vivo to extrude various anions and anionic glutathione conjugates.","['Henderson, G B', 'Hughes, T R', 'Saxena, M']","['Henderson GB', 'Hughes TR', 'Saxena M']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cholic Acid', 'Cholic Acids/*metabolism', 'Dinitrochlorobenzene/*pharmacology', 'Ethacrynic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/06 00:00,1994/05/06 00:01,['1994/05/06 00:00'],"['1994/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)36844-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 May 6;269(18):13382-9.,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Cholic Acids)', '0 (Dinitrochlorobenzene)', '26289-39-4 (S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'G1JO7801AE (Cholic Acid)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'M5DP350VZV (Ethacrynic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-six patients who received etoposide (25-65 mg/kg) added to cyclophosphamide (60-120 mg/kg) and either total body irradiation (12.0-13.2 Gy) or busulfan (12-16 mg/kg) were evaluable for toxicity. Fifty-one of the evaluable patients received allogeneic transplants, while twenty-six received autologous transplants. A comparative analysis of toxicities according to conditioning regimen, donor source and etoposide dose was made. RESULTS: Similar toxicities were observed among the treatment groups with the exception of more frequent skin (p = 0.003) and life threatening hepatic toxicities (p = 0.01) in the busulfan treated patients. Life threatening or fatal toxicities were not influenced by donor source, either when analyzed by treatment group or etoposide dose. Etoposide at a dose of 60-65 mg/kg in combination with TBI and cyclophosphamide was associated with a significantly increased incidence of life threatening or fatal toxicities compared with a combination using a dose of 25-50 mg/kg (15 of 24 vs. 5 of 20; p = 0.013). The maximally tolerated dose of etoposide in combination with busulfan and cyclophosphamide cannot be definitively established in this analysis in part due to the heterogeneity of the patient population and treatment schemes. CONCLUSION: Although toxicities with bone marrow transplant preparative regimens containing etoposide in combination with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation or busulfan were frequently severe, treatment related mortality risk was believed to be acceptably low.","['Spitzer, T R', 'Peters, C', 'Ortlieb, M', 'Tefft, M C', 'Torrisi, J', 'Cahill, R', 'Gadner, H', 'Urban, C', 'Deeg, H J']","['Spitzer TR', 'Peters C', 'Ortlieb M', 'Tefft MC', 'Torrisi J', 'Cahill R', 'Gadner H', 'Urban C', 'Deeg HJ']","['Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/etiology', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/etiology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1994/04/30 00:00,1994/04/30 00:01,['1994/04/30 00:00'],"['1994/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)90224-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)90224-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Apr 30;29(1):39-44. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)90224-0.,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cumulative probability of having a ST has been calculated for the different clinical and therapeutic subgroups of a population of 1121 patients consecutively treated (1960-1988) for Hodgkin's disease. Age groups at diagnosis were as follows: < 20 years, 18%; 20-40, 48%; 41-60, 26%; > 60, 8%. Initial treatment consisted of radiation alone (67%), combined modality treatment (24%), chemotherapy alone (9%). Treatment for relapse was also coded, and the occurrence of ST was related both to initial treatment (considering relapsed patients as censored at relapse) and to the ""overall"" treatment burden, without censoring at relapse. RESULTS: An increased ST risk has been observed in patients older at HD diagnosis. Second tumors cumulative probability rates were significantly higher in patients initially treated with chemotherapy, especially when associated with subtotal or total nodal irradiation (relative risks of 3.1 and 4.1, p = .03 and .005, respectively, when compared to involved field radiotherapy alone). The same trend was observed for second solid tumors. Acute leukemia was more frequent in patients initially given chemotherapy alone or associated with radiotherapy (p = .01), and in those treated with an increasing number of cycles (p = .004). ""Salvage"" chemotherapy after radiation alone at presentation does not seem to be linked with an increased risk of leukemia. CONCLUSION: The 15-year cumulative ST probability (11%) should be evaluated in the context of the very good cure rates achieved for Hodgkin's disease. The use of chemotherapy, particularly when associated with subtotal or total nodal irradiation, entails an increased risk of second malignancies and might be inappropriate in early stage Hodgkin's disease patients.","['Biti, G', 'Cellai, E', 'Magrini, S M', 'Papi, M G', 'Ponticelli, P', 'Boddi, V']","['Biti G', 'Cellai E', 'Magrini SM', 'Papi MG', 'Ponticelli P', 'Boddi V']","['Department of Clinical Physiopathology, University of Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",1994/04/30 00:00,1994/04/30 00:01,['1994/04/30 00:00'],"['1994/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)90222-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)90222-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Apr 30;29(1):25-31. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)90222-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hallmark of CML is represented by a marked increase in the number of leukemic progenitors, as well as more mature cells, in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB). Despite expansion of the leukemic clone, normal Ph-negative stem cells have been demonstrated to survive in CML. Early observations of partial, but transient, restoration of Ph-negative hematopoiesis after high-dose chemotherapy have recently been extended by the use of myeloablative regimens followed by autografting with marrow or blood-derived stem cells. Moreover, treatment of early-stage CML patients with the biologic response modifier alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) has led to the re-emergence of normal progenitor cells. Concurrently, ""in-vitro"" studies have reported that cultures of CML marrow in the presence of a stromal feeder-layer resulted in depletion of Ph-positive cells and predominance of Ph-negative hematopoietic precursors. Based on the assumption that normal and malignant stem cells may coexist in CML, several studies have recently been directed toward the characterization and ""in-vitro"" selection of benign progenitors within CML hematopoiesis. The results of those studies demonstrated that normal precursors can be phenotypically and functionally identified in the BM or PB of Ph-positive CML patients. These cells are included in the earliest identifiable hematopoietic cell compartment. Normal cells do not bear cell surface lymphoid or myeloid-lineage antigens, express high levels of the CD34 antigen, and fail to express the HLA-DR antigen. Furthermore, they possess a great capacity for adhering to marrow stroma. This cell population represents only a small minority of hematopoietic progenitors, but it retains many of the properties associated with putative hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, purification of a population of benign hematopoietic precursors that could be used for autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) may be feasible in CML patients.","['Lemoli, R M']",['Lemoli RM'],"['Istituto di Ematologia L. & A.

Analysis of incidence as a function of length of follow-up.,374-7,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Infections represent the major cause of death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, clinical studies dealing with their incidence have yielded inconclusive results. In order to address this issue we reviewed the records of 125 CLL patients (mean age 65.6 yrs; 81 M/44 F; Stage A, 48; Stage B, 37; Stage C, 40) followed up at our institution over a 10-year period. RESULTS: The 125 patients accrued 447 person-years, a mean of 3.8 years per person. There were 199 recorded infections: 47 severe (crude rate 9.8 per 100 person-years) and 72 moderate, respectively. The 5-year risk of developing a severe infection for the whole series was 26% (95% CI: 24.7-27.3%), and 21 out of 71 deaths (29.5%) could be attributed to infectious causes. Despite a linear trend toward increased risk (r = 0.98), hazard function analysis showed a constant pattern of risk (r = 0.30), suggesting a lack of correlation of this event with time. Furthermore, the 5-year risk of developing a severe infection increased to 57.1% (95% CI: 36.4-77.8%) for patients with low IgG levels (less than 6.5 gr/L), and to 68% for those with both low IgG levels and disease stage C. On the other hand, patients who experienced a severe infection more frequently had advanced clinical stage (P < 0.001), low IgG levels (P < 0.01) and diffuse bone marrow (BM) histology (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Infection is a constant risk in CLL that is associated with shortened survival. Factors such as hypogammaglobulinemia and advanced disease appear to be the major predisposing factors.","['Molica, S', 'Levato, D', 'Levato, L']","['Molica S', 'Levato D', 'Levato L']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Regionale A.

Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells are able to recognize tumor targets specifically because LAK cells can distinguish between normal and tumor cells. This study was aimed at analyzing receptor molecules on tumor cells and their counter-receptor molecules on LAK cells. Cell lines which differ in the pathway by which LAK cell lysis is mediated are important for an analysis of receptor molecules. METHODS: We adapted a novel method for efficient production of K562 clones in order to analyze the mechanisms by which target and effector receptor molecules mediate different LAK cell interactions. K562 cells were exposed to ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) for mutagenization and addition of two rounds of irradiated LAK cells. Prior data demonstrated that irradiation does not effect cytolysis. Surviving cells were plated in methylcellulose and single colonies were obtained after ten days. Cells were washed, resuspended in medium, expanded and tested as targets in a 51Cr-release assay. RESULTS: With this procedure a variety of clones could be generated easily and time-savingly. All twelve clones expressed the bcr/abl transcript, as determined by PCR, and were sensitive to LAK cell lysis. However, cell blockage studies revealed that K562 clones were generated with LAK cell recognition differing from parental K562. Antibody blockage showed that lysis of clone 5 (LEF 5) is partially mediated via the LFA-1/ICAM-1 pathway. ICAM-1 expression of this clone was similar to expression on K562, as determined by flow cytometry.

Licensing was based on (a) studies demonstrating the inactivation of several marker viruses [vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Sindbis virus, Sendai virus], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and non-A, non-B hepatitis virus [NANBHV; now known to be principally hepatitis C virus (HCV)] added to AHF just before treatment, (b) the realization that the principal viruses of concern in a transfusion setting (e.g. HIV, HBV, NANBHV) were all lipid-enveloped, and (c) laboratory, preclinical and clinical evidence indicating that AHF and other proteins present in the preparation were unaffected. The applicability of the SD method to a wide range of products and preparations, high process recoveries, and a growing body of viral safety information linked with the failure of several other virus inactivation methods to eliminate hepatitis transmission fostered the adoption of SD technology by more than 50 organizations world-wide. SD mixtures are now used in the preparation of products as diverse as intermediate purity and monoclonal antibody purified AHF and other coagulation factor concentrates, fibrin glue, normal and hyperimmune IgG and IgM preparations including those derived from tissue culture, plasma for transfusion, and various diagnostic controls.

Stimulation with ONO-4007 induced messenger RNA expression of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which have been reported to induce differentiation of several leukemia cell lines. However, autocrine production of these cytokines may not be involved in the mechanisms of differentiation induced by ONO-4007, because the treatment with IL-1 alpha, IL-6, or TNF-alpha does not induce the differentiation of c-WRT-7 cells. In vivo treatment by intravenous administration of ONO-4007 resulted in a significant prolongation of survival time of the rats inoculated intravenously with c-WRT-7 cells compared with that of untreated rats.

Polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) of seven untreated and nine IFN-alpha-treated patients were evaluated for the following parameters by the following methods: generation of oxygen species, by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence; leukotriene B4 (LTB4) generation, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); expression of LTB4 and formylmethionyl-leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP) receptor sites, by 3H-binding assay; and GTPase activity, by 32P-gamma-GTP. Compared to normal controls, reduced values were obtained in treated and untreated CML for most parameters studied. Therapy with IFN-alpha resulted in significantly diminished values for oxygen species (NaF stimulation) and LTB4 (FMLP stimulation) generation, as well as FMLP receptor expression as compared to untreated CML. We conclude that alterations at the level of oxygen species production, mediator generation, receptor expression, and transmembrane signaling are involved in functional defects of circulating mature neutrophils from CML patients.

In the cytoplasmic fraction GAbf-1 was not detectable before 30 min, continued to increase up to 2 h, but had disappeared within 12 h. GAbf-1 activity was not observed in nuclear extracts treated with IFN-gamma, and was not inhibited by prior treatment with the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. When the binding properties of GAbf-1 were compared with those of ISGF-3, the primary transcriptional activator for IFN-alpha-induced genes, a different pattern of retarded complexes was observed. Moreover, as observed by immunoblotting analysis, nuclear extracts from IFN-alpha-treated L1210 cells did not contain the p91/84 subunit of the ISGF3, the best characterized nuclear complex activated by IFN-alpha. Altogether these results indicate that GAbf-1 may be a novel transcription factor exploited by IFN-alpha to activate the 202 inducible gene in murine pre-B leukemia cells.","['Gariglio, M', 'Gaboli, M', 'Mana, C', 'Ying, G G', 'Gribaudo, G', 'Cavallo, R', 'Landolfo, S']","['Gariglio M', 'Gaboli M', 'Mana C', 'Ying GG', 'Gribaudo G', 'Cavallo R', 'Landolfo S']","['Institute of Microbiology, Medical School, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18786.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1994 Apr 15;221(2):731-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18786.x.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF9 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit)', '0 (Isgf3g protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product has been implicated as a key regulator of eukaryotic cell growth. The Rb protein enforces its growth-suppressive effect in early G1, where it is underphosphorylated and firmly bound in the nucleus. A possible link between the cyclic AMP-mediated growth arrest and regulation of Rb protein phosphorylation was explored by Western blot analysis. We found that both forskolin and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate induced a rapid (within 3 h) dephosphorylation of Rb protein. These data were confirmed by flow-cytometric analysis of isolated nuclei costained with anti-Rb antibodies and propidium iodide. The percentage of cells containing underphosphorylated Rb protein (i.e., G1 nuclei with bound Rb protein) increased from 9 to 87% after 4 h of forskolin treatment. During the first 4 h of forskolin treatment, the cells were transiently blocked in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and virtually no cells had passed through mitosis. The increased level of dephosphorylated Rb protein at 4 h was therefore not due to an accumulation in early G1 of cells containing underphosphorylated Rb protein. Instead, our data indicated that dephosphorylation of Rb protein occurred in cells that had already passed the point in G1 of Rb protein phosphorylation. Dephosphorylation of Rb protein was prevented by high concentrations of the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, indicating that activation of a phosphatase is involved in the cyclic AMP-mediated dephosphorylation of Rb protein. We suggest that the dephosphorylation of Rb protein is required for the forskolin-mediated arrest of the Reh cells in mid-G1.","['Christoffersen, J', 'Smeland, E B', 'Stokke, T', 'Tasken, K', 'Andersson, K B', 'Blomhoff, H K']","['Christoffersen J', 'Smeland EB', 'Stokke T', 'Tasken K', 'Andersson KB', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Department of Immunology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Colforsin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitotic Index', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Theophylline/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Apr 15;54(8):2245-50.,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '35873-49-5 (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DMP 840 exhibits curative activity in human tumor xenografts, where it shows selectivity for human solid tumors over murine leukemias. In contrast to the selectivity found for DMP 840 in vivo, DMP 840 exhibits potent antiproliferative activity in vitro against a variety of human and murine leukemia and solid tumor cell lines in culture, with inhibitory doses that reduce the number of treated cells to one half (IC50) values ranging from 2.3 to 53 nM. DMP 840 was growth inhibitory to three doxorubicin-resistant cell lines with IC50 values also in the nanomolar range. Clonogenic survival experiments showed that DMP 840 was equally cytotoxic to both exponentially growing and quiescent human clone A colon carcinoma cells. A 1-h incubation of DMP 840 (1.22-12 microM) caused 5-log cell kill in KB-3-1 human epidermoid carcinoma, clone A human colon carcinoma, and L1210 murine leukemia cell lines. The rapid cell killing by DMP 840 in clonogenic survival experiments and initial mechanism of action studies was consistent with a DNA-interactive mechanism for DMP 840 cytotoxicity. Mechanism of action studies in L1210 leukemia cells demonstrated that DMP 840 inhibited the incorporation of thymidine and uridine into DNA and RNA with IC50 values of 0.55 and 0.08 microM, respectively. DMP 840 produced DNA single-strand breaks in a dose-dependent manner. Double-strand breaks were not observed with DMP 840 treatment, even at higher concentrations of compound. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and P388 cells resistant to camptothecin and containing a mutant form of topoisomerase I were also used to evaluate whether DMP 840 was cross-resistant with agents active against topoisomerase I. While the CHOR line was 163-fold resistant to camptothecin, the CHOR line was only 1.7-fold resistant to DMP 840. In summary, DMP 840 is a DNA-interactive agent that demonstrates excellent antiproliferative activity in vitro against cultured tumor cells from both human and murine sources.

The mean plasma TBARS levels were: 12 normal volunteers = 0.14 microM; 19 ""normal"" RA catabolizers = 0.25 microM; and 14 ""rapid"" catabolizers = 0.82 microM. P = 0.008 (rapid catabolizers versus normal volunteers) and 0.05 (rapid catabolizers versus normal catabolizers). Repeat TBARS determinations were made during the course of therapy in 17 patients, all of whom converted to ""rapid"" RA catabolism on therapy. An increase in plasma TBARS levels > or = 20% of baseline was observed in 5 of 5 prostate cancer patients and 8 of 12 lung cancer patients treated with continuous RA therapy for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. These observations support the hypothesis that high levels of lipid peroxides and rapid oxidative catabolism of RA are positively correlated.","['Muindi, J F', 'Scher, H I', 'Rigas, J R', 'Warrell, R P Jr', 'Young, C W']","['Muindi JF', 'Scher HI', 'Rigas JR', 'Warrell RP Jr', 'Young CW']","['Developmental Chemotherapy Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['CA 05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/blood/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Lipid Peroxides/*blood/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy', 'Reference Values', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/analysis', 'Tretinoin/*blood/therapeutic use']",1994/04/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Apr 15;54(8):2125-8.,"['0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this trial was to compare, on a pharmacokinetic, biological, and clinical basis, the racemic mixture dl FA with the pure 1 FA in the rescue of high-dose methotrexate (MTX) therapy. Eighteen children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were entered in this trial planned with a cross-over design. Four cycles of MTX (5 g/m2, 24h CVI) were administered to each patient, with a 2-week interval between cycles. The rescue was achieved orally every 6h, starting 12h after the end of the MTX infusion, at a dose of 12 mg/m2 for dl FA and 6 mg/m2 for pure 1 FA. dl FA and 1 FA rescues were alternated from one cycle to the next. d FA, 1 FA, and the active metabolite 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) were measured in plasma using a stereospecific HPLC assay. After administration of dl FA, the accumulation of d FA in plasma was confirmed: mean residual concentrations were 420 and 652 nM after 2 and 6 intakes respectively. Total active folate concentrations (1 FA + 5-MTHF) were similar between the two types of rescue: 92 and 100 nM respectively for dl FA rescue and 1 FA rescue after two intakes, 186 and 184 nM respectively for dl FA rescue and 1 FA rescue after six intakes. Intra-individual statistical analysis of total active folates (1 FA + 5-MTHF) performed on 17 patients did not show any significant difference between dl FA rescue and 1 FA rescue. For both types of rescue, MTX terminal half-lives were identical (average value 13.9 h). Considering each type of toxicity (hematologic, hepatic, renal and digestive) there was no significant difference in the proportion of toxic cycles following l FA rescue or dl FA rescue. In conclusion, the administration of the pure l FA, as compared with the administration of the racemic mixture, results in comparable blood profiles of active folates and MTX, and leads to equivalent treatment tolerance.","['Etienne, M C', 'Thyss, A', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Rubie, H', 'Milano, G']","['Etienne MC', 'Thyss A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Rubie H', 'Milano G']","['Centre Antoine-Lacassagne, Nice, France.']",['fre'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antidotes/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/*administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Stereoisomerism']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1993 Apr;80(4):357-63.,"['0 (Antidotes)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",Acide folinique forme 1 pure versus acide folinique forme racemique dans le traitement de la leucemie de l'enfant par methotrexate forte dose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results prior to the marketing of fluconazole.,252-60,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of antifungal agents in hospitalized patients prior to marketing of fluconazole and to assess characteristics associated with their use. DESIGN: A cohort of hospitalized patients receiving topical or systemic antifungal therapy was monitored concurrently. SETTING: Sixty-nine hospitals ranging in size from 100 to more than 500 beds, 70.1 percent affiliated with medical schools. PATIENTS: Participating clinical pharmacists each identified 15 consecutive patients receiving systemic antifungal therapy and 5 consecutive patients receiving topical antifungal therapy at their institutions. Data collection began October 1989 and ended March 1990. INTERVENTION: All data collected were observational in nature, and no patient intervention was required. MEASURES: Characteristics of patients receiving antifungal therapy were compared using t-tests and chi-square tests. Utilization and patterns of use of antifungal therapy were reported. RESULTS: The most common risk factors necessitating antifungal therapy, in descending order, were: administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or presence of invasive catheters, carcinoma, AIDS, leukemia or lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Five hundred seventeen patients received systemic therapy and 464 (89.7 percent) received a single systemic agent. Of these, 242 (52.2 percent) received amphotericin B, 215 (46.3 percent) received ketoconazole, 6 (1.3 percent) received flucytosine, and 1 (0.2 percent) received intravenous miconazole. Fifty-three patients received two systemic agents either concurrently or consecutively. Ketoconazole was most often used for presumed or documented oral, urogenital, or esophageal infections and amphotericin B was the preferred agent for disseminated infections and fungemia (p < 0.001). Almost half of the patients receiving amphotericin B or ketoconazole (48.3 percent) received these drugs as empiric therapy. Documented infections were more likely to be treated with amphotericin B (54.8 percent) than with ketoconazole (27.4 percent) (p < 0.001). The predominant fungal isolates were Candida albicans, Candida spp., and unspecified yeasts. Amphotericin B toxicity led to discontinuation of drug therapy in only 5.1 percent of cases. Two hundred sixty-nine patients (34.2 percent) received topical antifungal therapy only. Nystatin oral suspension was prescribed to 65.3 percent of the patients, clotrimazole troches to 23.0 percent, amphotericin B irrigation to 10.9 percent, and nystatin tablets to 0.8 percent. CONCLUSIONS: The utilization patterns of antifungal agents in this survey follow established therapeutic guidelines. Prior to the introduction of fluconazole, amphotericin B was the agent of choice for documented systemic fungal infections. Ketoconazole was more often used for prophylaxis of fungal infections and treatment of oral and esophageal infections.","['Grasela, T H', 'Goodwin, S D', 'Pasko, M T', 'Walawander, C A', 'Raebel, M A']","['Grasela TH', 'Goodwin SD', 'Pasko MT', 'Walawander CA', 'Raebel MA']","['Center for Pharmacoepidemiology Research, State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Utilization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole/therapeutic use', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy', 'Nystatin/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'United States']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809402800219 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1994 Feb;28(2):252-60. doi: 10.1177/106002809402800219.,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '1400-61-9 (Nystatin)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine cyclin D1 expression in hematopoietic neoplasms with and without bcl-1 or cyclin D1 rearrangements, northern blot analysis was performed. METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood cells of patients with hematopoietic neoplasms in leukemic phase, including three patients with B-cell lymphoma containing chromosome 11q13 bcl-1 rearrangements.

The analysis of cases in which both diseases are present in the same anatomic site (composite lymphomas), or in separate sites (simultaneous or sequential HD and NHL), indicates that this phenomenon occurs more frequently than would be expected by chance alone. DESIGN: We reviewed our experience with composite, simultaneous, and sequential cases of HD and NHL, including both nodular lymphocyte-predominant HD (NLPHD) and the other (so-called 'usual') subtypes of HD. Cases analyzed included 43 cases of NLPHD and large-cell lymphoma (LCL); 14 cases of NHL following HD; 12 cases of composite lymphoma; 2 cases of simultaneous HD and NHL involving different sites; 8 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells; and 22 cases of HD following NHL. Immunophenotypic analysis of both components (HD & NHL) was performed when possible. In addition, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBER1 mRNA was performed in 35 cases of usual HD associated with NHL. RESULTS: The most common form of composite lymphoma was coexistent NLPHD with LCL of B-cell immunophenotype. With the abnormal cells of NLPHD also being of B-cell lineage, this finding suggests the existence of a clonal relationship between the two components. The association of nodular sclerosis or mixed cellularity HD and NHL was less common but still significant. The vast majority of the NHL associated with HD were of B-cell origin, most commonly follicular lymphomas. EBV was identified more frequently in the NHL of composite NHL + HD (4/12 cases; 33%) than the other patient groups studied (2/23; 9%). Moreover, in 4/5 composite lymphomas both the HD and NHL component were EBV-positive, suggesting an origin from a common EBV-infected progenitor cell. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that, at least in some cases, HD may be clonally related to an underlying B-cell malignancy, and that the Reed-Sternberg cell may be an altered B lymphocyte. A process that may have a different pathogenesis is the late occurrence of aggressive, usually EBV-negative (12/14 cases), B-cell NHL in patients successfully treated for HD. Such tumors may be related to an underlying and persistent immunodeficiency in these patients, and may be of similar pathogenesis to the Burkitt-like lymphomas associated with HIV-infection.","['Jaffe, E S', 'Zarate-Osorno, A', 'Kingma, D W', 'Raffeld, M', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Jaffe ES', 'Zarate-Osorno A', 'Kingma DW', 'Raffeld M', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Hematopathology Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/annonc/5.suppl_1.s7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1994;5 Suppl 1:7-11. doi: 10.1093/annonc/5.suppl_1.s7.,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein encoded by bcl-2 contributes to neoplastic cell expansion by prolonging cell survival through its ability to block programmed cell death (apoptosis). Because many chemotherapeutic drugs have been shown ultimately to kill tumor cells through mechanisms consistent with programmed cell death, we tested whether the relative levels of bcl-2 oncoprotein influence the sensitivity of lymphoma and leukemia cell lines to killing by conventional cytotoxic drugs commonly used in the treatment of cancer. METHODS: Leukemia cell lines with low levels of bcl-2 expression were stably infected with recombinant bcl-2 retroviruses to achieve elevations in bcl-2 protein levels. Lymphoma cell lines with high levels of bcl-2 expression as the result of 14;18 translocations were either stably transfected with inducible bcl-2 antisense expression plasmids or treated with bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides to achieve reductions in bcl-2 protein levels. The sensitivity of these genetically modified cells to killing by various antineoplastic drugs was then determined. RESULTS: Gene transfer-mediated elevations in bcl-2 protein levels in lymphocytic leukemia cell lines was correlated with markedly elevated resistance to killing by all cytotoxic drugs tested. Conversely, antisense-mediated reductions in bcl-2 protein levels in t(14;18)-containing NHL cell lines resulted in enhanced sensitivity to all anticancer drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The relative levels of bcl-2 oncoprotein represent one of the key determinants of the sensitivity of lymphocytic cells to killing by essentially all drugs currently available for the treatment of cancer.","['Reed, J C', 'Kitada, S', 'Takayama, S', 'Miyashita, T']","['Reed JC', 'Kitada S', 'Takayama S', 'Miyashita T']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Center, California.']",['eng'],"['CA-47956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/annonc/5.suppl_1.s61 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1994;5 Suppl 1:61-5. doi: 10.1093/annonc/5.suppl_1.s61.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, malignant cells of patients with HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) express IL-2 receptors. In contrast, normal resting cells do not express the IL-2 receptors identified by the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody. Using the unmodified anti-Tac monoclonal antibody, one-third of the 19 patients treated with ATL have undergone a remission. However, unmodified murine monoclonal antibodies are limited by their immunogenicity and their poor effector functions. To address these issues, we used genetic engineering to produce humanized anti-Tac that contains the complementarity-determining regions from the mouse with the remainder of the antibody derived from human IgG1-kappa. Humanized anti-Tac is dramatically less immunogenic than the murine versions and, in contrast to the parent antibody, manifests antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity with human mononuclear cells. To enhance its effector function, anti-Tac was armed with toxins or with alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides. In a clinical trial with 90Y-anti-Tac, 11 of the 17 patients with ATL underwent a partial or sustained complete remission.

Addition of the chelating agent diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) at seeding time caused an inhibition of the induction of ODC activity by up to 90%, and only Zn2+ of the bivalent metal ions tested was effective in reversing this effect. The inhibition of the induction of ODC activity was accompanied by a marked decrease, prevented by Zn2+ supplementation, of the accumulation of immunoreactive ODC protein and ODC mRNA. DTPA treatment also caused a slight acceleration of ODC turnover.

We have investigated the effect of glucocorticoids on eicosanoid formation and lipocortin-1 induction in a human cell line in vitro and in patients with inflammatory lung disease in vivo. Human promyelocitic U-937 cell line was differentiated by 24 h incubation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 6 ng/ml), then dexamethasone (1 microM) was added for further 16 h. In these conditions the steroid treatment caused both the release of lipocortin-1 in the cellular supernatant and the inhibition of eicosanoid release. These results suggest that the responsiveness of these cells to steroids is dependent on the phase of cell activation-differentiation. The selective release of the lipocortin-1 may explain the inhibition of eicosanoid formation. Patients with inflammatory lung disease underwent glucocorticoid treatment at clinically effective doses. LC-1 expression was significantly stimulated in alveolar macrophages, but not in blood-derived lympho-monocytes.

DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: 30 hematologic units in tertiary care or university hospitals. PATIENTS: 820 consecutive, afebrile, adult patients with acute leukemia and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive fluconazole, 150 mg, as a once-daily capsule, or amphotericin B suspension, 500 mg every 6 hours. MEASUREMENTS: An intention-to-treat analysis was done for 820 patients: 420 treated with fluconazole and 400 treated with oral amphotericin B. RESULTS: Definite systemic fungal infection occurred in 2.6% of fluconazole recipients and 2.5% of amphotericin B recipients; suspected systemic fungal infection requiring the empiric use of intravenous amphotericin B occurred in 16% of fluconazole recipients and 21% of oral amphotericin B recipients, a difference of 5 percentage points (95% CI for difference, -0.02% to 10%; P = 0.07).

However, the mean levels of sCD4 in CSF from these patients were significantly lower than ATL patients with meningeal infiltration. Soluble CD4 in the CSF from healthy volunteers were below the detectable limit. We conclude that meningeal infiltration of CD4(+) ATL cells is strongly associated with elevated sCD4 levels in CSF, and some part of sCD4 in CSF may be originated from the native cells in the CNS as a response of inflammatory stimulations. Therefore, measurement of sCD4 may be useful in the diagnosis of meningeal infiltration and/or meningeal irritation in patients with ATL.","['Uozumi, K', 'Hanada, S', 'Ishitsuka, K', 'Ohno, N', 'Otsuka, M', 'Shimotakahara, S', 'Nakahara, K', 'Takeshita, T', 'Chyuman, Y', 'Kuwazuru, Y']","['Uozumi K', 'Hanada S', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Ohno N', 'Otsuka M', 'Shimotakahara S', 'Nakahara K', 'Takeshita T', 'Chyuman Y', 'Kuwazuru Y', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['CD4 Antigens/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Leukemic Infiltration/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Male', 'Solubility']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830460208 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1994 Jun;46(2):95-100. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830460208.,['0 (CD4 Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of the supernatants on the proliferation capacity of normal and malignant human cells was examined. A suppression of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced proliferation of autologous and heterologous B-CLL lymphocytes was observed, whereas there was no effect on the proliferation of lymphocytes obtained from healthy volunteers. In addition, supernatants of irradiated B-CLL lymphocytes inhibited thymidine incorporation into blasts derived from patients with acute leukemia and the lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi, but they did not exert any effect on normal cells obtained from human embryonic liver. These results suggest the secretion of some factor(s) by irradiated B-CLL lymphocytes, which may inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells but has no effect on normal cells.","['Bessler, H', 'Notti, I', 'Cohen, A M', 'Klein, B', 'Djaldetti, M']","['Bessler H', 'Notti I', 'Cohen AM', 'Klein B', 'Djaldetti M']","['Department of Medicine B, Hasharon Hospital, Golda Medical Center, Petah Tiqva, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spleen/radiation effects']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830460202 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1994 Jun;46(2):65-71. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830460202.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A diagnosis of HCL was suspected based on morphologically characteristic hairy cells in the peripheral blood that contained tartrate resistant acid phosphatase. A bone marrow biopsy specimen had a normocellular marrow with an increase in interstitial lymphoid cells that stained with L26, MB2, and LN2 antibodies.

The origin of the JKB-1 cell line was indicated by its chromosomal and immunologic similarity to the patient's fresh leukemic cells. This cell line has been growing for more than 14 months in suspension culture medium and had a doubling time of about 24 hours. JKB-1 expressed terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) and early antigens (HLA-DR, CD19, CD24) of B cells, with heavy chain gene rearrangement. However, it did not express late antigens (CD10, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23) of B cells, light chain gene rearrangement, and cytoplasmic mu-chain. These results suggested that JKB-1 is at the stage of ""pro-B"" cell or early B-cell precursors. This cell line was induced to differentiate after 7 days of co-incubation with irradiated bone marrow stromal cells because of the expression of pre-B cell antigens (CD10, CD20), cytoplasmic mu-chain, light chain gene rearrangement, and disappearance of TdT, JKB-1 cells adhered to a preestablished bone marrow stromal cell layer with string-like processes under scanning electron microscope. When JKB-1 cells were separated from the stromal layer by a cyclopore membrane with 0.45 micron pore size, they did not differentiate. Bone marrow stromal cell conditioned medium could not induce differentiation either. Thus it was suspected that direct contact between JKB-1 cells and stromal cells was required for differentiation. In methylcellulose semisolid medium, the colony size and number of JKB-1 cells were increased by stem cell factor (SCF), or interleukin (IL)-3, or IL-7, but they were decreased by IL-6. Moreover, SCF synergized with IL-3 or IL-7 to stimulate the proliferation of JKB-1 cells. Because there are very few reproducible models for examining early stages of human B-cell differentiation, the JKB-1 cell line would be useful for studying the relationship between human B-cell differentiation and bone marrow microenvironment, as well as leukemogenesis.","['Urashima, M', 'Hasegawa, N', 'Kamijo, M', 'Shishikura, A', 'Kato, Y', 'Hoshi, Y', 'Akatsuka, J', 'Maekawa, K']","['Urashima M', 'Hasegawa N', 'Kamijo M', 'Shishikura A', 'Kato Y', 'Hoshi Y', 'Akatsuka J', 'Maekawa K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830460211 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1994 Jun;46(2):112-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830460211.,['0 (Cytokines)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the observation period, 1970-1989, 4,151 new cases of cancer occurred. Each participant's cumulative exposure to magnetic fields was estimated based on measurements of current exposure of 2,066 workers performing tasks similar to those in the cohorts using personal dosimetry. Estimates were also made of past exposure based on knowledge of current loading, work practices, and usage. Workers who had more than the median cumulative exposure to magnetic fields (3.1 microtesla (microT)-years) had a higher risk for acute nonlymphoid leukemia (odds ratio (OR) = 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-5.44). The same observation holds for acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.20-8.27). There was also an elevated risk for mean exposure above 0.2 microT (acute nonlymphoid leukemia, OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.00-5.58; acute myeloid leukemia, OR = 2.25, 95% CI 0.79-6.46). However, there were no clear dose-response trends with increasing exposure and no consistency among the three utilities. Men whose cumulative exposure to magnetic fields was above the 90th percentile (15.7 microT-years) had an elevated risk for brain cancer (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 0.76-5.00) that was not statistically significant.

Previous experiments have shown that transformed cells elicit a cell-mediated response accountable for rejection and resistance to a subsequent injection of parental tumor into a syngeneic host. L1210 expresses classical H-2 class I molecules, and since it has been shown that DTIC treatment does not modify the expression of these molecules, this is a suitable model to study nonclassical class I antigens, such as Qa2 glycoproteins, and their potential role in tumorigenicity. METHODS: Cloned cells from L1210 were treated with DTIC and then H-2D, and Qa antigen expression was studied on four clones, before and after xenogenization with DTIC. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: a strong decrease of Qa2 molecule expression was demonstrated by radioimmunoassay and immunofluorescent staining and was confirmed by FACS and 2D-gel analysis. The presence or the absence of Qa antigens on tumor cells could thus be involved in tolerance or rejection of tumor cells in syngeneic animals.","['Leroy, E', 'Lattuada, D', 'Casnici, C', 'Franco, P', 'Marelli, O E']","['Leroy E', 'Lattuada D', 'Casnici C', 'Franco P', 'Marelli OE']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Animals', 'Dacarbazine/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, MHC Class I/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/31 00:00,1993/12/31 00:01,['1993/12/31 00:00'],"['1993/12/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/31 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1993 Dec 31;79(6):439-43.,['7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)'],,,,,,['Qa'],,,,,,,,,,,

Methotrexate alone or in combination with INF-gamma was found to enhance the induction of morphologic and functional monocytic differentiation in the U-937 cell line. Various cellular effects with the addition of thymidine to the medium with methotrexate and IFN-gamma were studied. Enhanced inhibition of cell growth and perturbation of the cell cycle were noted when methotrexate and IFN-gamma were used in combination, but not when methotrexate was used alone. The reduction of cellular folate by methotrexate was also enhanced in combination with IFN-gamma. Cell cycle delay, resulting in cell growth inhibition of folate depletion, caused the induction of differentiation in U-937 cells, which was found to be greater with methotrexate + IFN-gamma than with methotrexate alone. Cellular differentiation, as assessed by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay, indirect immunofluorescence and morphology, showed better effects towards the differentiation of U-937 cells when the agents were used in combination. However, addition of thymidine to the medium was found to cancel all the aforementioned effects. The addition of thymidine to the medium also caused reversal of the inhibitory effect of methotrexate and IFN-gamma on cell growth and repletion of the endogenous folate level. Repletion of the folate level by exogenous thymidine is a new possibility for the role of the thymidine in cellular growth.","['Sur, P', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Otani, T', 'Minowada, J']","['Sur P', 'Matsuo Y', 'Otani T', 'Minowada J']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Folic Acid/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thymidine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/31 00:00,1993/12/31 00:01,['1993/12/31 00:00'],"['1993/12/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/31 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1993 Dec 31;79(6):433-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apropos of 19 cases].,449-53,"PURPOSE: To evaluate our experience in the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated to AML-M3 with substitution therapy with or without heparin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical records of 19 patients diagnosed of AML-M3 in the Hospital Juan Canalejo, in La Coruna, between 1986 and 1991 were revised. DIC was defined by abnormalities in one or more of the following: prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastic time, thrombin time, fibrinogenaemia, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, D-dimers. The treatment given to 13 patients was only substitutive including platelets, fresh-frozen plasma, cryoprecipitates and antithrombin III. Low-dose sodium heparin (Kabi) in continuous intravenous infusion was associated to the treatment of the remaining 6 patients. With regard to the leukaemic therapy, most of the patients received daunorubicin, 2 mg/kg/day x 5 days, and AraC, 100 mg/Kg/day x 7 days. RESULTS: All patients showed haemorrhagic symptoms at diagnosis, and laboratory data of DIC were present in 11 cases (57%). The mean duration of DIC was 6.5 days for the patients receiving substitutive treatment and 9.5 days for those given heparin. Complete remission (CR) of the leukaemia was attained in 12 cases (63%); of the patients treated with heparin, 50% achieved CR whereas 75% of those receiving substitute therapy attained CR. The 24-months survival rate was 30% for the patients treated with substitutive therapy and 16% for those treated with heparin. The incidence of death associated to haemorrhage during induction therapy was 30% for the substitutive treatment group and 50% for the heparin group. CONCLUSION: Shorter duration of DIC, lesser rate of early death, higher CR rate and longer 2-year survival were found in those AML-M3 patients not receiving heparin.","['Rodriguez Gomez, M', 'Lopez Fernandez, M F', 'Batlle, J']","['Rodriguez Gomez M', 'Lopez Fernandez MF', 'Batlle J']","['Servicio de Hematologiia-Hemoterapia, Hospital Juan Canalejo Teresa Herrera, La Coruna.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antithrombin III/therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/blood/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Heparin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1993 Dec;38(6):449-53.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",Terapeutica de la coagulacion intravascular diseminada en las leucemias agudas promielociticas.

A psychologic evaluation study of the mental health was carried out analysing different aspects, namely, personality, anemic status, anxiety, and stress along the last 12 months, and the grade of social support and the specific pattern of coping with stress situations were examined as well. The complete evaluation took into account the different phases of the leukaemia: diagnosis, clinical course, relapses and therapy; other circumstances such as sex, age, time from diagnosis, type of treatment, untoward therapeutic effects, type and time of isolation, were also contemplated. RESULTS: Intersenting data were collected, it being important that 77% of the cases had psychic alterations.

Although impaired DNA synthesis and destruction of hematopoietic cells have been implicated, the mechanism by which folate deficiency decreases blood cell production is uncertain. An in vitro model of folate-deficient erythropoiesis was developed by using proerythroblasts isolated from folate-deficient mice that were infected with Friend leukemia virus. Proerythroblasts from folate-deficient mice had one-tenth the total folate as did proerythroblasts from control mice. The folate-deficient proerythroblasts underwent apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, after 20-32 h in culture in folate-deficient medium. At the time of apoptosis the cells had differentiated into the later erythroblast stages and some had begun hemoglobin synthesis. Addition of either folic acid or thymidine, but not deoxycytidine or inosine, to the folate-deficient medium prevented the apoptosis and permitted proliferation and differentiation of the proerythroblasts into reticulocytes. The prevention of apoptosis by thymidine indicates (i) that decreased thymidylate synthesis plays a role in erythroblast apoptosis and the anemia of folate deficiency and (ii) that DNA cleavage is likely to be a primary event in the apoptosis of folate-deficient erythroblasts. Apoptosis of erythroblasts in the late stages of differentiation leads to decreased erythrocyte production and to anemia. The increased erythropoietin produced in response to the anemia increases the number of erythroid progenitor cells in the differentiation stages preceding those in which the cells undergo apoptosis. This population shift to earlier stage erythroblasts and proerythroblasts is characteristic of bone marrows of individuals with folate deficiency anemia.","['Koury, M J', 'Horne, D W']","['Koury MJ', 'Horne DW']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232.']",['eng'],"['DK31513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK32189/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Damage', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Pancytopenia/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Thymidine/*pharmacology']",1994/04/26 00:00,1994/04/26 00:01,['1994/04/26 00:00'],"['1994/04/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/26 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.9.4067 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Apr 26;91(9):4067-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.9.4067.,['VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)'],,,,PMC43724,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in contrast to retroviral onc genes, mutated proto-onc genes from cancers are not sufficient for carcinogenesis. Therefore, it has been proposed that mutated proto-onc genes depend on other proto-onc genes for carcinogenesis. Since the oncogene of the avian leukemia virus E26 includes coding regions derived from two cellular proto-onc genes, proto-myb and proto-ets, this hybrid gene has been proposed to be a model for two-gene-carcinogenesis. Here we set out to test this proposal. For this purpose myb and ets deletion mutants of cloned E26 provirus were prepared, and the corresponding viruses, produced by transfected primary chicken embryo cells, were tested for leukemogenicity in newborn chickens. It was found that an ets deletion mutant was just as leukemogenic as the wild-type virus and that a myb deletion mutant lacked leukemogenicity completely. To eliminate the possibility that our E26 myb deletion mutant failed to be leukemogenic because it failed to replicate, the virus was titered by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. By this method, E26 from the plasma of infected chickens was first allowed to reverse-transcribe viral RNA to cDNA in vitro, and then the cDNA concentration was determined from the lowest dilution that gave a positive signal after amplification of E26 cDNA by the PCR method. Virus titers of about 10(5) per ml were found for wild type and for myb and ets deletion mutants of E26. It is concluded that the ets region is not essential for carcinogenesis, and E26 derives transforming function from overexpression of its proto-myb coding region via the retroviral promoter. Thus, E26 is a single-hit carcinogen and, like all other oncogenic retroviruses, is not a model for two-gene-carcinogenesis. Viral ets probably reflects a genetic accident that transduced sequences of proto-ets together with proto-myb in generating E26.","['Wu, Y', 'Duesberg, P']","['Wu Y', 'Duesberg P']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', '*Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Virus Replication']",1994/04/26 00:00,1994/04/26 00:01,['1994/04/26 00:00'],"['1994/04/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/26 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.9.4039 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Apr 26;91(9):4039-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.9.4039.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (oncogene proteins v-ets)']",,,,PMC43718,,"['ets', 'myb']",,,,,,,,,,,

Tax activates transcription of viral and cellular genes through specific enhancers: the 21-bp enhancer of human T-cell leukemia virus type I, the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)-binding site of the interleukin 2 receptor alpha gene, and the serum-responsive element of c-fos. Tax binds to enhancer-binding proteins including cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, cAMP-responsive element modulator, transcription factor NF-kappa B p50 and p67SRF, and associates with each enhancer DNA indirectly. In addition to this mechanism, we report here that Tax binds to inhibitory factor kappa B gamma (I-kappa B) gamma, which forms a complex with NF-kappa B protein heterodimer p50-p65 or homodimer p50-p50 and retains them in the cytoplasm. Tax binding to I-kappa B gamma induces nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B p65. In association with this nuclear translocation of p65, transcription directed by the kappa B enhancer is strongly activated. Tax binds to the ankyrin motifs of I-kappa B gamma, suggesting its possible interaction with many other proteins carrying ankyrin motifs contributing to various regulatory processes. This is a different mechanism of transcriptional activation by the oncoprotein Tax and seems to be independent from the trans-activation through indirect binding to enhancer DNAs.","['Hirai, H', 'Suzuki, T', 'Fujisawa, J', 'Inoue, J', 'Yoshida, M']","['Hirai H', 'Suzuki T', 'Fujisawa J', 'Inoue J', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelB', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1994/04/26 00:00,1994/04/26 00:01,['1994/04/26 00:00'],"['1994/04/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/26 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.9.3584 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Apr 26;91(9):3584-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.9.3584.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Relb protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)']",,,,PMC43624,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Studies of populations in geographic areas of increased cosmic radiation and high natural background radiation, radiation-exposed workers, patients with medical exposure to radioactivity, and accidental exposure are reviewed. RESULTS: No reproducible evidence shows harmful effects associated with increases in background radiation of 3 to 10 times the usual levels. American military personnel who participated in nuclear testing had no increase in leukemia or other cancers. Among 22,000 patients with hyperthyroidism treated with 131I (mean dose, 10 rem), no increased incidence of leukemia was found in comparison with 14,000 similar patients who received other treatment. A 20-year follow-up of 35,000 patients who underwent 131I uptake tests for evaluation of thyroid function revealed that those studied for other than a suspected tumor had only 60% of the thyroid cancers expected in a control group. Although early studies showed that high exposures to miners to radon and its daughters resulted in a substantial increase in lung cancer, no evidence exists for an increase in lung cancer among nonsmokers exposed to increased radon levels in the home. CONCLUSION: Perhaps the association of radiation with the atomic bomb has created a climate of fear about the possible dangers of radiation at any level; however, no evidence indicates that current radiation exposures associated with medical usage are harmful.","['Yalow, R S']",['Yalow RS'],"['Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Bronx, New York.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,IM,"['Accidents, Occupational', 'Background Radiation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Reactors', 'Occupational Exposure', '*Radiation Effects', 'Radioisotopes/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radon', 'Ukraine']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(12)61639-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-6196(12)61639-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 1994 May;69(5):436-40. doi: 10.1016/s0025-6196(12)61639-5.,"['0 (Radioisotopes)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: We conducted a study of the cohort of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who had been diagnosed as having CLL during the period from 1935 through 1989. MATERIAL AND METHODS: By analysis of medical records, patients with CLL were characterized by Rai stage, absolute lymphocyte count, age at diagnosis, need for therapy, and reported cause of death in nonsurvivors. Trends for these variables were analyzed by decade throughout the study period. RESULTS: The overall annual incidence rate of CLL per 100,000 population in Olmsted County increased from 2.6 in the 1935 through 1944 period to 5.4 in the 1975 through 1984 period; however, the increasing rate was found only for those 50 years of age or older and was especially dramatic for those 75 years old or older. Analysis of Rai stage over time demonstrated an increase in the proportion of cases diagnosed as Rai stage 0. In addition, the median absolute lymphocyte count decreased, the median time to initiation of therapy increased, and the median age of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL at the time of diagnosis increased over time. Overall, 54% of patients had received therapy for CLL by the time of last follow-up. Among the nonsurvivors, CLL was documented as the underlying or a contributing cause of death in 69%. CONCLUSION: The overall increase in CLL was thought to be due to enhanced methods of early diagnosis and improved health care for the elderly population. Thus, artifact may best explain the observed trend, although we cannot exclude the possibility of an actual increase in incidence rates over time.","['Call, T G', 'Phyliky, R L', 'Noel, P', 'Habermann, T M', 'Beard, C M', ""O'Fallon, W M"", 'Kurland, L T']","['Call TG', 'Phyliky RL', 'Noel P', 'Habermann TM', 'Beard CM', ""O'Fallon WM"", 'Kurland LT']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota 55905.']",['eng'],['AR 30582/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(12)62215-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-6196(12)62215-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 1994 Apr;69(4):323-8. doi: 10.1016/s0025-6196(12)62215-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: We conducted a population study of leukemia diagnosed between 1975 and 1989 in residents of Olmsted County by review of medical records identified through diagnostic indexes, death certificates, autopsy files, and histologic preparations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Diagnoses of leukemia were categorized into various subtypes, and age- and sex-specific incidence rates were calculated for leukemia as a whole and for each subtype. In addition, incidence rates were age- and sex-adjusted to the 1970 US white population for comparison with earlier published rates. Age and annual trends as well as sex differences were assessed with the generalized linear interactive model approach. RESULTS: During 1975 through 1989, the mean annual incidence rate for leukemia was 12.3 per 100,000 population in Olmsted County. When adjusted for age and sex, the rate per 100,000 was 13.6, in comparison with a similarly adjusted rate of 11.8 for the previous decade (1965 through 1974). The rates for chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia remained stable throughout the entire study period; however, rates for acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia increased, most prominently in patients 50 years of age or older. This increased rate occurred in both males and females, but the incidence rates for both subtypes began increasing earlier for males than for females. CONCLUSION: Although we cannot rule out an actual increase in incidence rates for these types of leukemia in the elderly population, we believe that the increase in persons older than 50 years of age reflects social change in improved health care and its better utilization by elderly persons, as well as the ability to diagnose leukemia earlier than in the past.","['Call, T G', 'Noel, P', 'Habermann, T M', 'Beard, C M', ""O'Fallon, W M"", 'Kurland, L T']","['Call TG', 'Noel P', 'Habermann TM', 'Beard CM', ""O'Fallon WM"", 'Kurland LT']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota 55905.']",['eng'],['AR 30582/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(12)62214-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-6196(12)62214-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 1994 Apr;69(4):315-22. doi: 10.1016/s0025-6196(12)62214-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although idarubicin was given in one-fifth of the dose, the intracellular peak concentration was 70% of that of daunorubicin. The initial elimination of idarubicin from leukemic cells was somewhat faster but in the terminal phase the drug was retained longer than daunorubicin. Intracellular concentrations of both metabolites were low and probably of little importance for the activity of the drug.

These findings have prompted investigations into whether human tumor cells may be transduced with the IL2 gene and whether tumor cell lines could be engineered to release IL2. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility of inducing a productive transfer of the IL2 gene into human acute leukemia cells and to assess the phenotypic and proliferative changes generated in the engineered cells, as well as their tumorigenic potential in nude mice. METHODS: Three retroviral vectors (DC/TK/IL2, DC/AD/R/IL2, and N2/CMV/IL2) carrying the IL2 gene were used to transduce three human leukemic cell lines: K562 and U937 (myeloid) and ST4 (lymphoid). Messenger RNA expression of the IL2 gene was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and productive IL2 release using a human IL2 assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The expression of the p55 (alpha) and p75 (beta) chains of the IL2 receptor were determined by RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence. The kinetics of in vitro growth and proliferation of parental and engineered cells were also measured. Parental and IL2 gene-transduced ST4 lymphoblasts were injected into immunosuppressed nude mice that had their tumors measured twice weekly. RESULTS: The productive insertion of the IL2 gene was achieved in all three cell lines studied. The amounts of IL2 constitutively released by the engineered neoplastic cells ranged between 1 and 11 U/mL of IL2 produced from 10(6) cells in 72 hours. A fivefold increase in IL2 production was obtained in ST4 cells by further limiting dilution cloning of the bulk-infected cells. The stable integration of the IL2 gene did not modify the phenotype of the leukemic cells, the expression of the IL2 receptor alpha and beta chains and of several cytokine genes, or the kinetics of in vitro growth and proliferation. In nude mice injected with various IL2-producing ST4 clones, tumor growth associated inversely with the amounts of IL2 secreted by the leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the IL2 gene can be productively transduced into human myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cells without modifying their phenotypic and proliferative properties and that this transduction leads to a reduced or abrogated in vivo tumorigenic potential.","['Cignetti, A', 'Guarini, A', 'Carbone, A', 'Forni, M', 'Cronin, K', 'Forni, G', 'Gansbacher, B', 'Foa, R']","['Cignetti A', 'Guarini A', 'Carbone A', 'Forni M', 'Cronin K', 'Forni G', 'Gansbacher B', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana, Sezione Clinica, University of Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/18 00:00,1994/05/18 00:01,['1994/05/18 00:00'],"['1994/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/86.10.785 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 May 18;86(10):785-91. doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.10.785.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,['IL2'],,,,,,,,,,,

In breast carcinoma, a high-level expression of Hsp27 has been associated with shorter disease-free survival in patients with localized disease. PURPOSE: We have observed variable levels of Hsp27 among neuroblastoma tumors. Our aim in this study was to investigate the relationship between Hsp27 expression and stage of the disease and N-myc gene copy number. METHODS: We determined Hsp27 protein levels in 53 neuroblastoma tumors representing different stages of the disease and in 17 neuroblastoma cell lines by quantitative two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). We also performed statistical analysis of Hsp27 levels in relation to stage of the disease and to N-myc gene copy number. RESULTS: Increased Hsp27 expression in neuroblastomas was associated with limited stage disease and inversely correlated with N-myc gene amplification, a feature known to predict poor clinical outcome. An inverse correlation was also observed between N-myc gene amplification and Hsp27 protein levels among the neuroblastoma cell lines analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining of sections of neuroblastomas showed that Hsp27 was most prominently expressed in the cytoplasm of large ganglionic tumor cells present in neuronally differentiated areas of the tumors. Induction of neuronal differentiation in SMS-KCNR neuroblastoma cells using retinoic acid resulted in an increase in Hsp27. CONCLUSION: High level expression of Hsp27 in neuroblastoma is a feature of limited stage, differentiated tumors. IMPLICATION: Hsp27 may play a part in the biology of neuroblastomas with a favorable outcome.","['Ungar, D R', 'Hailat, N', 'Strahler, J R', 'Kuick, R D', 'Brodeur, G M', 'Seeger, R C', 'Reynolds, C P', 'Hanash, S M']","['Ungar DR', 'Hailat N', 'Strahler JR', 'Kuick RD', 'Brodeur GM', 'Seeger RC', 'Reynolds CP', 'Hanash SM']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor.']",['eng'],"['CA22794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, myc', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuroblastoma/*chemistry/genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/18 00:00,1994/05/18 00:01,['1994/05/18 00:00'],"['1994/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/86.10.780 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 May 18;86(10):780-4. doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.10.780.,['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)'],,,,,,['N-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms of VP-16 cytotoxicity involve DNA breakage secondary to inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II and/or direct drug-induced DNA strand cleavage. The VP-16 molecule contains a hindered phenolic group which is crucial for its antitumor activity because its oxidation yields reactive metabolites (quinones) capable of irreversible binding to macromolecular targets. VP-16 phenoxyl radical is an essential intermediate in VP-16 oxidative activation and can be either converted to oxidation products or reduced by intracellular reductants to its initial phenolic form. In the present paper we demonstrate that the tyrosinase-induced VP-16 phenoxyl radical could be reduced by ascorbate, glutathione (GSH) and dihydrolipoic acid. These reductants caused a transient disappearance of a characteristic VP-16 phenoxyl radical ESR signal which reappeared after depletion of the reductant. The reductants completely prevented VP-16 oxidation by tyrosinase during the lag-period as measured by high performance liquid chromatography; after the lag-period VP-16 oxidation proceeded with the rate observed in the absence of reductants. In homogenates of human K562 leukemic cells, the tyrosinase-induced VP-16 phenoxyl radical ESR signal could be observed only after a lag-period whose duration was dependent on cell concentration; VP-16 oxidation proceeded in cell homogenates after this lag-period. In homogenates of isolated nuclei, the VP-16 phenoxyl radical and VP-16 oxidation were also detected after a lag-period, which was significantly shorter than that observed for an equivalent amount of cells. In both cell homogenates and in nuclear homogenates, the duration of the lag period could be increased by exogenously added reductants. The duration of the lag-period for the appearance of the VP-16 phenoxyl radical signal in the ESR spectrum can be used as a convenient measure of cellular reductive capacity. Interaction of the VP-16 phenoxyl radical with intracellular reductants may be critical for its metabolic activation and cytotoxic effects.","['Stoyanovsky, D', 'Yalowich, J', 'Gantchev, T', 'Kagan, V']","['Stoyanovsky D', 'Yalowich J', 'Gantchev T', 'Kagan V']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15238.']",['eng'],['CA-51657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Free Radic Res Commun,Free radical research communications,8709453,IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deferoxamine/metabolism', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Etoposide/*metabolism', 'Free Radicals', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Monophenol Monooxygenase/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenols/*metabolism', 'Thioctic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10715769309056527 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res Commun. 1993;19(6):371-86. doi: 10.3109/10715769309056527.,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Phenols)', '3229-70-7 (phenoxy radical)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '73Y7P0K73Y (Thioctic Acid)', '7NV2KHU5JA (dihydrolipoic acid)', 'EC 1.14.18.1 (Monophenol Monooxygenase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data suggest differences in the nature and relative involvements of taurine biosynthetic pathways between the two cell lines, a phenomenon that may be related to their differing sensitivities towards chemotherapeutic agents such as adriamycin which promote the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo. However, the 1H NMR data obtained provided no evidence for an increased metabolic consumption of hypotaurine (a metabolic precursor of taurine with powerful .OH radical scavenging properties) in CCRF-CEM cells since differences observed in the hypotaurine: taurine concentration ratio between the drug-sensitive and -resistant cell lines were not statistically significant. Furthermore, hypotaurine is unlikely to compete with alternative endogenous .OH radical scavengers present such as lactate since its level in either of the two cell lines investigated (ca. 6.0 x 10(-8) mol./10(8) cells) is insufficient for it to act as an antioxidant in this context.

The data were compared with the immunophenotypes of lymph node cells from 51 patients with diffuse B small cell lymphoma or leukaemia with lymph node enlargement. The most frequent immunophenotype of B-CLL stage 0 was SIgM(D)+ EmR+ CD5+ CD9+ CD21+ CD23+ CD35- CD38-. Among the lymphomas, EmR-positive and EmR-negative cases were identified. The vast majority of the EmR-positive cases usually showed the leukaemic pattern, immunophenotype and lymph node histology of B-CLL. The EmR-negative cases usually had immunophenotypes quite different from those of B-CLL and the histology of indented cell lymphoma (centrocytic or intermediate) or features of lymphoplasmacytoid/cytic lymphoma. More than 20% of EmR-positive cells proved to be the most important marker to distinguish B-CLL from other lymphocytic lymphomas. Indeed this was a sign of better prognosis. Lymphoplasmacytoid/cytic lymphomas were EmR-positive with the immunophenotype of B-CLL or EmR-negative with a definitely different immunological profile.

Severe thrombo-embolic events occurred in 6 patients. The size of the spleen decreased in all patients who did not develop thrombocytopenia and could absorb adequate HU doses. Acute leukaemia (AL) was diagnosed in 9 patients and a myelodysplastic syndrome in one. Seven of them had been treated with HU alone.

In previously untreated patients with initially normal karyotypes (n = 19), chromosome abnormalities developed during HU therapy in 7 (37%).

In this study, we have cloned and sequenced the smaller H1(0)-related mRNA. This mRNA seems to be produced by the use of an additional polyadenylation signal present in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the initial transcript. This smaller H1(0)-encoding mRNA is expressed only in mouse and is transferred into polysomes as efficiently as the larger version upon the induction of cell differentiation. The use of the described polyadenylation site removes over 1 kb of the 3' UTR of H1(0) mRNA and seems to be involved in the regulation of H1(0) mRNA stability.","['Brocard, M P', 'Rousseau, D', 'Lawrence, J J', 'Khochbin, S']","['Brocard MP', 'Rousseau D', 'Lawrence JJ', 'Khochbin S']","[""INSERM U309, Departement de Biologie Moleculaire et Structurale, Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires de Grenoble, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Drug Stability', 'Histones/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poly A/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18754.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1994 Apr 1;221(1):421-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18754.x.,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)']",,,,,['GENBANK/X72894'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were sorted into CD45- and CD45+ populations and shown to be clonal in origin. T-cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking or coligation of the TCR with its CD4/CD8 co-receptors induced tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium signals in CD45+ but not in CD45- cells. Unexpectedly, whole cell p56lck and p59fyn tyrosine kinase activities were not reduced in CD45- compared to CD45+ cells. A novel technique was therefore developed to isolated specific pools of aggregated receptors expressed at the cell surface, together with their associated tyrosine kinases. Using this technique it was shown that cell surface CD4-p56lck kinase activity was 78% lower in CD45- than in CD45+ cells. Phosphorylation of TCR zeta- and gamma-chains occurred in TCR immunocomplexes from CD45+ but not CD45- cells, despite comparable levels of p59fyn and TCR proteins. Furthermore, TCR-associated tyrosine kinase activity towards an exogenous substrate was 84% lower in CD45- than in CD45+ cells. Addition of recombinant p59fyn to TCR immunocomplexes isolated from CD45-cells restored the phosphorylation of the TCR zeta- and gamma-chains. Our results demonstrate that CD45 selectively regulates the pools of p59fyn and p56lck kinases which are associated with the TCR and CD4 at the cell surface. Activation by CD45 of these receptor-associated kinase pools correlates with the ability of the TCR and its coreceptors to couple to intracellular signalling pathways.","['Biffen, M', 'McMichael-Phillips, D', 'Larson, T', 'Venkitaraman, A', 'Alexander, D']","['Biffen M', 'McMichael-Phillips D', 'Larson T', 'Venkitaraman A', 'Alexander D']","['Department of Immunology, AFRC Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['CD4 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1994 Apr 15;13(8):1920-9.,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,PMC395033,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method was optimized using the human leukemia cell lines HL-60 and K-562. Samples of 10(5) ethanol-fixed cells were treated with pepsin/HCl and stained as a nuclear suspension with anti-BrdUrd antibody, FITC-conjugated secondary antibody, and propidium iodide. Labelled mitoses could be discriminated from unlabelled mitoses, and from labelled and unlabelled G2 cells, by their intermediate log FITC fluorescence intensity. In addition, mitoses and G2 nuclei differed in forward and orthogonal light scattering, but had equal intensity of propidium iodide fluorescence. This method for discrimination of labelled mitoses was also tested on cultured normal adult human keratinocytes labelled with iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd). In keratinocytes, where the cell structure was preserved after pepsin/HCl, IdUrd labelled mitotic cells were similarly discriminated in the log FITC/propidium iodide fluorescence distribution.

We have investigated the utility of a pH sensitive ligand for the formyl peptide receptor, CHO-Met-Leu-Phe-Phe-Lys (SNAFL)-OH (SNAFL-seminaphtho-fluorescein), because in previous studies (Fay et al.: Biochemistry 30:5066-5075, 1991) protonation has been used to explain the quenching when the fluoresceinated formyl pentapeptide ligand binds to this receptor. Moreover, acidification in intracellular compartments is a general mechanism occurring in cells during processing of ligand-receptor complexes. Because the protonated form of SNAFL is excited at 488 nm with emission at 530 nm and the unprotonated form is excited at 568 nm with emission at 650 nm, the ratio of protonated and unprotonated forms can be examined by multiparameter flow cytometry. We found that the receptor-bound ligand is sensitive to both the extracellular and intracellular pH. There is a small increase in the pKa of the ligand upon binding to the receptor consistent with protonation in the binding pocket. Once internalized, spectral changes in the probe consistent with acidification and ligand dissociation from the receptor are observed.","['Fay, S P', 'Habbersett, R', 'Domalewski, M D', 'Posner, R G', 'Houghton, T G', 'Pierson, E', 'Muthukumaraswamy, N', 'Whitaker, J', 'Haugland, R P', 'Freer, R J']","['Fay SP', 'Habbersett R', 'Domalewski MD', 'Posner RG', 'Houghton TG', 'Pierson E', 'Muthukumaraswamy N', 'Whitaker J', 'Haugland RP', 'Freer RJ', 'et al.']","['Department of Cytometry, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque 87131.']",['eng'],"['AI-25832/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI19032/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01315/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Extracellular Space/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluoresceins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intracellular Fluid/chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/*analysis/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990150208 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1994 Feb 1;15(2):148-53. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990150208.,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-phenylalanyl-lysine', 'seminaphthofluorescein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of the inhibitory action of ETOH was investigated. Cells were pulsed with [3H]choline for 30 min and chased in the presence or absence of ETOH for up to 6 h. PC biosynthesis was inhibited drastically within 1 h after exposure to ETOH which increased intracellular cAMP appreciably. After a 3-h treatment, ETOH significantly inhibited both choline kinase (CK) and the cytosolic CTP: cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase (CT). The inactivated CT was no longer stimulated by exogenous phosphatidylglycerol (PG). There was no evidence for redistribution of CT activity between cytosol and microsomes. When cells were exposed to 8-Bromo-cAMP ranging from 100 to 300 microM, PC biosynthesis remained unaffected despite the drastically elevated cAMP. These results seem to suggest that the raised cAMP is not a prerequisite for the inhibition of PC biosynthesis in U937 cells. Following pretreatment with protein kinase inhibitors (H-89 and K-252a), PC biosynthesis was decreased significantly and the inhibitory effect of ETOH was potentiated. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibition of PC biosynthesis and the inhibitory effect of ETOH are independent of the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Unlike protein kinase inhibitors, pretreatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erbstatin, genistein and tyrphostin 25) resulted in differential effects on PC biosynthesis and on the inhibitory action of ETOH. Genistein stimulated PC biosynthesis by 30 per cent as well as partially preventing/reversing the ETOH action, while tyrphostin 25 produced a synergistic inhibition. The relevance of tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation to the regulation of PC biosynthesis and ETOH action remains to be established.","['Chu, A J']",['Chu AJ'],"['Miami Heart Institute, Miami Beach, FL 33140-2999.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Choline Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Ethanol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbf.290120107 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1994 Jan;12(1):45-55. doi: 10.1002/cbf.290120107.,"['0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.1.32 (Choline Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.15 (Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transplantation was substantially improved by preadaptation of BALL-1 by serial passages in newborn and young nude mice. We were able to establish the desirable conditions where 100% of SCID and nude mice that were inoculated i.p. with various doses of the adapted BALL-1 (termed BALL-1a) developed tumors. Tumors in SCID mice were disseminated to various tissues in a manner analogous to tumors in patients with B leukemia/lymphoma, whereas tumors in nude mice were not as widely disseminated and grew mainly as ascites. Flow cytometric analyses showed that all of the 11 tested cell surface markers of the parental BALL-1 were well maintained on the tumor cells recovered from the SCID and nude mice. The utility of the developed tumor models for the therapeutic studies was investigated by i.p. or i.v. administration of an anti-B leukemia/lymphoma monoclonal antibody, termed SN7 (IgG1 kappa), and SN7 immunotoxin (IT) that was prepared by conjugating SN7 to ricin A chain (RA) or deglycosylated RA (dgRA). In the nude mouse model study, SN7-RA that had been administered i.p. suppressed the tumor growth completely in all of the treated mice (n = 5) without any sign of tumor or undesirable side effects for as long as followed (i.e., 350 days), whereas unconjugated SN7 showed only a slight therapeutic effect. A control RA conjugate was not effective. In the SCID mouse model studies, several sets of experiments were carried out by i.p. or i.v. administration of IT, monoclonal antibody, or control IT. In the first three sets of experiments, SCID mice inoculated with 1.1 x 10(6) BALL-1a cells received an i.p. administration of phosphate-buffered saline or three different doses (i.e., 4 x 10 micrograms, 4 x 20 micrograms, and 4 x 30 micrograms) of therapeutic agents (SN7-RA and SN7). Virtually an identical result was obtained from the three experiments. All of the phosphate-buffered saline control group mice (n = 15) died within 35 days post tumor inoculation. In contrast, all of the mice that were treated with SN7-RA (n = 19) or with SN7 (n = 15) survived for as long as followed (i.e., 250 days).

Five of these antifolates were more growth inhibitory to the CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell line than methotrexate [MTX; drug concentration effective at inhibiting cell growth by 50% relative to untreated control (EC50), 12 nM], the antifolate used in the clinic, and two were more potent than 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin (EC50, 2.7 nM); similar patterns of response were obtained in the FaDu and A253 squamous carcinoma cell lines. In addition, the growth inhibitory potency of these antifolates was generally less dependent on exposure time than was MTX. Growth inhibitory effects could be reversed by leucovorin, indicating an antifolate mechanism. These antifolates targeted dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) based on direct human DHFR inhibition assays [drug concentration inhibiting enzyme activity by 50% (IC50), 0.6-28 nM; MTX IC50, 0.8 nM] and the cross-resistance of MTX-resistant CCRF-CEM cells containing elevated DHFR. Inhibition of human thymidylate synthase was generally weak. These 6,5-fused ring heterocyclic antifolates utilized the reduced folate/MTX transporter for uptake, based on the cross-resistance of MTX uptake-impaired CCRF-CEM cells, and were efficient substrates for this uptake system, based on inhibition of [3H]MTX uptake (IC50, 0.3-5.8 microM; aminopterin IC50, 2.6 microM). These analogues were substrates for CCRF-CEM folylpolyglutamate synthetase, with several being among the most active substrates now known (highest Vrel/Km 0.73; MTX and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, 0.013 and 0.24, respectively). Substrate activity for murine intestinal folylpolyglutamate synthetase was also assayed, and a different specificity pattern was observed. These new antifolates are apparently not substrates for aldehyde oxidase. Analogues containing the fused cyclopentene ring are preferred to those containing the fused pyrrole ring based on growth inhibitory potency, effectiveness against decreased uptake mutants and apparent affinity for transport, and inhibition of DHFR.

The chimeric BCR/ABL gene produces a P210 fusion protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. We have recently isolated a complementary DNA, CRKL, which could code for an adaptor protein consisting of one SH2 and two SH3 domains and lacking any catalytic domain. In the current study, we show that CRKL is highly phosphorylated in the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and that it is a substrate for the p210 BCR/ABL and p145 ABL kinases. BCR/ABL and ABL are coimmunoprecipitated with CRKL in vivo, demonstrating that relatively stable complexes are formed. In addition, the nucleotide exchange factor mSOS1 was found to be coimmunoprecipitated with CRKL. These findings establish a putative signal transduction pathway way through which BCR/ABL mediates its oncogenic activity.","['ten Hoeve, J', 'Kaartinen, V', 'Fioretos, T', 'Haataja, L', 'Voncken, J W', 'Heisterkamp, N', 'Groffen, J']","['ten Hoeve J', 'Kaartinen V', 'Fioretos T', 'Haataja L', 'Voncken JW', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Groffen J']","['Department of Pathology, Childrens Hospital of Los Angles, California 90027.']",['eng'],['CA47456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 May 15;54(10):2563-7.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,['CRKL'],,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of PLC has been investigated in nuclei of Friend erythroleukemia cells. Both beta and gamma isoforms are present in these nuclei. When Friend cells undergo terminal erythroid differentiation in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide the PLC beta isoform is down-regulated as shown by immunochemical and immunocytochemical analysis, by determination of enzymatic activity directly and in the presence of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and also by Northern blot for PLC beta message. By contrast, the amount of PLC gamma and its activity are unaffected by erythroid differentiation. Thus, the presence of a nuclear PLC beta, the activity and expression of which are modulated during differentiation of erythroleukemia cells, implicates a role for nuclear phosphoinositide signaling in the processes of cell determination and indicates the nuclear PLC beta as a key enzyme of the cycle in relation to the erythroid differentiative commitment of murine erythroleukemia cells.","['Martelli, A M', 'Billi, A M', 'Gilmour, R S', 'Neri, L M', 'Manzoli, L', 'Ognibene, A', 'Cocco, L']","['Martelli AM', 'Billi AM', 'Gilmour RS', 'Neri LM', 'Manzoli L', 'Ognibene A', 'Cocco L']","['Department of Morphology, University of Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 May 15;54(10):2536-40.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations in immune status of patients with various cancers may result in release of cytokines in circulation. The authors measured the circulating levels of IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, sCD23, and sIL-2R from patients with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (T-CLL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) to determine their importance in these T-cell disorders. METHODS: IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, sCD23, and sIL-2R levels were measured from the serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or bioassay methods. RESULTS: IL-4 levels were higher only in T-CLL, whereas, IFN-gamma and sIL-2R levels were higher in T-CLL and T-ALL. However, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and sCD23 levels were higher in PTCL. CONCLUSIONS: T-cell-derived IL-4 and IFN-gamma in T-CLL may act as an autocrine growth factor for proliferation of neoplastic T-cells. The sIL-2R levels in T-CLL, T-ALL, and PTCL are an indication of the degree of T-cell or immune activation due to concomitant immunologic processes in these disorders. However, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and sCD23 levels may contribute to inflammatory response and provide evidence of monocyte/macrophage, T-cell, or B-cell aberrations in PTCL.","['Raziuddin, S', 'Sheikha, A', 'Abu-Eshy, S', 'al-Janadi, M']","['Raziuddin S', 'Sheikha A', 'Abu-Eshy S', 'al-Janadi M']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, King Saud University, College of Medicine, Abha, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'CD3 Complex/blood', 'CD4 Antigens/blood', 'CD8 Antigens/blood', 'Child', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Interleukin-4/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*analysis', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940501)73:9<2426::aid-cncr2820730928>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 May 1;73(9):2426-31. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940501)73:9<2426::aid-cncr2820730928>3.0.co;2-k.,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age was 46 years, with no gender predominance. Seventy-three percent had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and deletion of chromosome 7 or monosomy 7 was the predominant cytogenetic abnormality. No temporal relation between the onset of diabetes insipidus and the leukemia was found. In none of the previously reported cases was diabetes insipidus the first manifestation of the leukemia recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The temporal relationship between diabetes insipidus and leukemia is inconsistent. The former may precede, follow, or present concomitantly with the latter.

Risk factors and outcome under empirical antimicrobial therapy in a randomized multicenter study.,2296-304,"BACKGROUND: Different empirical approaches to antimicrobial treatment of lung infiltrates in patients with neutropenia were studied within a prospective, randomized multicenter trial. METHODS: Patients with neutropenia with hematologic malignancies and fever of 38.5 degrees C or higher associated with newly diagnosed lung infiltrates were randomized for an initial therapy with acylaminopenicillin plus aminoglycoside (Group A), third-generation cephalosporin plus aminoglycoside (Group B), or the double beta-lactam combination (Group C), each in combination with rifampin. Nonresponders were given empirical amphotericin B plus 5-fluorocytosine beginning on day 4, day 5, or day 6 under study. RESULTS: Of 295 patients entered, 91.2% were evaluable. Complete response was obtained in 61.3% with no significant difference between treatment groups. The addition of rifampin did not improve treatment results. Only 27.1% of patients achieved a complete response by antibiotic therapy without additional antifungal therapy. Fungi dominated in cases of microbiologically documented infections and were associated with a poorer outcome compared with bacterial pneumonias. The trend of leukocyte counts under study had a highly significant effect on the outcome of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Lung infiltrates in febrile patients with neutropenia represent a high risk of treatment failure. Persistent neutropenia has a significantly adverse effect on the outcome of infection. Incorporation of systemic antifungal agents into first-line therapy, particularly in selected high-risk subgroups, might improve future treatment results. The quality of diagnostic techniques to establish the etiology of pulmonary infiltrates needs to be improved.","['Maschmeyer, G', 'Link, H', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Meyer, P', 'Helmerking, M', 'Eisenmann, E', 'Schmitt, J', 'Adam, D']","['Maschmeyer G', 'Link H', 'Hiddemann W', 'Meyer P', 'Helmerking M', 'Eisenmann E', 'Schmitt J', 'Adam D']","['Evangelisches Krankenhaus Essen-Werden, Medizinische Klinik, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Fever/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lung Diseases/complications/*drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940501)73:9<2296::aid-cncr2820730910>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 May 1;73(9):2296-304. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940501)73:9<2296::aid-cncr2820730910>3.0.co;2-7.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied sIL-2R levels in patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, and/or graft versus host disease (GVHD) following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Our study included 36 patients after T-cell depleted allogenic BMT and 11 healthy controls. Mean sIL-2R serum levels were significantly higher after BMT than before (1273 u/ml vs. 629 u/ml, respectively, p < 0.007). In the patients who developed CMV disease, with or without GVHD, mean sIL-2R levels increased significantly (2866 u/ml p < 0.004); there was a drop after recovery (1949 u/ml), but not a return to pre-CMV onset levels. Similar elevated sIL-2R levels were found in patients during CMV disease only, GVHD only, or both. In patients who developed GVHD, sIL-2R levels were positively correlated with the severity of GVHD (Pearson's correlation coefficient .8322, p < 0.003).

The recognition of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with minimally differentiation (AML-M0) is established with methods that include myeloid markers CD13/CD33 and detection of MPO in blast cells by immunological techniques or electron microscopy cytochemistry (EM). We have analysed the presence of MPO in leukaemic blast cells by conventional cytochemistry and immunological methods using a monoclonal antibody anti-MPO (CLB-MPO1) in 121 cases of acute leukaemia. The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity of this McAb to identify AML-M0, as CD13/CD33 can be expressed in some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and EM cytochemistry is not always available in many laboratories. Anti-MPO was positive in all cases of AML (M1-M5) which were positive by Sudan Black B reaction in similar or higher percentage ratio for each case, although in some of them did not label with CD13/CD33 tested by IF and IPc techniques. Based on the anti-MPO positivity, 5 out of 10 cases called undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) were reclassified as AML-M0, though 4 cases were CD13/CD33 negative. Furthermore, after analysing the anti-MPO expression among 32 cases of ALL, we had to reclassify four of them as acute biphenotypic leukaemia. We conclude that anti-MPO is a very sensitive and reliable tool in AML diagnosis and has an important role in distinguishing minimally differentiated AML and biphenotypic acute leukaemia from AUL and ALL.","['Praxedes, M K', 'De Oliveira, L Z', 'Pereira, W da V', 'Quintana, I Z', 'Tabak, D G', 'De Oliveira, M S']","['Praxedes MK', 'De Oliveira LZ', 'Pereira Wda V', 'Quintana IZ', 'Tabak DG', 'De Oliveira MS']","['Department of Clinical Haematology of University Hospital, UFF, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/*analysis/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409059594 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Jan;12(3-4):233-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199409059594.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect continued after removal of the ODN from the medium. Blocking of self-renewal of the leukemic blast stem cells in secondary plating of cells from cloning assays by two of the p53 ODNs was also observed. Control ODNs had no effect on leukemic blasts. Treatment of normal bone marrow cells with the four p53 ODNs did not influence their growth, nor was there any effect by the p53 ODNs on the leukemic cell-line, HL60, that does not express p53.

In particular, beta 1 subfamily integrins (VLA 1-6 proteins) have been found to mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) component such as fibronectin, collagen, laminin; however, VLA-4 has been found to exhibit both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion functions. The reactivity of VLAs is virtually ubiquitous and independent of line or tissue specificity. However, the expression of individual VLAs within single tissues can be modulated according to the type or functional status of the cell. One of the main reasons for interest in these molecules is that they may play a determining role in neoplastic transformation and diffusion; in particular, in lymphoproliferative syndromes, a lack of cell adhesiveness or an abnormal adhesion pattern in neoplastic lymphocytes may free these cells from regulation, thus contributing towards the development of leukemia and/or lymphoma. Studies of VLA expression in B-cell leukemia/lymphomas show a modulation of VLA3 and VLA4 reactivity. The most interesting element is the identification of a VLA3/VLA4 pattern associated with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) characterised by a reduced expression of VLA4 and the constant expression of VLA3. Although the value of VLA3 as an additional marker for the diagnosis of classical B-CLL is indisputable, the biological/functional significance of this reactivity remains to be confirmed.","['Baldini, L G', 'Cro, L M']","['Baldini LG', 'Cro LM']","['Servizio di Ematologia, Centro G.

The scientific importance of human T-ALL has resided in its role as a cancer prototype, permitting the identification of novel genes centrally involved in both neoplastic change and normal cellular differentiation.

Grade II-IV of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was similar in the two groups, but grade III-IV and chronic disease was more common in the busulfan-treated group (P = .04). Death associated with GVHD occurred in 17% of the busulfan-treated group and 2% of the TBI group (P = .003). Patients treated with busulfan had a 3-year actuarial survival of 62%, which was worse than the 76% among those treated with TBI (P < .03). In multivariate analysis, poor survival was associated with advanced disease (P < .0001), no posttransplant septicemia (P = .0006), grade II-IV GVHD (P = .006), and busulfan treatment (P < .02). The incidence of relapse did not differ between the two groups. Relapse-free survival was also similar in the two treatment groups on analysis of data from all patients, children, patients with early disease, and those with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia. However, in adults (P = .05) and patients with advanced disease (P = .005), leukemia-free survival was significantly better in those treated with TBI. We conclude that patients treated with busulfan have more early toxicity and an increased transplant-related mortality in patients with advanced disease. TBI is therefore the treatment of choice, especially in adults and patients with advanced disease. However, busulfan is an acceptable alternative for patients with early disease and for those in whom TBI is not feasible.","['Ringden, O', 'Ruutu, T', 'Remberger, M', 'Nikoskelainen, J', 'Volin, L', 'Vindelov, L', 'Parkkali, T', 'Lenhoff, S', 'Sallerfors, B', 'Ljungman, P']","['Ringden O', 'Ruutu T', 'Remberger M', 'Nikoskelainen J', 'Volin L', 'Vindelov L', 'Parkkali T', 'Lenhoff S', 'Sallerfors B', 'Ljungman P', 'et al.']","['Division of Clinical Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystitis/epidemiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70051-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 1;83(9):2723-30.,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for catalase, indirect immunocytofluorescence of immature leukemic promyelocytes (HL-60 cells) showed a pattern of small, sharp, punctate staining in the cytoplasm of all cells, while mature neutrophils showed a larger diffuse, flocculent pattern of cytoplasmic staining. Differential centrifugation of nitrogen cavitates of HL-60 cells indicated that the putative catalase-containing compartment was relatively fragile compared with the compartment(s) that contained myeloperoxidase (MPO), beta-hexosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase, and lysosomal alpha-mannosidase activities. Parallel studies using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-induced HL-60 cells and mature neutrophils showed that, in the course of differentiation, there was an apparent shift in the localization of catalase from the granule fraction to the cytosolic fraction. Percoll-sucrose density gradient centrifugation of HL-60 cell cavitates showed a catalase-containing compartment with a mean peak density (1.05 g/mL) significantly lower than that of the major myeloperoxidase-containing compartment (1.08 g/mL); in mature neutrophils, catalase activity comigrated with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Catalase in isolated fractions was protected from proteolysis in the absence, but not in the presence, of 0.1% Triton X-100. Digitonin titration experiments confirmed the compartmentalized nature of catalase in immature HL-60 cells and were consistent with a cytosolic localization in mature neutrophils. Ultrastructural localization of catalase by Protein A-gold immunocytochemistry demonstrated four to six catalase-containing compartments in all HL-60 cell profiles. In mature neutrophils, catalase was localized primarily in the cytoplasmic matrix, although in fewer than 2% of the cell profiles, one to two catalase-containing compartments were observed. The changes in catalase localization that occur during myeloid differentiation appear to be similar to the changes that occur during erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation, and may have potential clinical significance in the classification of acute leukemia and in the development of drug resistance.","['Ballinger, C A', 'Mendis-Handagama, C', 'Kalmar, J R', 'Arnold, R R', 'Kinkade, J M Jr']","['Ballinger CA', 'Mendis-Handagama C', 'Kalmar JR', 'Arnold RR', 'Kinkade JM Jr']","['Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",['eng'],"['CA22294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE06869/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Catalase/*analysis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Digitonin/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70043-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 1;83(9):2654-68.,"['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 55 cases of small lymphocytic (sm lym) NHL, deletions of 6(q21q23) were the most common recurring cytogenetic abnormality. Among 14 sm lym NHL with del(6)(q21q23), this abnormality occurred as a solitary change in 3 cases. Each of these 3 cases, and 5 additional cases with del(6q) and other abnormalities, showed atypical larger forms with the morphologic appearance of prolymphocytes or paraimmunoblasts in the peripheral blood. In comparison, of the 11 cases without del(6q) and circulating abnormal cells, prolymphocytoid forms were observed in 4 cases (P < .001). Of the 31 sm lym without del(6q), trisomies of chromosomes 3, 12, or 18, or t(11;14)(q13;q32) occurred in greater than 10% of cases. Proliferation centers or infiltration by larger forms were observed in similar proportions of tissue sections derived from sm lym NHL with or without del(6q). The presence of the larger forms in the peripheral blood did not have an adverse prognostic impact on the survival of the del(6q) cohort, who experienced a median survival in excess of 6 years. All 14 cases of del(6q) sm lym NHL were characterized by a mature B-cell phenotype. Expression of CD11c, a feature of a CLL/PLL variant previously described, was not detected in 9 cases analyzed. In 5 cases of del(6q) sm lym NHL, no circulating abnormal lymphocytes were noted. Twelve cases presented with, or developed, clinical splenomegaly. These results suggest that deletion of a gene or genes at 6q21-23 is associated with the pathogenesis of a subset of B-cell sm lym NHL that may display larger prolymphocytoid cells in the peripheral blood, but that follows a clinical course typical of other well-differentiated lymphocytic neoplasms.","['Offit, K', 'Louie, D C', 'Parsa, N Z', 'Filippa, D', 'Gangi, M', 'Siebert, R', 'Chaganti, R S']","['Offit K', 'Louie DC', 'Parsa NZ', 'Filippa D', 'Gangi M', 'Siebert R', 'Chaganti RS']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70038-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 1;83(9):2611-8.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The selected carbohydrate ligands mainly encompass common components of natural glycoconjugates as mono- or disaccharides. The monocytoid cells of the THP-1 line, the very young myeloblasts and the myeloblasts of the lines KG-1a and KG-1, the promyelocytes of the HL-60 line, and the early myeloblasts/erythroblasts of the K-562 line displayed a nonuniform pattern of specific binding with quantitative differences at a fixed, nonsaturating concentration of the probes. Scatchard analysis in four cases corroborated the indication of cell-type-related differences between the various cell lines. To test whether the detectable cellular sugar-binding sites can mediate adhesion to glycoligands, a rather simple model matrix of nitrocellulose-immobilized neoglycoproteins was first used. In comparison to the carbohydrate-free carrier protein significant cell adhesion was observed primarily with neoglycoproteins that exposed galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, and fucose moieties among the 11 tested types of carbohydrate residue. Subsequently, human bone marrow stromal cell layers were tested as a model matrix with increased levels of physiological relevance and complexity. Mixtures of carbohydrate and neoglycoprotein were employed as inhibitors of an interaction via lectins between the stromal and the tumor cells. The carbohydrate-dependent alterations of this parameter revealed cell-type-associated properties. Tumor cell binding was significantly decreased for not more than two lines with the effective sugars, namely N-acetylgalactosamine, mannose, fucose, and sialic acid.","['Gabius, S', 'Wawotzny, R', 'Martin, U', 'Wilholm, S', 'Gabius, H J']","['Gabius S', 'Wawotzny R', 'Martin U', 'Wilholm S', 'Gabius HJ']","['Institut fur Physiologische Chemie, Tierarztliche Fakultat, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carbohydrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01727416 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1994 Mar;68(3):125-32. doi: 10.1007/BF01727416.,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both OA and CL-A induced the long-lasting release of serotonin in an extracellular Ca(2+)-independent manner. CL-A did not increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the fura-2-loaded cells. CL-A was 100-fold more potent than OA in inducing the release, suggesting that PP1 is a dominant protein phosphatase in regulating RBL-2H3 cells. The CL-A-induced release of serotonin was completely inhibited by the nonselective protein kinase inhibitors, staurosporine and K-252a. CL-A induced phosphorylation of several cellular proteins in RBL-2H3 cells, which could be inhibited by staurosporine.

(2) The activity was linear with respect to time and cell number. (3) The enzymatic activity on splenocytes and on the NK leukemia cell line CRNK-16, but not on IL-2 activated NK (A-NK) cells, was sensitive to trypsin treatment. (4) The AP activity on intact cells had a broad pH dependency with optimal activity at slightly alkaline pH but lower activity at acidic pH. (5) There was a preference for neutral substrates and essentially no activity towards acidic substrates. (6) Enzymatic activity was inhibited in the presence of the AP inhibitors bestatin and amastatin, and in the presence of the chelator, 1,10 phenanthroline, indicating the involvement of a metalloprotease. (7) Culture of A-NK cells with bestatin resulted in a decrease in cytotoxicity against YAC-1 and P815 targets. Amastatin treatment caused only a slight decrease in cytotoxicity against YAC-1 targets, but a significant decrease in cytotoxicity against P815 targets. (8) Treatment of A-NK cultures with specific inhibitors of APases caused an increase in expression of CD2 (an increase from 20-80% with bestatin and an increase from 25-35% in the presence of amastatin). These results provide the first evidence for the existence of APases on the surface of NK cells and suggest a role for these enzymes in the regulation of cytotoxic activity and of CD2 surface expression.","['Amoscato, A A', 'Spiess, R R', 'Brumfield, A M', 'Herberman, R B', 'Chambers, W H']","['Amoscato AA', 'Spiess RR', 'Brumfield AM', 'Herberman RB', 'Chambers WH']","['Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, PA 15213.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Aminopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*enzymology', 'Endopeptidases', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*enzymology', 'Leucine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Peptides', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/28 00:00,1994/04/28 00:01,['1994/04/28 00:00'],"['1994/04/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/28 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(94)90244-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(94)90244-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1994 Apr 28;1221(3):221-32. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(94)90244-5.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '67655-94-1 (amastatin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DACH can exist as the trans-1R,2R, trans-1S,2S or cis isomer, and we have previously established that the R,R form of DACH-Pt(II) complex is in general superior. Here, we have examined if specific axial and/or equatorial ligands attached to a platinum(IV) center can modulate the antitumor activities of R,R-DACH-Pt complexes in murine tumor models in vivo. Four series of R,R-DACH-Pt complexes were synthesized, with each series consisting of one platinum(II) complex and three corresponding platinum(IV) analogs, each differing by the chemical nature of the axial ligand (chloro, hydroxo or acetato). Combination of axial chloro with equatorial chloro (Cl2Cl2), 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato (Cl2CBDCA), tartronato (Cl2Tart) or methylmalonato (Cl2MeMal) gave activities which were similar to or greater than those of the corresponding platinum(II) complex in the cisplatin-sensitive L1210/0 or cisplatin-resistant L1210/DDP leukemia and solid M5076 reticulosarcoma models. The exception was the complex Cl2Cl2 in the M5076 model, which was 2-fold less sensitive to this platinum(IV) complex than to the corresponding platinum(II) analog. Axial hydroxo or acetato platinum(IV) complexes were effective in combination with equatorial chloro ([OH]2Cl2 or Ac2Cl2) or tartronato ([OH]2Tart or Ac2Tart) against L1210/0, L1210/DDP and M5076 cells, but effective only against M5076 cells when combined with equatorial 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato (CBDCA) or methylmalonato. The results demonstrated a profound effect of axial and equatorial ligands on the antitumor activities of R,R-DACH-Pt(IV) complexes. Furthermore, these modulatory effects could be influenced strongly by the tumor model.

Three pairs of isomers of quinoline complexes [amino dichloro quinoline platinum (II)] were studied in this context. For the cis 5- and 6-nitroquinoline complexes, the DNA binding and toxicity were higher with the 5-substituted ligand. Reduction potentials were similar (-260 and -280 mV). No selectivity for hypoxic toxicity was observed, but radiosensitizing ability by both complexes was greater in hypoxic (than oxic) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The trans 5-nitroquinoline complex produced better sensitization in hypoxia than its cis isomer [enhancement ratio (ER) 1.7 at 10 microM versus 40 microM for cis]. However, this was accompanied by some aerobic sensitization. The trans isomer of the (unsubstituted) quinoline complex was considerably more toxic than its cis isomer. Neither showed selectivity for hypoxia, either as radiosensitizers or as cytotoxins, which may be attributable to the lack of a reducible (nitro) function. Four quinoline complexes showed high activity in cisplatin-resistant L1210 cells, with the lowest resistance factor being for the trans quinoline complex. Results suggest that trans complexes with one aromatic ring may have activity different from the cis geometry, which should be exploited with respect to cisplatin resistance and cross-resistance with radiation.","['Skov, K A', 'Adomat, H', 'Doedee, M', 'Farrell, N']","['Skov KA', 'Adomat H', 'Doedee M', 'Farrell N']","['Medical Biophysics Department, B.C.

Combination of CBDCA and divicine, at a 2:1 ratio, increased cytotoxicity considerably. Under specific conditions of time schedule of administration, the association of CBDCA and divicine resulted in a clear synergistic activity. Alkaline elution studies on both unirradiated and gamma-irradiated MELC demonstrated opposite patterns of DNA damage with the two molecules. Thus, CBDCA elicited DNA interstrand crosslinks (ISC), while divicine resulted in DNA single strand breaks (SSB). Association of both molecules led in the unirradiated cells to a higher SSB frequency than recorded with divicine alone. Accordingly, intracellular activation of CDBCA by redox cycling of divicine seems not to be involved.

In the other pair, a methylated site was identified between positions -242 and -580 within the -650 bp promoter region of the resistant daughter cell only. The identity of the sequence from all four cell lines indicates that mutations in the topo II alpha gene promoter of PMA-resistant cells cannot explain the absence of topo II alpha mRNA down-regulation following PMA treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of children newly diagnosed with ALL. Plasma samples were obtained at four time points: at diagnosis before therapy, 5 days after administration of L-asparaginase alone, after the remission induction program, and at completion of the consolidation phase. Plasma levels of 21 hemostatic proteins were measured. The amount of thrombin generated following activation with an APTT reagent was quantitated. RESULTS: At diagnosis there were significant elevations in factors VIII, IX, von Willebrand, alpha 2-macroglobulin and protein S. In contrast, there were significant reductions in protein C, prekallikrein, and factors XIIIA and XIIIS. L-asparaginase treatment alone decreased concentrations of 11 proteins, with antithrombin III being affected to the greatest extent. After multiagent chemotherapy, not including L-asparaginase, concentrations of most proteins increased to or above baseline. At completion of consolidation therapy, which included weekly L-asparaginase administration, concentrations of most proteins were decreased compared with baseline values. The amount of thrombin generated following activation with an APTT reagent was similar to adults. CONCLUSION: Plasma concentrations of coagulation proteins are affected by disease (ALL) alone and by combination chemotherapy with or without L-asparaginase.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and five patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplant, or induction therapy for acute leukemia in 1988 and 1989 were studied. Patients were stratified according to the type of therapy, and randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID, or a combination of oral neomycin 250 mg QID, polymyxin-B 100 mg QID, and oral nalidixic acid 1,000 mg BID. Treatment began on admission and continued until the absolute granulocyte count was greater than 500/mm3 for 3 consecutive days. RESULTS: The 96 evaluable patients were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment groups; 63 patients received ciprofloxacin and 33 received NPN. Fever developed in 92% of patients on ciprofloxacin and in 97% of patients on NPN. (P = 0.66), 6.6 +/- 5.8 and 7.2 +/- 5.3 days from the start of prophylaxis, respectively. Twenty-five patients on ciprofloxacin developed 29 microbiologically documented infections, fewer than the 26 infections in the 22 patients on NPN (P = 0.02). Patients on ciprofloxacin had fewer bacteremias (33%) than did the NPN patients (55%) (P = 0.05). Gram-negative bacteremias were very rare (2 cases; no Enterobacteriaceae), but streptococcal bacteremias were frequent in both arms (27 cases). Side effects were not significantly different, but compliance with ciprofloxacin was better. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin is at least as effective as the combination of neomycin/polymyxin/nalidixic acid in the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in myelosuppressed patients, and is better tolerated. Additional agents to prevent streptococcal infections are needed.","['Jansen, J', 'Cromer, M', 'Akard, L', 'Black, J R', 'Wheat, L J', 'Allen, S D']","['Jansen J', 'Cromer M', 'Akard L', 'Black JR', 'Wheat LJ', 'Allen SD']","['Methodist Hospital of Indiana, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*complications/etiology', 'Ciprofloxacin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intestines/*drug effects/microbiology', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nalidixic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Neomycin/administration & dosage', 'Patient Compliance', 'Polymyxin B/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(94)90063-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(94)90063-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1994 Apr;96(4):335-41. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(94)90063-9.,"['3B91HWA56M (Nalidixic Acid)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)', 'J2VZ07J96K (Polymyxin B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exposure of each study subject to electric and magnetic fields was evaluated from cumulative exposure measures based on present measurements and historical data. Limited information on potential confounders such as creosote, solvents, and herbicides was also collected; information on whether the subject had smoked was obtained by interviews with the subjects or work colleagues. The case-control analysis showed that men employed on electric railways, compared with non-electric ones, had an odds ratio for leukemia of 0.70 (adjusted for smoking) and an odds ratio for brain tumor of 0.87. No significant trend was shown for exposure to either magnetic or electric fields.

A new enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting the antibody to an HTLV-I tax gene product, p40tax, has recently been developed. By this ELISA method, the positive rate of anti-p40tax among HTLV-I seropositive subjects, including 96 pregnant women (index subjects), 26 mothers, 13 husbands, and 13 children was investigated. The percentage positive for anti-p40tax among pregnant women, mothers, husbands, and children was 41.6, 50, 53.8 and 53.8%, respectively. This means that the positive rate of anti-p40tax remains almost constant with increasing age. The rate of mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-I was significantly higher in p40tax seropositive (29.6%) than in seronegative mothers (8.1%). The positive rate of anti-p40tax in transmission from husband to wife (29%) and through blood transfusion (17%) was lower than the overall prevalence (46%). Thus, these data suggest that p40tax antibodies are associated with the frequency of HTLV-I transmission and with the differences in the transmission routes.","['Umemoto, M', 'Take, H', 'Sawada, T']","['Umemoto M', 'Take H', 'Sawada T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima City Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies/*immunology', 'Child, Preschool', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*immunology/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1994.tb03131.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1994 Feb;36(1):62-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1994.tb03131.x.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurotoxic effects, such as cognitive impairment, have been associated with this therapy. A rat model was developed to determine which agent, or combination of agents, in CNS therapy causes neurotoxicity. The agents examined were cranial irradiation (1000 cGy), methotrexate (2 or 4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and prednisolone (18 or 36 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Young Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to each agent alone or to two- or three-agent combinations. Each therapy had matched controls that received sham radiation and/or intraperitoneal saline. Subsequent to exposure, spontaneous behavior was tested using a computer pattern recognition system, which recorded and classified behavior in a novel environment. Behavioral initiations, total times, and time structures were compared in therapy and control groups. Combined rather than single-agent therapies had more behavioral effects, and these were dose- and sex-dependent. Synergistic interactions between agents caused behavioral deficits, and components of the combination determined the abnormality. Some combinations interacted antagonistically, and thus mitigated behavioral deficits. Prednisolone was clearly pivotal to behavioral outcome. A low prednisolone dose antagonized methotrexate preventing deficits, whereas a higher prednisolone dose altered behavior by enhancing effects of methotrexate and radiation. These findings emphasize that steroids are important in agent interactions. Their role in morbidity associated with leukemia treatment protocols may be equally important as that of methotrexate and cranial irradiation.","['Mullenix, P J', 'Kernan, W J', 'Schunior, A', 'Howes, A', 'Waber, D P', 'Sallan, S E', 'Tarbell, N J']","['Mullenix PJ', 'Kernan WJ', 'Schunior A', 'Howes A', 'Waber DP', 'Sallan SE', 'Tarbell NJ']","['Department of Toxicology, Forsyth Research Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],['CA53858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,IM,"['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Nervous System/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental/etiology/prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-199402000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1994 Feb;35(2):171-8. doi: 10.1203/00006450-199402000-00009.,"['9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the vast majority of cases, a hemopoietic lineage can be confidently assigned; namely, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or the precursor-B and precursor-T variants of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The areas of greatest practical importance are in morphologically difficult or undifferentiated cases, and in distinguishing between the major variants of precursor-B and T-ALL. Cases with aberrant patterns of marker expression (acute mixed lineage leukemia, lineage infidelity) are frequently encountered in both ALL and AML, and can lead to diagnostic confusion. However, correlation with morphology and other clinicopathologic features, and careful consideration of the weight of phenotyping evidence almost always allows the correct lineage to be identified. The prognostic value of phenotypic information in acute leukemia is generally limited. Recognition of the major variants of ALL is still of clinical importance, but the significance of myeloid antigen positivity in ALL is controversial, and may not have prognostic value. Patterns of myeloid antigen expression in AML have limited prognostic significance, while the relationship between lymphoid antigen expression and treatment response in AML remains highly controversial.

The E2A-HLF fusion gene, formed by a t(17;19)(q22;p13) in childhood pro-B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia, encodes a hybrid protein that contains the trans-activation domain of E2A (E12/E47) linked to the bZIP DNA-binding and dimerization domain of hepatic leukemia factor (HLF). Here we report that both HLF and E2A-HLF bind to a 10-bp consensus sequence, 5'-GTTACGTAAT-3', with a core dyad-symmetric motif characteristic of the bZIP scissors-grip model of DNA binding. A probe containing this sequence bound chimeric E2A-HLF proteins in nuclear extracts of a leukemic cell line (UOC-B1) containing the t(17;19), as demonstrated by complexes supershifted with antibodies specific for amino-terminal epitopes of E2A or carboxyl-terminal eptiopes of HLF. E2A-HLF functioned as a potent trans activator of reporter gene expression from a plasmid that contained the consensus DNA-binding sequence. Interestingly, wild-type HLF was restricted in its capacity to act as a trans activator, functioning in human fetal kidney cells but not HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells or NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. The ability of the E2A-HLF hybrid protein to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and trans activate the expression of artificial reporter genes suggests that it could subvert transcriptional programs that normally control the growth, differentiation, and survival of lymphoid progenitor cells.","['Inaba, T', 'Shapiro, L H', 'Funabiki, T', 'Sinclair, A E', 'Jones, B G', 'Ashmun, R A', 'Look, A T']","['Inaba T', 'Shapiro LH', 'Funabiki T', 'Sinclair AE', 'Jones BG', 'Ashmun RA', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 59571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adenovirus E2 Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Consensus Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.5.3403-3413.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 May;14(5):3403-13. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.5.3403-3413.1994.,"['0 (Adenovirus E2 Proteins)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,PMC358705,,"['E2A', 'HLF']",,,,,,,,,,,

There are two genes in the mouse genome, PEBP2 alpha A and PEBP2 alpha B, which encode the alpha subunit. Two types of the alpha B cDNA clones, alpha B1 and alpha B2, were isolated from mouse fibroblasts and characterized. They were found to represent 3.8- and 7.9-kb transcripts, respectively. The 3.8-kb RNA encodes the previously described alpha B protein referred to as alpha B1, while the 7.9-kb RNA encodes a 387-amino-acid protein, termed alpha B2, which is identical to alpha B1 except that it has an internal deletion of 64 amino acid residues. Both alpha B1 and alpha B2 associate with PEBP2 beta and form a heterodimer. The alpha B2/beta complex binds to the PEBP2 binding site two- to threefold more strongly than the alpha B1/beta complex does. alpha B1 stimulates transcription through the PEBP2 site about 40-fold, while alpha B2 is only about 25 to 45% as active as alpha B1. Transactivation domain is located downstream of the 128-amino-acid runt homology region, referred to as the Runt domain. Mouse chromosome mapping studies revealed that alpha A, alpha B, and beta genes are mapped to chromosomes 17, 16, and 8, respectively. The last two genes are syntenic with the human AML1 on chromosome 21q22 and PEBP2 beta/CBF beta on 16q22 detected at the breakpoints of characteristic chromosome translocations of the two different subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia.

We have shown recently that IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor rapidly activate a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, acute-phase response factor (APRF), by tyrosine phosphorylation, which then binds to IL-6 response elements of various IL-6 target genes. Here we demonstrate that APRF is activated by all cytokines acting through gp130 and is detected in a wide variety of cell types, indicating a central role of this transcription factor in gp130-mediated signaling. APRF activation is also observed in vitro upon addition of IL-6 to cell homogenates. Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors block both the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of APRF. The factor was purified to homogeneity from rat liver and shown to consist of a single 87-kDa polypeptide, while two forms (89 and 87 kDa) are isolated from human hepatoma cells. As reported earlier, the binding sequence specificity of APRF is shared by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) activation factor, which is formed by the Stat91 protein. Partial amino acid sequence obtained from purified rat APRF demonstrated that it is likely to be related to Stat91. In fact, an antiserum raised against the amino-terminal portion of Stat91 cross-reacted with APRF, suggesting the relatedness of APRF and Stat91. Altogether, these data indicate that APRF belongs to a growing family of Stat-related proteins and that IFN-gamma and IL-6 use similar signaling pathways to activate IFN-gamma activation factor and APRF, respectively.","['Wegenka, U M', 'Lutticken, C', 'Buschmann, J', 'Yuan, J', 'Lottspeich, F', 'Muller-Esterl, W', 'Schindler, C', 'Roeb, E', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Horn, F']","['Wegenka UM', 'Lutticken C', 'Buschmann J', 'Yuan J', 'Lottspeich F', 'Muller-Esterl W', 'Schindler C', 'Roeb E', 'Heinrich PC', 'Horn F']","['Institute of Biochemistry, RWTH Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Catechols/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Genistein', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemical synthesis', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tyrphostins']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.5.3186-3196.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 May;14(5):3186-96. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.5.3186-3196.1994.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '118409-60-2 (tyrphostin 47)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",,,,PMC358686,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A higher number of cells, on average, bound to PPME and fucoidin derivatized polyacrylamide gels in B-MLUS than in B-CLL. However, the differences observed were not statistically significant. In four cases with B-CLL, the stimulatory effect of interferon-alpha on the function of L-selectin and some other accessory molecules was also studied. The increased binding of PBMCs to immobilized analogue molecules (PPME, fucoidin) and to high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the in vitro HEV-binding assay supports the notion that interferon-alpha not only increases the expression of the adhesion molecules, but also results in an enhanced adhesive function.","['Csanaky, G', 'Vass, J A', 'Losonczy, H', 'Schmelczer, M']","['Csanaky G', 'Vass JA', 'Losonczy H', 'Schmelczer M']","['Department of Pathology, University Medical School of Pecs, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/blood/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytosis/*blood', 'Male', 'Mannans/*pharmacology', 'Mannosephosphates/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Polysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Venules/metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02989666 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1993;10(4):173-80. doi: 10.1007/BF02989666.,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (Mannosephosphates)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '57034-83-0 (mannose-6-phosphate rich phosphomannan)', '9072-19-9 (fucoidan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results from an ethidium displacement assay on calf thymus and T4 DNA suggest that like distamycin these agents bind strongly to the minor groove of DNA. The data show that these conjugates exhibit a lower AT preference than distamycin and the decrease is significantly greater for the imidazole-containing compounds. All of the compounds along with 8-methoxypsoralen, 1, were relatively noncytotoxic in the dark with only the imidazole-psoralen compound 3 giving an IC50 value below 100 microM. Following UV activation, all compounds showed an increased potency with photoinduced dose modifications in the human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells of > 333, 12, > 1.3, and > 2.5 for compounds 2-5, respectively, under the UV irradiation conditions employed. The psoralen-pyrrole analogue 2 was over 300 times more active following UV activation than agent 1, 250 times more potent than the corresponding coumarin conjugate 4, and 15-fold more potent than its imidazole analogue 3. Data from CD dilution (with DMF) studies show that upon irradiation with light at 366 nm, compounds 2-5 bind irreversibly to DNA. Furthermore, upon irradiation compound 2 produced interstrand cross-linked DNA in quantitative yield, with isolated DNA, at > 300- and > 3000-fold lower drug concentrations than the imidazole analogue 3 and 8-methoxypsoralen, respectively. As expected coumarin conjugates 4 and 5 did not produce any cross-linked DNA under any conditions. Since the psoralen conjugates are more phototoxic than their coumarin analogues, these results suggest that DNA interstrand cross-link formation may be an important mechanism by which they exert their biological activity in cells. In addition, the enhanced photocytotoxic potency of conjugate 2 over 3 may be related to its larger binding constant, more efficient DNA cross-linking ability, and possibly to its preference for AT-rich sequences.","['Lee, M', 'Roldan, M C', 'Haskell, M K', 'McAdam, S R', 'Hartley, J A']","['Lee M', 'Roldan MC', 'Haskell MK', 'McAdam SR', 'Hartley JA']","['Department of Chemistry, Furman University, Greenville, South Carolina 29613.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Alkylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis', 'Base Composition', 'Coumarins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ficusin/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Furocoumarins/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', '*Light', 'Molecular Structure', 'Netropsin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Photochemistry', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Pyrroles/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00034a019 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1994 Apr 15;37(8):1208-13. doi: 10.1021/jm00034a019.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Furocoumarins)', '0', '(N-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-1-methyl-4-(1-methyl-4-((5-(8-psoralenyloxy)pentanoyl', ')amino)pyrrole-2-carboxamido)pyrrole-2-carboxamide)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '64B3O0RD7N (Netropsin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'KTZ7ZCN2EX (Ficusin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy patients undergoing allogeneic (n = 150) or autologous (n = 20) BMT were evaluated by physical examination, history, rest and exercise ECG, chest x-ray, two-dimensional echocardiography, and radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) before BMT, and monitored for 3 months thereafter. RESULTS: Following BMT, cardiac toxicity occurred in eight patients (4.7%). Three patients (1.8%) developed life-threatening toxicity (pericardial effusion and left ventricular failure, n = 2; sudden cardiac arrest, n = 1). Thirty-eight patients (22%) had pathologic findings before BMT. In 22 patients, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determined by RNV was reduced to less than 55%. This was the only abnormality in 17 patients and was generally mild, with a lowest EF of 42%. There was no correlation between overall results of cardiologic evaluation before BMT and cardiac toxicity. Cardiotoxic events occurred more frequently in patients with a reduced EF (P < .05). However, this was restricted to minor cardiac events. Life-threatening cardiac toxicity was not significantly increased in patients with pathologic results before BMT. Moreover, none of the patients with an EF less than 50% developed cardiac toxicity. CONCLUSION: Life-threatening cardiac toxicity is rare after BMT, occurring in less than 2% of all patients. Although the occurrence of cardiac toxicity is correlated with a reduction of EF before BMT, life-threatening cardiac toxicity cannot be predicted in individual patients.","['Hertenstein, B', 'Stefanic, M', 'Schmeiser, T', 'Scholz, M', 'Goller, V', 'Clausen, M', 'Bunjes, D', 'Wiesneth, M', 'Novotny, J', 'Kochs, M']","['Hertenstein B', 'Stefanic M', 'Schmeiser T', 'Scholz M', 'Goller V', 'Clausen M', 'Bunjes D', 'Wiesneth M', 'Novotny J', 'Kochs M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III (Hematology and Oncology), University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/etiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Heart/*physiology', 'Heart Arrest/etiology', 'Heart Diseases/*etiology', 'Heart Failure/etiology', 'Heart Function Tests', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pericardial Effusion/etiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.5.998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 May;12(5):998-1004. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.5.998.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 33 survivors studied, 26 (group A) received intensive chemotherapy including anthracyclines, one also received busulfan, cyclophosphamide (Bu/Cy), and bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Seven patients (group B) received chemotherapy, TBI, and BMT. Hearing, sight, growth, and endocrine, renal, and cardiac function were assessed. RESULTS: The mean height standard deviation score of 25 nontransplanted group A patients was +0.67 at diagnosis, -0.11 following treatment (P = .016), and +0.34 7 years later (P > .05), indicating no long-term growth impairment. The patients had normal gonadal function and the girls had normal uterine size and ovarian volume. The Bu/Cy patient had primary ovarian failure. Four group B children required growth hormone and four sex steroids for growth or gonadal failure. The girls had reduced uterine size and ovarian volume. Three had thyroid dysfunction and six had cataracts. Abnormalities of renal function were found in both groups and hearing loss in group A only. The mean cardiac shortening fraction was significantly reduced at 29.2% in group A and 28.6% in group B compared with 36% in normal subjects. Two group A patients have developed cardiac failure. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy and TBI before BMT for AML has resulted in growth failure, gonadal and thyroid damage, and cataracts in most children, whereas chemotherapy alone caused cardiac, renal, and hearing abnormalities only.","['Liesner, R J', 'Leiper, A D', 'Hann, I M', 'Chessells, J M']","['Liesner RJ', 'Leiper AD', 'Hann IM', 'Chessells JM']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Hospitals for Sick Children, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Endocrine Glands/physiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Heart/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vision, Ocular', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.5.916 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 May;12(5):916-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.5.916.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment outcomes were analyzed according to the presenting clinical and laboratory features of 30 infants treated between May 1979 and April 1993. A stepwise multivariate regression model was used to identify the most important prognostic indicator with respect to event-free survival. RESULTS: Infant ALL cases were characterized by high presenting leukocyte count (median, 87 x 10(9)/L), increased frequency of CNS leukemia (50%), and blast cells with a CD10- phenotype (67%), myeloid-associated antigen expression (48%), and 11q23/MLL rearrangement (68%). The 11q23/MLL involvement was correlated with age less than 6 months, CD10- phenotype, myeloid-associated antigen expression, and high leukocyte count. Although 11q23/MLL involvement, age less than 6 months, myeloid-associated antigen expression, and female sex were each significantly associated with an inferior treatment outcome, only rearranged 11q23/MLL emerged as an independent predictor of prognosis in multivariate analysis (P = .01). Infants with this genetic abnormality had a 4.7-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.3- to 17.0-fold) increased risk in adverse events compared to other infants. CONCLUSION: The 11q23/MLL involvement of blast cells identifies a major subgroup of infant ALL cases that require an innovative treatment approach. Infants who lack this genetic abnormality have an intermediate prognosis and could be treated accordingly on risk-directed protocols.","['Pui, C H', 'Behm, F G', 'Downing, J R', 'Hancock, M L', 'Shurtleff, S A', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Head, D R', 'Mahmoud, H H', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Furman, W L']","['Pui CH', 'Behm FG', 'Downing JR', 'Hancock ML', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Head DR', 'Mahmoud HH', 'Sandlund JT', 'Furman WL', 'et al.']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318.""]",['eng'],"['P01 CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transcription Factors']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.5.909 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 May;12(5):909-15. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.5.909.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to examine the relation between risk of leukemia and various treatment factors (including cumulative dose of cytostatic drugs and interaction with radiotherapy [RT]), while also assessing the effect of treatment-induced bone marrow damage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study in a cohort of 1,939 patients treated for HD between 1966 and 1986 in the Netherlands. Detailed information from the medical records was obtained for 44 cases of leukemia and 124 matched controls, in whom leukemia had not developed. RESULTS: The cumulative dose of mechlorethamine was the most important factor in determining leukemia risk. As compared with patients who received RT alone, patients treated with six or fewer cycles of combinations including nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine) and procarbazine had an eightfold increased risk of developing leukemia (P = .08), while patients who received more than six of such cycles had a greater than 40-fold excess risk (P < .001). Treatment with lomustine or a combination of teniposide and cyclophosphamide also significantly increased the risk of leukemia. Patients who had received chemotherapy (CT) during two or more time periods had a nearly 40-fold increased risk of leukemia as compared with patients treated only once. The extent of RT did not further increase leukemia risk among patients who also received CT. A significantly increased risk of leukemia was found among patients with low platelet counts, both in response to initial therapy and during follow-up. Patients who experienced 2 or more half-year periods with platelet counts less than 75 x 10(6)/mL had an approximately fivefold risk of developing leukemia, and a similar risk increase was found for patients who responded to initial treatment with a > or = 70% decrease of platelet counts (as compared with patients who had a < or = 50% decrease). CONCLUSION: In addition to mechlorethamine, lomustine and teniposide combinations were also linked to an elevated risk of developing leukemia. Since the number of CT episodes was found to be a strong determinant of leukemia risk, it is important that new therapies for HD continue to yield high initial cure rates. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether patients at high risk for developing leukemia may be identified from the response of their platelets to initial therapy for HD.","['van Leeuwen, F E', 'Chorus, A M', 'van den Belt-Dusebout, A W', 'Hagenbeek, A', 'Noyon, R', 'van Kerkhoff, E H', 'Pinedo, H M', 'Somers, R']","['van Leeuwen FE', 'Chorus AM', 'van den Belt-Dusebout AW', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Noyon R', 'van Kerkhoff EH', 'Pinedo HM', 'Somers R']","['Department of Epidemiology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkylating Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.5.1063 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 May;12(5):1063-73. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.5.1063.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Proliferative activity in bone marrow trephine cryosections from 99 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 23 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 11 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and two with acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) was investigated. Infiltration was seen in 52 out of 99 cases of NHL on bone marrow cryosections. A score was devised to assess pathological infiltrates in bone marrow trephine cryosections using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. This method of scoring gave a measure of non-erythroid proliferative activity. RESULTS: Mean Ki-67 positivity in bone marrow infiltrates in 31 low grade B cell lymphomas (Kiel classification) was 0.3% before and 4.7% after treatment, 16.4% in seven high grade B cell lymphomas, and 17.8% in 12 peripheral T cell lymphomas. In 48 cases of NHL, bone marrow cryosections had not been infiltrated, and in all but one case the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells in normal marrow was less than 3%; the remaining case showed coexistent myelodysplasia and 8% bone marrow Ki-67 positivity. In eight cases of common ALL at diagnosis, the mean Ki-67 positivity in marrow cryosections was 24.9%, significantly higher than the 2.4% Ki-67 positivity seen in AML (p < 0.05). One of the two cases of common ALL with less than 1% Ki-67 positivity was refractory to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative activity of erythroid elements in the bone marrow varies greatly. Immunostaining of bone marrow cryosections using Ki-67 permits accurate assessment of non-erythroid proliferative activity in lymphomas and leukaemia. High grade B cell lymphomas and peripheral T cell lymphomas invading the marrow have very similar mean proliferative activities. Such levels of proliferation are of the same order as those seen in common ALL, but much higher than those seen in AML.","['White, D M', 'Smith, A G', 'Smith, J L']","['White DM', 'Smith AG', 'Smith JL']","['Department of Haematology, Southampton General Hospital, Hants.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cryoultramicrotomy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Palatine Tonsil/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.47.3.209 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1994 Mar;47(3):209-13. doi: 10.1136/jcp.47.3.209.,"['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",,,,PMC501896,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These characteristics were evident in electrophoretic mobility shift assays showing that complexes of myogenic factors and HTF4 displayed a relatively high affinity for the enhancer in the muscle creatine kinase gene, whereas TAL1 appeared to greatly attenuate the interaction of HTF4 with this enhancer. In addition, by forming a complex with HTF4 in solution, TAL1 could exert a negative effect on the interactions of HTF4 with elements that include E box motifs of microE2 (CAGCTG) and kappa E2/microE5 (CACCTG) type. Similarly, heterodimers containing TAL1 and the DNA binding domain of E47 exhibited a relatively weak affinity for microE2 and kappa E2/microE5 core motifs. The results of both studies invoked the hypothesis that in vivo TAL1 might act as a negative regulator of microE2 and kappa E2/microE5 sequence motifs by forming a complex with the products of the E2A and HTF4 genes. Support for this hypothesis was obtained by transient expression analyses where TAL1 was found to inhibit the activation effects produced by E2-5 and HTF4a on a reporter gene construct containing repeated microE2 and microE5 motifs, derived from the immunoglobulin gene enhancer.","['Doyle, K', 'Zhang, Y', 'Baer, R', 'Bina, M']","['Doyle K', 'Zhang Y', 'Baer R', 'Bina M']","['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1393.']",['eng'],['AI29121/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Creatine Kinase/genetics', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscles/enzymology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/22 00:00,1994/04/22 00:01,['1994/04/22 00:00'],"['1994/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)32686-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Apr 22;269(16):12099-105.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '142661-93-6 (TCF12 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)']",,,,,,"['E2A', 'HTF4']",,,,,,,,,,,

Because lymphocytes adhere tightly to fibroblasts transfected with CD22 cDNA, it would appear reasonable to suggest that regulatory mechanisms might have evolved which prevent undesired CD22-mediated leukocyte aggregation. Here we provide evidence for the existence of at least one mechanism that might regulate CD22 interaction with ligands on adjacent cells. We demonstrate that sialylation of CD22 by beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase abrogates CD22-mediated lymphocyte adhesion, and that adhesion can be restored by removal of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid residues from the CD22 molecule. Taken together, our results suggest that alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase can both promote and inhibit CD22-ligand interactions. These observations provide the first direct evidence that receptor-ligand interactions mediated by an Ig superfamily molecule are under the control of a specific glycosyltransferase.","['Braesch-Andersen, S', 'Stamenkovic, I']","['Braesch-Andersen S', 'Stamenkovic I']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital.']",['eng'],['CA55735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/isolation & purification/*metabolism/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/isolation & purification/*metabolism/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Molecular Weight', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/22 00:00,1994/04/22 00:01,['1994/04/22 00:00'],"['1994/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)32640-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Apr 22;269(16):11783-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (beta-D-galactoside alpha 2-6-sialyltransferase)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, these antibodies are helpful in the diagnosis of small round cell tumors of childhood (SRCT). Lymphomas also are in the differential diagnosis of SRCT, but few have been studied with respect to MIC2 protein expression. In the present study we used the 12E7 antibody to assess MIC2 expression in 82 pediatric non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Forty lymphoblastic, 22 small noncleaved, and 20 large cell lymphomas were studied. Strong immunoreactivity was found in 37 of the 40 (93%) lymphoblastic lymphomas, whereas only one of the 22 (5%) small noncleaved lymphomas was 12E7 positive. Four of the 20 (20%) large cell lymphomas also were immunoreactive. Three 12E7+ lymphoblastic lymphomas were primary in bone and were of B-progenitor lineage; Ewing's sarcoma was included in the initial differential diagnosis of these cases. Evaluation of 125 pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases for MIC2 expression showed similar results, with all 36 T-cell ALLs showing strong expression, one of eight B-cell (Burkitt-like) ALLs showing 12E7 expression, and 62 of 81 B-progenitor ALLs showing 12E7 positivity. We conclude that among the SRCTs, MIC2 expression is not limited to Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, but also shows strong and reliable expression in lymphoblastic lymphomas and related leukemias. MIC2 analysis continues to be helpful in the diagnosis of SRCT, provided that a panel of antibodies is used. In addition, the possibility that MIC2 analysis may aid in the distinction of lymphoblastic lymphomas from small noncleaved lymphomas needs to be further addressed.","['Riopel, M', 'Dickman, P S', 'Link, M P', 'Perlman, E J']","['Riopel M', 'Dickman PS', 'Link MP', 'Perlman EJ']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis/genetics', 'Child', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*chemistry/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/genetics']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0046-8177(94)90149-X [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(94)90149-x [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1994 Apr;25(4):396-9. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(94)90149-x.,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,,,,,['MIC2'],,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the role of uPA in metastasis to the skeleton and to extraskeletal sites, we have developed a homologous model of uPA overexpression in a rat prostate cancer cell line. Full length cDNA encoding rat (r) uPA was isolated and subcloned as a 1.4-kilobase XbaI-BspHI fragment in the sense and antisense orientation into the Moloney murine leukemia retroviral vector pYN. The control (pYN) and experimental (pYN-ruPA, pYN-ruPA-AS) plasmids were transfected into Dunning R 3227, Mat LyLu rat prostate carcinoma cells. Experimental clones expressing at least 5-fold higher (pYN-ruPA) or 3-fold lower (pYN-ruPA-AS) than controls were selected, and control and experimental cells were inoculated into the left ventricles of inbred male Copenhagen rats. Animals were sacrificed at timed intervals to examine the evolution of metastatic lesions. Control animals developed metastases to the lumbar vertebrae resulting in spinal cord compression and hind limb paralysis at 20-21 days postinoculation. Animals inoculated with cells overexpressing uPA developed hind limb paralysis significantly earlier (by day 14-15 postinoculation). Additionally, more widespread skeletal (ribs, scapula, and femora) metastases were seen. Serum from experimental animals showed a progressive elevation in alkaline phosphatase levels, and histological examination of lumbar metastases revealed markedly increased osteoblastic activity over that observed in control animals. In contrast to this, animals inoculated with cells underexpressing uPA developed hind limb paralysis significantly later (days 25-29 postinoculation) and displayed decreased tumor metastasis. These studies support a role for the catalytic domain of uPA in enhancing both skeletal and nonskeletal prostate cancer invasiveness and are consistent with a role for the growth factor domain of uPA in mediating an osteoblastic skeletal response.","['Achbarou, A', 'Kaiser, S', 'Tremblay, G', 'Ste-Marie, L G', 'Brodt, P', 'Goltzman, D', 'Rabbani, S A']","['Achbarou A', 'Kaiser S', 'Tremblay G', 'Ste-Marie LG', 'Brodt P', 'Goltzman D', 'Rabbani SA']","['Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],['R01 CA 37126/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/metabolism/*secondary', 'Hindlimb', 'Male', 'Paralysis/etiology', 'Plasminogen Activators/genetics/*metabolism/urine', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 May 1;54(9):2372-7.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In three patients topoisomerase II recognition site-like sequences, at different stringency levels, were identified at the breakpoints on chromosome 11.

However, chromosome structure may differ in the G1, S, and G2 phases, and phase-specific constraints may be masked if the chromosome analysis does not discriminate between the phases. Therefore, using confocal microscopy, we examined the structure of S-phase chromosomes labelled with 5-iododeoxyuridine after prolonged treatment with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. In the S-phase, labelled 0.32 mu chromosome fibres mostly appear as semi-circles with an average diameter of 0.83 +/- 0.03 mu. These semi-circles are joined together to form different 3D structures, and two semicircles frequently adopt s- or omega-like conformations involving about 2.5 mu of the chromosome contour length (L). Morphometric analysis of the S-phase fibres suggests that our data fit both the random flexible polymer model and also a model in which two constrained semi-circles are attached to each other by a flexible joint, thus eliminating constraints at long distances (L more than 2 mu).","['Svetlova, M', 'Solovjeva, L', 'Stein, G', 'Chamberland, C', 'Vig, B', 'Tomilin, N']","['Svetlova M', 'Solovjeva L', 'Stein G', 'Chamberland C', 'Vig B', 'Tomilin N']","['Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Chromosome Res,"Chromosome research : an international journal on the molecular, supramolecular and evolutionary aspects of chromosome biology",9313452,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', '*S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01539453 [doi]'],ppublish,Chromosome Res. 1994 Jan;2(1):47-52. doi: 10.1007/BF01539453.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether it could be effectively used for T-cell depletion in mice to suppress GvHD in the same manner as the anti-human-CD3 MABs have been applied in clinical transplantation. Evaluation of the effectiveness of this antibody was carried out both under fully allogeneic MHC-mismatched and under unrelated-donor MHC-matched marrow transplant conditions. For both types of transplantation, depletion of the donor cells with YCD3-1 plus complement prior to their injection into lethally irradiated recipients significantly suppressed GvHD, resulting in survivals of 75-79%, as compared to 8-13% in the controls that received undepleted cells from the same donors (p < 0.0001). These results suggest that the YCD3-1 MAB may have a potential for use as a negative selection agent in the further definition of the roles of the various T-cell subtypes, as well as the possible roles of natural-killer cells, in future studies into the mechanisms of GvHD, and of the graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['OKunewick, J P', 'Kociban, D L', 'Machen, L L', 'Buffo, M J']","['OKunewick JP', 'Kociban DL', 'Machen LL', 'Buffo MJ']","['Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA 15212.']",['eng'],"['R01-AI28425/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA49437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology', 'CD3 Complex', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rats', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/096368979300200416 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Transplant. 1993 Jul-Aug;2(4):331-7. doi: 10.1177/096368979300200416.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the present progress in the mechanism of oncoprotein-targeted antitumor effects and focused on herbimycin A-induced antitumor activity on Ph1-positive leukemia cells.","['Okabe, M', 'Uehara, M']","['Okabe M', 'Uehara M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/toxicity', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Quinones/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309059570 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Dec;12(1-2):41-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199309059570.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,30,,,"['abl', 'bcr']",,,,,,,,,,,

Etoposide (VP 16-213) at low concentrations shows differentiation-inducing activity against leukemic cells in vitro. A prior study showed that oral low-dose etoposide therapy was effective in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. We used low-dose etoposide to treat six patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) and seven patients with AL transformed from MDS. The etoposide (50 mg, 2-7 times/week) was usually administered intravenously to ensure reliable bioavailability. Of 12 assessable patients, four RAEB-t patients achieved a partial response and one AL patient achieved complete remission. The responders became transfusion-independent, and this continued for 2-9 months while etoposide therapy was continued. Three of five responders had been resistant to prior repeated low-dose cytarabine therapy. The side effects were mild and well tolerated. Heterogeneous mechanisms were surmised to explain the clinical effects of low-dose etoposide. Several aspects, including the optimal schedule of low-dose etoposide therapy, the effect of this therapy on the patients' survival, the usefulness of combination therapy with other chemotherapeutic drug(s) and/or cytokine(s), should be investigated in the future.","['Ogata, K', 'Nomura, T']","['Ogata K', 'Nomura T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309059569 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Dec;12(1-2):35-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199309059569.,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we give a brief overview of the major cytokines involved in the regulation of B-CLL proliferation. In vitro experiments have indicated that there is an antagonistic interaction between TNF-alpha as a growth-enhancing factor and IL-4, which inhibits the growth of B-CLL. We have extended these findings with recent experiments on the intracellular signals which might be involved in these processes. We show that increased levels of intracellular cAMP dose-dependently inhibit the TNF-alpha-induced proliferation of B-CLL. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for the signals involved in the regulation of B-CLL proliferation. The implications for possible new ways of treatment are discussed.","['van Kooten, C', 'Rensink, I', 'Aarden, L', 'van Oers, R']","['van Kooten C', 'Rensink I', 'Aarden L', 'van Oers R']","['Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Cytokines/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology/therapy', '*Signal Transduction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/physiology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309059568 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Dec;12(1-2):27-33. doi: 10.3109/10428199309059568.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated a possible role of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced proliferation of human circulating monocytes and the effects of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 on M-CSF production by human monocytic cells. Both 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 and recombinant human M-CSF increased 2.5-fold the nucleus number of human circulating monocytes on day 6 of the culture. These effects were inhibited by antihuman M-CSF antibody as well as by anti-c-fms antibody, although these antibodies themselves did not affect the nucleus number when added to control culture. These results indicated that M-CSF is required for 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-stimulated monocyte proliferation. In addition, 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 stimulated M-CSF secretion from human circulating monocytes. Secretion and mRNA expression of M-CSF by 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated THP-1 cells (human monocytic leukemia cell line) and TPA-treated HL-60 cells (human promyelocytic leukemia cell line) were also increased by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. M-CSF secretion from TPA-treated THP-1 cells was increased by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 in a dose-dependent and metabolite-specific manner. The present study demonstrates that 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 is a potent stimulator for M-CSF production by human monocytic cells and that the proliferative effect of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 on human monocytes may be attributed, at least in part, to the stimulated secretion of M-CSF.","['Kaneki, M', 'Inoue, S', 'Hosoi, T', 'Mizuno, Y', 'Akedo, Y', 'Ikegami, A', 'Nakamura, T', 'Shiraki, M', 'Ito, H', 'Suzu, S']","['Kaneki M', 'Inoue S', 'Hosoi T', 'Mizuno Y', 'Akedo Y', 'Ikegami A', 'Nakamura T', 'Shiraki M', 'Ito H', 'Suzu S', 'et al.']","['Department of Geriatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73238-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 15;83(8):2285-93.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analyses from 39 patients (17 males and 22 females) were accepted after review. Several unique cytogenetic features were observed. Twelve patients (31%) had a t(4;11)(q21;q23) and had a significantly shorter event-free survival (EFS) than did the other patients with adequate cytogenetic analyses (P = .009). Five additional patients had an 11q23 breakpoint, not associated with 4q21. When EFS for these 5 patients was compared with that of the t(4;11) patients, even with these small numbers there was a strong, although not significant, suggestion that the t(4;11) patients have a reduced EFS (P = .09), indicating that the specific translocation, t(4;11)(q21;q23), and not an 11q23 breakpoint per se, may be associated with the poor prognosis of these infants. Structural abnormalities were present in 27 of 28 patients with abnormal karyotypes.

Two females had structural abnormalities involving Xp11, a breakpoint rarely seen in ALL. Fourteen (36%) patients had a single structural abnormality, and 13 (33%) had complex karyotypes. No patients had hyperdiploidy with more than 50 chromosomes. Only normal chromosomes were observed in 11 patients (28%), and their outcome did not differ from patients with abnormal karyotypes.

However, relatively little is known about its effect on apoptosis that occurs after terminal differentiation. Bcl2 protein levels decrease during differentiation of myeloid cells into granulocytes that subsequently undergo apoptosis, but the potential role of Bcl2 in coupling survival and differentiation remains undefined. To ascertain the relationship between decreasing Bcl2 levels and the onset of apoptosis in differentiating myeloid cells, Bcl2 was hyperexpressed in the HL-60 cell line after retroviral gene transfer. After treatment of HL-60/BCL2 cells with all-trans retinoic acid or phorbol myristic acid, Bcl2 levels did not decrease as in normal HL-60 cells but, rather, increased because of activation of the viral promoter. Differentiation of the Bcl2-overexpressing cells was similar to that of normal HL-60 cells, but they showed little evidence for apoptosis and had a prolonged survival. These studies show that the survival-enhancing properties of Bcl2 counteract programmed cell death that accompanies terminal differentiation; however, Bcl2 has no significant effect on differentiation itself, suggesting that apoptosis and differentiation are regulated independently in myeloid cells.","['Naumovski, L', 'Cleary, M L']","['Naumovski L', 'Cleary ML']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, CA.""]",['eng'],['CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73235-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 15;83(8):2261-7.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the strategy for analysis of gene mutations based on in vitro DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and/or direct sequence analysis. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed single nucleotide substitutions involving codons 12, 13, or 61 in six of 20 patients (30%).

Eight precursor B-ALLs appeared to contain biclonal/oligoclonal Ig heavy-chain (IgH) gene rearrangements at diagnosis. Differences in rearrangement patterns between diagnosis and relapse were found in 67% (20 cases) of precursor B-ALLs (including all eight biclonal/oligoclonal cases) and 50% (five cases) of T-ALLs. In precursor B-ALLs, especially changes in IgH and/or TcR-delta gene rearrangements were found (17 cases), but also changes in TcR-beta, TcR-gamma, Ig kappa, and/or Ig lambda genes (11 cases) occurred. The changes in T-ALLs concerned the TcR-beta, TcR-gamma, TcR-delta, and/or IgH genes. Two precursor B-ALLs showed completely different Ig and TcR gene rearrangement patterns at relapse, suggesting the absence of a clonal relation between the leukemic cells at diagnosis and relapse and the development of a secondary leukemia. The clonal evolution in the other 23 ALL patients was based on continuing rearrangement processes and selection of subclones. The development of changes in Ig and TcR gene rearrangement patterns was related to remission duration, suggesting an increasing chance of continuing rearrangement processes with time. These immunogenotypic changes at relapse occurred in a hierarchical order, with changes in IgH and TcR-delta genes occurring after only 6 months of remission duration, whereas changes in other Ig and TcR genes were generally detectable after 1 to 2 years of remission duration. The heterogeneity reported here in Ig and/or TcR gene rearrangement patterns at diagnosis and relapse might hamper polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) using junctional regions of rearranged Ig or TcR genes as PCR targets. However, our data also indicate that in 75% to 90% of ALLs, at least one major rearranged IgH, TcR-gamma, or TcR-delta band (allele) remained stable at relapse. We conclude that two or more junctional regions of different genes (IgH, TcR-gamma, and/or TcR-delta) should be monitored during follow-up of ALL patients for MRD detection by use of PCR techniques. Especially in biclonal/oligoclonal precursor B-ALL cases, the monitoring should not be restricted to rearranged IgH genes, but TcR-gamma and/or TcR-delta genes should be monitored as well, because of the extensive changes in IgH gene rearrangement patterns in this ALL subgroup.","['Beishuizen, A', 'Verhoeven, M A', 'van Wering, E R', 'Hahlen, K', 'Hooijkaas, H', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Beishuizen A', 'Verhoeven MA', 'van Wering ER', 'Hahlen K', 'Hooijkaas H', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University/University Hospital Dijkzigt, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Recurrence']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73232-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 15;83(8):2238-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, endogenous p53 protein seems to play little role in normal cell-cycle control as suggested by the normal development of p53 null mice, and by the low p53 protein levels expressed in most cell types. Recently, increased expression of endogenous p53 protein has been observed during the cellular response to DNA damage, as well as during differentiation of human hematopoietic cells. To study the role of the p53 gene in hematopoietic differentiation, we introduced the wild-type p53 gene or the temperature-sensitive p53(Val135) mutant into p53-deficient HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Morphological analysis, flow-cytometric determination of granulocytic or monocytic surface markers, and ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) demonstrated that expression of exogenous wild-type p53 gene in HL-60 cells induces differentiation through the granulocytic pathway. Proliferation and cell-cycle analysis performed early after expression of wild-type p53 showed that induction of differentiation is not coupled with growth arrest, which suggests that p53 is involved in differentiation independently of its activity on the cell cycle.","['Soddu, S', 'Blandino, G', 'Citro, G', 'Scardigli, R', 'Piaggio, G', 'Ferber, A', 'Calabretta, B', 'Sacchi, A']","['Soddu S', 'Blandino G', 'Citro G', 'Scardigli R', 'Piaggio G', 'Ferber A', 'Calabretta B', 'Sacchi A']","['Molecular Oncogenesis Laboratory, Istituto Regina Elena CRS, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['CA09678-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, p53/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73231-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 15;83(8):2230-7.,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,

Recent investigations have shown that TNF can use a signal transduction pathway in HL-60 cells involving sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide with subsequent stimulation of a ceramide-linked kinase. When sphingomyelinase was added exogenously to activate this cascade in HIV-1-infected HL-60 cells, it mimicked TNF-induced HIV production. Phospholipases A2, C, or D, which do not generate ceramide, had no effect; however, a synthetic ceramide analog added exogenously potently induced HIV production. In addition, anti-TNF antibodies blocked much of the effect of both sphingomyelinase and the synthetic ceramide analog on virus expression, suggesting that, although signaling is initiated through the sphingomyelin pathway, it is sustained by autocrine TNF synthesis. Thus, direct activation of the sphingomyelin pathway recapitulated the effect of TNF on both HIV and TNF production. These studies indicate that the sphingomyelin pathway is involved in TNF signaling for HIV production in chronically infected myeloid cells.","['Rivas, C I', 'Golde, D W', 'Vera, J C', 'Kolesnick, R N']","['Rivas CI', 'Golde DW', 'Vera JC', 'Kolesnick RN']","['Program in Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA57400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL42107/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'HIV-1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*microbiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phospholipases/pharmacology', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/pharmacology', 'Sphingomyelins/*physiology', 'Sphingosine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73226-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 15;83(8):2191-7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the expression of the two type II activin receptor mRNAs during the differentiation of K562 erythroleukemic cells, which are known to be induced toward the erythroid lineage in response to activin or toward the megakaryoblastic lineage by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The cDNA of the human activin receptor type IIB (hActR-IIB) was cloned and sequenced from two RNA sources, the K562 cells and the human fetal brain, which is, of the tissues screened by Northern blot analysis, the most abundant source of ActR-IIB RNA. The cDNA encodes a predicted 512 amino acid protein containing an extracellular ligand binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. The amino acid sequence is 99.2% and 98.4% homologous in the coding region to the previously described mouse and rat ActR-IIB2s, respectively, and 69% identical to the other human activin serine/threonine kinase receptor, hActR-II. The alternative splicing events in the juxtamembrane region previously reported for the respective mouse receptor were not observed during the processing of K562 cell and human fetal brain RNA. Northern analysis showed that the 10- and 2.5-kb transcripts of hActR-IIB are more abundantly expressed than the 6.0- and 3.0-kb transcripts of hActR-II in K562 cells. No changes in the steady-state levels of hActR-II and IIB mRNAs were detected upon differentiation of K562 cells by activin A or by PMA. Similarly, the receptor mRNA levels remained constant in HL-60 cells induced to either monocyte/macrophage or granulocyte-like cells by PMA or dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively. Thus, the mRNA expression levels of both receptors apparently do not correlate with the differentiation status of these cells.","['Hilden, K', 'Tuuri, T', 'Eramaa, M', 'Ritvos, O']","['Hilden K', 'Tuuri T', 'Eramaa M', 'Ritvos O']","['Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Activin Receptors', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73223-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 15;83(8):2163-70.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors)']",,,,,['GENBANK/X77533'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The IL-4-, IL-6-, and GM-CSF-induced complexes can be distinguished from the recently characterized IFN gamma-activated protein p91 on the basis of mobility in polyacrylamide gels, sequence preferences, and lack of reactivity with an anti-p91 antiserum. The IL-4- and GM-CSF-induced complexes react with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, demonstrating the presence of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in these DNA-binding complexes.

In addition, CD30 ligand mediated reduction of proliferation and viability, by induction of cytolytic cell death, of CD30+, large-cell anaplastic lymphoma cell lines. Two new antibodies, M44 and M67, against the CD30 antigen demonstrated similar biologic activities to the CD30 ligand.

However, most studies have found that relative rates of cell proliferation are not increased in CML. Moreover, we found that CML progenitors display a normal proliferative response to growth factors and do not manifest greater proliferative potential than normal progenitors. Growth of malignancies depends on an imbalance between the rate of cell production and the rate of cell death. We found that BCR-ABL expression inappropriately prolongs the growth factor-independent survival of CML myeloid progenitors and granulocytes by inhibiting apoptosis, a genetically programmed process of active cell death; inhibition of BCR-ABL expression by antisense oligonucleotides reversed the suppression of apoptosis as well as the enhancement of survival. The decreased rate of programmed cell death appears to be the primary mechanism by which BCR-ABL effects expansion of the leukemic clone in CML.","['Bedi, A', 'Zehnbauer, B A', 'Barber, J P', 'Sharkis, S J', 'Jones, R J']","['Bedi A', 'Zehnbauer BA', 'Barber JP', 'Sharkis SJ', 'Jones RJ']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD 21287-8967.']",['eng'],"['CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL46533/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73209-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 15;83(8):2038-44.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients, as a result of treatment with chemotherapy and immunosuppressive agents, undergo catabolic stress. In stressed patients attention has been focused on the optimal calorie: nitrogen ratio of total parenteral nutrition formulations. Theoretically, TPN formulas of low calorie: nitrogen ratio impede body protein catabolism. In bone marrow transplant patients negative nitrogen balance may persist despite high nitrogen intake. The purpose of the present study is to determine the effect of increasing nitrogen intake on nutritional and metabolic parameters in bone marrow transplant patients. The metabolic effect of an increased nitrogen dose during TPN was studied in 33 bone marrow transplant patients, divided into 2 groups. Patients were given total parenteral nutrition formulas providing a protein intake of 1.4 +/- 0.2 g of protein/kg IBW/day for the first group, and 2.3 +/- 0.12 g of protein/kg IBW/day for the II group. Total calories, non protein and protein, were held constant at 40 kcal/kg IBW/day for all patients. Data have been calculated for 4 weeks starting from the first week pretransplant. As we had expected, the patients who are the object of the present study were well nourished at the time of hospital admission, confirming the description of bone marrow transplant recipients published by other transplant centers.

In vitro cellular, as well as in vivo, studies of oxidizability have generally relied upon chemical indicators of peroxidation such as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. To examine the oxidizability of lipids in cells, we have measured oxygen uptake and, using electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping with alpha-(1-oxo-4-pyridyl)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN), the real time generation of lipid-derived free radicals. We have used our experimental in vitro cellular lipid modification model to examine the rate and extent of lipid peroxidation versus the degree of lipid unsaturation in L1210 murine leukemia cells. Lipid peroxidation was stimulated using the prooxidants iron, ascorbate, and the ether lipid compound 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine. We did a total cellular lipid analysis to determine the number of lipid carbon-carbon double bonds contained in L1210 cells enriched with eight fatty acids of different degrees of unsaturation. We found in cellular lipids that (i) lipid chain length had no apparent effect on the rate or extent of radical formation; (ii) the maximum amount of lipid radical generated increases with the total number of bis-allylic positions in the cellular lipids; and, most importantly, (iii) the rate of cellular lipid peroxidation increases exponentially with the number of bis-allylic positions. Our quantitative results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that the number of bis-allylic positions contained in the cellular lipids of intact cells determines their susceptibility, i.e., oxidizability, to free radical-mediated peroxidative events.","['Wagner, B A', 'Buettner, G R', 'Burns, C P']","['Wagner BA', 'Buettner GR', 'Burns CP']","['Department of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['CA31526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49264/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR59/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Fatty Acids/chemistry', 'Free Radicals', 'Hydrogen/*chemistry', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', '*Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Nitrogen Oxides', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Phospholipid Ethers/pharmacology', 'Pyridines', 'Solutions', 'Spin Labels', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/19 00:00,1994/04/19 00:01,['1994/04/19 00:00'],"['1994/04/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/19 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00181a003 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1994 Apr 19;33(15):4449-53. doi: 10.1021/bi00181a003.,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '0 (alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '7YNJ3PO35Z (Hydrogen)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, after 5 days of culture in the presence of NGF, the majority of embryonic day 21 sympathetic neurons can be supported by either of these factors. Furthermore, postnatal day 6 sympathetic neurons can be immediately supported by LIF and CNTF, indicating that acquisition of survival responsiveness occurs in vivo as well as in vitro.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-adenosine deaminase (ADA), or pegademase bovine, has FDA-approved labeling as replacement therapy for ADA deficiency in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease who are not suitable candidates for bone marrow transplantation. Pegademase bovine reverses the toxic accumulation of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in adenosine deaminase-deficient cells, restoring the immune system. PEG-asparaginase (pegaspargase) has shown promise in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia; allergic reactions have been minimal. Animal studies suggest that superoxide dismutase has potential use in conditions in which the body's ability to remove oxygen free radicals is reduced, such as burns and myocardial infarction; coupling with PEG may greatly increase the protein's half-life.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 340 patients had curative treatment with mantle or paraaortic and pelvic radiotherapy (1964 to 1972) or mantle plus paraaortic and spleen or splenic pedicle or total nodal radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (1973 to 1992) and have a follow-up of at least 1.5 years. Since 1987, after chemotherapy only modified involved fields were irradiated. All second tumors have been histologically verified. The cumulative incidence of second solid cancer of the patients have been compared with the age and sex specific expected rates according to the ""Zurcher Krebsregister 1980 to 1990"". RESULTS: We observed seven patients with leukemia after radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, five patients with non-Hodgkin-lymphoma and 21 patients with solid cancers after radiotherapy or radiotherapy and chemotherapy with a cumulative risk of all second malignancies of 7.0% (ten years), 30.7% (20 years) and 40.5% (24 years). Cumulative risk of second solid cancer was 3.1% (ten years), 9.3% (15 years), 23.5% (20 years) and 34.3% (24 years). Cumulative risk of second solid cancer was significantly higher than expected with no decrease of the relative risk after more than 20 years of follow-up. Comparable to the observations from Stanford, we observed a significantly higher risk of breast cancer in women less than 30 years of age at treatment. Relative risk of second solid cancer was higher after radiotherapy plus chemotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone, but the difference was not statistically significant. Nearly all patients with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy and a follow-up of ten years or more had radiotherapy with large fields. CONCLUSIONS: In patients after treatment of Hodgkin's disease with radiotherapy or radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, incidence of second solid cancer is significantly higher than expected. Incidence of second solid cancer after chemotherapy and large field radiotherapy is higher than after radiotherapy alone, but this difference is statistically not significant.","['Glanzmann, C', 'Veraguth, A', 'Lutolf, U M']","['Glanzmann C', 'Veraguth A', 'Lutolf UM']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Radio-Onkologie, Universitatsspital Zurich, Schweiz.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Here we report that a 15-kDa cellular protein called EAP (for EBER associated protein), previously shown to bind EBER1, is in fact the ribosomal protein L22. Approximately half of the L22 in EBV-positive cells is contained within the EBER1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle, whereas the other half residues in monoribosomes and polysomes. Immunofluorescence with anti-L22 antibodies demonstrates that L22 is localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleoli of uninfected human cells, as expected, whereas EBV-positive lymphocytes also show strong nucleoplasmic staining. In situ hybridization indicates that the EBER RNPs are predominantly nucleoplasmic, suggesting that L22 relocalization correlates with binding to EBER1 in vivo. Since incubation of uninfected cell extracts with excess EBER1 RNA does not remove L22 from preexisting ribosomes, in vivo binding of L22 by EBER1 may precede ribosome assembly. The gene encoding L22 has recently been identified as the target of a chromosomal translocation in certain patients with leukemia, suggesting that L22 levels may be a determinant in cell transformation.","['Toczyski, D P', 'Matera, A G', 'Ward, D C', 'Steitz, J A']","['Toczyski DP', 'Matera AG', 'Ward DC', 'Steitz JA']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06536-0812.']",['eng'],"['CA 16038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 40115/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/chemistry', '*Ribosomal Proteins', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism']",1994/04/12 00:00,1994/04/12 00:01,['1994/04/12 00:00'],"['1994/04/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/12 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.8.3463 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Apr 12;91(8):3463-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.8.3463.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '135844-68-7 (RPL22 protein, human)']",,,,PMC43597,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A monoclonal antibody (2H2) that recognizes the specific region of the N-terminal domain of the murine c-fgr gene product (Fgr) has been established. With an immune complex kinase assay in a monocytic leukemia cell line, 2H2 monoclonal antibody was shown to precipitate a 59-kDa protein that corresponds in molecular mass to murine Fgr. Fgr was expressed highly in lymph nodes, slightly in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, and barely in the thymus and was not detected in bone marrow. In the presence of a mild detergent, Fgr was coimmunoprecipitated with a 70-kDa protein (p70) or with p70 plus several other molecules that were expressed on the cell-surface membrane of macrophage tumor cell lines PU5-1.8 and J774.1, respectively. By contrast, Fgr was not coimmunoprecipitated with a low-affinity receptor for the Fc portion of IgG that is associated with human Fgr. The molecule was also coimmunoprecipitated with the Ly6C molecule from a macrophage cell line (J774.1) that showed protein-tyrosine kinase activity.

The TAL1 gene products possess a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that interacts in vitro with the bHLH proteins (E12 and E47) encoded by the E2A locus. We have now applied two independent methods, the two-hybrid procedure and co-immunoprecipitation analysis, to demonstrate that TAL1 and E2A polypeptides also associate in vivo. These studies show that the bHLH domain of TAL1 selectively interacts with the bHLH domains of E12 and E47, but not with the Id1 helix-loop-helix protein. TAL1 does not self-associate to form homodimeric complexes, implying that the in vivo functions of TAL1 depend on heterologous interaction with other bHLH proteins such as E12 and E47. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the presence of endogenous TAL1/E2A complexes in Jurkat cells, a leukemic line derived from a T-ALL patient.

Usually the high-grade component is a monomorphous, large cell lymphoma, but occasionally the high-grade component takes the form of Hodgkin's disease or a Hodgkin's-like lymphoma. Although Richter's syndrome is thought to represent clonal evolution of the underlying B-cell neoplasm in most cases, such a progression is difficult to explain when the high-grade component is Hodgkin's disease. We report two cases of Richter's syndrome in which the large cells had a morphology consistent with Reed-Sternberg cells and were found in a background of CLL. The large cells in both cases expressed the CD15 and CD30 antigens in a pattern characteristic of Reed-Sternberg cells, and the large cells in one case also expressed monotypic cytoplasmic immunoglobulin of the same type as that expressed by the underlying CLL. In both cases, Southern blot analysis of DNA from lymph nodes that contained both CLL and the Hodgkin's-like component showed single immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we found Epstein-Barr virus DNA in lymph nodes from both cases, and in peripheral blood lymphoid cells from one case 4 yr before the onset of Richter's syndrome.

Because of the high incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia and the danger of exacerbation of DIC with pregnancy, management of acute promyelocytic leukemia during pregnancy requires prompt and careful attention. CASE: A 29-year-old woman in her third trimester was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia and DIC. The infant was delivered by cesarean and the mother was successfully treated with tretinoin, inducing the leukemic promyelocytes to differentiate into mature granulocytes and possibly reversing the DIC. CONCLUSION: If the fetus can be delivered safely, tretinoin as a single agent is an option for the initial treatment of maternal acute promyelocytic leukemia because it does not suppress the bone marrow and may ameliorate DIC. Because of the danger of hyperleukocytosis, chemotherapy should be added initially if the white blood cell count is greater than 5000/microL. If the fetus cannot be delivered at a viable stage, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy is the alternative option.","['Celo, J S', 'Kim, H C', 'Houlihan, C', 'Canavan, B F', 'Manzullo, G P', 'Saidi, P']","['Celo JS', 'Kim HC', 'Houlihan C', 'Canavan BF', 'Manzullo GP', 'Saidi P']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Obstet Gynecol,Obstetrics and gynecology,0401101,IM,"['Adult', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/etiology', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Obstet Gynecol. 1994 May;83(5 Pt 2):808-11.,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight children had been continuously supported with a ventilator for 3 days to 4.5 years before transplantation and three were supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Indications for lung transplantation in this pediatric population included the following: cystic fibrosis (n = 13), pulmonary hypertension, and associated congenital heart disease (n = 10), pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect and nonconfluent pulmonary arteries (n = 3), pulmonary fibrosis (n = 6), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 1). Three children underwent retransplantation for acute graft failure (n = 2) or chronic rejection (n = 1). Pulmonary fibrosis was related to complications of treatment of acute of myelogenous leukemia with bone marrow transplantation in two children and to bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, interstitial pneumonitis, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis in four others. Thirteen children underwent lung transplantation and concomitant cardiac repair. Bilateral lung transplantation, ventricular septal defect closure and pulmonary homograft reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract to the transplanted lungs was performed in three children by means of a new technique that avoids the need for combined heart-lung transplantation. Two patients had ventricular septal defect closure and single lung transplant for Eisenmenger's syndrome, two had ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus and transplantation, three additional children underwent atrial septal defect closure and lung transplantation, and two underwent lung transplantation for congenital pulmonary vein stenosis. Eight early deaths and three late deaths occurred (actuarial 1-year survival 62%). Lung transplantation in children has been associated with acceptable early results, although modification of the adult implantation technique has been necessary. Lung transplantation and repair of complex congenital heart defects is possible; heart-lung transplantation may only be required for patients with severe left heart dysfunction and associated pulmonary vascular disease. Bronchiolitis obliterans remains a major concern for long-term graft function in pediatric lung transplant recipients.","['Spray, T L', 'Mallory, G B', 'Canter, C B', 'Huddleston, C B']","['Spray TL', 'Mallory GB', 'Canter CB', 'Huddleston CB']","[""Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis Children's Hospital, MO 63110.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/mortality', 'Heart Arrest, Induced', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation/methods/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lung Transplantation/*methods/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Missouri/epidemiology', 'Reoperation/mortality/statistics & numerical data']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-5223(94)70373-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1994 Apr;107(4):990-9; discussion 999-1000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At very low concentrations, retinoid stimulate proliferation of leukemic cells rather than induce their differentiation. Also, cRA in combination with tRA could induce differentiation of RA resistant HL-60 cells. Steady-state levels of RAR-alpha mRNA in HL-60 cells were not affected by either cRA or tRA. In contrast, cRA, but not tRA could reduced RXR-alpha mRNA accumulation in dose-dependent manner. The loss of partner for RAR may result in differential gene regulation through the retinoid pathway.

New indices of effector-target conjugation.,197-210,"New methods for simplified quantitation of effector-target conjugation have been developed. The binding unit (BU) is defined as the number of target cells required to bind a specified percentage of effector cells. The number of binding units is determined from binding isotherms in which effector conjugate frequencies are measured by holding constant the number of effector cells and by varying the number of target cells. Alternately, a binding unit can be defined as the number of effector cells required to bind a specified percentage of target cells. In this case, BU is computed from binding isotherms in which target conjugate frequencies are measured at different values of effector cells by holding constant the number of target cells. Also, the area under the curve (AUI) of these isotherms is another index that can be used as an overall measure of the binding capacity in an effector-target system. The experimental values of BU and AUI determined from effector and target isotherms agree well with theoretical predictions based on our previously developed binding model (J. Immunol. Methods (1992) 155, 133-147). The relationship between BU and AUI, and procedures to determine these parameters are shown. The value of these indices to express effector-target conjugation quantitatively has been confirmed by determining the values of BU and AUI for the NK-K562 effector-target system.","['Galvez, J', 'Cabrera, L', 'Lajarin, F', 'Garcia-Penarrubia, P']","['Galvez J', 'Cabrera L', 'Lajarin F', 'Garcia-Penarrubia P']","['Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Adult', 'Binding Sites', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Linear Models', 'Models, Biological', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(94)90395-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(94)90395-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1994 Apr 15;170(2):197-210. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(94)90395-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is characterized by lymphoadenopathy, hyperimmunoglobulinemia, and immune deficiency in both T and B cell functions. The development of disease requires the presence of mature T cells, especially CD4 T cells, and B cells. It has previously been shown that a B cell tumor line derived from MAIDS mouse stimulated a large fraction of unprimed T cells based on TCR V beta chain expression. This stimulatory activity was assumed to be mediated by a superantigen encoded by MAIDS virus. The stimulation of T cells by viral superantigen was thought to play a role in the development of the disease. To examine the role of T cell reactivity to MAIDS superantigen, we used TCR transgenic mice. There are two distinct T cell populations which can be distinguished based on their TCR expression and function in the TCR transgenic mice, one bearing the transgene derived alpha- and beta-chain TCR that is nonreactive to MAIDS superantigen and the other bearing an endogenous alpha- but transgene-derived beta-chain TCR that is reactive to superantigen. Unlike T cells found in noninfected TCR transgenic mice, anergic T cells expanding in virally infected TCR transgenic mice are homogeneous for the TCR phenotype, indicating the presence of a selection of T cells based on their TCR expression. T cell hybridomas established by fusing T cells from virus-infected transgenic mice to thymoma cell line are also anergic. We found mRNA of defective LP-BM5 virus in a majority of T cell hybridomas from virus-infected mice but not from noninfected mice. By using in vitro infection of T cell clones with recombinant virus containing LP-BM5 MAIDS virus gag gene, we have demonstrated that virus infection directly abrogated the Ag-specific reactivity of T cells. The establishment of anergic T cell hybridomas and the in vitro infection of T cells with recombinant viruses would be a useful tool in the analysis of biochemical and molecular mechanisms of T cell dysfunction in MAIDS.","['Kanagawa, O', 'Gayama, S', 'Vaupel, B']","['Kanagawa O', 'Gayama S', 'Vaupel B']","['Department of Pathology and Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/immunology', 'Genes, gag/genetics', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/microbiology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Superantigens', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 May 1;152(9):4671-9.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Superantigens)']",,,,,,['gag'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The immunophenotype was analysed in nine patients by immunofluorescence flow cytometry using a panel of 15 monoclonal antibodies. The DNA content of blast cells was determined using Vindelov's technique. RESULTS: The most relevant clinical and haematological disease characteristics included: the presence of enlarged spleen and liver by 56% and 67%, respectively; a moderate degree of leucocytosis with thrombocytopenia while haemoglobin was normal in 50% of patients. All patients received alkylating agents or hydroxyurea, or both. Interestingly, the chronic phase in patients receiving this latter drug was shorter. All cases showed a myeloid phenotype, four of them reactive only to early myeloid antigens (CD13/33); in the remaining cases the blast cells displayed granulomonocytic (CD14+, CD15+), erythroid (CD71 ), or megakaryocytic (CD61+, CD41+) markers. Coexpression of lymphoid related antigens (CD7, TdT, or CD19) was also detected. The morphological assessment of blast cells agreed with the immunophenotyping in five out of the nine cases. Blast cells from all six patients analysed displayed a diploid DNA content and the proportion of S-phase cells ranged from 0.4% to 4%.

The delta domain peptide inhibited the activation of the c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase by phorbol esters in permeabilized U937 leukemic cells. Mutation of c-Jun followed by transfection into U937 leukemic cells demonstrated that partial deletions of the delta domain are sufficient to block phosphorylation of the amino terminus of c-Jun. In vitro deletion of the amino-terminal (amino acids 31-44) half of the delta domain inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun. However, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 45-60) half only partially inhibited c-Jun phosphorylation.

The acquisition of immunogenicity by the H-2Kb-transformed clones following gene transfer is associated with the reduction of constitutive reactive superoxide radicals. When the levels of cellular superoxide for the H-2Kb-positive immunogenic clones were determined, they were significantly lower (30 to 60%) than that of the parental K36.16 tumor cells. This reduction of superoxide in the H-2Kb-transformed cells was associated with a significant increase in the level of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and GPX I, together with a reduction in the DNA-binding form of the NF-kappa B transcription factor. The K36.16 parental tumor cells were also found to be relatively more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of hydrogen peroxide in vitro. To further support the role of superoxide anion radicals in tumorigenesis, in vivo depletion of glutathione promoted the tumorigenicity of the H-2Kb-transformed clones in (AKR/J x C57BL/6/J) F1 mice, whereas SOD was able to reduce their tumorigenicity. In addition, the presence of R-sulfoxine (BSO) in spleen-cell cultures in vitro abolished the ability of the immune lymphocytes to develop into tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These observations support the concept that oxidative processes in tumor cells may have a strong influence on the host response against tumors.","['Chia, K Y', 'Lim, S P', 'Oei, A A', 'Sabapathy, T K', 'Hui, K M']","['Chia KY', 'Lim SP', 'Oei AA', 'Sabapathy TK', 'Hui KM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National University of Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Free Radicals', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/analysis', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/physiology']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910570215 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Apr 15;57(2):216-23. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910570215.,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most important preventive measure for cross-infection would be isolation of the infected or colonized patients and hand-washing. To prevent self-infection, it is essential to maintain the defensive ability of patient including normal flora, and active immunization or prophylactic antibiotic treatment will be needed in some patients.

Although candidiasis is the most common infection, mold infections are increasing in frequency. Fluconazole (FLU) is a new antifungal agent that has been used successfully to treat Candida infections and has modest activity against aspergillosis in animal models. Subtherapeutic doses of amphotericin B (AMB) have been considered effective as prophylaxis in these patients. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and toxicity of these agents as antifungal prophylaxis. METHODS: Adults with acute leukemia undergoing remission induction chemotherapy randomly were assigned to receive antifungal prophylaxis with AMB (0.5 mg/kg three times weekly) or FLU (400 mg daily). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was administered as an antibacterial prophylaxis. Prophylaxis was continued until the patient achieved complete remission or was treated for 8 weeks without antileukemic response. Prophylaxis was discontinued if the patient experienced a possible or proven fungal infection or a serious toxicity. RESULTS: Overall, 58% of the 36 patients assigned to AMB successfully completed prophylaxis compared with 80% of the 41 patients assigned to FLU (< 0.05). Proven, probable, or possible fungal infections occurred in 31% and 17% of the patients, respectively. The risk of discontinuing prophylaxis due to fungal infection or toxicity increased with time in the study and was significantly greater for AMB (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: At the dose used in this study, AMB was no more effective and was more toxic than FLU for prophylaxis of fungal infections in patients undergoing remission induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia.","['Bodey, G P', 'Anaissie, E J', 'Elting, L S', 'Estey, E', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H']","['Bodey GP', 'Anaissie EJ', 'Elting LS', 'Estey E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Medical Specialties, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amphotericin B/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Premedication', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940415)73:8<2099::aid-cncr2820730814>3.0.co;2-n [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Apr 15;73(8):2099-106. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940415)73:8<2099::aid-cncr2820730814>3.0.co;2-n.,"['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
