These vesicles change the intrinsic shape of chromatids to fit the different topology of the interphase nuclear spheroid. Reciprocal translocations between selected chromatids result whenever the nucleus of malignant cells organizes de novo certain exceptional or emergency differentiation paths. However, the almost unavoidable chimeric genes resulting from these translocations may be less ominous than hitherto suspected. This seems to be the case for chronic myelogenous leukemia, where the bcr-abl chimeric gene lessens the aggressiveness of the primary clone when functioning in the context of myelomonocitic differentiation. Finally, our model estimates the statistical incidences of the bcr-abl chimera. These estimates are found to agree with clinical data better than evaluations from the random mutation theory.","['Matioli, G T']",['Matioli GT'],"['University of Southern California, School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology, Los Angeles 90033-1054.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Chromatids/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*physiology']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 1990 May;32(1):11-9. doi: 10.1016/0306-9877(90)90061-i.,0306-9877 (Print) 0306-9877 (Linking),"['0306-9877(90)90061-I [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(90)90061-i [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Study Group of Mycosis in Hematologic Disease.,116-30,"The prophylactic and therapeutic effects of the oral administration of amphotericin B (AMPH) to patients with deep mycosis associated with hematologic diseases were evaluated in an investigation including determination of serum concentrations of the antibiotic. Prophylactic effects were examined in 111 subjects, and the efficacy rates averaged 83.8% at daily doses from 1,200 to 4,800 mg. The efficacy was significantly higher at a dose of 2,400 mg/day than at a dose of 1,200 mg/day (P less than 0.05). The efficacy rate tended to be higher when the length of administration period was 1 month or more. The percentage of the number of days of fever by neutrophil count was significantly less at a daily dose of 2,400 mg than at 1,200 mg in patients with neutrophil count of 1,000 cells/mm3 or less (P less than 0.001). The safety was evaluated in 131 subjects, and adverse effects were found in only 2 cases of nausea for an incidence rate of 1.5%. Therapeutic effects were studied in 12 cases, and efficacy rates averaged 58.3% at daily doses from 2,400 to 7,200 mg. Adverse effects consisted of 1 case of diarrhea among 15 subjects who were evaluated for the safety for an incidence rate of 6.7%. The serum concentrations of the antibiotic were examined in 60 of the prophylactic and therapeutic subjects. Average concentrations of AMPH at 4 hours after the first daily dose of 1,200, 2,400 and 4,800 mg were 0.040, 0.053 and 0.078 micrograms/ml, respectively. Concentrations gradually increased thereafter and reached averages of 0.089, 0.090 and 0.132 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the 3 dose levels on the 7th day. These results indicated that there were no serious adverse effects and serum concentrations were above the Candida MIC values at daily prophylactic and therapeutic doses of 1,200 to 7,200 mg of AMPH. Based on these findings, this drug can be expected to show prophylactic and therapeutic effects with safety in cases of deep mycosis.","['Urabe, A', 'Takaku, F', 'Mizoguchi, H', 'Nomura, T', 'Ogawa, T', 'Maekawa, T', 'Omine, M', 'Miura, Y', 'Hirashima, K', 'Takatani, O']","['Urabe A', 'Takaku F', 'Mizoguchi H', 'Nomura T', 'Ogawa T', 'Maekawa T', 'Omine M', 'Miura Y', 'Hirashima K', 'Takatani O', 'et al.']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Japan,Jpn J Antibiot,The Japanese journal of antibiotics,0154402,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy/prevention & control']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Antibiot. 1990 Jan;43(1):116-30.,0368-2781 (Print) 0368-2781 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Induction therapy with VAD and VAD plus cyclophosphamide (CVAD) was followed by a 2-year rotating maintenance program with multiple antileukemic combinations, and included early intensifications with Adriamycin and high-dose cytarabine (ara-C) and a late intensification with cyclophosphamide, carmustine (BCNU), and etoposide (VP-16) (CBV) followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Duration of therapy was 24 to 30 months. Eight-eight patients (84%) achieved complete remission (CR) with VAD-CVAD, and 94 (90%) ultimately had CR with continuation of the maintenance as planned. Induction mortality was 3%; only half of the patients required prolonged hospitalization of 1 week or longer, or intravenous antibiotics. Maintenance therapy was given to 79 patients, while nine with histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA)-matched related donors underwent allogeneic BMT. The median remission duration was 22 months, and the median survival was 19 months. Factors associated with significantly worse CR rates were older age, the presence of hypoalbuminemia or hyperbilirubinemia, L2 or L3 morphology, and myeloid markers on leukemic cells. Those associated with significantly worse remission durations were the presence of elevated leukocyte or absolute peripheral blast counts, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive or B-cell ALL, L2 morphology, and more than one course to achieve CR. Patients could be divided into standard-risk ALL (28% of patients) and high-risk ALL (72% of patients) with long-term remission rates of 70% versus less than 30%. The 26 patients who underwent CBV autologous BMT had similar long-term outcome compared with 21 patients who did not (older age, medical contraindications, or socioeconomic problems). The presence or absence of myeloid markers on leukemic cells did not affect long-term prognosis. We conclude that VAD therapy is a well-tolerated effective induction regimen. High-risk ALL patients require alternative maintenance investigational approaches.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Walters, R S', 'Keating, M J', 'Smith, T L', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Estey, E H', 'Huh, Y O', 'Spinolo, J', 'Dicke, K', 'Barlogie, B']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Walters RS', 'Keating MJ', 'Smith TL', ""O'Brien S"", 'Estey EH', 'Huh YO', 'Spinolo J', 'Dicke K', 'Barlogie B', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'CBV protocol', 'CVAD protocol', 'VAD I protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/toxicity']",,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Jun;8(6):994-1004. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.6.994.,0732-183X (Print) 0732-183X (Linking),['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.6.994 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

In the curative treatment of patients with Hodgkins disease, ionizing radiations are not associated with an increased frequency of leukemias and induced second tumors are no more frequent than following the use of alkylating agents. 4. All second tumors attributed to radiation therapy occur after a latent period of many years and except for leukemia usually are potentially curable. 5. The risks of radiation-induced second cancers are no greater than the risks of operative or anesthetic deaths and these catastrophes are immediate and non-remedial. 6.

The clinical spectrum varies from the incidental discovery of a pathologically raised monoclonal immunoglobulin on routine electrophoresis in asymptomatic patients to widespread skeletal involvement with incapacitating bone pain. Symptoms may result from a solitary tumor mass, described as an extramedullary plasmacytoma, in virtually any part of the body. Metabolic abnormalities commonly include hypercalcemia, elevated plasma urate levels, or the development of amyloidosis, all of which may disturb renal function. High paraprotein levels cause hyperviscosity, resulting in generalized debility and varying degrees of disturbed mental function. The natural history is determined by the mass of the tumor coupled with its unique biologic features. Median survival of unselected patients, without effective treatment but once symptoms are evident, is approximately 7 months; this period can be significantly prolonged with appropriate therapy. As a first step, urgent medical management is often necessary, centering on rehydration, correction of hyperviscosity, and reversal of metabolic defects, each of which may improve renal function. Over the longer term, specific antitumor drugs have extended median survival to approximately 30 months, and most regimens include a combination of melphalan and prednisone, with or without other cytotoxic drugs.

A model system with myeloid cells has shown that normal hematopoietic cells require different proteins to induce cell multiplication and cell differentiation, and that a cascade of interactions between proteins determines the correct balance between immature and mature cells in normal development. Gene cloning has shown that there is a family of different genes for these proteins. Normal protein regulators of hematopoiesis can control the abnormal growth of certain types of leukemic cells and suppress malignancy by inducing differentiation to mature nondividing cells. Genetic abnormalities that give rise to malignancy in these leukemic cells can be bypassed and their effects nullified by inducing differentiation, which stops cells from multiplying. These hematopoietic regulatory proteins are active in culture and in vivo and have been used clinically to correct defects in blood cell development. The results provide new approaches to therapy.","['Sachs, L']",['Sachs L'],"['Department of Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Growth Substances)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics/physiopathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Clone Cells', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/genetics']",110,1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1990 May 15;65(10):2196-206. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900515)65:10<2196::aid-cncr2820651006>3.0.co;2-y.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),['10.1002/1097-0142(19900515)65:10<2196::aid-cncr2820651006>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Cells from patients and their donors were tested in 51Cr release assays against fully allogeneic CML targets and against cultured K562 targets; cells from 26 patients were tested against host-derived CML targets that were cryopreserved before transplantation. Cultured CML targets (K562) were highly susceptible to lysis by freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and to a greater degree by PBL cultured in medium containing interleukin-2 (IL-2) in all assays performed. In contrast, noncultured CML targets were lysed only by IL-2-activated cells from a subset of patients. When present, lytic activity to CML targets was detectable as early as 3 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, and remained positive throughout the posttransplant period. Optimal lytic activity developed within the first week of culture and required greater than or equal to 250 U/mL of IL-2 in the culture medium. Lytic activity to fully allogeneic and host-derived CML targets appeared to be mediated by CD16+ and CD56+ cells but not by CD3+ cells. Lysis of allogeneic CML targets was variable, but patients could be divided into two groups: those with and those without lytic activity to the majority of targets tested. The basis for the differences in lytic activity could not be ascribed to target susceptibility to lysis, the proportion of NK cells in the cultures, or to the phenotype of the NK cell subsets in the cultures. When tested in parallel, the lytic activity of donor and recipient cultures against host-derived CML targets was highly correlated, suggesting that there may be inherent differences in the ability of NK cells to recognize CML targets. The risk of relapse for patients who failed to generate lytic activity against host-derived CML targets was significantly increased over that for patients with lytic activity against host leukemia. These data indicate that posttransplant immunotherapy with IL-2 designed to activate NK cells will likely augment the graft-versus-leukemia potential of the graft.","['Hauch, M', 'Gazzola, M V', 'Small, T', 'Bordignon, C', 'Barnett, L', 'Cunningham, I', 'Castro-Malaspinia, H', ""O'Reilly, R J"", 'Keever, C A']","['Hauch M', 'Gazzola MV', 'Small T', 'Bordignon C', 'Barnett L', 'Cunningham I', 'Castro-Malaspinia H', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Keever CA']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jun 1;75(11):2250-62.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)84313-4 [pii]'],,['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The overall incidence of early hemorrhagic death (within the first 10 days of treatment) was 9.4%, with no significant differences between the various groups. Similarly, there were no differences in complete remission rates or duration of survival. The consumption of packed red blood cells and platelet concentrates was similar for two of the groups, and there was a significantly greater use of platelet concentrates for heparin-treated patients. High blast cell counts on the day of admission were significantly associated with hemorrhagic death within the first 10 days.

Levels were determined in 31 normal healthy controls, 30 patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 21 patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), 27 patients with myocardial infarction (MI), 26 patients with acute leukaemia and 56 patients with liver disease. Considering all subjects, significant correlations were established between the results of all assays. Notably high correlations (r greater than 0.9) were established between plasma and serum levels of D-dimer, between plasma levels of D-dimer and serum levels of FgE, and between serum levels of D-dimer and FgE. All assays showed very high discrimination (sensitivity) between the normal control group and patients with DIC (97-100%), but there were marked differences between the assays in sensitivity for DVT and MI. In general, the FgE assay was more sensitive than the D-dimer assay, whilst both the FgE and D-dimer assays were more sensitive than the TAT assay. The same trends were apparent in the capability of the assays to discriminate between the normal control group and patients with acute leukaemia and liver disease: disorders with an unknown prevalence of activation of coagulation/fibrinolysis. Our results indicated that measurements of fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDPs) in serum were almost unaffected by artefacts. The data further suggested that the broad-spectrum FgE assay was better than the more specific D-dimer assay in detecting clinical hypercoagulability. Our study showed that, in the clinical conditions examined, FDPs were more effective markers of hypercoagulability than TAT.","['Boisclair, M D', 'Lane, D A', 'Wilde, J T', 'Ireland, H', 'Preston, F E', 'Ofosu, F A']","['Boisclair MD', 'Lane DA', 'Wilde JT', 'Ireland H', 'Preston FE', 'Ofosu FA']","['Department of Haematology, Charing Cross & Westminster Medical School, London.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (antithrombin III-protease complex)', '0 (fibrin fragment D)', '0 (fibrinogen-related antigen)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens/analysis', 'Antithrombin III/analysis', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Blood Coagulation Tests/*methods', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/blood', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/analysis', 'Fibrinolysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Liver Diseases/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction/blood', 'Peptide Hydrolases/analysis', 'Thrombosis/blood']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Apr;74(4):471-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb06337.x.,0007-1048 (Print) 0007-1048 (Linking),['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb06337.x [doi]'],,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,

The first eight patients (group A) received i.v. L-ase alone (20,000 U/m2 on alternate days over 10 d); the last seven patients (group B) received, in addition to L-ase, bolus injection of antithrombin concentrate (2000 U) on alternate days for a total of six administrations, beginning with the second L-ase infusion. Increased levels of TAT (P less than 0.05) and D-dimer (P less than 0.01) were observed prior to L-ase, possibly related to inflammation and cytolysis secondary to previous chemotherapy. In patients treated with L-ase alone, further elevation of TAT (P less than 0.05) and persistence of increased D-dimer were observed, associated with marked reduction of the anticoagulant activities of protein C, protein S and antithrombin III. At variance, in patients receiving antithrombin III supplementation there was no increase of TAT and a normalization of D-dimer levels occurred during L-ase treatment. In these patients, mean plasma antithrombin III activity was maintained at levels higher than 70% of normal throughout the treatment. The rate of decline of fibrinogen, factor IX, protein C and protein S was unaffected by antithrombin III supplementation, indicating that hypercoagulability has little if any relevance for the reduction of coagulation factors and inhibitors induced by L-ase treatment.

These early findings suggest a potential role for IL-2 in the treatment of certain malignant neoplasms including lymphomas and leukemias. Advanced, rapidly growing tumors are generally not amenable to immunotherapy. Therefore, it is more likely that protocols with IL-2 will be used to prolong remission and prevent relapse in leukemia patients with minimal tumor load. Several approaches are currently being tested in animal experiments and clinical trials. Activation of tumor-reactive lymphocytes (specific or nonspecific) by IL-2 in vivo may eradicate residual leukemia in patients with occult disease. In vitro-propagated autologous or allogeneic leukemia-reactive T cells may be infused with IL-2 to facilitate the tumor destruction. The IL-2 enhances monoclonal antibody-dependent effector systems, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vivo. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes on leukemia/lymphoma cells could therefore be used with IL-2 to target nonspecific effectors to destroy tumor cells. Other cytokines appear to potentiate various antitumor activities of IL-2, including cytotoxicity of antigen-specific T lymphocytes or lymphokine-activated killer cells in vitro, and these combined effects may be exploited in clinical trials in which more than one cytokine is used simultaneously or in sequence. Finally, a stepwise completion of clinical protocols testing this immunologic approach in combination with other treatment modalities is necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Malkovska, V', 'Sondel, P M']","['Malkovska V', 'Sondel PM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Bacterial products with established usefulness include BCG, C. parvum and L-Asparaginase. Immunotherapy with such agents has not, however, found general application, although revived interest in 'Coley's mixed toxins' (used earlier this century) paralleled the development of their presumed effector molecules, tumour necrosis factor and lymphotoxin. Many other Cytokines, both natural or recombinant, are now produced on a vast scale following the recent biotechnology revolution. Of these, Alpha Interferons have already proved useful in hairy cell leukaemia, carcinoid tumours, renal cell cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic granulocytic leukaemia and certain lymphomas, whilst their use as adjuvants or in combination is currently being investigated. More recently, Interleukin-2, which stimulates the clonal expansion of activated T-cells, has shown promise both as a single agent, and when used with lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells or tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS). A different approach involves the Colony Stimulating Factors such as G-CSF and GM-CSF which reduce the degree and duration of treatment-related myelosuppression, thereby allowing more intensive cytotoxic or radiation therapy, as well as facilitating early recovery following bone marrow transplantation. Monoclonal antibodies have not proved as specific for malignant cells as was originally hoped, but certain tumours, such as lymphoma, are now realistic targets for therapy. Increasingly sophisticated effector mechanisms (e.g. conjugated pro-drugs) and genetically engineered ""humanised"" monoclonal antibody hybrids present the brightest hopes for the future. Biotherapy, the ""fourth modality of cancer treatment"" has already assumed its place alongside surgery, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, and will grow in importance as our understanding of the molecular biology of cancer increases in the coming decades.","['Nethersell, A B']",['Nethersell AB'],"['Department of Clinical Investigation, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Beckenham, Kent, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,['0 (Immunologic Factors)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",50,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 1990 Mar;19(2):223-34.,0304-4602 (Print) 0304-4602 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

T3-induced changes in cardiac function can result from direct or indirect T3 effects. Direct T3 effects result from T3 action in the heart itself and are mediated by nuclear or extranuclear mechanisms. Extranuclear T3 effects, which occur independent of nuclear T3 receptor binding and increases in protein synthesis, influence primarily the transport of amino acids, sugars, and calcium across the cell membrane. Nuclear T3 effects are mediated by the binding of T3 to specific nuclear receptor proteins, which results in increased transcription of T3-responsive cardiac genes. The T3 receptor is a member of the ligand-activated transcription factor family and is encoded by cellular erythroblastosis A (c-erb A) genes. The c-erb A protein is the cellular homologue of the viral erythroblastosis A (v-erb A) protein, which causes red cell leukemia in chickens. Currently, three T3-binding isoforms of the c-erb protein and two non-T3-binding nuclear proteins that exert positive and negative effects on T3-responsive cardiac genes have been identified. T3 increases the heart transcription of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) alpha gene and decreases the transcription of the MHC beta gene, leading to an increase of myosin V1 and a decrease in myosin V3 isoenzymes. Myosin V1, which is composed of two MHC alpha, has a higher myosin ATPase activity than myosin V3, which contains two MHC beta. The globular head of myosin V1, with its higher ATPase activity, leads to a more rapid movement of the globular head of myosin along the thin filament, resulting in an increased velocity of contraction. T3 also leads to an increase in the speed of diastolic relaxation, which is caused by the more efficient pumping of the calcium ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This T3 effect results from T3-induced increases in the level of the mRNA coding for the SR calcium ATPase protein, leading to an increased number of calcium ATPase pump units in the SR. Overall, thyroid hormone leads to an increase in ATP consumption in the heart. In addition, less chemical energy of ATP is used for contractile purposes and more of it goes toward heat production, which causes a decreased efficiency of the contractile process in the hyperthyroid heart.","['Dillmann, W H']",['Dillmann WH'],"['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)']",IM,"['Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Triiodothyronine/genetics/*pharmacology']",55,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1990 Jun;88(6):626-30. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(90)90530-q.,0002-9343 (Print) 0002-9343 (Linking),"['0002-9343(90)90530-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(90)90530-q [doi]']",,['HL25022/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

In the other recombinant VV, WR-env17, the env gene was inserted within the signal sequence of the VV hemagglutinin (HA) gene, so that the reading frame for the env gene was in phase with that for the HA gene. Comparative studies were performed on the mode of expression and processing of the env proteins in relation to their immunogenicity. In WR-env17-infected cells, translation was initiated exclusively from the initiation methionine of the HA to produce nascently the chimeric env protein, including the altered HA signal peptide. Both this altered HA signal peptide and the internalized env signal peptide functioned as insertion signals for the endoplasmic reticulum. Although about half of the nascent chimeric protein was cleaved at the carboxyl terminus of the internalized env signal peptide to produce the authentic env protein, the other half was cleaved at the carboxyl terminus of the altered HA signal peptide alone to synthesize the chimeric protein. These events led to a less efficient transport of the env protein produced by WR-env17 from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus than that of the authentic env protein synthesized by WR-proenv1.

The ets-1 gene products were characterized using a specific monoclonal antibody developed against a bacterially expressed v-ets protein. The ets-1 gene product in the human T-cell line CEM was found to consist of at least six species: four major species with apparent molecular weights of 51 kDa (p51), 48 kDa (p48), 42 kDa (p42), and 39 kDa (p39); and two minor species of 52 kDa (pp52) and 49 kDa (pp49), which are demonstrated to be the phosphorylated forms of p51 and p48, respectively. All of the ets-1 proteins are related to each other and are considered products of the ets-1 gene. Subcellular localization showed that the pp52 and p51 are found mainly in the cytoplasm, while p48 and p39 are found mainly in the nucleus. Specific antibodies against various exons of ets-1 showed that both p42 and p39 lack a region corresponding to exon VII. Polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed the presence of an additional RNA product that corresponds to mRNA lacking exon VII. These results suggest that the human ets-1 gene encodes multiple proteins that are generated by at least two distinct mechanisms: alternative splicing of mRNA and protein phosphorylation.","['Koizumi, S', 'Fisher, R J', 'Fujiwara, S', 'Jorcyk, C', 'Bhat, N K', 'Seth, A', 'Papas, T S']","['Koizumi S', 'Fisher RJ', 'Fujiwara S', 'Jorcyk C', 'Bhat NK', 'Seth A', 'Papas TS']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 May;5(5):675-81.,0950-9232 (Print) 0950-9232 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Western blotting analyses with these McAbs were performed on human leukemia-lymphoma cells. All T-cell lines were positive in p75c-myb expression. B-cell lines were variable, myeloid and erythroid cells were positive although the amount of expressed p75c-myb was less than the T-cell lines. Cells isolated from patients were positive in expression except for cells from acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation (AML M2), acute hypergranular promyelocytic leukemia (AML M3) and erythroleukemia (AML M6) developed from myelodysplastic syndromes. Differences in p75c-myb expression seemed to depend upon the differentiation stage and distinctive lineage from which each cell line had been established. The p75c-myb expression in HL60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line) showed remarkably high at logarithmic growth. When examined with HL60, p75c-myb expression significantly decreased during the differentiation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or retinoic acid.

Based on these findings, Phase I trials were started elsewhere in patients with solid tumors, but were discontinued because of toxicity. In leukemic patients, we were able to demonstrate a good correlation between biochemical parameters (i.e., decline in IMPDH activity and GTP concentrations in blast cells) and clinical response. The most consistent responses to therapy were seen in patients with myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. Severe toxicity was seen in the earlier patients in the study.

Two molecular mutant genotypes were recognized upon digestion with NcoI and subsequent probing with a 1.1 kb cDNA insert from plasmid pMtk 4: (i) no detectable alteration, and (ii) the absence of the functional tkb allele as indicated by the absence of the 6.3 kb fragment. In combination with the previously established chromosomal nature of most small colony tk -/- mutants, this permitted the classification of these 10 mutagens according to the relative proportions of each of four classes of genetic damage they induced. AHA and EMS gave mutational spectra consistent with their point mutational effects in other systems. The other eight mutagens induced mostly small colony mutants, most of which had lost the entire original tkb allele. Methotrexate induced high frequencies of large colony mutants at the tk locus, most of which lacked the tkb allele, although it is weakly or non-mutagenic at the hemizygous hprt locus in these same cells. At least three of these mutagens-methotrexate, caffeine, methapyrilene (and possibly procarbazine)--lack structural alerts for DNA reactivity, implying a major class of non-DNA primary targets for mutagenicity in mammalian cells that interact secondarily with the chromosome.

Progression of disease is paralleled by the increase of SICRI levels in the serum; this increase of SICRI levels did not correlate with a decreased concentration of circulating glucose. SICRI was isolated and purified from spleen infiltrated with leukemic cells. Monospecific antiinsulin immunoglobulin G was used for immunoaffinity chromatography to isolate SICRI from tumor tissue. The purified substance yielded a single band with a molecular mass of about 150 kDa in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturating and non-denaturating conditions. Purified SICRI enhanced growth of myeloid leukemia cells in soft agar. Biochemical and biological data together with our previous results obtained in other experimental tumors provide evidence that SICRI and insulin are two distinct biologically active agents.

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies reported between 1968 and September 1989 were identified through computer searches using MEDLINE and through extensive searching of bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: All articles, abstracts, and reviews were evaluated, and those that contained therapeutic data were analyzed for response rates, survival, and toxicity. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Therapies for the myelodysplastic syndromes have included hormones, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, and differentiating agents, including hematopoietic growth factors. With the exception of bone marrow transplantation, none is curative or increases survival. Hematopoietic growth factors are of interest for clinical trials, because they increase the number of neutrophils and, occasionally, the number of platelets in patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes. Nonetheless, hematopoietic growth factors are not without toxicity; most notably, they are associated with a risk for acceleration to acute myeloid leukemia, and their effect on survival remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Standard therapy for the myelodysplastic syndromes is supportive care. When the disease progresses, patients with aggressive histologic or other poor-risk features should be considered for aggressive chemotherapy, with or without growth factors, or bone marrow transplantation. Patients with good prognostic features are candidates for therapy with growth factors or other potential differentiating agents. Carefully designed and conducted clinical trials that incorporate correlative laboratory science are essential to developing a more rational approach to therapy.","['Cheson, B D']",['Cheson BD'],"['National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hormones)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Growth Substances/therapeutic use', 'Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*therapy']",121,1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1990 Jun 15;112(12):932-41. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-112-12-932.,0003-4819 (Print) 0003-4819 (Linking),['10.7326/0003-4819-112-12-932 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

This procedure was examined in samples from 3 normal volunteers and 29 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphosarcoma cell leukemia (LSCL), blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-BC), or other unclassified leukemias. PLP fixation preserved the immunoreactivity of surface glycoproteins as well as immunoglobulins to the most satisfactory extent. Leukemic cells fixed with PLP maintained their fine structural details, so that we could identify their cytoplasmic organelles, although glutaraldehyde produced the best preservation of cellular ultrastructure. In three patients with ALL, our method revealed that a significant portion of blasts possessed both lymphoid surface antigens and peroxidase-positive cytoplasmic granules. Our method was also useful in identifying the lineage of peroxidase-negative leukemic cells, including monoblastic leukemia and megakaryoblastic leukemia cells. Ultraimmunocytochemistry using PLP fixation and the ABC technique may be a promising strategy for determining the nature of blastic cells that remain unclear after a conventional work-up, for characterizing leukemic cells in patients with a relatively low blast cell count in the bone marrow or peripheral blood, and for estimating the presence and frequency of leukemia with multilineage expression.","['Yano, T', 'Ohtake, K I', 'Kameda, K', 'Kizaki, M', 'Ogawa, T']","['Yano T', 'Ohtake KI', 'Kameda K', 'Kizaki M', 'Ogawa T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1405-69-2 (Avidin)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Avidin', 'Biotin', 'Blood Platelets/enzymology', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Peroxidases/blood', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1990 Jun;34(2):140-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830340211.,0361-8609 (Print) 0361-8609 (Linking),['10.1002/ajh.2830340211 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

In 1948 the accompanying megaloblastic maturation arrest was explained by inactivation of the methylcobalamin coenzyme and subsequent folate deficiency. We studied the anti-leukemic effect of N2O on a transplantable acute leukemia in B(rown) N(orway) rats. Progression of this B,N,M(yelocytic)L(eukemia) was measured as spleen and liver weights, and leukemic blood cell counts. The deoxyuridine (dU)-suppression test provided in vitro indication of the functional folate activity of leukemic cells. Breathing of N2O-oxygen considerably reduced but did not eradicate, BNML-proliferation. Addition of anti-metabolites, interfering with some enzyme in the folate metabolism beyond the methylcobalamin co-enzyme dependent methionine synthase step, acted at least synergistically. The anti-leukemic effect of cycloleucine, which reduces S-adenosyl-methionine synthesis by inactivation of methionine adenosyltransferase, was moderate but became much stronger with N2O inhalation. Methotrexate, a potent anti-leukemic agent by inhibiting tetrahydrofolate (THF) generation through inactivation of di-HF reductase, became highly anti-BNML, even in low dosage when combined with or preceded by N2O. 5-Fluorouracil, which inhibits methylene-THF dependent thymidilate synthase, itself was surprisingly anti-BNML, but also became much more potent with previous or concomitant N2O exposure. Preliminary dU-suppression test results with human acute leukemia cells, exposed to N2O and/or folate antagonists in vitro, correlated well with the in vivo BNML-experiments. Combining the anticobalamin activity of N2O with an anti-folate therefore seems to be a promising chemotherapeutic approach.","['Abels, J', 'Kroes, A C', 'Ermens, A A', 'van Kapel, J', 'Schoester, M', 'Spijkers, L J', 'Lindemans, J']","['Abels J', 'Kroes AC', 'Ermens AA', 'van Kapel J', 'Schoester M', 'Spijkers LJ', 'Lindemans J']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['BR1SN1JS2W (mecobalamin)', 'K50XQU1029 (Nitrous Oxide)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*prevention & control', 'Nitrous Oxide/*toxicity', 'Vitamin B 12/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors']",45,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1990 Jun;34(2):128-31. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830340209.,0361-8609 (Print) 0361-8609 (Linking),['10.1002/ajh.2830340209 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

2187120,NLM,MEDLINE,19900615,20191029,7,1,1990,Etoposide and teniposide in the treatment of acute leukemia.,3-10,"Etoposide and teniposide are semi-synthetic glucoside derivatives of podophyllotoxin with a documented anti-tumour activity in various types of malignant diseases. It was an early observation that these epiphodophyllotoxins were efficacious in hematological malignancies such as lymphomas and leukemias. In this report the clinical evidence supporting the activity of etoposide and teniposide in acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) is reviewed. Unlike podophyllotoxin, etoposide and teniposide do not appear to affect microtubular function nor arrest cells in mitosis. These epiphodophyllotoxins, like other DNA intercalating agents, have topoisomerase II as their target. Most studies with etoposide have been performed in ANLL and with teniposide in ALL. This choice seems to be rather arbitrary and is better explained by traditional reasons than actual study results. The data in acute leukemias are partly flawed by the absence of certain prospective comparative trials. However, the current information on etoposide clearly shows that this agent has substantial activity in ANLL and may well be incorporated into front-line regimens and the same is true for teniposide in the treatment of ALL. Nevertheless, based on available literature, there are no convincing data to the author's mind to support that one of these agents is superior to the other in the treatment of acute leukemias.","['Bjorkholm, M']",['Bjorkholm M'],"['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",56,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1990;7(1):3-10. doi: 10.1007/BF03000484.,0736-0118 (Print) 0736-0118 (Linking),['10.1007/BF03000484 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Out of 40 patients in remission, 10 showed functional host and donor haemopoiesis (mixed chimerism), whereas in the other 30 (complete chimerism) host haemopoiesis was never detected. Seven of the 14 evaluable patients who relapsed showed the reappearance of host haemopoiesis at the time of relapse. Analysis of the dose of total body irradiation (TBI) indicated that patients who achieved mixed chimerism, whether or not they relapsed, had received significantly lower doses than those with complete chimerism. However, some patients with complete chimerism had received a TBI dose equivalent to the dose received by those with mixed chimerism, suggesting that the TBI dose is not the only factor determining the reappearance of host haemopoiesis. The data on chimerism and relapse suggest that there is heterogeneity in radiosensitivity between normal marrow cells and leukaemic cells, and also within the different types of leukaemia. The incidence/severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) was significantly higher in patients with complete chimerism than in mixed chimeras, suggesting that mixed chimerism may play a role in the development of tolerance. Alternatively the absence of GVHD (i.e. tolerance) may be responsible for the persistence of host haemopoietic cells.","['Frassoni, F', 'Strada, P', 'Sessarego, M', 'Miceli, S', 'Corvo, R', 'Scarpati, D', 'Vitale, V', 'Piaggio, G', 'Raffo, M R', 'Sogno, G']","['Frassoni F', 'Strada P', 'Sessarego M', 'Miceli S', 'Corvo R', 'Scarpati D', 'Vitale V', 'Piaggio G', 'Raffo MR', 'Sogno G', 'et al.']","['Servizio Immunoematologia Centro Trasfusionale, Ospedali Galliera, Universita di Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/pathology/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Radiation Chimera/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*pathology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Apr;5(4):235-40.,0268-3369 (Print) 0268-3369 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

AML-BFM Study Group.,1932-40,"The main difference between the two cooperative studies on therapy of childhood acute myelogenous leukemia AML-BFM-78 and AML-BFM-83 was the addition of an 8-day ADE (cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, etoposide) induction treatment in the second study. Due to this intensification, the relapse rate, but not the rate of induction failures, was reduced. The probability of a 6-year event-free survival increased from 38%, SD 4%, in study AML-BFM-78 to 49%, SD 4%, in study AML-BFM-83, P = .08. The improvement of the 6-year event-free interval (EFI) was significant in the second study (61%, SD 4%, versus 47%, SD 5%, P less than .05); it was restricted to the FAB types M1 through M4 (EFI: 67%, SD 5%, versus 45%, SD 5%, P less than .01). The difference in EFI seen in FAB M5 was not statistically significant (EFI: 40%, SD 10%, versus 63%, SD 11%, NS). According to the results of the second study, two different risk groups (low and high) could be identified by combinations of predominantly pretherapeutic parameters. The low risk group, comprising 37% of the patients who achieved complete remission, included the FAB types with granulocytic differentiation and specific additional features: FAB M1 with Auer rods, FAB M2 with white blood cell count of less than 20,000/microL, FAB M3 all patients, and FAB M4 with eosinophilia. The 6-year Kaplan-Meier estimation of EFI is 91%, SD 4%, compared with 42%, SD 6% in the high risk group.

These data suggest that the role of the Moloney IN protein in the early steps of integration involves sequence-specific recognition of the DNA sequences found at the ends of the long terminal repeats.","['Krogstad, P A', 'Champoux, J J']","['Krogstad PA', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Immunoblotting', 'Integrases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism']",,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Jun;64(6):2796-801. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.6.2796-2801.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.6.2796-2801.1990 [doi]'],PMC249460,"['CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-HD07233/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

NF kappa B may play a central role in mediating TNF's gene regulatory action; however, the molecular mechanisms of TNF-induced NF kappa B activation are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate with two human leukemic cell lines, K562 and Jurkat, that TNF induces rapid and transient activation and translocation of protein kinase C (PK-C) from the cytosol to the membranes, which is followed by the emergence of kappa B-binding activity. In order to investigate whether TNF-mediated PK-C activation can be linked to induction of NF kappa B, we tried to block TNF action by use of various protein kinase C inhibitors as well as down-regulation of PK-C. Preincubation of Jurkat cells with protein kinase inhibitor H7 or staurosporine blocked PK-C activation by either TNF or phorbol 12-myristate 12-acetate (PMA). This pretreatment regimen completely inhibited NF kappa B activation by PMA. In contrast, TNF's ability to induce NF kappa B remained unaffected. In addition, NF kappa B was TNF-inducible in Jurkat cells depleted for PK-C by long-term exposure to high dose phorbol ester. The data indicate that PK-C is not required for NF kappa B activation by TNF and imply a novel, PK-C-independent mechanism of physiological NF kappa B activation.","['Meichle, A', 'Schutze, S', 'Hensel, G', 'Brunsing, D', 'Kronke, M']","['Meichle A', 'Schutze S', 'Hensel G', 'Brunsing D', 'Kronke M']","['Klinische Arbeitsgruppe der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Gottingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 May 15;265(14):8339-43.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)39077-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

A comprehensive map of protein-binding sites facilitates construction of a simple chimeric promoter responsive to the viral tax2 gene product.,8237-42,"We present a map describing the binding of cellular proteins to a 300-base pair (bp) region of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeat. The map accounts for nearly all of the DNase I protection reported in a previous study using crude nuclear extracts. Notable features include a complex arrangement of overlapping binding sites encompassing the 21-bp repeat elements (see accompanying paper) as well as binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 and NF-I that significantly deviate from the previously defined consensus recognition sequences. Based on the binding results, we constructed simple chimeric promoters containing 21-bp repeat elements, Sp1-, and nuclear factor I-binding sites upstream of a TATA box. Transient transfection experiments show that these promoters are expressed in T-cells and are regulated by the viral tax2 gene product. Deletion of the Sp1 and nuclear factor I sites abolishes tax-induction, suggesting that one or both of these proteins play a role in mediating the tax-responsiveness conferred by the 21-bp repeat element.","['Nyborg, J K', 'Matthews, M A', 'Yucel, J', 'Walls, L', 'Golde, W T', 'Dynan, W S', 'Wachsman, W']","['Nyborg JK', 'Matthews MA', 'Yucel J', 'Walls L', 'Golde WT', 'Dynan WS', 'Wachsman W']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder 80309.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Y-Box-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (YBX1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', '*CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Viral', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NFI Transcription Factors', 'Nuclear Proteins', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/microbiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Y-Box-Binding Protein 1']",,1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 May 15;265(14):8237-42.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)39063-5 [pii]'],,"['CA01113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

A review.,365-80,"Mitoxantrone, a cytotoxic anthracenedione derivative, has given clinical evidence of beneficial activity in breast cancer, lymphoma and leukaemia. Several different mechanisms of action have been suggested to account for this. In addition to intercalation, biological effects such as electrostatic interactions with DNA, DNA-protein cross-links, immunosuppressive activities, inhibition of topoisomerase II, prostaglandin biosynthesis and calcium release have been described. Various methods of drug monitoring in biological fluids and tissues are available: the highest sensitivity has been achieved with high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, radioimmunoassay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Early pharmacokinetic studies of mitoxantrone in experimental animals using radioactive material showed an extensive tissue distribution and a long terminal plasma half-life. The best fit for the plasma concentration-time curve in humans is achieved in a 3-compartment model. All studies reported a short absorption half-life of between 4.1 and 10.7 minutes, with the distribution phase being between 0.3 and 3.1 hours. In contrast, the values of the terminal half-life are quite variable, ranging from 8.9 hours to 9 days. Differences might be attributed to assay sensitivity, number and weighting of data points beyond 24 hours and coadministration drugs. Many studies showed a very large volume of distribution with sequestration of mitoxantrone in a deep tissue compartment. In autopsy studies, relatively high tissue concentrations have been measured in liver, bone marrow, heart, lung, spleen and kidney. Bile is the major route for the elimination of mitoxantrone, with lesser amounts excreted in the urine. Several metabolites have been separated, 2 of which were identified as the monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acid derivatives. Mitoxantrone is usually administered by rapid intravenous infusion at 3-weekly intervals; other regimens include continuous infusion, daily repeated doses or weekly administration.

A binding assay between isolated NM and 32P-end-labeled c-myc fragments in the presence of unlabeled competitors was used, and a 3'-end DraI/DraI fragment of 172 base pairs containing the first of the two polyadenylation [poly(A)] signals was identified as an in vitro MAR. Direct detection of endogenous c-myc fragments remaining NM bound after restriction digestion was used, and an in vivo MAR has been identified as the ClaI/EcoRI 1.4-kilobase pair fragment containing the 172-base pair in vitro MAR fragment. In addition, a nuclear protein (Mr = 25,000, p25) demonstrating preferential binding to the 172-base pair c-myc MAR has been identified and partially purified. This protein is diminished in the nuclei of the cells induced by phorbol ester to undergo macrophage differentiation.

The activity of the enzyme was five times higher in leukemic cells than in normal lymphocytes. Fe and Cu stimulated and Zn inhibited RR activity in both types of cells.

In both cases the inhibitory effects were reversed by Fe and Cu, but not Zn. These findings suggest that: 1) Fe, Cu and Zn may modulate RR activity in vitro and their action is related and interdependent. 2) DFX alone may inhibit RR activity. 3) DFX enhances HU effect on leukemic cells. 4) The effects of both inhibitors may be modified by trace metals.","['Oblender, M', 'Carpentieri, U']","['Oblender M', 'Carpentieri U']","['Pediatric Department, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Copper/*pharmacology', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Zinc/*pharmacology']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1990 Jan-Feb;10(1):123-7.,0250-7005 (Print) 0250-7005 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Concomitant laboratory investigations included the analysis of colony assays for normal granulopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM) and leukemic CFU-L with and without the addition of GM-CSF, as well as DNA measurements by flow cytometry (FCM) for the detection of DNA-aneuploidies. The present analysis is focused on one particular patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in whom the detection of a DNA aneuploidy provided the readily accessible means to monitor the response of leukemic blasts to induction chemotherapy and subsequent GM-CSF treatment in vivo complementing the colony assay analyses performed in vitro. Prior to therapy 60% of cells revealed a DNA aneuploidy with a DNA index of 1.26 and in-vitro exposure of leukemic bone marrow blasts to GM-CSF (100 U/ml) enhanced the growth of CFU-L and CFU-GM with a significantly higher stimulatory index for CFU-L (1:19 versus 1:5.5). Three days after the completion of two cycles of induction therapy with thioguanine, cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin (TAD 9) a morphologic bone marrow evaluation revealed aplasia without leukemic blasts. By FCM DNA analysis, however, 8% residual aneuploid cells were found. No growth of CFU-L was observed at this time point neither spontaneously nor after the addition of GM-CSF which induced the growth of CFU-GM, only. In-vivo application of GM-CSF (250 micrograms/mg2/day by continuous 24-h infusion) led to the recovery of normal granulopoiesis without evidence of a concomitant stimulation of aneuploid leukemic cells. These data indicate a change in the susceptibility of leukemic blasts to GM-CSF before and after chemotherapy. A reduction of the leukemic cell burden below a critical level or a selection of GM-CSF non-responsive early leukemic precursor cells may account for these observations.","['Hiddemann, W', 'Zuhlsdorf, M', 'Wormann, B', 'Koenigsmann, M', 'Buchner, T']","['Hiddemann W', 'Zuhlsdorf M', 'Wormann B', 'Koenigsmann M', 'Buchner T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Munster, F.R.G.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '0O54ZQ14I9 (Aminoglutethimide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'N29QWW3BUO (Danazol)', 'TAD protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aminoglutethimide/therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Danazol/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Tamoxifen/therapeutic use']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(4):347-52. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90162-3.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90162-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

2185339,NLM,MEDLINE,19900601,20170210,8,5,1990 May,Report of the National Cancer Institute-sponsored workshop on definitions of diagnosis and response in acute myeloid leukemia.,813-9,"The National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored a workshop to develop a set of standardized diagnostic and response criteria for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clinical trials. The French-American-British (FAB) classification was retained for diagnosing AML, with the addition of patients with bone marrow morphologic features of a myelodysplastic syndrome and less than 30% bone marrow blasts, but with greater than or equal to 30% blasts in the peripheral blood. In this report, there are four important subgroups of AML not defined in the FAB classification that are discussed: undifferentiated acute leukemia, MO (AML lacking definitive myeloid differentiation by morphology or conventional cytochemistry but with ultrastructural or immunophenotypic evidence for AML), mixed lineage leukemia, and hypocellular AML. Definitions of response for clinical trials are presented to facilitate comparisons among different studies. Complete remission is considered the only response worth reporting in phase III trials, since lesser responses do not improve survival.

The use of these probes in conjunction with morphology and immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry allows the pathologist to assign virtually all lymphoid neoplasms to the B or T cell lineage. The cloning of Ig and TCR genes also has led to the identification of new protooncogenes that reside at the breakpoints of chromosomal translocations frequently observed in lymphoid neoplasms. Molecular probes for these new genes involved in the pathogenesis of lymphoid neoplasms may be used as additional molecular markers for the determination of clonality, lineage, and even histologic subtype of lymphoid neoplasms. Finally, the development of new molecular technologies such as polymerase chain reaction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis has provided new tools for the highly sensitive detection of genetic rearrangements in human tumors and will greatly enhance the ability of the pathologist to monitor minimal residual disease and detect early relapse.","['Willman, C L', 'Griffith, B B', 'Whittaker, M']","['Willman CL', 'Griffith BB', 'Whittaker M']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Clin Lab Med,Clinics in laboratory medicine,8100174,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', '*Molecular Biology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell']",57,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Med. 1990 Mar;10(1):119-49.,0272-2712 (Print) 0272-2712 (Linking),,,"['CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 DK01284/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Ataxia-telangiectasia patients appear to have two separate clinical patterns of malignancy. One pattern involves solid tumors, which have not been stressed and which include malignancies in the oral cavity, breast, stomach, pancreas, ovary, and bladder. Detection of a solid tumor in an A-T patient should serve as a warning. It heralds a markedly elevated risk of another malignancy in that patient. The second pattern of neoplasia in A-T is well recognized and consists of lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These malignancies may relate to immunodeficiency in A-T and to chromosome breakage and rearrangement, which are a feature of A-T. These two patterns of malignancy may be truly separate and reflect different mechanisms of malignancy in A-T, or they may not really be separate but instead reflect a single mechanism of malignancy. The situation in A-T is reminiscent of that in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), in which Kaposi's sarcoma occurs with mild immunodeficiency and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia occurs with more profound immunodeficiency owing to the human immunodeficiency virus.

There were no significant differences between the GM-CSF-treated and the historical groups in the time required to reach neutrophil counts of 500 or 1,000/microL after administration of chemotherapy.

Growth of leukemia after GM-CSF administration was observed in only 1 of the 8 patients who survived long enough for response to induction therapy to be fully evaluated.

Large TFT resistant colonies are believed to be due to induction of small amounts of genetic damage (point mutations, small deletions) at the tk locus, whilst small colonies are thought to be a result of larger effects. The relative proportions of the two colony types were determined in some experiments. All three compounds induced dose-related increases in MF under all conditions.

The number of subjects in the separate plants varied from 98 to 604. By the closing date of the study (31 December 1982) 268 had died, 68 from malignant neoplasms. For 63 employees who had left the plant (2.4%) the vital status remained unknown. The standardised mortality ratio for all causes of death was 0.87 and for all malignancies 0.97 compared with national rates. When local state rates were used the SMRs were slightly lower. Two deaths from leukaemia were observed compared with 2.35 expected (SMR = 0.85). SMRs for carcinoma of the oesophagus (2.0) and carcinoma of the stomach (1.38) were raised but not significantly.

Supernatants from normal spleen cells treated in vitro either with the polysaccharide or the intact endotoxin showed immunoenhancing helper activity for both normal and FLV infected spleen cells and this enhancing activity was due to IL-1 induced by either bacterial product. Thus the immunoenhancing soluble mediator, i.e., IL-1, is induced equally by PS or LPS and has immunorestorative activity for FLV infected animals. The potential value of the nontoxic PS as an immunoadjuvant in retrovirus immunosuppressed lymphoid cells is evident.

Tests of these viral genomes for transmission of v-abl and neo markers showed more stable coexpression in a protein fusion construct. The neo fusion was subcloned from this v-abl construct into a promoterless c-abl fragment, and the resulting DNA was used to transform embryonic stem cells.

Two types of archival tissue samples served as a source of cells. Different passages of the KG-1 myeloid cell line which had been established from leukemic blasts of this patient were also analyzed. We found that native blast cells isolated at either of the two disease stages did not carry an N-ras mutation, and neither did early passage KG-1 cells.

Stripped adult bladder mucosa incubated with HaSV, in the presence or absence of helper virus, was transplanted beneath the renal capsule of syngeneic animals and maintained for periods up to three months. Control implants, exposed to helper virus alone, formed heterotopic bladders lined by urothelium displaying focal areas of full differentiation when associated with underlying submucosal elements. Exposure of urothelium to HaSV resulted in increased proliferative potential of mucosal and submucosal elements with the appearance of a normal differentiated heterotopic bladder 10 days post-implantation. Implants left for 28 days presented a range of hyperplastic lesions (mild-severe) characterized from histological evaluation and antibody markers recognizing basal (D66) and superficial cell populations (H10) in normal bladder mucosa. Staining of mild hyperplastic lesions revealed an increased basal cell compartment and a loss of fully differentiated cells lining the lumen of the implanted bladder. In severe hyperplasia no superficial cells were observed but mucosal elements stained throughout with antibody D66. This phenotype was accompanied by an irregular laminin staining pattern associated with a disorganized basement membrane and increased blood vasculature. Similar experiments conducted with HaSV and helper virus resulted in the generation of mesenchymal lesions at 28 days with little surviving urothelium. The H-ras oncogenic protein can induce hyperplastic lesions in normal urothelium which were characteristic of preneoplastic changes identified in bladder carcinogenesis.","['Wagner, H E', 'Joyce, A D', 'Beatrice, K', 'Summerhayes, I C']","['Wagner HE', 'Joyce AD', 'Beatrice K', 'Summerhayes IC']","['New England Deaconess Hospital, Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelial Cells', '*Genes, ras', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Subrenal Capsule Assay', 'Transplantation, Heterotopic', 'Urinary Bladder/*transplantation', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Apr;5(4):557-63.,0950-9232 (Print) 0950-9232 (Linking),,,"['CA42944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

We wished to determine whether a normal, diploid human epithelial cell in which activation of ras had occurred could be identified in culture and, furthermore, whether expression of a mutant p21ras in such an otherwise normal cell would result in abnormal histogenic behavior in vivo. Thus, we introduced the v-Ha-ras gene into an early passage culture of normal human epidermal keratinocytes via a defective retrovirus. We examined these genetically engineered cells for changes in growth and differentiation, both in culture and in the epithelium formed when cultures were grafted to the skin of nude mice. We have found that keratinocytes expressing p21v-ras are independent of epidermal growth factor (EGF)--a factor which is normally essential for progressive colony growth, but that they are otherwise indistinguishable in culture from normal cells. v-ras keratinocytes also secrete a factor possessing some specific biological activities of members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, but which is distinct from acidic and basic FGF. In short-term dermal grafts the v-ras cells form a non-invasive and normally differentiating epidermis. However, the cells express elevated levels of keratin 19, which is a characteristic of fetal epidermis and of premalignant lesions of some stratified squamous epithelia.","['Henrard, D R', 'Thornley, A T', 'Brown, M L', 'Rheinwald, J G']","['Henrard DR', 'Thornley AT', 'Brown ML', 'Rheinwald JG']","['Division of Cell Growth and Regulation, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Apr;5(4):475-81.,0950-9232 (Print) 0950-9232 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that the attenuated hemolytic and erythroleukemogenic abilities of an F-MuLV variant, clone B3, were due mostly to changes in the env gene and long terminal repeat, respectively. For the present study, we derived two constructs exchanging env fragments of F-MuLV 57 and M-MuLV and compared them with two constructs described by Chatis et al. (J. Virol. 52:248-254, 1984) exchanging the U3 region of the long terminal repeat of the same parental viruses. When comparing the hemolytic effect of these constructs with those of the parent, we found that the U5-gag-pol region of F-MuLV was required for development of severe early hemolytic anemia and that, unlike the env of F-MuLV B3, the env of M-MuLV was fully competent in inducing severe early hemolytic anemia when associated with the F-MuLV U5-gag-pol and U3 regions. As expected, induction of erythroleukemia depended on the presence of the F-MuLV U3 region; however, the presence of both the U3 and U5-gag-pol regions of F-MuLV appeared to be synergistic and was associated with a more rapid appearance of erythroleukemia.","['Sitbon, M', 'Ellerbrok, H', 'Pozo, F', 'Nishio, J', 'Hayes, S F', 'Evans, L H', 'Chesebro, B']","['Sitbon M', 'Ellerbrok H', 'Pozo F', 'Nishio J', 'Hayes SF', 'Evans LH', 'Chesebro B']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Oncologie des Maladies Retrovirales, Hopital Cochin, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U152, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genes, gag', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Plasmids', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 May;64(5):2135-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.5.2135-2140.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.5.2135-2140.1990 [doi]'],PMC249371,,,,,,,

We have reviewed the morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features of this disease in 23 patients treated at the National Cancer Institute in the 25-year period between 1963 and 1988. These tumors are uniformly of B-cell origin, but most of them express the T-cell antigen CD5; lambda light chain was expressed nearly twice as frequently as kappa. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years; all patients presented with stage III or IV disease, and the natural history of disease in these patients was heterogeneous. Median survival of patients was more than 5 years, but those with liver involvement documented by biopsy had a significantly shorter survival. No other prognostic factor or combination of prognostic factors significantly affected survival in this small series; however, patients with high expression of the proliferation-associated nuclear antigen Ki-67, absence of cell-surface antigens CD9 and CD10, and blastic morphology appeared to have poorer survival. Treatment was heterogeneous, but patients who achieved a complete response to combination chemotherapy survived longer than patients who failed to achieve a complete response. Only two patients had complete responses lasting longer than 2 years. Unlike patients with follicular lymphoma, those with relapsed IDL did not undergo histologic progression of the disease to an aggressive lymphoma. However, as with patients with follicular lymphoma, it was possible to observe patients with IDL without therapy for periods up to 5 years. Although a significant minority of patients may have very aggressive disease, it appears that, in most patients, IDL behaves similarly to other lymphomas with indolent histology, and thus, an optimal therapeutic approach has not yet been defined.","['Bookman, M A', 'Lardelli, P', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Duffey, P L', 'Longo, D L']","['Bookman MA', 'Lardelli P', 'Jaffe ES', 'Duffey PL', 'Longo DL']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research Facility, MD 21701.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COP protocol 2']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1990/05/02 00:00,1990/05/02 00:01,['1990/05/02 00:00'],"['1990/05/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/02 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 May 2;82(9):742-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/82.9.742.,0027-8874 (Print) 0027-8874 (Linking),['10.1093/jnci/82.9.742 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

A marked neutropenia and monocytopenia was observed within 5 min after an i.v. injection of GM-CSF. This persisted for 1-2 h and seemed related to activation of an adhesive glycoprotein (MO1) on the surface of these cells. With continued daily i.v. administration of GM-CSF, all patients with refractory malignancies developed a striking leukocytosis. Total leukocyte counts reached 75,000/microliters within 2 weeks of treatment. This was due to an increase in band and segmented neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes. Accelerated myelopoiesis required the continuous presence of GM-CSF; with pump failure for 24 h or discontinuation after 14 days, leukocyte counts returned to normal levels in 24-48 h. GM-CSF also increased myelopoiesis in the patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or following anti-leukemic treatment.

The treatment induced a rapid 3- to 5-fold increase in the number of circulating neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes. Lymphocytes, platelets and reticulocytes were unmodified during treatment. Activation of circulating neutrophils during GM-CSF treatment was demonstrated by a significant, increased release of neutrophil-derived platelet-activating factor after stimulation with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha or phagocytosis. The granulomonocytosis was dependent on increased bone marrow production of mature cells. Using the thymidine suicide technique, we observed that GM-CSF more than doubled the percentage of granulocyte-macrophage and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-gm and CFU-meg) and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-e) in the S phase of the cell cycle. However, at the level of morphologically recognizable cells with autoradiography, we observed that GM-CSF increased the labeling index of the granulo-monopoietic cells, whereas that of the erythroblasts was unchanged. These data suggest that in accordance with in vitro observations, GM-CSF exerts its activity through all granulo-monopoietic lineages, whereas other cytokines (erythropoietin, thrombopoiesis-stimulating factors) may be needed to fully exploit the proliferative stimulus of GM-CSF on BFU-e and CFU-meg. After treatment discontinuation, the proliferative activity drops to values lower than before treatment, suggesting a period of relative refractoriness of marrow progenitors to the cytocidal effect of cell cycle-specific antineoplastic agents. This hypothesis is under evaluation in a controlled clinical trial where GM-CSF is given prior to chemotherapy.","['Aglietta, M', 'Bussolino, F', 'Piacibello, W', 'Apra, F', 'Sanavio, F', 'Stacchini, A', 'Monzeglio, C', 'Carnino, F', 'Gavosto, F']","['Aglietta M', 'Bussolino F', 'Piacibello W', 'Apra F', 'Sanavio F', 'Stacchini A', 'Monzeglio C', 'Carnino F', 'Gavosto F']","['Clinica Medica A, Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neutrophils/drug effects']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1990 Jan;8 Suppl 1:283-90; discussion 290-2. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530080727.,0737-1454 (Print) 0737-1454 (Linking),['10.1002/stem.5530080727 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

2182603,NLM,MEDLINE,19900524,20151119,4,2,1990 Apr,T gamma lymphocytosis and T cell chronic leukemias.,473-87,"The T cell chronic leukemias encompass a broad spectrum of diseases involving mature post-thymic T cells. With the development of highly specific marker studies, clear patterns of immunophenotypic and functional characteristics of the involved cells have emerged. These studies, along with the development of molecular probes for the T cell receptor gene loci, have helped to elucidate the pathogenetic basis for the highly variable clinical course which has been described for patients with these disorders. The T gamma lymphocytosis syndrome has been identified as a benign chronic illness which is nevertheless usually a monoclonal neoplastic proliferation of large granular lymphocytes. These patients represent a distinct clinical entity characterized by splenomegaly, neutropenia, and peripheral blood lymphocytosis. The cells of TGLS are large granular lymphocytes and display many of the immunophenotypic and functional characteristics of NK and K cells. These cells have been implicated pathogenetically in the associated cytopenias seen in the illness, but a clear link has not been established. Although the lymphoproliferative manifestations of the disease are usually easily controlled with low-dose alkylating agents, therapy of the neutropenia has been relatively unsuccessful. Separating these patients from the rest of the spectrum of the T cell chronic leukemias has provided insight into the other disorders as well. It has established that T-CLL and T-PLL are, in fact, extremely rare. T-CLL is similar to its B cell counterpart, except that patients have a higher incidence of skin infiltration. Available data suggest that the prognosis in T-CLL is actually less variable, and somewhat worse, than generally believed when those patients were viewed in conjunction with the patients with the more benign TGLS. T-PLL is an extremely aggressive disease characterized by massive splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin infiltration. It is refractory to most forms of therapy. These illnesses are again phenotypically distinct from the retrovirus-associated ATLL. Most of the early cases of T-CLL reported from Japan were probably ATLL; this disease is characterized by pronounced splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin infiltration. It has an extremely aggressive natural history, and survival is usually less than 1 year from diagnosis. The rapid development of sophisticated immunologic and molecular techniques for analyzing T cell proliferations has allowed highly specific distinctions to be made among the cells of origin of the different T cell chronic leukemias.

The immunophenotype of PLL cells, characterized by heavy cell surface staining for IgM and/or IgD and loss of mouse red blood cell receptors, suggests derivation from a slightly more mature cell than the one that gives rise to typical CLL. In patients with PLL prolymphocytic invasion accounts for massive splenomegaly and white counts of well over 100,000 per mm3 with minimal lymphadenopathy. Prolymphocytes are large cells with relatively open chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Extra material on the long arm of chromosome 14 is the most common cytogenetic abnormality. The clinical course of patients with PLL is aggressive, with median survivals usually of all stages. Combination chemotherapy regimens typically reserved for those with an unfavorable prognosis for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas probably are more effective in the treatment of patients with PLL than are the less myelosuppressive oral regimens used in CLL.","['Stone, R M']",['Stone RM'],"['Department of Medicine, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', '*Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Spleen/radiation effects', 'Splenectomy']",92,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1990 Apr;4(2):457-71.,0889-8588 (Print) 0889-8588 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

A significant advance in the management of CLL has also been made. Now we know when to initiate therapy. We recommend that patients with stage 0 and patients with stages I and II associated with good prognostic features such as absence of disease-related symptoms, long lymphocyte doubling time, nondiffuse bone marrow infiltration, and low tumor load not be treated; they should be followed at 2- to 6-month intervals. We recommend initiation of therapy for patients with stages I and II, associated with poor prognostic features such as presence of disease-related symptoms, short lymphocyte doubling time, diffuse bone marrow infiltration, and high tumor load and for patients with stages III and IV. However, we still do not know what constitutes the optimal therapy for the disease. In one large randomized study, the response rate as well as survival superiority of CHOP (with low-dose Adriamycin) over COP in previously untreated patients with stage C disease was observed. In another large randomized study, only a response rate advantage of CHOP (with standard dose Adriamycin) over chlorambucil and prednisone (in previously untreated patients with stages B and C) was seen. No randomized studies have compared CHOP versus chlorambucil and prednisone in patients with stages III and IV or stage C. At present, our recommendation for the treatment of patients with advanced disease is chlorambucil and prednisone therapy. New drugs under clinical trials for CLL include (1) deoxycoformycin, (2) 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and (3) fludarabine monophosphate. Both deoxycoformycin and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine have been shown to have some activity in previously treated CLL patients with advanced disease. The effectiveness of these agents, however, has not been tested yet in untreated patients with advanced disease. Fludarabine monophosphate, on the other hand, has been shown to be very effective in both previously treated and untreated patients with advanced disease. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation recently has been found to be of benefit in some patients (37 to 46 years) in a preliminary study; this therapeutic procedure should be tested further in a larger population of younger patients (less than 50 years) with advanced CLL. New agents such as lymphokines (interferons and IL-2) and monoclonal antibodies have been investigated for their efficacy and found to be minimally effective in previously treated patients with advanced disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Han, T', 'Rai, K R']","['Han T', 'Rai KR']","['Hematologic Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Lymphokines/therapeutic use', 'Splenectomy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",79,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1990 Apr;4(2):431-45.,0889-8588 (Print) 0889-8588 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Although morphologically resembling the small peripheral blood B cell, by virtue of the expression of B cell restricted and associated cell surface antigens, B-CLLs are not the neoplastic counterparts of normal resting B cells. Similar to the peripheral blood B cell, B-CLLs express CD19, CD20, CD21, CD24, CD40, CD44, CD45R, and sIgM/D. However, unlike peripheral blood B cells, B-CLLs generally do not express C3b complement receptor, LFA-1, or CD22. In addition, B-CLLs express the T cell associated antigen CD5, and a number of antigens induced on normal B cells following in vitro activation (B5, Blast-1, CD23). These findings support the hypothesis that B-CLLs are the neoplastic counterparts of one or more unique subpopulations of normal B cells. Normal CD5+ B cells, which phenotypically resemble B-CLL, are present in fetal lymphoid tissues and in small numbers in adults. Moreover, normal CD5+ B cells are present in increased numbers in patients with autoimmune diseases and a subset of normal in vitro activated B cells phenotypically resemble B-CLL. Similar studies into the state of differentiation of T-CLL cells suggest that although most cases resemble normal activated T helper cells, a significant number are the neoplastic counterparts of natural killer cells. Recent studies have examined the function of B and T cells in B-CLL. Although controversial, these studies suggest that the in vitro response to mitogens and cytokines of B-CLL cells is abnormal. T cell proliferation in B-CLL is depressed due to an inability to produce sufficient T cell growth factor (IL-2) as well as a poor response to exogenous IL-2 possibly from ineffective IL-2 receptor expression. Purified populations of T helper and T suppressor cells demonstrate insufficient support of Ig production by normal B cells as well as excess suppression, respectively. These studies have further supported the previous hypothesis that the depressed cellular and humoral immunity in CLL is multifactorial with both abnormal B and T cell function.","['Freedman, A S']",['Freedman AS'],"['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype']",203,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1990 Apr;4(2):405-29.,0889-8588 (Print) 0889-8588 (Linking),,,['5K08 CA01105-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Several prognostic features influence relapse and survival following allogeneic BMT for CML. The most important factor is treatment of patients during chronic phase. The timing of BMT in chronic phase CML remains controversial, because the Seattle findings that BMT done within a shorter interval from diagnosis to transplant was associated with improved survival has not been confirmed by the IBMTR. No factor can predict in the individual patient the timing of transformation, even in patients with low-risk chronic phase CML, but we believe that allogeneic BMT should be offered as soon as possible for newly diagnosed patients who have histocompatible siblings. More widespread application of BMT in CML is possible because of effective methods for preventing GVHD, the major cause of morbidity after allogeneic BMT. However, in vitro techniques for the depletion of donor marrow T cells have resulted in higher graft failure and relapse rates. More precise understanding of the immune mechanisms involved may permit more selective depletion techniques which not only abrogate GVHD but also permit sustained engraftment and preserve GVL effect. This may extend application of BMT for patients with mismatched related or histocompatible unrelated donors. It is of interest that cytogenetic relapse after BMT is not invariably followed by hematologic relapse. It is likely that the use of polymerase chain reaction techniques which detect the bcr-abl rearrangement at a very low level will identify the persistence of the malignant clone after allogeneic BMT in even more patients. At present, the significance of such findings is unclear, but further study of the kinetics of disappearance of the CML clone post-BMT may increase our understanding of the immune mechanisms involved in suppression of the malignant clone and determine whether in fact CML can be cured using BMT approaches.","['Delage, R', 'Ritz, J', 'Anderson, K C']","['Delage R', 'Ritz J', 'Anderson KC']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/pathology/*surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Oncogenes', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",96,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1990 Apr;4(2):369-88.,0889-8588 (Print) 0889-8588 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

These studies evaluated the use of either 41.8 degrees C whole body hyperthermia (WBH), or the nonmyelosuppressive chemotherapeutic drug, lonidamine (LON), as an adjunct to total body irradiation (TBI) (12.5 cGy twice a week, every other week for a planned total dose of 150 cGy). Whole body hyperthermia was initiated approximately 10 min after total body irradiation; lonidamine was administered orally (420 mg/m2) on a daily basis. Although entry to the studies was nonrandomized, the two patient populations were accrued during the same time frame and were comparable in terms of histology, stage of disease, performance status, and prior therapy. Of 8 patients entered on the TBI/WBH study, we observed 3 complete responses (CR), 4 partial responses (PR), and 1 improvement (i.e., a 48% decrease in tumor burden). Of 10 patients entered in the TBI/LON study, there was 1 CR and 4 PR. For the TBI/WBH study, myelosuppression was not treatment-limiting; there were no instances of infection or bleeding and platelet support was never required.

The median time to treatment failure (MTTF) is 9.4 months (90% confidence interval = 7-15.4 months). In the TBI/LON study, 50% of patients receiving TBI required treatment modification due to platelet-count depression during therapy, but there were no instances of infection or bleeding. Frequently observed LON-related toxicities included myalgias, testicular pain, photophobia and ototoxicity. For the TBI/LON study, median survival is 7.6 months; MTTF was 2.4 months.

This is especially true in patients at high risk of early death due to high intensity chemotherapy for relapse or to higher age. In an attempt to reduce the phase of risk we administered human recombinant GM-CSF to 23 patients at a median age of 65 (range 17-84) years including 8 acute myelogenous (AML) and 5 lymphoblastic (ALL) leukemias after early or second relapses and 10 patients of 65 years and older in primary induction treatment for AML. 3 patients with AML had prior bone marrow transplantation. 4 AML's were secondary to tumor chemotherapy (2) or myelodysplastic syndrome (2). The study was part of chemotherapeutic phase II and III studies using TAD9 for primary induction chemotherapy and S-HAM for relapses. Starting on day 4 after the end of intensive CT GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2/day was given by continuous i.v. infusion and after recovery of neutrophils was deescalated in two 4 day steps and discontinued. 12/23 patients achieved a complete remission (CR) and median age of responders is 61 (range 17-84) years. In the group of the non-transplanted patients the median recovery time of neutrophils is reduced by one week when compared to controls receiving the same chemotherapy (p = 0.002).

In view of its favourable efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profile it was considered appropriate to evaluate its use prophylactically in patients undergoing a period of neutropenia. Two hundred and forty-eight patients receiving chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of acute leukaemia, lymphoma or aplastic anaemia, and expected to be rendered temporarily neutropenic, have been entered into an ongoing multicentre comparative clinical study to compare the prophylactic efficacy of 50 mg daily oral fluconazole with that of widely used regimens of oral polyenes. The incidence of suspected fungal infection was less in the fluconazole group (27%) than in the polyene group (45%), the difference being statistically significant (P less than 0.05). Only one of the suspected infections in the fluconazole group was confirmed mycologically compared with 17 in the polyene group. Fluconazole prophylaxis was well tolerated and it therefore offers a promising new approach to the management of fungal infection in the neutropenic patient.

In the three ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) trials 70, 76, and 79, employing radiotherapy (8.5 Gy craniospinal, 18 or 24 Gy cranial irradiation) in all arms, the incidence of CNS relapses (isolated and combined) in standard-risk patients (SR, 60% of all children) was consistently less than 6%. A risk factor (RF) calculated from absolute blast number, liver, and spleen size at diagnosis was used to stratify patients in the subsequent trials ALL-BFM 81 and 83. In ALL-BFM 81, SR patients (RF less than 1.2) were randomized to receive 18 Gy cranial irradiation or intermediate-dose i.v. methotrexate (ID-MTX) (4 x 0.5 g/m2). In ALL-BFM 83, the SR group was further subdivided into group SR low (SR-L, RF less than 0.8) and group SR high (SR-H, RF 0.8 - less than 1.2). SR-L patients received no irradiation, and were tested by randomization for the effectiveness of an intensive reinduction regimen (protocol III). SR-H patients were randomized for 12 or 18 Gy. The results were as follows: In patients of both trials with RF less than 0.8, radiotherapy could be replaced by ID-MTX plus protocol III.

The L10 and L10M protocols had the highest percentage of long-term (greater than 5 years) remissions (52% and 40% respectively) compared with the L2 and more recent protocols (24%-32%); this is partly attributable to a greater prevalence of adverse risk factors among the latter protocols. The overall long-term survival of the first 199 patients with minimum 3 years follow-up is now 31%, with 35% of the 163 patients achieving complete remission (CR) remaining free of relapse for greater than 5 years. The disease-free survival of the 163 patients reaches a plateau of 33% after 6 years. The percentages of patients subsequently relapsing after remaining in continuous CR for 1.5, 3, and 5 years are 42%, 28%, and 6%, respectively; no relapses have yet occurred after 6 years in this series. Postrelapse survival improved progressively with longer duration of first remission. The results of treatment in second or later remission with either chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were unsatisfactory and there were only a few long-term survivors. Recently we have attempted to select patients at highest risk of early relapse for BMT in first remission, but the number of eligible patients actually having BMTs has been low for a variety of reasons, including early death, failure to reach CR, early relapse, patient refusal, or medical contraindications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Clarkson, B', 'Gaynor, J', 'Little, C', 'Berman, E', 'Kempin, S', 'Andreeff, M', 'Gulati, S', 'Cunningham, I', 'Gee, T']","['Clarkson B', 'Gaynor J', 'Little C', 'Berman E', 'Kempin S', 'Andreeff M', 'Gulati S', 'Cunningham I', 'Gee T']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']",Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Evaluation/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",20,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1990;33:397-408. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-74643-7_75.,0171-7111 (Print) 0171-7111 (Linking),['10.1007/978-3-642-74643-7_75 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess whether the addition of cytosine arabinoside increased the response rate at a tolerable toxicity. The regimen consisted of mitoxantrone (M) 10 mg/m2 i.v. days 4-8, cytosine arabinoside (A) 100 mg/m2 continuous infusion days 1-8, and etoposide (VP-16) (V) 100-120 mg/m2 i.v. days 4-8 (MAV protocol) for relapsed and refractory AML. Thirty-six patients were treated, with a median age of 51 (20-73) years. For induction therapy one to two MAV cycles and for consolidation therapy two courses were scheduled. Twenty-one (58.3%) patients attained a complete remission (CR), with a median duration of 4.5 (1-12+) months. The median survival of all patients was 5.5 (0.5-15.5+) months. Four patients died in CR from chronic infections or after consolidation therapy with MAV. In evaluable patients, times to greater than 500 granulocytes/microliters and greater than 25,000 platelets/microliters were 23 (7-46) and 23 (6-44) days, respectively. In 54 evaluable MAV courses the following toxicity was observed (WHO grades 3/4): 26%, nausea and vomiting: 9%, hemorrhage; 6%, bilirubinemia; 11%, diarrhea; 22%, mucositis; 6%, local infection; 20%, septicemia; 13%, fever of unknown origin; 2%, cardiac arrhythmia; 7%, congestive heart failure.

Systematic collection and conservation of acute leukemic cells, cytogenetically and immunologically characterized, would greatly facilitate and accelerate these fundamental studies.","['Hagemeijer, A', 'van der Plas, D C']","['Hagemeijer A', 'van der Plas DC']","['Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",38,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1990;33:23-30. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-74643-7_4.,0171-7111 (Print) 0171-7111 (Linking),['10.1007/978-3-642-74643-7_4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Here we present a new multicellular functional unit, the Hematon, isolated from the light-density floating fraction of normal human bone marrow (BM) aspirates. The Hematon is organized in a compact, three-dimensional spheroid complex from central adipocytes, fibroblastoid cells, and resident macrophages that compartmentalize myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocyte progenitor cells and their progenies. The Hematon fraction is more than twofold more abundant in progenitor cells when compared to the mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction as gauged by cytological techniques and by analysis of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) populations. Individual Hematons may produce, within 2-3 weeks, up to 50,000 hemopoietic cells of different cell lineages in organotypic microcultures. Recombinant human hematopoietic growth factors interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) significantly stimulated the endogenous cell production of some but not all of the individually treated Hematons, indicating the heterogeneity of factor-responsive cells within the Hematon population. Comparative observations of 184 BM aspirates support the hypothesis that the presence of Hematons in a BM aspirate correlates positively with homeostatic blood cell production, because the Hematon was present in normal BM (31/40) and it was rare among patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (15/53), acute myeloblastic leukemia (7/39), and chronic myelocytic leukemia (5/52). We suggest that the Hematon represents a unifying model around which the variability of fundamental BM functions and dysfunctions can be explored.","['Blazsek, I', 'Misset, J L', 'Benavides, M', 'Comisso, M', 'Ribaud, P', 'Mathe, G']","['Blazsek I', 'Misset JL', 'Benavides M', 'Comisso M', 'Ribaud P', 'Mathe G']","[""Institut du Cancer et d'Immunogenetique, Universite Paris-Sud, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytological Techniques', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 May;18(4):259-65.,0301-472X (Print) 0301-472X (Linking),,,,,,,,,

The search for less toxic chemotherapy in terms of decreased sterility and myelodysplasia-acute non-lymphocytic leukemia prompted the design of ABVD. Recent data from different countries indicate that adriamycin-based combinations as ABVD or MOPP alternating with ABVD appear very useful to improve treatment outcome compared to MOPP alone. The combination of chemotherapy and radiation has been utilized by many institutions in practically all stages of Hodgkin's disease. The intent is to optimize the cure rate and with the theory that less intensive therapy of both modalities may carry a lower risk of iatrogenic complications without compromising treatment outcome. In patients relapsing from curative radiotherapy, combination chemotherapy such as ABVD or MOPP/ABVD is recommended as the most effective salvage regimen, associated to further irradiation if technically feasible. In patients relapsing from primary chemotherapy, clinicians have first to take into consideration whether the duration of first complete remission is longer than 12 months. In this case, retreatment with the same drug regimen remains the treatment of choice. In patients with progressive lymphoma while on primary chemotherapy or showing remission duration lesser than 12 months, non-cross resistant chemotherapy or high dose therapy plus autologous bone marrow transplantation are indicated.","['Bonadonna, G', 'Santoro, A']","['Bonadonna G', 'Santoro A']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Radioisotope Teletherapy/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",23,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1990 Mar;4(1):69-73. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(90)90017-m.,0268-960X (Print) 0268-960X (Linking),"['0268-960X(90)90017-M [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(90)90017-m [doi]']",,,,,,,,

HTLV-I is also associated with a benign disease, HTLV-I associated myelopathy. Main routes of the infection is through breast milk feeding from carrier mother to her baby, from carrier husband to wife, and by blood transfusion of carrier blood to recipient patients. The presence of anti-HTLV-I antibody is a definite sign of the carrier of HTLV-I, then screening of the antibody has been introduced with success to prevent the HTLV-I infection. Mechanism of leukemogenesis by the virus is not known. It is important to note that age-dependent occurrence of HTLV-I associated ATL can be simply described by a Weibull model. This suggests that ATL leukemogenesis might be the result of accumulation of numerous critical events, most likely somatic mutations, which are estimated to be five from the analysis. Although HTLV-I infection plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of ATL as an initiator, it may be only a prerequisite for accumulation of later events. The presence of HTLV-I negative ATL suggests that factor(s) other than HTLV-I infection may be involved in the leukemogenic process of ATL.","['Shimoyama, M']",['Shimoyama M'],"['Hematology-Oncology and Medical-Oncology division, National Cancer Center Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

We isolated ret proto-oncogene cDNA clones from a cDNA library of a human neuroblastoma line, Nagai, which over-expressed these mRNAs. Four cDNA clones differing from each other in their 3' portions were analysed. The sequence of the region common to the cDNA clones is essentially identical to a reported cDNA sequence derived from THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells, that encodes a protein with characteristic features of receptor-type tyrosine kinase. From the 3' heterogeneity, two isoforms of the ret proto-oncogene product of 1072 and 1114 residues that differed from each other in their 9 and 51 C-terminal amino acids are predicted. Comparison of the structures of cDNA clones with that of the genomic clone showed that the 3' heterogeneity is produced by alternative polyadenylation and splicing of mRNA. Northern blot analysis using various fragments of cDNA indicated that the 4.5 kb, 3.9 kb and possibly 7.0 kb transcripts may encode a protein of 1072 residues, while the 6.0 kb transcript and a (minor) 4.6 kb transcript may encode a protein of 1114 residues.","['Tahira, T', 'Ishizaka, Y', 'Itoh, F', 'Sugimura, T', 'Nagao, M']","['Tahira T', 'Ishizaka Y', 'Itoh F', 'Sugimura T', 'Nagao M']","['Carcinogenesis Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/analysis', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', '*Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Jan;5(1):97-102.,0950-9232 (Print) 0950-9232 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

We isolated a molecular clone of WM-E (15-1) which was weakly neurovirulent (incidence, 8%) but was highly leukemogenic (incidence, 45%). Both lymphoid and granulocytic leukemias were observed, and these leukemias were often neuroinvasive. A chimeric virus was constructed containing the env and 3' pol sequences of 15-1 and long terminal repeat (LTR), gag, and 5' pol sequences from a clone of Friend murine leukemia virus (FB29). FB29 has been shown previously to replicate to high levels in the central nervous system (CNS) but is not itself neurovirulent. This finding was confirmed at the DNA level in the current study. Surprisingly, intraperitoneal inoculation of neonatal IRW mice with the chimeric virus (FrCasE) caused an accelerated neurodegenerative disease with an incubation period of only 16 days and was uniformly fatal by 23 days postinoculation. Introduction of the LTR of 15-1 into the FrCasE genome yielded a virus (FrCasEL) with a degree of neurovirulence intermediate between those of 15-1 and FrCasE. No differences were found in the levels of viremia or the relative levels of viral DNA in the spleens of mice inoculated with 15-1, FrCasE, or FrCasEL. However, the levels of viral DNA in the CNS correlated with the relative degrees of neurovirulence of the respective viruses (FrCasE greater than FrCasEL greater than 15-1). Thus, the env and 3' pol sequences of WM-E (15-1) were required for neurovirulence, but elements within the LTR and gag-pol regions of FB29 had a profound influence on the level of CNS infection and the rate of development of neurodegeneration.","['Portis, J L', 'Czub, S', 'Garon, C F', 'McAtee, F J']","['Portis JL', 'Czub S', 'Garon CF', 'McAtee FJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*microbiology', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA, Viral', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', '*Genes, gag', '*Genes, pol', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Virulence/genetics']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Apr;64(4):1648-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.4.1648-1656.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.4.1648-1656.1990 [doi]'],PMC249301,,,,,,,

Previously, oncogene transformation of CEF has been conducted almost exclusively with replicating viruses, because of perceived difficulties with direct DNA transfection. Here, we show that CEF can be efficiently and stably transfected by selection for the neomycin resistance gene (neo). Cotransfection of neo with various oncogenes resulted in CEF transformation in vitro and, in several instances, sarcoma formation in vivo. Transfection of src, myc, erbB, and ras, either singly or in combination, resulted in soft-agar colonies with unique morphologies. Transfection of a family of v-src, c-src, and v/c-src chimeric constructs demonstrated the ability of the assay to discriminate between transforming and nontransforming genes. Transfection of a number of erbB variants showed that internal mutations, primarily in the kinase domain, contribute significantly to the ability to transform fibroblasts. The tumorigenic potential detected by transfection of oncogenes faithfully reproduced those previously reported by using viral infections. Our studies establish the utility of CEF transformation by direct DNA transfection. This method should prove useful in analyzing oncogenes, (e.g., myc) that do not readily transform rodent cell lines and in studying host-range mutants of oncogenes, such as those recently identified for src and erbB.","['Antczak, M', 'Kung, H J']","['Antczak M', 'Kung HJ']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Chimera', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/microbiology', 'Genes, ras', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Oncogenes', 'Plasmids', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Species Specificity', '*Transfection']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Apr;64(4):1451-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.4.1451-1458.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.4.1451-1458.1990 [doi]'],PMC249278,"['CA 39207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 46613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

We investigated the nature and diversity of the structures involved in the recognition phenomenon by evaluating the effects of treating effector and target cells with trypsin and chymotrypsin, enzymes that disrupt surface protein molecules. Chymotrypsin and trypsin treatment of B16 target cells, a murine melanoma cell line, significantly abolished killing by LAK cells. Alternatively, neither of these treatments in P815 cells, a murine mastocytoma cell line, affected killing by LAK cells. Moreover, we found a differential effect of both these enzymes on YAC-1 cells, a murine leukemia cell line, with trypsin having a less inhibitory effect on cytolysis than chymotrypsin. The nature of the LAK cell receptor that presumably plays a role in binding target antigen was also investigated. Treatment of LAK cells with chymotrypsin significantly reduced lysis of the B16 and YAC-1 target cell types. However, trypsin treatment of the effectors only inhibited killing of the B16 tumor cell line. Cytotoxicity exerted against YAC-1 remained unaltered upon trypsinization of LAK cells. These cumulative results indicate heterogeneity of both the receptors on the LAK cells and the surface antigen molecules recognized on these targets. The use of YAC-1 as a target provided us with a tool to compare the LAK with the natural killer (NK) systems. The overall effect of proteolytic enzyme treatment in reducing cell lysis was more pronounced in the NK than in the LAK system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bean, P', 'Agah, R', 'Mazumder, A']","['Bean P', 'Agah R', 'Mazumder A']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1990 Feb;9(1):92-7.,0732-6580 (Print) 0732-6580 (Linking),,,"['CA01222/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The cells were stimulated to proliferate employing mitogenic factors as follows. 1) Transferrin or insulin: HL-60 cells were adjusted for growth in serum-free medium, and 24 h prior to the experiment, the cells were deprived of transferrin or insulin. The re-addition of either one of them stimulated cell proliferation as was evident by increased [3H]-tymidine incorporation activity. Cell proliferation was associated with an enhanced Ca2+ influx rate, measured by 45Ca2+ uptake activity. 2) Granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF): addition of GM-CSF to proliferating or quiescent HL-60 cells resulted in increased cell proliferation, which was also accompanied by increased rate of Ca2+ influx. 3) Serum: HL-60 and U-937 were grown for 24 h in serum-depleted medium. Re-addition of serum to the cells was not associated with immediate or delayed change in calcium influx rate but rather with an immediate increase in the cytosolic free calcium concentration, measured employing the fluorescent probe, fura-2AM. This increase was independent of extracellular calcium, unaffected by verapamil, diltiazem, and lanthanum, and associated with enhanced 45Ca2+ efflux. Thus, in all three cases evoked cell proliferation was accompanied by quantitative changes in Ca2+ metabolism.

This peptide was then used to elicit rabbit antibodies for study of the translation and post-translational modification of this gene product in hematopoietic cells. When HL-60 cells were radiolabeled for 2 min with [35S]methionine, a protein that migrated in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel with a Mr of 20,000 was immunoprecipitated with the IgG fraction of the anti-peptide serum. Kinetic experiments revealed that within 10 min this radiolabeled precursor protein was converted in HL-60 cells into an Mr approximately 150,000 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan intermediate. After a 20-min to 1-h chase, this [35S]methionine- or [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycan intermediate lost its antigenicity, presumably due to proteolysis of its N terminus. A human genomic library was probed under conditions of high stringency with cDNA-H4 to isolate genomic clones that contain the gene that encodes this proteoglycan peptide core. This gene spans approximately 15 kilobases and consists of three exons. The first exon encodes the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA transcript, as well as the entire 27-amino acid signal peptide of the translated molecule. The second exon encodes a 49-amino acid region of the peptide core, predicted to be the N terminus of the molecule after its proteolytic processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. The third exon encodes the remainder of the molecule, including its glycosaminoglycan attachment, serine-glycine repeat region. As assessed by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis, the transcription-initiation site in HL-60 cells for this gene resides 53 base pairs upstream from the translation-initiation site.","['Nicodemus, C F', 'Avraham, S', 'Austen, K F', 'Purdy, S', 'Jablonski, J', 'Stevens, R L']","['Nicodemus CF', 'Avraham S', 'Austen KF', 'Purdy S', 'Jablonski J', 'Stevens RL']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0 (secretory granule proteoglycan)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteoglycans/*genetics/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/04/05 00:00,1990/04/05 00:01,['1990/04/05 00:00'],"['1990/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Apr 5;265(10):5889-96.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)39446-3 [pii]'],,"['AI-07306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-22531/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-23401/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,"['GENBANK/J05284', 'GENBANK/M33649', 'GENBANK/M33650', 'GENBANK/M33651']",

While the nature of these stimuli is largely unknown, the development of haemopoietic cells in association with stromal cells requires intimate cell contact. Molecules of the extracellular matrix, such as heparan sulphate, are able to bind growth factors and in this way the stromal cells may form microenvironmental niches which preferentially promote development of multipotent and committed cells along discrete lineages. Cells from some patients with acute and chronic myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias are defective in their ability to interact with stromal cells and consequently cannot survive in stromal cell-mediated long-term marrow cultures. We have exploited this phenomenon to obtain normal haemopoietic cells from patients with leukaemia, and to use these cells for successful autografting in patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukaemias.","['Dexter, T M', 'Coutinho, L H', 'Spooncer, E', 'Heyworth, C M', 'Daniel, C P', 'Schiro, R', 'Chang, J', 'Allen, T D']","['Dexter TM', 'Coutinho LH', 'Spooncer E', 'Heyworth CM', 'Daniel CP', 'Schiro R', 'Chang J', 'Allen TD']","['Department of Experimental Haematology, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Withington, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans']",34,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1990;148:76-86; discussion 86-95. doi: 10.1002/9780470513880.ch6.,0300-5208 (Print) 0300-5208 (Linking),['10.1002/9780470513880.ch6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Gene cloning has shown that there is a family of different genes for these proteins. Normal protein regulators of haemopoiesis can control the abnormal growth of certain types of leukaemic cells and suppress malignancy by inducing differentiation to mature, non-dividing cells. Genetic abnormalities that give rise to malignancy in these leukaemic cells can be bypassed and their effects nullified by inducing differentiation, which stops cells from multiplying. These haemopoietic regulatory proteins are active in culture and in vivo and have been used clinically to correct defects in blood cell development.

Cell lines established on the basis of an ability to proliferate in the absence of exogenous colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) fall into two classes; those that are maximally stimulated and show no evidence of production of CSFs and others that grow in a density-dependent manner and express granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). That the growth of this latter class can be suppressed by the inclusion of antisense GM-CSF oligonucleotides in the growth medium indicates that the basis for their in vitro proliferation, and probably their ability to initiate the formation of transplantable leukaemias, is autocrine stimulation by GM-CSF. The ability of low levels of CSF to sustain autocrine stimulation, as we have shown, raises the possibility of an autocrine basis for the proliferation of certain human leukaemic cells. The ability to detect low concentrations of CSFs and develop in vitro assays that closely mimic the conditions that exist in vivo will be important aids in the classification of human leukaemias.","['Dunn, A R', 'Wilks, A F']","['Dunn AR', 'Wilks AF']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Melbourne Tumor Biology Branch, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Mutagens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/metabolism']",20,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1990;148:145-55; discussion 155-7. doi: 10.1002/9780470513880.ch10.,0300-5208 (Print) 0300-5208 (Linking),['10.1002/9780470513880.ch10 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Analysis of three distinct colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-CSF and granulocyte macrophage-CSF, and the lymphocytotropic growth factor IL-2 revealed remarkably similar distal subcellular biochemical signals, although the mode of initial membrane signal transduction may differ significantly. Both early progenitor cell growth factors, such as IL-3, and late-acting factors, such as CSF-1, stimulate tyrosine and serine/threonine substrate phosphorylations. One substrate (p68) is phosphorylated in response to many CSFs and to IL-2, suggesting that it plays a highly conserved role in the signal transduction processes of many different receptor(s). The proliferative CSFs and IL-2 also stimulate the expression of many of the same genes, including protooncogenes, the ornithine decarboxylase gene, and members of the phylogenetically ancient family of stress response genes. Thus although initial membrane events may differ among the proliferative stimulants, the biochemical and molecular convergence of signalling pathways on highly conserved cellular substrates and on the programme of gene expression is seen.","['Farrar, W L', 'Ferris, D K', 'Linnekin, D']","['Farrar WL', 'Ferris DK', 'Linnekin D']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/physiology', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/genetics', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics']",21,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1990;148:127-37; discussion 137-44. doi: 10.1002/9780470513880.ch9.,0300-5208 (Print) 0300-5208 (Linking),['10.1002/9780470513880.ch9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

2180517,NLM,MEDLINE,19900509,20081121,5 Suppl 1,,1990 Jan,Transplants of blood-derived hematopoietic cells.,2-4,"Increasing numbers of transplants, particularly autotransplants, are performed using blood-derived cells. Most subjects have leukemia but others have solid tumors or even genetic disorders. Despite this expanding data base, several important issues are unresolved. Can blood-derived cells reconstitute short-term hematopoiesis? Here, the answer is likely yes, although this is not yet proven. Studies using genetically marked cells should resolve this issue. Next, can blood-derived cells reconstitute long-term hematopoiesis? Here, the answer is unknown, but it would not be surprising were this not so. However, since most (if not all) high-dose chemotherapy and radiation treatments do not completely eradicate endogenous hematopoietic stem cells, reconstitution of long-term hematopoiesis from the graft may not be necessary for blood-derived grafts to be useful clinically. Another unresolved area is whether blood-derived grafts have a lower likelihood of tumor recurrence because of a lower probability of tumor contamination (qualitative or quantitative) or because of a different cellular composition of the graft. This issue is only answerable in controlled trials. Most data suggest that recurrence rate would not be higher than bone marrow-derived grafts. Whether it is lower is unknown. Analysis of this point is confounded by the fact that most (perhaps all) relapses that occur post-transplant using current conditioning schedules are explicable by residual leukemia in the recipient. Thus, tumor contamination of the graft is not presently an operationally important issue. There are some recent developments in this area. One is the use of umbilical cord blood cells to reconstitute hematopoiesis in a child with Fanconi anemia.

Anatomopathologic diagnosis of 14 cases].,123-36,"Fourteen primary non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma (ML) of the breast observed between 1985 and 1989 were reviewed. Using the Ann Arbor staging system, 5 of these ML were at clinical stage IE, 2 at stage IIE, and only one was at clinical stage IVE (the ML involved both breasts of a young woman after her third post-partum and she died quickly), staging was not available in 6 cases. At the time of physical examination, the diagnosis of ML was not suspected. When possible, it was done or-suspected before surgery, studying fine needle aspiration cytology (4 cases) or drill biopsy (2 cases). Cytological examination was also useful to make the difference between primary large cells T ML and granulocytic sarcomas which sometimes occur before the acute myeloid leukemia and/or the blast crisis of a myeloproliferative disorder. According to the Kiel histopathological classification (updated in 1988), 78.5% of these ML were of great malignancy, more than half of them being polymorphous centroblastic B ML. Only one of them was an angiocentric pleomorphic T lymphoma of great malignancy. None of the ML of low malignancy, all of the follicular type, was a MALT (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue) ML, as described by Isaacson. Intra-epithelial lymphocytes were observed in 6 of the ML of great malignancy; but in 2 cases, they were T lymphocytes and these lympho-epithelial lesions could not be interpreted as an argument for the MALT nature of these ML. None of our cases were associated with a ML from another MALT site.","['Prevot, S', 'Hugol, D', 'Le Tourneau, A', 'Audouin, J', 'Diebold, J']","['Prevot S', 'Hugol D', 'Le Tourneau A', 'Audouin J', 'Diebold J']","[""Laboratoire J Delarue, Service central d'anatomie et de cytologie pathologiques, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Time Factors']",45,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1990;77(2):123-36.,0007-4551 (Print) 0007-4551 (Linking),,,,,,Lymphomes malins non hodgkiniens primitifs mammaires.

Analysis of bone marrow cultures in leukemia, myelodysplasia and aplastic anemia.",192-7,"The influence of GM-CSF on bone marrow cultures from 13 patients with aplastic anemia, MDS and acute leukemia was studied in a short-term suspension culture system. In each case combined cytogenetic and proliferation analyses were performed with respect to the question, whether chromosome aberrations play a role in the in vitro response to GM-CSF and in order to search for stimulating effects on malignant cells. The responsiveness was compared of aplastic and myelodysplastic cultures on the one hand and of leukemic cells on the other. Our results show that myelodysplastic and aplastic cells display a tendency for reduced susceptibility to GM-CSF as compared to healthy controls, while in leukemic bone marrow the response to the growth factor was significantly enhanced, indicating a leukemia-specific response pattern. In the majority of leukemias analyzed, the presence of cytogenetically abnormal cells in cultures with excessive response to GM-CSF can be taken as a proof for stimulation of malignant cells. The significance of these findings for pathogenesis and prognosis in aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia and leukemia is discussed.","['Haase, D', 'Fonatsch, C']","['Haase D', 'Fonatsch C']","['Institut fur Humangenetik, Medizinische Universitat zu Lubeck, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neural Tube Defects/genetics/*pathology']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1990 Mar;60(3):192-7. doi: 10.1007/BF01720275.,0006-5242 (Print) 0006-5242 (Linking),['10.1007/BF01720275 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

In the 3H-thymidine incorporation assay, purified B-CLL cells from four out of sixteen cases, in which the percentage of Tac antigen (Tac Ag) positive cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes ranged from 0 to 48.8%, responded to IL-2 (100 U/ml) after both 3- and 6-day incubation. No relationship was found between the responsiveness to IL-2 and the percentage of Tac Ag positive cells. In the radiolabeled IL-2 binding assay, however, B-CLL cells from all seven cases examined, including three cases with mitogenic response to IL-2 and four cases without mitogenic response, were shown to have both high- and low-affinity receptors. The number of high- and low-affinity receptors per cell ranged from 29-186 and from 420 to 1,800, respectively. Furthermore, with the affinity cross-linking method p55 (Tac Ag) and p70/75 were found even in cases without mitogenic response in their B-CLL cells. In conclusion, the B-CLL cells so far examined possessed high-affinity IL-2 receptors consisting of p55 and p70/75; nevertheless, this was not sufficient to respond to the mitogenic signal of IL-2.","['Yagura, H', 'Tamaki, T', 'Furitsu, T', 'Tomiyama, Y', 'Nishiura, T', 'Tominaga, N', 'Katagiri, S', 'Yonezawa, T', 'Tarui, S']","['Yagura H', 'Tamaki T', 'Furitsu T', 'Tomiyama Y', 'Nishiura T', 'Tominaga N', 'Katagiri S', 'Yonezawa T', 'Tarui S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1990 Mar;60(3):181-6. doi: 10.1007/BF01720273.,0006-5242 (Print) 0006-5242 (Linking),['10.1007/BF01720273 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Second line treatment.,163-71,"The strategy for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia must primarily be based on the patient's age and clinical condition as well as on the stage of the disease. Accordingly, the general decision between an intensive approach including high-dose chemotherapy or possibly immediate allogeneic bone marrow transplantation versus less-aggressive palliative treatment will precede the selection of the most appropriate salvage regimen. In patients qualifying for intensive second-line chemotherapy the duration of the first remission and the number of relapses provide the means to discriminate between refractoriness or maintained responsiveness to conventional protocols. More than 50% of patients with first relapses after 6-12 months remission duration will respond to standard therapy again and should therefore not be entered on investigational agents with unproven antileukemic activity. The latter seems deeply warranted, on the other hand, for early relapses, second recurrences and resistant first relapses with a remission rate of less than 30% after conventional regimens. These guidelines not only provide an objective rationale for selecting the most appropriate strategy at relapse in individual patients.

A new treatment for this T-lymphocyte-mediated condition uses an immunotoxin, H65-RTA, comprised of a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the CD5 lymphocyte differentiation antigen coupled to ricin A chain, a cytotoxic enzyme that inhibits protein synthesis. The safety and efficacy of this lymphocyte-targeted immunotoxin was evaluated in patients with severe AGVHD in a phase I-II dose escalation study with group expansion at the two middle doses. Thirty-four patients received up to 14 daily intravenous infusions of the immunotoxin. The principal side effects were constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and myalgias, and hypoalbuminemia with weight gain was seen at all doses. Thirty-two patients were evaluated for improvement or resolution of disease. Durable complete or partial responses were not dose-related and were seen in 16 patients. Skin GVHD had the highest incidence of response (73%), although improvement or resolution in gastrointestinal tract (45%) and liver (28%) GVHD was also noted. Survival in responding patients was significantly prolonged at all times as compared with those with no response (P = .03). Treatment was associated with a rapid decrease in peripheral blood T lymphocytes, which persisted for greater than 1 month after therapy. Anti-immunotoxin antibodies were seen in 6 of the 23 patients tested; these were of low titer and did not block immunotoxin binding to T cells.

Overall survival appeared to be better in the untreated group (50 deceased patients compared with 62 in the chlorambucil group), but the difference was not significant (P = .21) even after adjusting for both prognostic and imbalanced factors (P = .09). The crude 5-year survival rates were 82% in the untreated group and 75% in the chlorambucil group. The action of chlorambucil appeared to be a complex phenomenon associating beneficial effects consisting in slowing down disease progression to stage B or C (P less than .01), and favoring disease remission with harmful effects given by a short survival after disease progression to stage B or C in the chlorambucil group and an increased incidence of epithelial cancers (33 v 19), as well as an excess of epithelial cancer deaths (13 v 3), in the chlorambucil group. As these results suggested an overall harmful effect of chlorambucil, we tried to define, within stage A patients, a group of patients with a low probability of disease progression. We showed that stage A patients with hemoglobin greater than or equal to 120 g/L and lymphocyte count less than 30 x 10(9)/L had a survival that was not significantly different (P = .46) from that of the age- and sex-matched French population.

The status of underlying disease at the time of transplantation was prognostic for the 2-year disease-free survival. Thirty-four patients received intensive chemotherapy prior to the conditioning for BMT. The 2-year disease-free survival was 60% for the 16 patients transplanted in complete remission. The results were significantly less favourable for those with more advanced disease who only partially responded to prior intensive chemotherapy (2-year disease-free survival: 18%) while none of those who either relapsed or were resistant to chemotherapy survived BMT for 2 years. Forty-four patients had not received any prior intensive chemotherapy.

2180423,NLM,MEDLINE,19900504,20121115,5,1,1990 Feb,Recognition by the DNA repair system of DNA structural alterations induced by reversible drug-DNA interactions.,43-53,"Ditercalinium (NSC 335153) was synthesized as a bifunctional DNA intercalator. It is made of two 7-H pyridocarbazole rings joined by a rigid bis-ethyl bispiperidine chain. It binds to DNA with high affinity and elicits anti-tumor activity on a variety of animal tumors. 1H n.m.r. studies of ditercalinium bis-intercalated into d(CpGpCpG)2 have shown that the intercalation process occurs from the large groove of the DNA helix while the two intercalated rings are separated by two base pairs. Because of the linking chain rigidity of ditercalinium, DNA conformation has to be altered to permit the intercalation of the two rings. DNA must be bent toward the minor groove. In E. coli, ditercalinium elicits a specific toxicity on polA strains which is suppressed by an additional uvrA mutation. In vitro, the purified UvrA and UvrB proteins bind to the DNA-ditercalinium complex in an ATP dependent manner. The UvrABC complex induces single-strand nicks, but only when ditercalinium is bound to negatively supercoiled DNA. The life-time of the UvrAB-DNA-ditercalinium complex is greater than 50 min when free ditercalinium concentration is maintained constant in the incubation medium. The cytotoxicity of ditercalinium in E. coli results from the induction of a futile and abortive DNA repair. The reversible ditercalinium-DNA complex mimics a bulky DNA lesion, yet the UvrABC endonuclease is unable to cope with a reversible lesion since it cannot eliminate the causative agent. The interaction of UvrA and UvrB proteins has also been studied with DNA and other DNA-binding drugs forming high-affinity complexes such as distamycin. The Uvr protein recognition process appears to be associated with specific DNA structural alterations. In eukaryotic cells, ditercalinium is concentrated in mitochondria. Mitochondrial DNA is rapidly and totally degraded. Mitochondrial DNA coded proteins being no longer synthesized, the respiratory chain is progressively inactivated. The stimulation of the glycolytic pathway allows the cells to continue growth for several generations. Dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria and its activity is dependent on mitochondria energization. It becomes inactive after ditercalinium treatment. A drop of the pyrimidine pool is then observed. Complementation of treated cells with uridine decreases 10-fold the ditercalinium toxicity. The cellular delayed toxicity of ditercalinium results from the slow induction of a pyrimidineless state associated with the progressive inactivation of mitochondria.

The authors have found that the alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method is sensitive and reliable. Murine monoclonal or nonmurine polyclonal antibodies can be used to label a variety of membranous and/or cellular constituents in tissues that have been routinely processed in a histopathology laboratory. The monoclonal antibody against leukocyte common antigen (CD45) can be used to differentiate hematologic from nonhematologic tumors. Monoclonal antibodies (L26, LN1, LN2, LN3, MB1, MB2) label B-cell lymphomas, whereas other monoclonal antibodies (UCHL1, MT1) more characteristically stain T-cell lymphomas. Polyclonal antibodies against CD3 specifically mark neoplastic cells from T-cell lymphomas and leukemias but as yet are not commercially available. Monoclonal antibodies Leu-M1 (CD15), Ber H2 (Ki-1; CD30), and LN2 label Reed-Sternberg cells from most cases of nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, and lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin's disease. Monoclonal antibodies Mac 387, KP1 (CD68), and NP57 (antielastase), as well as polyclonal antibodies against lysozyme, help identify subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia and extramedullary myeloid cell tumors.

A number of components with different possible effects were isolated: lectins, viscotoxins, alkaloids, etc. ""Oncological therapy"" and ""stimulation of the bone marrow"" are given as the main fields of indication. Pregnancy, hyperthyroidism and intolerances are given as contraindications. Depending on the type and the stage of the tumour, treatment based on a specific rhythmic schedule should be carried out for a period ranging from five years to a lifetime. A 7-ampoule pack costs 37 to 44 DM. Local inflammatory reactions occur as side effects. Fever is desirable. Helixor was developed by the Section for Leukemia and Cancer Therapy of the Gemein-schaft Fischermuhle e. V. in Rosenfeld, FRG, and has been used since about 1968. It is produced and distributed by Helixor Heilmittel GmbH & Co. The origin of anticancer treatment with Helixor, a mistletoe preparation, is the anthroposophical medicine. In addition, Helixor supposedly bridges the dramatic gap between conventional and natural treatment of cancer in that it exerts both a selective cancerostatic and an immunostimulatory effect. Hardly any research has been done on the pharmacodynamics, the pharmacokinetics and the toxicity of the total extract Helixor. In vitro studies reveal a cytostatic effect on individual cell lines; animal experiments with freshly pressed juice are contradictory. Specific effects of Helixor on the immune system and its actual bearing on the tumour process have so far not been unequivocally elucidated.

It is characterized by the classic symptomatological triad: ascites, hepatomegaly, and abdominal pain. In 2/3 cases its etiology remains unknown. Budd-Chiari syndrome may be associated with polycythemia vera, neoplasms, chronic leukemia, congenital abnormalities, hypercoagulation conditions, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, and constrictive pericarditis. Even though its clinical diagnosis is difficult, radiology plays a decisive role with US, CT, MR imaging and, above all, angiography; the latter, together with liver biopsy, generally provides with an unquestionable diagnosis. Through the definition of stage of the disease, of level (intrahepatic, venous, caval, cardiac), of type (intrinsic or extrinsic), and degree of both obstruction and consequent development of collateral channels, radiology determines which patients should undergo a medical or a surgical treatment. In some case, percutaneous angioplasty can be performed. Four cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome, including two children, were investigated with US, CT, angiography, and liver biopsy; MR imaging was also employed in one case. The underlying cause was identified in 3 patients: constrictive pericarditis of probable congenital origin and web occlusion of the inferior vena cava near the right atrium in the 2 children; hepatic vein thrombosis due to essential thrombocythemia in the third case. In the fourth patient, thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins was unexplained. The diagnosis was established by means of liver biopsy and phlebography of the hepatic veins.

DNA from this patient registered in a nude mouse tumorigenicity assay (NMT). The N12 Val mutation was not detected in the original tumour tissue from the same patient. A second patient in remission from HD showed evidence of co-existent N12 cysteine (Cys) and N13 valine (Val) substitutions which were not detected in presentation material or unaffected tissues.

In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, some patients have a breakpoint within the major breakpoint cluster region of the bcr gene, whereas others have the break within its first intron. This second type of translocation results in the transcription of a 7.0-kilobase chimaeric bcr/abl messenger RNA translated into a bcr/abl fusion protein, p190, which has an abnormal tyrosine kinase activity and is strongly autophosphorylated in vitro.

Up to now, 20 cases have been reported in which the single abnormality occurred without additional chromosomal aberrations. Trisomy 4 has been found in both primary and secondary AML, the majority of cases being diagnosed as FAB M4 or M2 subtypes. In the cytogenetic analysis of 305 patients with AML, we found 209 cases with aberrant karyotypes, among them two patients (22a, male, M2; and 69a, male, M4) with trisomy 4 as single aberration. The younger patient achieved complete remission lasting 13 months and survived 22 months whereas the older patient died in aplastic phase due to septicaemia 5 weeks after admission. Trisomy 4 is proposed to be the primary aberration in both these cases of de novo AML. Although in one case, as in two cases reported earlier, cytogenetic results were only available in first relapse, we have no indication that trisomy 4 appeared in a secondary induced leukemia, because the leukemic blasts of the relapse were morphologically identical to first acute phase. In contrast to other specific chromosomal aberrations, results indicate that trisomy 4 has as yet no prognostic relevance concerning the clinical outcome.","['Weber, E', 'Nowotny, H', 'Haas, O A', 'Kasparu, H', 'Grois, N', 'Lutz, D']","['Weber E', 'Nowotny H', 'Haas OA', 'Kasparu H', 'Grois N', 'Lutz D']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research and Hematology, Third Medical Department, Hanusch Hospital, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', '*Trisomy']",18,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Mar;4(3):219-21.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Lederle Cooperative Group.,177-83,"This phase III, randomized trial in previously untreated adults with ANLL compared mitoxantrone plus cytosine arabinoside with the CALGB ""7 + 3"" daunorubicin-based regimen. Two hundred evaluable patients (98 treated with the mitoxantrone-based regimen and 102 with the daunorubicin-based regimen) were included in the analysis of efficacy. The median age of the patients was 60 years. The induction regimen comprised cytosine arabinoside 100 mg/m2 by infusion daily for 7 days and mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 or daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 daily for days 1-3. If needed, a second induction course was administered: cytosine arabinoside for 5 days and mitoxantrone or daunorubicin for 2 days. Postremission therapy consisted of two consolidation courses, identical to the second induction course. Sixty-three percent (62 of 98) of patients treated with mitoxantrone achieved complete remission (CR), compared to 53% (54 of 102) treated with daunorubicin. The median time to CR was 35 days in patients treated with mitoxantrone and 43 days for those treated with daunorubicin. Eighty-nine percent (55 of 62) of patients treated with mitoxantrone who entered complete remission achieved CR following one induction course, compared to 68% (37 of 54) of patients treated with daunorubicin who entered CR. The median duration of CR was 240 days in patients treated with mitoxantrone and 198 days in those treated with daunorubicin; the median length of survival was 328 days in patients who received mitoxantrone and 247 days in those who received daunorubicin. The toxicity profiles in patients treated with either of the two regimens were comparable in incidence and in severity. Patients treated with mitoxantrone required fewer median platelet units and were treated with fewer median days of intravenous antibiotics, compared to those who received daunorubicin. Mitoxantrone in combination with cytosine arabinoside is effective in previously untreated ANLL. complete remissions occur more frequently after a single induction course of the mitoxantrone-based regimen, compared to the standard Cancer and Acute Leukemia Group B regimen. This should be explored in further trials.","['Arlin, Z', 'Case, D C Jr', 'Moore, J', 'Wiernik, P', 'Feldman, E', 'Saletan, S', 'Desai, P', 'Sia, L', 'Cartwright, K']","['Arlin Z', 'Case DC Jr', 'Moore J', 'Wiernik P', 'Feldman E', 'Saletan S', 'Desai P', 'Sia L', 'Cartwright K']","['Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,1990/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Mar;4(3):177-83.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Complete remission (CR) was achieved in three patients with RAEB-t and one patient with AML, partial remission was obtained in one patient with RAEB and hematological improvement in one patient with refractory anemia (RA). Interestingly, prolonged CR for more than 26 months with persistent chromosomal abnormalities was observed in a case of AML, which progressed from RA. Myelosuppression caused by low-dose ACR was milder than that caused by low-dose Ara-C. Furthermore, in vitro studies indicated that ACR induced differentiation of bone marrow cells from one patient with MDS. From these observations, it is suggested that low-dose ACR may be an alternative to low-dose Ara-C for treatment of MDS, and that the in vivo effect of ACR may be mediated by the differentiation of abnormal hemopoietic clones.","['Shibuya, T', 'Teshima, T', 'Harada, M', 'Taniguchi, S', 'Okamura, T', 'Okamura, S', 'Niho, Y']","['Shibuya T', 'Teshima T', 'Harada M', 'Taniguchi S', 'Okamura T', 'Okamura S', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)'],IM,"['Aclarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cell Count/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(2):161-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90045-b.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90045-b [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Three of the five patients were classified as biphenotypic leukemia because of the coexpression of myeloid/B lymphoid markers in patients 1 (FAB M2) and 2 (FAB CMMoL) and myeloid/T lymphoid markers in patient 3 (FAB M4). Patient 4 was identified as bilineal-biphenotypic leukemia because acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (FAB M4) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (FAB L1) coexisted and each population coexpressed myeloid and T lymphoid markers. Patient 5 was identified as bilineal leukemia due to the conversion from AML (FAB M1) to ALL (FAB L1) at an interval of 3 months. The Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome was negative in all cases. A leukemic blast colony formation using cell line 5637 conditioned medium as a stimulator was obtained in all four patients examined. Three of the five patients had been suffering from so-called stem cell disorders such as aplastic anemia in patient 2, trilineage myelodysplasia in patient 4 and refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation in patient 5. The pre-existing impairment of pluripotent stem cell was probably the background of these hybrid leukemia. Hybrid leukemia appears to have an inferior prognosis: an AML-directed chemotherapy resulted in a low remission rate (2/5) with a short duration of relapse free survival (1/2) and an ALL-directed chemotherapy produced no remission (0/3). Chronological phenotypic analysis revealed that hybrid features of leukemic blasts disappeared at the time of relapse in patient 1 and progression to AML in patient 2.

A diagnosis of MDS (RARS) was made by hematological examinations, and pyridoxamine was administered from September, 1983. The monocyte counts in the peripheral blood increased above 1,000/microliters continuously from June, 1985, and an exacerbation of anemia was also seen.

Associazione Italiana Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica.,672-7,"Between May 1980 and April 1987, 49 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in isolated testicular and first leukemia relapse (ITR) were enrolled in the Associazione Italiana Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) multicenter study REC80-ITR. According to the Rome Workshop criteria, 77% were at standard and 23% at high initial prognostic risk. In 33% of the cases, ITR occurred during first treatment. The REC80-ITR protocol consisted of an induction phase regimen of vincristine (VCR), cytarabine (ARA-C), methotrexate (MTX), and asparaginase (L-asp), and bilateral testicular irradiation, and CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal MTX and a maintenance phase with a multidrug rotating regimen. Total treatment duration was 30 months. The median time of observation after ITR was 51 months. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival and disease-free survival (DFS) at 4 years were 67.7% and 41%, respectively. Patients who had an ITR on therapy or within the first off-therapy year showed the poorest outcome. The DFS at 3 years was 20%, 47.6%, and 100%, respectively, for children who had an ITR on treatment (n = 16), within the first year of treatment withdrawal (n = 22), or later (n = 10) (P = .001). Patients with an asymptomatic occult testicular infiltrate at treatment discontinuation had a very unfavorable prognosis. Eighty-one percent of second relapses involved the bone marrow. In our experience, children presenting an early ITR (ie, within 6 months of treatment withdrawal) need a very aggressive treatment because of the high probability of an underlying systemic disease. On the other hand, patients with a late ITR seem to have a truly local recurrence and can apparently be cured by standard protocols, as shown in protocol REC80-ITR.","['Uderzo, C', 'Grazia Zurlo, M', 'Adamoli, L', 'Zanesco, L', 'Arico, M', 'Calculli, G', 'Comelli, A', 'Cordero di Montezemolo, L', 'Di Tullio, M T', 'Guazzelli, C']","['Uderzo C', 'Grazia Zurlo M', 'Adamoli L', 'Zanesco L', 'Arico M', 'Calculli G', 'Comelli A', 'Cordero di Montezemolo L', 'Di Tullio MT', 'Guazzelli C', 'et al.']","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Testicular Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Apr;8(4):672-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.4.672.,0732-183X (Print) 0732-183X (Linking),['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.4.672 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

This conductance was detected in the cells 24 hours after exposure to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), as the cells began to express the macrophage phenotype, and continued to increase for 4 days after PMA exposure. The magnitude of inward current was a function of external K+; current was blocked by extracellular or intracellular Cs+ and by extracellular Ba++. Hyperpolarization produced activation at membrane potentials more negative than -80 mV, and a slower, partial inactivation also occurred at potentials more negative than -100 mV. This conductance was not detected in proliferating cells nor in granulocytes derived from HL-60 cells which were induced to differentiate with retinoic acid (RA). Exposure of differentiated macrophages to recombinant human CSF-1 produced inhibition of the lKi beginning within 1 minute after exposure. CSF-1 inhibition of lKi channels in cell-attached patches indicated that channel modulation was via intracellular mediators. The rapid inhibition of the inward rectifier by the macrophage-specific CSF-1 appears to be one of the earliest cellular responses to this factor.","['Wieland, S J', 'Chou, R H', 'Gong, Q H']","['Wieland SJ', 'Chou RH', 'Gong QH']","['Department of Anatomy, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Macrophages/cytology/*physiology', 'Potassium/*physiology', 'Potassium Channels/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1990 Mar;142(3):643-51. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041420326.,0021-9541 (Print) 0021-9541 (Linking),['10.1002/jcp.1041420326 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

On the basis of these studies the clinical applicability of monitoring erythrocyte MTX concentrations in children with ALL and adult psoriasis patients have been evaluated. To accomplish this task a set of methods has been developed: 1) An automated enzymatic assay adapted for a centrifugal analyzer was used to measure MTX concentrations between 10 and 60 nmol/l in erythrocytes and serum. 2) For the study of MTX kinetics in myeloid cells, age fractionated erythrocytes and HPLC fractionated methotrexate polyglutamates a sequential radioligand binding assay with a range of 1-8 (and 1-16) nmol/l was employed. 3) Discontinuous Percoll gradients of increasing densities were used to separate myeloid cells and erythrocytes of increasing mean cell age. Declining reticulocyte counts and erythrocyte-aspartate aminotransferase activity were taken as parameters of increasing mean erythrocyte age. 4) In order to study MTX polyglutamate metabolism a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure was set up using tetrabutylammonium phosphate in acetonitrile in an automatically generated gradient buffer system. The MTX polyglutamates were separated, and the concentrations determined by the radioligand binding assay. The individual polyglutamates were identified by comparisons with the retention times of MTX polyglutamate standards (MTX-glu1+2+3+4+6+7) which were detected spectrophotometrically at 304 nm. During 24 hour infusions MTX was incorporated predominantly in the proliferating myeloid bone marrow cells before appearing in circulating neutrophils about seven days later. Evidence for MTX incorporation in the erythroid precursors of the bone marrow was provided by demonstrating high MTX content in density fractionated reticulocyte enriched erythrocyte populations. During weekly low dose MTX treatment the erythrocyte MTX concentration reached a constant level (steady state ery-MTX) after 4-6 weeks. MTX concentrations in age fractionated red blood cells and the terminal decline of the ery-MTX and its polyglutamate forms after cessation of MTX administration revealed that maintenance of the steady state ery-MTX depended on three conditions: 1) The amount of MTX added to the circulation via MTX containing reticulocytes. 2) The in vivo efflux of MTX from circulating erythrocytes, and 3) The loss of MTX with age dependent destruction of red blood cells. The in vivo efflux of MTX accounted for a loss of MTX which was 3-4 times greater than the amount that was lost with age dependent erythrocyte destruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Schroder, H']",['Schroder H'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus Kommunehospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Dan Med Bull,Danish medical bulletin,0066040,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate/physiology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Neoplasms/*blood/drug therapy']",180,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dan Med Bull. 1990 Feb;37(1):22-40.,0907-8916 (Print) 0907-8916 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

2178634,NLM,MEDLINE,19900426,20181113,5,1,1990 Jan-Feb,The toxicity of cytarabine.,7-27,"The principal toxicity of standard induction regimens for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) [including cytarabine (ARA-C) 100 mg/m2 for 7 days plus an anthracycline] is myelotoxicity, leading to death in at least 25% of cases during induction in non-selected patients. The complete remission rate is less than 35% in patients over 65 years of age, due in part to an age-related increase of myelotoxicity. The other important adverse effect of standard-dose cytarabine is gastrointestinal toxicity, especially oral mucositis, diarrhoea, intestinal ulceration, ileus and subsequent Gram-negative septicaemia. Idiosyncratic reactions like exanthema, fever and elevation of hepatic enzymes are relatively frequent, but do not represent therapeutic problems. Intermittent high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2 in 8 to 12 doses) is extremely myelosuppressive. Similarly, the gastrointestinal toxicity is formidable and dose-limiting. Severe, and sometimes irreversible, cerebellar/cerebral toxicity in 5 to 15% of courses of treatment limits the peak dose of cytarabine. The pathogenesis, prophylactic and therapeutic measures are unknown. These major toxicities are age-related and prohibitive to the use of high-dose cytarabine therapy in patients older than 55 to 60 years. Subacute noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema occurs in some patients, with an incidence of about 20%, and seems to have an intriguing coincidence with precedent streptococcal septicaemia; high-dose systemic steroids may be beneficial. Corneal toxicity is very frequent in high-dose cytarabine therapy but is always reversible. It is largely preventable with prophylactic steroid or 2-deoxycytidine eyedrops. Fever, exanthema and hepatic toxicity have an incidence similar to that in standard dosage. The maximum tolerable cumulated dose of cytarabine is significantly lower when the agent is administered as a continuous infusion, due to myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. Conversely, continuous infusion may be less neurotoxic. The antileukaemic effect of continuous infusion high-dose cytarabine is less well established. The only significant toxicity of low-dose cytarabine is myelosuppression. Given the generally poor condition of leukaemia patients, low-dose cytarabine therapy is well tolerated, although occasional cases of diarrhoea, reversible cerebellar symptoms, peritoneal and pericardial reactions, and ocular toxicity have been reported. Continuous infusion may be more toxic than the usual intermittent dosage. It is concluded that the toxicity of the standard induction regimen for ANLL is acceptable in patients younger than 60 to 65 years with no concurrent disease. Low dose cytarabine is tolerable for virtually all ANLL patients, but the overall therapeutic efficacy still needs to be defined and compared to standard therapy in the relevant age groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Stentoft, J']",['Stentoft J'],"['Department of Internal Medicine and Haematology B, Aalborg Hospital South, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drug Saf,Drug safety,9002928,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged']",139,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Saf. 1990 Jan-Feb;5(1):7-27. doi: 10.2165/00002018-199005010-00003.,0114-5916 (Print) 0114-5916 (Linking),['10.2165/00002018-199005010-00003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

One patient died from relapse after 3 months, one patient is a long-term survivor (38+ months), and two patients still on chemotherapy are disease-free for 11+ and 13+ months.","['Hirt, A', 'Luethy, A R', 'Mueller, B', 'Gugler, E', 'Wagner, H P']","['Hirt A', 'Luethy AR', 'Mueller B', 'Gugler E', 'Wagner HP']","['Department of Pediatrics (Inselspital), University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Remission Induction']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1990 Spring;12(1):27-33. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199021000-00006.,0192-8562 (Print) 0192-8562 (Linking),['10.1097/00043426-199021000-00006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Subcutaneous injection of 1.6 x 10(6) U of human recombinant IFN-alpha 2b per kg delivered peak concentrations in plasma of 3,600 U/ml at 2 h postadministration with a half-life of elimination of 2.9 h. This dosage of IFN-alpha could be delivered to cats for up to 12 weeks without significant clinical toxicity. Oral administration of AZT (20 mg/kg three times daily) resulted in peak concentrations in plasma of 3 micrograms/ml at 2 h with a half-life of elimination of approximately 1.60 h. Treatment of FeLV-FAIDS-infected cats with IFN-alpha, either alone or in combination with orally administered AZT, resulted in significant decreases in circulating p27 core antigen beginning 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. AZT alone had no effect on circulating virus antigen. Depending upon whether high (1.6 x 10(6) U/kg)- or low (1.6 x 10(4) to 1.6 x 10(5) U/kg)-dosage IFN-alpha was used, cats became refractory to therapy 3 or 7 weeks after the beginning of treatment. At these times, IFN-alpha-treated animals developed antibodies to IFN-alpha that were neutralizing, specific for human recombinant IFN-alpha, and dose dependent in magnitude. The results of this study indicate that human recombinant IFN-alpha is effective in reducing circulating virus antigenic load in cats persistently infected with FeLV-FAIDS. However, the continued efficacy of IFN-alpha therapy appeared to be limited by the formation of cytokine-specific neutralizing antibodies.","['Zeidner, N S', 'Myles, M H', 'Mathiason-DuBard, C K', 'Dreitz, M J', 'Mullins, J I', 'Hoover, E A']","['Zeidner NS', 'Myles MH', 'Mathiason-DuBard CK', 'Dreitz MJ', 'Mullins JI', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Cats', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Zidovudine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1990 Sep;34(9):1749-56. doi: 10.1128/AAC.34.9.1749.,0066-4804 (Print) 0066-4804 (Linking),['10.1128/AAC.34.9.1749 [doi]'],PMC171917,['N01 AI 72663/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells displayed high and low-affinity binding sites for leukotriene B4 (LTB4). The pretreatment of myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells with 1-10 nM LTB4 enhanced superoxide production evoked by 100 nM formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP) to 127-137% of the controls stimulated by fMLP alone. A concentration eliciting a half maximal increase (EC50) of LTB4 for the enhancing effect on superoxide production evoked by fMLP was 0.32 nM. This was roughly similar to the dissociation constant (Kd) of high affinity receptors for LTB4 (0.23 nM). These results suggest that high affinity receptors transduce the enhancing effect of LTB4 on fMLP-induced superoxide production. Although it seems possible that enhancement of fMLP-induced superoxide production is associated with a substantial increase and/or an affinity alteration in receptors for fMLP, LTB4-pretreated cells failed to show significant changes in fMLP binding compared to non-pretreated ones. It seems likely that Ca2+ influx transduces enhancement of fMLP-induced superoxide production, because extracellular Ca2+ is necessary for an enhancing effect of fMLP-induced superoxide production. Also, EC50 of LTB4 for Ca2+ influx (0.78 nM) was similar to that of the enhancing effect of superoxide generation evoked by fMLP. Although pretreatment of LTB4 failed to enhance the maximal level of fMLP-induced intracellular Ca2+ rise, transient overshoot in intracellular Ca2+ evoked by fMLP declined more rqpidly after LTB4 pretreatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Harada, Y']",['Harada Y'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hiroshima J Med Sci,Hiroshima journal of medical sciences,0421060,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene B4)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukotriene B4/*pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Receptors, Leukotriene B4', '*Superoxides']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hiroshima J Med Sci. 1990 Sep;39(3):89-94.,0018-2052 (Print) 0018-2052 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Viable lineage-committed precursors cannot be identified until after they have expressed their mature phenotype and these precursors cannot be grown to large number while lineage is committed but still immature. Recently, we have identified stable sublines of the HL-60 human leukemia cell line which differ from each other in that they selectively differentiate to either neutrophils (UR-1-4), monocyte/macrophages (MRI), eosinophils (clones 2 and 15), or mixtures of two (clones 7 and 8) or of all three lineages (UR-1-2) when stimulated to mature with butyric acid under identical conditions. Characterization of these sublines provided evidence that the expression of lineage in HL-60 cells is a multistep process and that the lineage tendencies (lineage direction) the clones exhibited when cultured with butyric acid represent a step in that process earlier than irreversible lineage commitment but later than the multipotential wild type HL-60 cells. First, treatment of these sublines with compounds that induce differentiation of HL-60 cells to specific lineages (dimethylsulfoxide, neutrophil; 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, monocyte), generally induced differentiation to the lineage associated with that inducer rather than the butyrate-associated lineage. Second, culture of neutrophil or monocyte-directed sublines in medium of elevated pH for two months leads to the development of eosinophils. Culturing the sublines first in butyric acid for variable lengths of time and switching to either DMSO or VD3 indicated that irreversible lineage commitment develops on a time course similar to the development of the commitment to mature. Markers of monocytic and eosinophilic differentiation could not be simultaneously demonstrated in single mature cells, consistent with the phenomenon of lineage fidelity. In addition, several assays were validated that could reliably classify mature HL-60 cells to their lineage. The collection of these sublines appears to constitute a model system with well-defined behavior with respect to the early events of lineage determination that can be grown to quantities sufficient for biochemical and molecular analysis. Exploring the differences between these clones may provide a new way to examine the early events of the lineage development process in myeloid cells.","['Fischkoff, S A', 'Rossi, R M']","['Fischkoff SA', 'Rossi RM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Butyrates)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(11-12):979-88. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90111-l.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90111-l [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Percentage neutrophils were significantly increased in induction cultures. Although total cell number increased with time in both control and induction cultures, the increase was less in induction cultures. These findings are consistent with the differentiation-associated growth limitation and with the decreased myeloperoxidase activity reported in RA-treated cultures in other studies.

These data suggest that the TCR on C6VL/1 can interact with RadLV in the absence of any co-receptor function of CD4 and implicates the TCR as a sufficient receptor for retrovirus.","[""O'Neill, H C""]","[""O'Neill HC""]","['Developmental Haematology Group, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra City, ACT.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CD4 Antigens', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'Receptors, Virus', 'Thymoma/immunology/*microbiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/immunology/*microbiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/microbiology']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 1990;2(4):377-80. doi: 10.1093/intimm/2.4.377.,0953-8178 (Print) 0953-8178 (Linking),['10.1093/intimm/2.4.377 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

This variant of t-AML is characterized by a short interval from initial drug therapy to bone marrow dysfunction and monocytic morphology without trilineage dysplasia. Unlike classic t-AML, which frequently has abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, this new subtype is characterized by rearrangements involving band q23 of chromosome 11, most commonly a 9;11 translocation. The majority of patients with this subtype t-AML had prior cytotoxic therapy with topoisomerase II-reactive drugs including anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, or actinomycin D, combined with either an alkylating agent or cisplatin. This association of prior therapy which includes topoisomerase II-reactive agents and a rapidly appearing t-AML involving the monocytic line and chromosome 11 requires additional study.","['Albain, K S', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Ullirsch, R', 'Schumacher, H']","['Albain KS', 'Le Beau MM', 'Ullirsch R', 'Schumacher H']","['Department of Medicine, Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL 60153.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/therapy', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*ultrastructure', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dactinomycin/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Iatrogenic Disease', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*chemically induced/classification/genetics', 'Mastectomy, Radical', 'Middle Aged', 'Podophyllotoxin/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy', 'Tamoxifen/administration & dosage', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",42,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1990 May;2(1):53-8. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870020110.,1045-2257 (Print) 1045-2257 (Linking),['10.1002/gcc.2870020110 [doi]'],,"['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 35377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

One (RTVL-Ia) is in the first intron of the HPR gene, and the second (RTVL-Ic) is at the 3'-end of the gene cluster. The chimpanzee three-gene cluster (HP-HPR-HPP) contains an additional, third copy (RTVL-Ib) in the intergenic region between HPR and HPP. RTVL-Ia and RTVL-Ib are essentially full size and have the general structure, 5'-LTR-gag-pol-env-3'-LTR, while RTVL-Ic lacks about one-third of its 5'-part. Although none of the elements has retained long open reading frames, we could detect stretches having amino acids identical to various parts of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) proteins. We conclude that the RTVL-I elements were derived from a virus very similar in structure to Mo-MuLV. The DNA sequences surrounding the insertion points of the three RTVL-I elements are not alike and allow the inference that they integrated into the haptoglobin gene cluster independently at some time after the initial formation of the triplicated gene cluster in primates. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the three elements leads to the hypothesis that foreign DNA introduced into the genome can initially accumulate mutations more rapidly than the genomic sequences surrounding it.","['Maeda, N', 'Kim, H S']","['Maeda N', 'Kim HS']","['Department of Pathology and Genetics Curriculum, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Haptoglobins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Multigene Family', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pan troglodytes', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1990 Dec;8(4):671-83. doi: 10.1016/0888-7543(90)90254-r.,0888-7543 (Print) 0888-7543 (Linking),['10.1016/0888-7543(90)90254-r [doi]'],,['GM37567/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['HPR']

The effect of PGA1 on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was investigated. When VSV-infected L-1210 cells were kept in the presence of PGA1 the amount of all five viral proteins and their respective mRNAs was dose-dependently decreased. To determine whether the effect was on viral transcription or translation, the temperature-sensitive VSV mutant tsG 41 was employed. This is a good model system for the investigation of primary transcription; at the restrictive temperature of 39 degrees C, tsG 41 is unable to replicate but can transcribe viral mRNA. Mutant mRNA synthesis was strongly inhibited by PGA1 at this temperature, indicating that the major effect is on primary transcription.

Both recombinant receptors, fMLP-R26 and fMLP-R98, are 350 amino acids long (Mr 38,420); they differ from each other by two residue changes at positions 101 and 346 and by significant differences in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Both clones were able to transfer to COS-7 cells the capacity to specifically bind a new and highly efficient hydrophilic derivative of N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys, referred to as fMLPK-Pep12. Photolabeling experiments revealed that the glycosylated form of the fMLP receptor in COS cells has a molecular weight (Mr 50,000-70,000) similar to that observed for the native receptor in differentiated HL-60 cells. Northern blot analysis revealed a major transcript of 1.6-1.7 kb and two minor hybridization signals of 2.3 and 3.1 kb, suggesting a related family of receptors. The complex hybridization pattern obtained with restricted genomic DNA was consistent with either two genes encoding fMLP receptor isoforms or a single gene with at least one intron in the coding sequence. Sequence comparison established that the fMLP receptor belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The structural similarities observed with RDC1, a receptor isolated from a dog thyroid cDNA library, which shares weak homologies with other members of the family, suggests that the fMLP receptor is representative of a new subfamily.","['Boulay, F', 'Tardif, M', 'Brouchon, L', 'Vignais, P']","['Boulay F', 'Tardif M', 'Brouchon L', 'Vignais P']","['LBIO/Laboratoire de Biochimie, Departement de Recherche Fondamentale, Grenoble, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', '*Multigene Family', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection']",,1990/12/18 00:00,1990/12/18 00:01,['1990/12/18 00:00'],"['1990/12/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/18 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 Dec 18;29(50):11123-33. doi: 10.1021/bi00502a016.,0006-2960 (Print) 0006-2960 (Linking),['10.1021/bi00502a016 [doi]'],,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M33537', 'GENBANK/M33538', 'GENBANK/M60626', 'GENBANK/M60627']",

H2O2/vanadate stimulate best formation of inositol triphosphate while their effects on the mono and di derivatives are more moderate. In the presence of 3 mM H2O2, both protein tyrosine phosphorylation and InsP formation are highly correlated and manifest an identical dose-response relationship for vanadate. Half-maximal and maximal effects are obtained at 30 and 100 microM, respectively. This stimulatory effect of H2O2/vanadate is not mimicked by other oxidants such as spermine, spermidine, KMnO4, and vitamin K3. In RBL cells, the kinetics of inositol triphosphate formation correlate with tyrosine phosphorylation of a 67-kDa protein, while tyrosine phosphorylation of a 55-kDa protein is closely correlated with both inositol monophosphate formation and serotonin secretion from these cells. Taken together, these results suggest a causal relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation triggered in a nonhormonal manner and polyphosphoinositide breakdown. Furthermore, these results implicate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in playing a role in the stimulus-secretion coupling in RBL cells.","['Zick, Y', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, R']","['Zick Y', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Muscles/cytology', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",,1990/11/06 00:00,1990/11/06 00:01,['1990/11/06 00:00'],"['1990/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 Nov 6;29(44):10240-5. doi: 10.1021/bi00496a013.,0006-2960 (Print) 0006-2960 (Linking),['10.1021/bi00496a013 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The trees showed that the viruses diverged from a common ancestral virus and that they are classified into two groups whose hosts are either primates or bovines. However, the topology of the trees for the viruses differed from that for the hosts. This suggests that HTLV-I and HTLV-I-related viruses evolved independently of host-species divergence and that interspecies transmission between human and monkeys occurred in the past. The nucleotide diversity of the tax genes of HTLV-I was estimated to be 0.025. This value is more than 10 times larger than that of human globin genes, but it is about 20 times smaller than that of hemagglutinin genes of influenza A viruses. Thus, the genetic variability of the HTLV-I genes seems to be higher than that of nuclear genes but much lower than the genes of typical RNA viruses. Furthermore, we examined functional constraints on the overlapping region of the rex and tax genes. The results obtained imply that for the overlapping region, the tax gene has much stronger constraints against amino acid changes than the rex gene.","['Ina, Y', 'Gojobori, T']","['Ina Y', 'Gojobori T']","['National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Evol,Journal of molecular evolution,0360051,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'DNA, Viral', '*Deltaretrovirus/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genes, pX', 'Genetic Variation', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Evol. 1990 Dec;31(6):493-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02102076.,0022-2844 (Print) 0022-2844 (Linking),['10.1007/BF02102076 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['rex', 'tax']"

Simulation by cell lines.,211-6,"Thymocytes from SJL/J mice exhibit a periodicity in their response to hormonal stimulation with isoproterenol. This periodicity (5-9 days) is expressed in large changes in the intensity of the response (peak levels of intracellular cAMP which vary approximately 6-fold), and in the response pattern, i.e., in the occurrence or non-occurrence of an immediate hormone-induced desensitization. In contrast, C57BL/6 thymocytes have a homogeneous response pattern (in all cases there was an immediate desensitization). Their response does change with the same periodicity, but these changes are restricted to the intensity of response (the peak of cAMP levels varies only approximately 2-fold). Using T, B and pre-B shown that these periodic changes may be due to fluctuations in T cell subpopulations in the thymus and possibly also the infiltration of B cells into it. These observations provide a useful system for studying at the cellular and molecular level the known correlation between endocrine disorders and neoplasia in mice. On the other hand, the set of cell lines with such different response patterns to a single hormone may be used for the identification and isolation of additional cellular constituents involved in the cellular response to hormones and its immediate desensitization.","['Riven-Kreitman, R', 'Tauber-Finkelstein, M', 'Zipori, D', 'Shaltiel, S']","['Riven-Kreitman R', 'Tauber-Finkelstein M', 'Zipori D', 'Shaltiel S']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Endocrine System Diseases/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Isoproterenol/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*physiology', 'Periodicity', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Thymus Gland/*drug effects/pathology']",,1990/10/22 00:00,1990/10/22 00:01,['1990/10/22 00:00'],"['1990/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 1990 Oct 22;73(2-3):211-6. doi: 10.1016/0303-7207(90)90134-t.,0303-7207 (Print) 0303-7207 (Linking),['10.1016/0303-7207(90)90134-t [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Direct involvement of the putative V-(D)-J recombinase in the translocation has been proposed, since the hot spot region of the breakpoints on chromosome 18 possesses the 7/9 signal-like sequence. The 5' flanking region of bcl-2 gene is another hot spot of the translocations which are preferentially associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The translocation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia results in the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 gene to various regions on the immunoglobulin light chain loci. No association of a 7/9 signal sequence and the heterogeneity of the breakpoints within the bcl-2 and IgL loci suggest that the translocations occurring at the 5'-flanking region of the bcl-2 gene might be mediated by a different mechanism from that of the t(14;18) translocation. Here we demonstrate that the breakpoints at the 5' flanking region of bcl-2 gene are surrounded by multiple alternating purine-pyrimidine elements (potential Z-DNA). The antibodies specific to Z-DNA showed that the regions containing the alternating purine-pyrimidine elements were confined to the 5' hot spot region. The data suggest that Z-DNA formation may be involved in chromosome translocations at the 5' flanking region of bcl-2 gene.","['Adachi, M', 'Tsujimoto, Y']","['Adachi M', 'Tsujimoto Y']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA/*chemistry/genetics', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Superhelical/chemistry', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Plasmids', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Nov;5(11):1653-7.,0950-9232 (Print) 0950-9232 (Linking),,,['R01-CA50551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['GENBANK/X51898'],['bcl-2']

R., Serunian L. A., Soltoff, S. P., Libby, P., and Cantley, L. C. (1989) Cell 57, 167-175. An alternative pathway for in vivo synthesis of one of these lipids was recently suggested: phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate could be produced by phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate at the D-4 position of the inositol ring (Yamamoto, K., and Lapetina, E. G. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 168, 466-472). Here we demonstrate the presence of an enzyme in human platelets that phosphorylates [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate to produce [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. This enzyme is Mg2(+)-dependent and its apparent molecular mass is approximately 150 kDa as estimated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration chromatography. Unlike the major phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase in platelets that is stimulated by the detergent Nonidet P-40, the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-4-kinase is inhibited by Nonidet P-40. Both activities are also differentiated by the action of adenosine.

Human lung and kidney are a rich source of ACE and the enzyme is bound to the plasma-membrane of vascular endothelial cells; however, the small intestine and the choroid plexus are also particularly rich in ACE, where it is concentrated on the surface of cuboidal epithelial cells facing the cerebrospinal fluid. The ACE is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 150,000 daltons and it cleaves C-terminal dipeptides of several oligo-peptides, including angiotensin I and bradykinin. It catalyzes conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and induces inactivation of bradykinin. Synthetic acylated tripeptides such as radiolabelled hippuryl-histidyl-leucine and hippuryl-glycyl-glycine have been found to be the most suitable substrates for determining the activity of ACE with radiochemical assays. The mean-normal values for ACE activity is 25 U/ml; there are no significant differences in ACE activity between different sexes and races, but there is significant decrease in adults. The measurement of ACE activity in sarcoidosis suggests the following results: 1) There is a relationship between the increased SACE and LACE activity and active disease and between normal ACE activity and inactive disease. 2) Normal or decreased ACE activity is useful for therapeutic evaluation of sarcoidosis. 3) Increased SACE activity can be a sensitive parameter for predicting clinical relapse of the disease. An increased SACE activity is found in a wide variety of non-sarcoid granulomatous diseases and non-granulomatous systemic diseases. A decreased SACE and LACE activity is found in non-granulomatous pulmonary diseases such as ""Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome"", lung cancer and lung toxicity caused by antineoplastic drugs. Moreover, a low preoperative SACE is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer and its levels may be useful for predicting clinical relapse of this disorder after operation. Finally, a low SACE activity is found in malignant lymphomas, leukemia and multiple myeloma. A relationship is also found between decreased enzyme activity and a poor prognosis and clinical relapse of these diseases.","['Lauta, V M']",['Lauta VM'],"['Istituto di Patologia speciale medica e Metodologia clinica, Universita degli studi, Policlinico, Bari.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Recenti Prog Med,Recenti progressi in medicina,0401271,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.4.15.1 (Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Granuloma/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Lung/drug effects', 'Lung Diseases/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/enzymology', '*Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/blood/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Sarcoidosis/diagnosis/enzymology']",96,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Recenti Prog Med. 1990 Sep;81(9):601-13.,0034-1193 (Print) 0034-1193 (Linking),,,,,,"ACE: fisiopatologia e ruolo nella diagnosi e prognosi delle granulomatosi sistemiche, neoplasie e pneumotossicita da citostatici.",,,

(1990) Nature (London) 343, 762-764]. To directly compare the effects of gp55 with erythropoietin (Epo), we produced retrovirions that encode either gp55, Epo, or EpoR. After infection with EpoR virus, interleukin 3-dependent DA-3 cells bound 125I-labeled Epo and grew without interleukin 3 in the presence of Epo. These latter cells, but not parental DA-3 cells, became factor-independent after superinfection either with Epo virus or with Friend spleen focus-forming virus. In addition, Epo virus caused a disease in mice that mimicked Friend erythroleukemia. Although Fv-2r homozygotes are susceptible to all other retroviral diseases, they are resistant to both Epo viral and Friend viral erythroleukemias. These results indicate that both gp55 and Epo stimulate EpoR and that the Fv-2 gene encodes a protein that controls response to these ligands. However, the Fv-2 protein is not EpoR because the corresponding genes map to opposite ends of mouse chromosome 9. These results have important implications for understanding signal transduction by EpoR and the role of host genetic variation in controlling susceptibility to an oncogenic protein.","['Hoatlin, M E', 'Kozak, S L', 'Lilly, F', 'Chakraborti, A', 'Kozak, C A', 'Kabat, D']","['Hoatlin ME', 'Kozak SL', 'Lilly F', 'Chakraborti A', 'Kozak CA', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythropoietin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Dec;87(24):9985-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.24.9985.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),['10.1073/pnas.87.24.9985 [doi]'],PMC55299,"['AI28572/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Fv-2<up>r</up>']

The TCR gene was placed under the control of the human beta-actin promoter and enhancer. Bone marrow cells pretreated with 5-fluorouracil were infected by coculturing with psi-2 virus-producing cells in the presence of recombinant interleukins 1, 2, 4, and 6 as well as interleukin 3 from WEHI-3 conditioned medium. The infected cells were transplanted into irradiated mice, and expression of the exogenous V beta 6 gene was examined with a V beta 6-specific monoclonal antibody, RNase protection, and polymerase chain reaction amplification. Three of seven mice expressed the retroviral TCR gene on the surface of a significant proportion of mature T cells 5-6 months after transplantation. In mice analyzed less than 1 month after transplantation, up to 30% of mature T cells expressed V beta 6 TCRs, an increase of at least 20% above the level of endogenous V beta 6 expression. DNA analysis revealed that pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells were infected by the retroviral vector in a long-term reconstituted mouse that showed increased V beta 6 expression.","['Kang, J', 'Wither, J', 'Hozumi, N']","['Kang J', 'Wither J', 'Hozumi N']","['Division of Molecular Immunology and Neurobiology, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transfection']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Dec;87(24):9803-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.24.9803.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),['10.1073/pnas.87.24.9803 [doi]'],PMC55262,,,,,,,

Within 24 h after induction and well before the onset of hemoglobin synthesis, we observed a 3-fold increase in beta-receptor density and a more than 10-fold increase in receptor-coupled cAMP formation. During the following 4 days, in parallel with the development of normoblast-like cells, receptor numbers returned to preinduction levels while catecholamine-dependent cAMP formation remained significantly elevated. Simultaneously, the apparent potency of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline increased 10-fold. Improved receptor-cyclase coupling is probably due to a major shift in the expression of Gi and Gs regulatory proteins. Bacterial toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of membrane proteins suggests that the dominating species in native cells is Gi (Gsa:Gia = 1.7). By contrast, Gs predominates in differentiated cells (Gsa:Gia = 1.8:1). Receptor-independent forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation showed a pronounced, albeit transient, decrease during differentiation. We suggest that these changes in cellular cAMP responses may be important for transient positive or negative cooperative interactions between hormones and growth factors in the course of erythroid cell development.","['Moudry, R', 'Porzig, H']","['Moudry R', 'Porzig H']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Catecholamines)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catecholamines/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Interphase/physiology', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1990 Dec;191(2):278-85. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(90)90015-3.,0014-4827 (Print) 0014-4827 (Linking),['10.1016/0014-4827(90)90015-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

In contrast, coexisting chromosomally normal hematopoietic cells are relatively well maintained. Thus, even though normal cells are initially undetectable, they may become the predominant population. Recently, we have begun to explore the potential of such cultures as a strategy for preparing CML marrow for autografting, and based on cytogenetic studies of the differential kinetics of Ph1-positive and Ph1-negative clonogenic cells, have chosen a 10-day period in culture to obtain maximal numbers of selectively enriched normal stem cells. Here we present the results of molecular analyses of the cells regenerated in vivo for the initial three CML patients to be treated using this approach by comparison with the differentiated cells generated by continued maintenance of an aliquot of the autograft in vitro (using a slightly modified culture feeding procedure to enhance the production and release of cells into the nonadherent fraction after 4 weeks) for the one patient whose genotype made molecular analysis of clonality status also possible. These analyses showed that cells with a rearranged breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene were not detectable by Southern blotting in either in vitro or in vivo populations of mature cells that might be assumed to represent the progeny of primitive cells present at the end of the initial 10 days in culture. Production of BCR-negative cells was also shown to be temporally correlated with the appearance of nonclonal hematopoietic cells both in culture and in vivo. These findings provide support for the view that prolonged maintenance of CML marrow cells in long-term culture may allow molecular characterization of both the BCR-genotype and clonality status of cells with in vivo regenerative potential.","['Turhan, A G', 'Humphries, R K', 'Eaves, C J', 'Barnett, M J', 'Phillips, G L', 'Kalousek, D K', 'Klingemann, H G', 'Lansdorp, P L', 'Reece, D E', 'Shepherd, J D']","['Turhan AG', 'Humphries RK', 'Eaves CJ', 'Barnett MJ', 'Phillips GL', 'Kalousek DK', 'Klingemann HG', 'Lansdorp PL', 'Reece DE', 'Shepherd JD', 'et al.']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genotype', 'Granulocytes/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Dec 1;76(11):2404-10.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)84870-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

We have now obtained evidence for the interaction of these pathways. We used a Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cell line with a relatively low (8% to 10%) hemoglobinization response to Epo alone. Pretreatment of these cells for 1 day with DMSO followed by its removal and the addition of Epo resulted in a marked enhancement of the Epo specific hemoglobinization. We have designated this effect ""DMSO priming."" This priming effect of DMSO on the Epo response was both time-dependent and DMSO concentration-dependent. DMSO priming potentiated the Epo response in three ways. Firstly, DMSO priming increased the total number of Epo responsive cells from 8% to 10% to 40% to 60%. Secondly, DMSO priming reduced the time required to reach the optimal Epo-induced response from 4 days to 2 days. Thirdly, the Epo dose-response curve was left-shifted approximately 20-fold. DMSO priming was also associated with a marked increase in Epo receptor density characterized by an apparently new receptor population and by the appearance of positive cooperativity between receptors. Our results suggest that the DMSO priming effect is due to potentiation of the Epo signaling pathway, thus resulting in a much more rapid and dramatic Epo-induced hemoglobinization response.","['Chern, Y', 'Yonekura, S', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Chern Y', 'Yonekura S', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, New England Deaconess Hospital, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Dec 1;76(11):2204-9.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)84841-1 [pii]'],,['DK 38841/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Two cell lines representing different stages of differentiation were used (HL-60, promyelocytic, and THP-1, mature monocytic). In accordance with previous studies, it was observed that a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), was a sufficient stimulus for induction of the IL-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and IL-1 beta protein production in both of these cell lines. A structural analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) or agents elevating the endogenous cAMP levels (prostaglandin E2, forskolin) were not alone able to induce IL-1 beta expression, but they strongly enhanced the PMA-induced IL-1 beta production and IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation. Nuclear run off analysis showed that this elevation in IL-1 beta mRNA levels was due to an increased rate of transcription. If dbcAMP was added 6 hours before PMA to the cultures, no enhancement in the IL-1 beta production was seen, implying that for this enhancing effect both of these signals must be present simultaneously. PKC inhibitor, H7, also blocked effectively the PMA plus dbcAMP induced IL-1 beta production, while the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, HA1004, had no effect, suggesting that PKA activation is not involved in the mechanism of action of cAMP in this case. Collectively, the present findings show that cAMP-dependent signals can have a positive regulatory effect on the PKC-dependent activation of the IL-1 beta gene in cells derived from different stages of myeloid differentiation.","['Hurme, M', 'Serkkola, E', 'Ronni, T', 'Silvennoinen, O']","['Hurme M', 'Serkkola E', 'Ronni T', 'Silvennoinen O']","['Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Dec 1;76(11):2198-203.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)84840-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The resulting construct was then cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcYM1, which contains the polyhedrin promoter of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). Cells of the insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) were cotransfected with the resulting recombinant transfer vector pAc85 and infectious AcNPV/E2 DNA. After cotransfection, recombinant baculovirus that lacked the polyhedrin gene and expressed gp85 was selected from the supernatant and used to infect Sf9 cells. The expression of the gp85 gene peaked 3 days after infection, but expression products were not released into the culture medium even though the signal peptide had been cleaved.

PCR allows rapid sequencing of variable-(diversity)-joining (V-[D]-J) junctions from tumor DNA and construction of anti-junctional oligonucleotides (AJOs) used as probes to detect clonal cells in the same patient. We have defined oligonucleotides suitable for all T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements involving functional V gamma segments. Oligonucleotides corresponding to preferential TCR delta rearrangements in T and B lineage ALLs were also used. By analysis of the nucleotide sequence of 52 V gamma-V gamma junctions from 30 cases of B and T ALLs, we demonstrate that V-J junctional sequences are clone specific in both lineages and at all stages of differentiation examined despite the frequent presence of the recently described P nucleotides. Experiments performed with TCR gamma delta AJOs on DNA from tumor cells and polyclonal T cells show that AJOs can be used to differentiate clonal cells from polyclonal T cells, distinguish between different T cell clones, and detect residual clonal populations at 10(-4)/10(-5) dilution. AJOs were also used to detect residual disease in samples from patients in clinical and morphological complete remission. Finally, rearrangement patterns were studied by classical Southern analysis in selected cases at both presentation and subsequent relapse showing absence of clonal evolution in most cases. V-(D)-J nucleotide sequences of rearrangements with an identical pattern of rearrangement at presentation and relapse were identical in all cases analyzed. We therefore describe a new, specific, and clinically useful strategy for the detection of minor clonal populations applicable in the majority of cases of ALL.","['Macintyre, E A', ""d'Auriol, L"", 'Duparc, N', 'Leverger, G', 'Galibert, F', 'Sigaux, F']","['Macintyre EA', ""d'Auriol L"", 'Duparc N', 'Leverger G', 'Galibert F', 'Sigaux F']","['Molecular Hematology Laboratory, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1990 Dec;86(6):2125-35. doi: 10.1172/JCI114951.,0021-9738 (Print) 0021-9738 (Linking),['10.1172/JCI114951 [doi]'],PMC329853,,,,,,,

The present work has examined the involvement of cAMP-dependent signaling mechanisms in the regulation of c-jun gene expression. Low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in untreated HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. In contrast, treatment of these cells with 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate was associated with increases in c-jun expression that were maximal at 3 h and then declined to pretreatment levels. Similar findings were obtained with N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, but not with 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. c-jun transcripts were also increased with agents, such as prostaglandin E2 and forskolin, that increase intracellular cAMP levels. The effects of these agents on c-jun expression were associated with activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Moreover, inhibition of this kinase activity with the isoquinolinesulfonamide derivative H8 was associated with a block in the induction of c-jun expression by cAMP. Nuclear run-on analysis further demonstrated that while c-jun transcription is a low levels in untreated HL-60 cells, treatment with cAMP analogs is associated with an increase in the transcriptional rate of this gene. Taken together, these findings suggested that, in addition to activation of protein kinase C, stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity is also involved in the transcriptional induction of c-jun gene expression. The present results similarly demonstrate that c-fos gene transcription is induced in HL-60 cells through a mechanism involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Since heterodimers of the Jun and Fos proteins have been shown to bind to the phorbol ester-responsive element (AP-1-binding site), the present findings indicate that cAMP-induced signaling events may also regulate gene transcription through formation of Fos/Jun heterodimers and that interaction between phorbol ester- and cAMP-dependent pathways could occur through induction of the c-jun gene in these cells.","['Nakamura, T', 'Datta, R', 'Sherman, M L', 'Kufe, D']","['Nakamura T', 'Datta R', 'Sherman ML', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/12/15 00:00,1990/12/15 00:01,['1990/12/15 00:00'],"['1990/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Dec 15;265(35):22011-5.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(18)45840-1 [pii]'],,"['CA01902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Evidence for a multimeric complex.,271-8,"In order to study the erythropoietin receptor in its native state, we solubilized erythropoietin-receptor complexes from spleen cell membranes of mice infected with the anemia strain of Friend virus using mild detergents. Among 11 tested detergents, Triton X-100 and Lubrol PX were the most effective. Triton X-100 was therefore selected for this study. The solubilized complexes appeared to be well representative of the total membrane receptor population as indicated by cross-linking experiments and affinity measurements. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the complexes were determined by gel filtration chromatography and ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradients prepared with H2O or D2O. Although erythropoietin-receptor-detergent complexes exhibited some heterogeneity, we determined the following minimal hydrodynamic values: sedimentation coefficient (s20,w): 11.7 +/- 0.8 S, Stokes radius: 7.7 +/- 0.2 nm, partial specific volume: 0.774 +/- 0.017 ml/g, giving a molecular mass of 458 +/- 66 kDa. The contribution of the detergent was estimated to be 28% from the measured partial specific volume, giving an estimated molecular mass of 330 +/- 48 kDa for the erythropoietin-receptor complex. The minimal molecular mass value was significantly greater than those obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, strongly suggesting that the erythropoietin receptors were present as multimeric complexes. The nature of these complexes is discussed. Beside this major component our results revealed the presence of higher-molecular-mass erythropoietin binding components. We also demonstrated that erythropoietin-receptor complexes could be precipitated with anti-erythropoietin antibodies. This property should greatly improve the purification of erythropoietin receptors.","['Mayeux, P', 'Casadevall, N', 'Lacombe, C', 'Muller, O', 'Tambourin, P']","['Mayeux P', 'Casadevall N', 'Lacombe C', 'Muller O', 'Tambourin P']","['Unite INSERM 152, Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Octoxynol', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Solubility']",,1990/11/26 00:00,1990/11/26 00:01,['1990/11/26 00:00'],"['1990/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1990 Nov 26;194(1):271-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19453.x.,0014-2956 (Print) 0014-2956 (Linking),['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19453.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Its mechanism of action is not yet well understood. This paper investigates the sites of MC 540-mediated photodamages in L1210 leukemia cells by examining the effects of MC 540-sensitized photoirradiation on several soluble and membrane-bound marker enzymes. When exposed to MC 540 and white light under a standard set of conditions, the activities of Na+/K(+)-ATPase, Mg2(+)-ATPase, and 5'-nucleotidase (three plasma membrane-bound enzymes) were reduced by 54, 49, and 55%, respectively. None of the intracellular enzymes included in this survey was affected by MC 540-sensitized photoirradiation as long as the plasma membrane remained intact. The two soluble enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase, remained refractory to MC 540-sensitized photoirradiation even after the plasma membrane had been disrupted. By contrast, the activities of the membrane-bound enzymes, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and succinate dehydrogenase, were reduced in cell lysates by 55 and 81%, respectively. Purified NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was about 3 times less sensitive than the microsomal enzyme, suggesting that the membrane environment facilitated photoinactivation. The MC 540-sensitized photoinactivation of enzymes was accelerated in the presence of deuterium oxide and inhibited if oxygen in the medium was displaced by nitrogen or azide was added to the medium. Taken together, these data support the view that the plasma membrane is a major target of MC 540-mediated photodamages, that the inactivation of membrane-bound enzymes is an oxidative process, and that at least some photodynamic damages are mediated by type II chemistry.","['Gaffney, D K', 'Sieber, F']","['Gaffney DK', 'Sieber F']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.6.1.- (Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*antagonists & inhibitors/radiation effects"", 'Animals', 'Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase/*antagonists & inhibitors/radiation effects', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Clone Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Free Radicals', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Light', 'Mice', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/*antagonists & inhibitors/radiation effects', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Singlet Oxygen', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*antagonists & inhibitors/radiation effects']",,1990/12/15 00:00,1990/12/15 00:01,['1990/12/15 00:00'],"['1990/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Dec 15;50(24):7765-9.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,['CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Very low specific binding of the CEA-specific Mab35 was found, whereas the CEA- and NCA-recognizing Mab47 showed 20-fold higher binding. The number of binding sites for Mab47 on HL-60 cells is lower than on normal granulocytes and is modulated by inducers of cellular differentiation and growth. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), an inducer of neutrophilic differentiation, increased Mab47 binding in a time-dependent manner up to 4-fold after 7 days. In contrast, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate which induces differentiation into monocyte/macrophages led to a loss of binding sites. Mab47 binding was also decreased by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and this effect was enhanced in the presence of DMSO during the first 3 days of DMSO treatment. It is concluded that agents affecting neutrophilic differentiation or cell growth act in an opposite manner on NCA expression of HL-60 cells. NCA expression is not crucial for neutrophilic differentiation because it can be suppressed by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor early in the differentiation program without affecting cell maturation.","['Novak-Hofer, I', 'Blauenstein, P', 'Schubiger, P A']","['Novak-Hofer I', 'Blauenstein P', 'Schubiger PA']","['Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen-PSI, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Surface/*biosynthesis', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Densitometry', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Dec 1;50(23):7437-43.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Agents Chemother. 31:452-454 (1987); Mol. Pharmacol. 36:9-14 (1989)]. The present study explores possible genetic mechanisms involved in AZT-induced anemia by evaluating the effects of AZT on globin gene expression at both the transcriptional and the translational levels in butyric acid-induced K-562 human erythroleukemia cells. AZT, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 250 microM, was added to cells 25 hr after initiation of induction of hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis with 1.4 mM butyric acid. Hb synthesis, as measured by benzidine staining, was inhibited by AZT in a dose- and time-dependent manner in these cells. AZT inhibition of cell growth was not the major contributing factor in the net inhibition of Hb synthesis in K-562 cells. As assessed by Northern blot analysis, AZT inhibition of Hb synthesis was associated with a decrease in globin mRNA steady state levels without inhibition of total RNA synthesis or actin mRNA steady state levels. In particular, a decrease of globin mRNA levels of 23% by 25 microM AZT was observed, reaching a maximum inhibition of 59% in the presence of 250 microM AZT. In vitro translation experiments demonstrated that essentially all nonglobin translatable mRNAs were not inhibited by AZT concentrations as high as 250 microM, whereas globin mRNAs coding for epsilon, zeta, A gamma, G gamma, and alpha chains were substantially inhibited to similar levels by AZT, in a dose-dependent manner. Transcriptional run-on studies with isolated nuclei from AZT-treated K-562 cells demonstrated a 20 and 50% inhibition of in vitro synthesized globin transcripts from cells exposed to 25 and 100 microM AZT, respectively. 2',3'-Dideoxycytidine also inhibited K-562 cell growth in the same concentration range as AZT but, of importance, had no effects on Hb production. These data suggest that inhibition of globin gene expression may play a role in the cytotoxicity of AZT to the erythroid cell.","['Weidner, D A', 'Sommadossi, J P']","['Weidner DA', 'Sommadossi JP']","['Department of Pharmacology, Center for AIDS Research, Birmingham, Alabama.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Anemia/chemically induced', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zalcitabine/pharmacology', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1990 Dec;38(6):797-804.,0026-895X (Print) 0026-895X (Linking),,,"['AI25784/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-42125/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

This work was conducted in order to investigate whether alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) could be a substrate for E-24.11, its degradation leading to the negative alpha-MSH radiobinding assay results observed with some CALLA-positive cell lines. We used 3 human melanoma cell lines (GLL-19, Mel Juso and G361) which lack receptors to alpha-MSH and express CALLA, and, as a control, one CALLA-negative melanoma cell line (HBL) with specific receptors for alpha-MSH. Radioimmunoassays give evidence that alpha-MSH was degraded in the presence of the 4 melanoma cell lines and that disappearance of the peptide was significantly reduced by phosphoramidon in 2 lines (GLL-19 and G361). Upon incubation of alpha-MSH with GLL-19 and G361 cell membranes, 3 degradation products were completely abolished in the presence of phosphoramidon. Amino acid content analysis of alpha-MSH fragments produced by purified E-24.11 permitted identification of 6 peptide bonds in the sequence of alpha-MSH susceptible to cleavage by the enzyme. It is concluded that alpha-MSH is a substrate in vitro for purified E-24.11 and for the enzyme present on the human melanoma cell lines GLL-19 and G361, expressing a high level of endopeptidase activity. However, hydrolysis of alpha-MSH by this enzyme does not seem to represent the main factor responsible for the apparent absence of receptors for the hormone on some cell lines.","['Deschodt-Lanckman, M', 'Vanneste, Y', 'Loir, B', 'Michel, A', 'Libert, A', 'Ghanem, G', 'Lejeune, F']","['Deschodt-Lanckman M', 'Vanneste Y', 'Loir B', 'Michel A', 'Libert A', 'Ghanem G', 'Lejeune F']","['Laboratoire Pluridisciplinaire de Recherche Experimentale Biomedicale, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '581-05-5 (alpha-MSH)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neprilysin/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-MSH/analysis/*metabolism']",,1990/12/15 00:00,1990/12/15 00:01,['1990/12/15 00:00'],"['1990/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 Dec 15;46(6):1124-30. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910460629.,0020-7136 (Print) 0020-7136 (Linking),['10.1002/ijc.2910460629 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Virus particles, metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose, were harvested from the culture supernatants and lysed with detergents. The viral envelope glycoprotein was isolated from the lysates by immunoaffinity chromatography and purified by preparative SDS/PAGE. Oligosaccharides were liberated by sequential treatment of tryptic glycopeptides with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F and fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Individual glycans were characterized chromatographically, by methylation analyses and in part, by enzymic microsequencing. The results demonstrated that viral glycoproteins, synthesized in mouse embryo fibroblasts, carried as major constituents partially fucosylated diantennary, 2,4- and 2,6-branched triantennary and tetraantennary complex type N-glycans with 0-4 sialic acid residues and only small amounts of high-mannose type species with 5-9 mannose residues. As a characteristic feature, part of the complex type glycans contained additional Gal(alpha 1-3) substituents. Glycoprotein obtained from virions propagated on mink lung cells, contained partially fucosylated diantennary and 2,4-branched triantennary oligosaccharides with 1-3 sialic acid residues, in addition to trace amounts of high-mannose type species with 8 or 9 mannose residues. Thus, the results reveal that predominantly, the complex type N-glycans of the retroviral envelope glycoprotein display cell-specific variations including differences in oligosaccharide branching, sialylation and substitution by additional Gal(alpha 1-3) residues.","['Geyer, H', 'Kempf, R', 'Schott, H H', 'Geyer, R']","['Geyer H', 'Kempf R', 'Schott HH', 'Geyer R']","['Biochemisches Institut, Justus-Liebig-Universitat Giessen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.96 (Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Animals', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, Viral', 'Glycopeptides/isolation & purification', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligosaccharides/*isolation & purification', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification']",,1990/11/13 00:00,1990/11/13 00:01,['1990/11/13 00:00'],"['1990/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1990 Nov 13;193(3):855-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19409.x.,0014-2956 (Print) 0014-2956 (Linking),['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19409.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

In the present study we show that FLAP is present in a variety of cells known to produce leukotrienes, but is absent from a number of cells which do not synthesize leukotrienes. Furthermore, differentiation of the human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line towards granulocytic cells following exposure to dimethylsulfoxide is associated with the concurrent induction of both FLAP and 5-lipoxygenase and an increased capacity to synthesize leukotrienes. Cellular leukotriene synthesis in this system is functionally dependent on FLAP as shown by its inhibition by the leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886, a compound which specifically binds to FLAP.","['Reid, G K', 'Kargman, S', 'Vickers, P J', 'Mancini, J A', 'Leveille, C', 'Ethier, D', 'Miller, D K', 'Gillard, J W', 'Dixon, R A', 'Evans, J F']","['Reid GK', 'Kargman S', 'Vickers PJ', 'Mancini JA', 'Leveille C', 'Ethier D', 'Miller DK', 'Gillard JW', 'Dixon RA', 'Evans JF']","['Department of Pharmacology, Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research, Pointe Claire-Dorval, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (ALOX5AP protein, human)', '0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Alox5ap protein, mouse)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SRS-A)', '130007-52-2 (L 669083)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins', 'Affinity Labels', 'Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*genetics/physiology', 'Azides', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Leukotriene B4/*biosynthesis', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Photochemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'SRS-A/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Nov 15;265(32):19818-23.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(17)45446-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

There were highly significant improvements (P less than 0.001 for trend) in survival for many major diagnostic groups. Between 1971-73 and 1983-85 the actuarial 5-year survival rates increased from 37% to 70% for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, from 4% to 26% for acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia, from 76% to 88% for Hodgkin's disease, from 22% to 70% for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, from 61% to 72% for astrocytoma, from 24% to 42% for medulloblastoma, from 15% to 43% for neuroblastoma, from 58% to 79% for Wilms' tumour, from 17% to 54% for osteosarcoma, from 26% to 61% for rhabdomyosarcoma, from 59% to 94% for malignant testicular germ-cell tumours and from 43% to 77% for malignant ovarian germ-cell tumours. These increases in population-based survival rates reflect the substantial advances in treatment of a wide range of childhood cancers since 1970. The two principal diagnostic groups for which there was no evidence of any trend were retinoblastoma, which already had an excellent prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of over 85%, and Ewing's sarcoma, for which the survival rate remained below 45%.","['Stiller, C A', 'Bunch, K J']","['Stiller CA', 'Bunch KJ']","['University of Oxford, Department of Paediatrics, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/epidemiology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Nov;62(5):806-15. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.383.,0007-0920 (Print) 0007-0920 (Linking),['10.1038/bjc.1990.383 [doi]'],PMC1971530,,,,,,,

EGF-receptor biochemistry appears altered in the K562 transfectants. Autophosphorylation of the K562 receptor is not stimulated substantially by EGF. Tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor is high in the absence of EGF, whereas receptor affinity for EGF is low. K562 cells are shown to lack mRNA for transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha). Therefore autocrine stimulation of the K562 receptor, at least by TGF alpha, does not explain the observed receptor biochemistry. The K562 receptor is phosphorylated at a single major site in intact cells, a threonine residue that may be Thr-669.

Evidence that the guanine nucleotide acts by relieving phospholipase C from an inhibitory constraint.",743-8,"Myeloid differentiated human leukaemia (HL-60) cells contain a soluble phospholipase C that hydrolysed phosphatidylinositol 4.5-bisphosphate and was markedly stimulated by the metabolically stable GTP analogue guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]). Half-maximal and maximal (up to 5-fold) stimulation of inositol phosphate formation by GTP[S] occurred at 1.5 microM and 30 microM respectively. Other nucleotides (GTP, GDP, GMP, guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate. ATP, adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, UTP) did not affect phospholipase C activity, GTP[S] stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation was inhibited by excess GDP, but not by ADP. The effect of GTP[S] on inositol phosphate formation was absolutely dependent on and markedly stimulated by free Ca2+ (median effective concn. approximately 100 nM). Analysis of inositol phosphates by anion-exchange chromatography revealed InsP3 as the major product of GTP[S]-stimulated phospholipase C activity. In the absence of GTP[S], specific phospholipase C activity was markedly decreased when tested at high protein concentrations, whereas GTP[S] stimulation of the enzyme was markedly enhanced under these conditions. As both basal and GTP[S]-stimulated inositol phosphate formation were linear with time whether studied at low or high protein concentration, these results suggest that (a) phospholipase C is under an inhibitory constraint and (b) GTP[S] relieves this inhibition, most likely by activating a soluble GTP-binding protein.","['Camps, M', 'Hou, C F', 'Jakobs, K H', 'Gierschik, P']","['Camps M', 'Hou CF', 'Jakobs KH', 'Gierschik P']","['Pharmakologisches Institut, Universitat Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '005990WHZZ (Deoxycholic Acid)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Cytosol/enzymology/metabolism', 'Deoxycholic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocytes/enzymology/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/*pharmacology"", 'Guanosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis/drug effects', 'Inositol Phosphates/biosynthesis/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate', 'Phosphatidylinositols/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Phospholipids/blood', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors/blood']",,1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1990 Nov 1;271(3):743-8. doi: 10.1042/bj2710743.,0264-6021 (Print) 0264-6021 (Linking),['10.1042/bj2710743 [doi]'],PMC1149625,,,,,,,

Since these studies have been done exclusively by Northern and dot blot analysis and frequently with mixed populations of cells, quantitative changes in gene expression for particular populations of cells are difficult to assess. We therefore examined MPO expression at the cellular level in various normal and malignant hematopoietic cells by the in situ hybridization (ISH) technique. Using this approach, we demonstrated that inducing the promyelocytic HL-60 cell line to differentiate along either monocytic or granulocytic pathways decreases MPO mRNA expression. Similarly, when ISH was performed on normal bone marrow, relatively high levels of MPO mRNA were detected in myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and early eosinophilic precursors, whereas the expression was markedly decreased in more advanced stages of myeloid differentiation. These findings agree with the known decrease in MPO protein synthesis observed during granulocytic differentiation and suggest that regulation of MPO protein synthesis occurs at the level of MPO mRNA expression. We conclude by showing that ISH can detect MPO mRNA in myeloblasts of patients with acute leukemia and can be a potentially useful technique in the study of myeloid differentiation in acute leukemias.","['Zaki, S R', 'Austin, G E', 'Swan, D C', 'Hooper, W C', 'Greer, P W', 'Evatt, B L', 'Chan, W C']","['Zaki SR', 'Austin GE', 'Swan DC', 'Hooper WC', 'Greer PW', 'Evatt BL', 'Chan WC']","['Division of Immunologic, Oncologic, and Hematologic Diseases, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia 30333.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoradiography', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Peroxidase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Dec;4(12):813-8.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Complete remission is obtained by inducing terminal granulocytic differentiation of the leukemic cells. To elucidate whether the effect of retinoic acid on the differentiation of M3 leukemic cells was related to any specific characteristics of its receptor, we analyzed the structure and expression of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) genes in 16 M3 patients. Abnormal RAR alpha transcripts were detected in 13 cases. In nine patients, the genomic DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting and evidence for a rearranged RAR alpha gene was found generated in four cases. Normal RAR transcripts and germline restriction fragments were found in samples from normal or other leukemic cells, suggesting that this alteration of the RAR alpha gene is specifically seen in M3 leukemias. These results suggest that alteration of the retinoic acid receptor alpha may be implicated in M3 leukemogenesis.","['Chomienne, C', 'Ballerini, P', 'Balitrand, N', 'Huang, M E', 'Krawice, I', 'Castaigne, S', 'Fenaux, P', 'Tiollais, P', 'Dejean, A', 'Degos, L']","['Chomienne C', 'Ballerini P', 'Balitrand N', 'Huang ME', 'Krawice I', 'Castaigne S', 'Fenaux P', 'Tiollais P', 'Dejean A', 'Degos L', 'et al.']","['Service de Medecine Nucleaire, Unite Inserm 204, Hopital Saint Louis, Universite Paris VII, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Drug Tolerance/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Dec;4(12):802-7.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Transthyretin is expressed predominantly in the liver and choroid plexus in adult mice, and TTR upstream regulatory elements were previously shown to potentiate transcription in liver-derived cells. The effects of inserting the TTR distal enhancer and/or promoter-proximal sequences into an M-MuLV LTR lacking its enhancers were measured in three ways. (i) Chimeric LTRs were fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and tested for transient gene expression by transfection into liver-derived cells or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. (ii) Infectious M-MuLV containing an altered LTR [delta Mo + TTR(PD) MuLV) was generated, and infectivity in culture on hepatocyte lines and NIH 3T3 cells was tested. (iii) Infection of delta Mo + TTR(PD) MuLV in vivo was tested by inoculating NFS/N mice and performing in situ hybridization of whole animal sections. Chimeric LTR-cat constructs showed higher levels of cat gene expression in liver-derived cell lines than in NIH 3T3 cells, indicating increased LTR activity in these cells. However, in vitro infection did not show significantly higher infectivity in hepatocytes for delta Mo + TTR(PD) M-MuLV than did wild-type M-MuLV. In vivo, delta Mo + TTR(PD) MuLV showed expression in the same tissues as with wild-type M-MuLV-inoculated mice, i.e., lymphoid organs and the intestines and, additionally, two novel sites not seen in wild-type M-MuLV-inoculated animals. Of 10 mice, 8 showed viral expression in the brain and 3 showed expression in the liver. Thus, insertion of TTR elements into the M-MuLV LTR altered LTR activity both in vitro and in vivo.","['Feuer, G', 'Fan, H']","['Feuer G', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Prealbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Prealbumin/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Dec;64(12):6130-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.12.6130-6140.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.12.6130-6140.1990 [doi]'],PMC248787,"['CA32454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM07134/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The proportion of K562 cells taking up stain gradually decreased to about 10% of those present by about 13 days postinfection; during this time, virus yield per day measured by either plaque or hemagglutination titration fell about 10-fold. The decrease in percent staining was followed by waves of increased staining accompanied by increased virus production. Virus-producing cultures were maintained for over 3 months. Evolution of both virus and cells accompanied establishment of persistence in that plaque size changed from about 7 mm in diameter for the original virus to less than 1.5 mm by day 20 postinfection and most of the cells cloned from persistently infected cultures were resistant to superinfection with the original virus.

A filter-based dot blot assay was developed to monitor specific 125I-TNF alpha binding during fractionation of the cell extract. By a combination of immuno- and ligand affinity chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography both receptor proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed two bands at 55 and 51 kDa for the 55-kDa TNF receptor and a major 75-kDa and a minor 65-kDa band for the 75-kDa TNF receptor. All these bands specifically bound TNF alpha and TNF beta in ligand blot experiments. The exclusive specificity of monoclonal antibodies of the utr series for the 75.65-kDa bands and of the htr series for the 55.51-kDa bands was demonstrated with the purified antigens on Western blots. Both TNF receptor types were found to contain N-linked carbohydrates. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the 55- and 51-kDa bands of the 55-kDa TNF receptor revealed identical sequences suggesting a possible truncation at the C-terminal end. Two different N-terminal sequences were determined for the 65-kDa band. One corresponded to the published sequence of ubiquitin; the other was therefore assumed to be a unique sequence of the 75-kDa TNF receptor.

The HL-60 promyelocytic/myeloblastic cell line and the promonocytic line, U937, were susceptible to productive infection by monocytotropic HIV-1 isolates (HIV-1JR-FL and HTLV-IIIBa-L) after treatment with retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, dibutyryl cAMP, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Virus production was only detected when these compounds were added before virus infection. Virus replication did not correlate with CD4 receptor expression because undifferentiated HL-60 cells express CD4 and the level of CD4 expression did not increase after differentiation in the presence of retinoic acid, 1,25(OH)2D3, or TPA. A mature monocytic cell line (THP-1) was capable of infection without pretreatment, and treatment with differentiating agents enhanced virus production. A chronically infected cell line (J-HL-60) was isolated after HIV-1JR-FL infection of HL-60 cells treated with retinoic acid. Virus production in this cell line was enhanced more than 10-fold after differentiation in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA. The majority of virus production by 1,25(OH)2D3-treated J-HL-60 cells was associated with the mature, adherent population. Molecular analysis of a cloned line of J-HL-60 showed integration of a single DNA provirus. These results suggest that cellular factors associated with precursor cell differentiation along the myelomonocytic pathway are required for optimal replication of monocytotropic HIV-1 strains in vitro.","['Kitano, K', 'Baldwin, G C', 'Raines, M A', 'Golde, D W']","['Kitano K', 'Baldwin GC', 'Raines MA', 'Golde DW']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/*pharmacology', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'HIV Infections/complications', '*HIV-1/genetics/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*microbiology/pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Virus Replication/drug effects/physiology']",,1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Nov 15;76(10):1980-8.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)82106-5 [pii]'],,"['CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL42107/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['Blood 1991 Apr 1;77(7):1624'],,,,

This entity is also observed in nontropical areas endemic for HTLV-I, including Japan, South America, and the southern United States. Viruses of the HTLV family are being associated increasingly with pathology in humans. The pathogenesis of HTLV-I-associated tropical spastic paraparesis remains to be understood. However, future research is expected to favor a multidisciplinary approach, with exciting potential insights derived from the fields of neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases.

Independently, adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF) was purified from human T-lymphotropic virus I-infected leukemic T-cell line (ATL-2) and reported as an interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor-inducing factor. We have previously reported the same molecular mass, pI, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence for both 3B6-derived IL-1 and ADF. cDNA cloning of ADF demonstrated high homology with the prokaryotic disulfide reducing enzyme thioredoxin. We show here that ADF and 3B6-derived IL-1 are identical. By RNA blot, 3B6 and ATL-2 cells were shown to contain high levels of 0.6-kilobase mRNA corresponding to ADF. Such message was not detected in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes but could be weakly induced by lymphocyte activation. Antibodies have been raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH2 terminus and the COOH terminus of ADF. Immunoblotting and sequential immunoprecipitation with these antibodies revealed the same 13-kDa protein in 3B6 and ATL-2 cells. Recombinant ADF could sustain growth of 3B6 and ATL-2 cells at low cellular concentration without fetal calf serum; ADF, thus, appears involved in their autocrine growth. Similarly, recombinant ADF could enhance growth of other B-cell lines, including the Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt lymphoma line BL41 and the lymphoblastoid cell lines CRAG8, CRB95, and 1G8. Finally, recombinant ADF exhibits marked synergism with other cytokines, such as IL-1 and IL-2, allowing virally infected lymphocytes to respond to suboptimal amounts of a variety of growth factors.","['Wakasugi, N', 'Tagaya, Y', 'Wakasugi, H', 'Mitsui, A', 'Maeda, M', 'Yodoi, J', 'Tursz, T']","['Wakasugi N', 'Tagaya Y', 'Wakasugi H', 'Mitsui A', 'Maeda M', 'Yodoi J', 'Tursz T']","[""Laboratoire d'Immuno-Biologie Cellulaire, UA1156 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Cytokines', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Growth Substances/*genetics', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Nov;87(21):8282-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.21.8282.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),['10.1073/pnas.87.21.8282 [doi]'],PMC54939,,,,,,,

In mice bearing the resistant tumor, a maximally tolerated dose of camptothecin produced no net reduction in tumor cell burden, in contrast to a 5-log cell kill in the parental P388 (P388/S). The IC50 of camptothecin, as determined by colony formation assays of cultured cells, was 8 times greater for the cloned P388/CPT cell line than for P388/S. P388/CPT cells were not cross-resistant to other antineoplastic agents, including topoisomerase II inhibitors. The type I topoisomerases purified from P388/CPT and P388/S cells were identical with respect to molecular weight, specific activity, in vitro camptothecin sensitivity, and DNA cleavage specificity. Camptothecin induced fewer protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks in the resistant cells than in the wild-type P388 cells. Topoisomerase I mRNA, immunoreactivity, and extractable enzymatic activity were 2-4 times lower for P388/CPT cells than for P388/S cells. As resistance to camptothecin developed, topoisomerase I extractable activity decreased, concomitant with an increase in topoisomerase II extractable activity. Furthermore, the appearance of camptothecin resistance was associated with specific rearrangements of the topoisomerase I gene. These results suggest that development of resistance to inhibitors of topoisomerase I can occur by down-regulation of the target enzyme, thus reducing the production of lethal enzyme-mediated DNA damage. The enhanced topoisomerase II activity in these cells suggests that resistance to camptothecin may be overcome by co-treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors.","['Eng, W K', 'McCabe, F L', 'Tan, K B', 'Mattern, M R', 'Hofmann, G A', 'Woessner, R D', 'Hertzberg, R P', 'Johnson, R K']","['Eng WK', 'McCabe FL', 'Tan KB', 'Mattern MR', 'Hofmann GA', 'Woessner RD', 'Hertzberg RP', 'Johnson RK']","['Department of Biomolecular Discovery, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Leukemia P388/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1990 Oct;38(4):471-80.,0026-895X (Print) 0026-895X (Linking),,,['CA40884-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

All three patients whose blast cells showed variations in gene rearrangement patterns between diagnosis and relapase also demonstrated a change in the immunophenotype: one from cALLA+ to cALLA- B precursor cell ALL; one from T-ALL to AML; and one showed a marked increase in myeloid characteristics at relapse. Blast cells from these three patients at relapse showed the presence of chromosomal translocations involving 11q23; for two patients, this involved replacement of the original karyotype. We conclude that while most relapses are the result of reemergence of the original clone, new clones that differ in immunophenotype, karyotype, and gene rearrangement are occasionally present at relapse.

The temporal localization of cellular targets for virus replication and the genesis of ultrastructural spongiform changes in the central nervous system (CNS) of CFW/D mice inoculated at birth with neurovirulent ts1 MoMuLV and nonneurovirulent wild type (wt) MoMuLV were studied comparatively by transmission electron microscopy. Cellular targets for both ts1 and wt MoMuLV infection were sequentially (a) splenic megakaryocytes, (b) CNS intravascular platelets and capillary endothelia, and (c) resident CNS pericytes and microglia. When compared with wt MoMuLV-infected mice, ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice had amplified localization of virus to microglia with disease progression that paralleled the development of spongiform changes both temporally and spatially. Virus infection of neurons was never observed. Spongiform lesions originated from the dilated cytocavitary system of proximal neuronal processes (predominantly dendrites) and from vacuolated myelin sheaths of distal axons. As the disease progressed, the severity of the spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice increased rapidly and was associated with increased number of virions and virus-infected cells. Lesions in wt MoMuLV-infected mice were not severe and regressed terminally with apparent clearance of virus from the CNS. These studies indicated that murine retroviral-induced spongiform lesions originated from both neuronal and oligodendroglial degeneration; splenic megakaryocytes, platelets, and cell-free viremia contributed to systemic dissemination of virus to the CNS; microglia were the major cell target and reservoir for virus infection in the CNS; and the neurovirulence of ts1 MoMuLV occurred by enhanced replication rather than by a fundamental change in cellular tropism. The identification of microglia as the major CNS cell target for virus infection and the absence of productive virus infection of neurons suggested an indirect mechanism for murine retroviral-induced neuronal dysfunction.","['Baszler, T V', 'Zachary, J F']","['Baszler TV', 'Zachary JF']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,IM,"['Animals', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*microbiology/pathology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*growth & development/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mutation', '*Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroglia/*microbiology', 'Spleen/microbiology/ultrastructure', '*Virus Replication']",,1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 1990 Nov;63(5):612-23.,0023-6837 (Print) 0023-6837 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Anesthesia by rapid intraperitoneal injection of Saffan was sufficient for magnetic resonance imaging and could be repeated at appropriate intervals. Eleven frontal magnetic resonance images through the abdomen with a center-to-center distance of 1.5 mm between adjacent slices were acquired simultaneously. To optimally demarcate spleens from the surrounding tissues, the magnetic resonance images were mildly T2-weighted for mice infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus and mildly T1-weighted for those infected with Friend and Rauscher virus. Measurements requiring only 3 to 4 hours in groups of 24 to 28 mice were accomplished by using a standardized holder (i) accommodating two animals in the supine position and (ii) ensuring reproducible positioning in the magnetic resonance-instrument, and (iii) by reducing the number of phase-encoding steps of mildly T2-weighted magnetic resonance images from 256 to 128. Volumes of spleens and inguinal lymph nodes were calculated from the respective cross-sectional areas. The weights and magnetic resonance image-derived volumes of spleens and inguinal lymph nodes correlated well (r greater than 0.95). Despite large variations in the extent of splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy at any given time, the progression of the disease could easily be followed by repeating magnetic resonance imaging at intervals. Thus, statistically relevant results can be obtained in an infection model requiring the use of only a few animals.","['Allegrini, P R', 'Wachsmuth, E D']","['Allegrini PR', 'Wachsmuth ED']","['Physics Department, CIBA GEIGY Limited, Basle, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,['8067-82-1 (Alfaxalone Alfadolone Mixture)'],IM,"['Alfaxalone Alfadolone Mixture/pharmacology', 'Anesthesia', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematocrit', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*diagnosis', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rauscher Virus', 'Spleen/pathology']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 1990 Oct;63(4):568-75.,0023-6837 (Print) 0023-6837 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

It is known that cervical cancer is extraordinarily rare in non-human mammals that have the estrous cycle. In contrast, cervical cancer is frequent in human beings which have lost the estrous cycle, and subsequently evolved a sexual behavior irrespective of the menstrual phase. Therefore, upon the hypothesis that the estrous cycle is a period protected from a sexually transmitted disease, we studied the status of local defence mechanism and growth/differentiation of normal cervical epithelium during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Then, the influence of HPV-infection on the growth and differentiation of cervical epithelium was analyzed. As a local immune system of the cervix, both IgA and IgG are secreted in the cervical mucus, and the levels in the follicular phase were significantly higher than those during the luteal phase and pregnancy. An existence of local defence mechanism in the follicular phase is suggested. Analysis of a cell proliferation antigen Ki-67 in normal cervix revealed that parabasal cells enter the cell cycle more frequently in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. Basal and reserve cells are usually resting, but a few cells enter the cell cycle during the luteal phase and during pregnancy. Since cycling cells are more susceptible to viral infection, the basal and/or reserve cells during the luteal phase and pregnancy are suggested to be under the risk for HPV infection. As factors regulating growth and differentiation of cervical squamous epithelium, immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-erbB-2 protein, adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF), and HPV DNA was examined. In normal cervix, basal cells were usually ER-positive and PR-negative. Parabasal cells were ER-positive and PR-negative in the follicular phase, while they were ER-negative and PR-positive during the luteal phase and pregnancy. Considering the results of Ki-67 expression, the ER-negative and PR-positive status is possibly related to the proliferation of the cervical squamous epithelium. In cervical condylomas, basal cells infected by HPV6/11 were ER-positive, but HPV16/18-infected cells were ER-negative. Neoplastic cells of CINs and invasive squamous carcinomas containing HPV DNA 16/18 were ER-negative, while those containing HPV DNA 31/33/35 were weakly ER-positive. PR was positive in 2 of 2 condylomas, 18 of 26 CINs, and 13 of 22 invasive carcinomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Konishi, I']",['Konishi I'],"['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai zasshi,7505749,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cervix Uteri/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Epithelium/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Menstrual Cycle', 'Middle Aged', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology/physiopathology']",6,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai Zasshi. 1990 Aug;42(8):812-22.,0300-9165 (Print) 0300-9165 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

High titers of specific human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I antibodies were detected in the serum. Molecular analysis of DNA extracted from the skin tumor biopsy specimen showed a clonal integration of an HTLV-I provirus and a T-cell clonal population as demonstrated by T-cell receptor beta and gamma gene rearrangement studies. Neither HTLV-I provirus nor T-cell receptor rearrangements were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells DNA despite the presence of rare adult T cell leukemia cells (less than 1%) and a small excess of DR-expressing cells, and detection of HTLV-I Pol and Px sequences by in vitro gene amplification.

Separation from diacylglycerol kinase activity.,18803-8,"This laboratory first provided evidence for a potential signal transduction pathway involving sphingomyelin and its derivatives (Kolesnick, R.N., and Clegg, S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6534-6537). Recently, this laboratory demonstrated the existence of the novel sphingolipid ceramide 1-phosphate in human leukemia (HL-60) cells. Ceramide 1-phosphate was synthesized from ceramide derived from sphingomyelin but not glycosphingolipids. This suggested that a specific pathway extended from sphingomyelin to ceramide 1-phosphate. The present studies provide additional support for this notion by demonstrating the existence of a ceramide kinase activity distinct from diacylglycerol (DG) kinase in HL-60 cells. Microsomal membranes contained a kinase activity that phosphorylated ceramide but not 1,2-DG in the presence of physiologic and higher Ca2+ concentrations (60 nM-3 mM). Kinetic analyses demonstrated an apparent Vmax for ceramide and ATP of 70 pmol.min-1.mg protein-1; apparent Km values were 45 and 25 microM, respectively. The pH optimum was within the physiologic range (pH 6-8). Magnesium but not other divalent cations (Mn2+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Zn2+) also stimulated ceramide phosphorylation. Magnesium also induced 1,2-DG phosphorylation. Since DG kinase is a Mg2(+)-stimulable enzyme that may utilize ceramide as substrate, additional studies separated calcium-dependent ceramide kinase from DG kinase activity. 1,2-DGs competitively inhibited magnesium- but not calcium-dependent ceramide phosphorylation. Hence, calcium-dependent ceramide kinase activity neither utilized DG as substrate nor was inhibited by DG. These activities were physically separable. Both activities were solubilized by n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and stabilized by glycerol. Ceramide kinase activity bound weakly to a DEAE-cellulose anion exchange column and eluted with 4-fold purification as a single peak of activity in the flow-through and 0.05 M NaCl elutions. In contrast, the majority of DG kinase activity bound more tightly and was recovered as a broad peak in the 0.2-0.35 M NaCl elutions. These studies demonstrate the existence of a ceramide kinase activity in HL-60 cells which is functionally and physically separable from DG kinase. These studies provide further support for the notion of a specific pathway from sphingomyelin to ceramide 1-phosphate.","['Kolesnick, R N', 'Hemer, M R']","['Kolesnick RN', 'Hemer MR']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Diglycerides)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (Diacylglycerol Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.138 (ceramide kinase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Diacylglycerol Kinase', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/*enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)']",,1990/11/05 00:00,1990/11/05 00:01,['1990/11/05 00:00'],"['1990/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Nov 5;265(31):18803-8.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(17)30584-7 [pii]'],,['R01-CA-42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Both viruses have been sequenced and subjected to intense molecular biologic scrutiny, and in both cases genes believed to be important in lymphocyte immortalization have been identified. These viral genes are not homologues of cellular oncogenes, nor is there any evidence to suggest insertional mutagenesis. Rather, these genes alter the expression of a variety of cellular genes and, in so doing, alter the growth characteristics of the host cell. Infection with either virus is most likely to be asymptomatic, associated with a benign self-limited lymphoproliferation, or both, but in a small fraction of instances these benign lymphoproliferations give rise to a lymphoma or leukemia. In the case of the Epstein-Barr virus, a variety of cofactors have been identified that are important to the evolution of malignancy. These cofactors include immunosuppression in transplant recipients, cogenital immunodeficiency in the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus infection in AIDS patients, and malaria in patients with endemic Burkitt's lymphoma. In the case of HTLV-1, cofactors have not been identified. Nonetheless, the importance of cofactors is suggested by the small fraction of the population infected by the virus who actually develop lymphoproliferative disease, and the long latency period between infection and the development of frank lymphoproliferative disease. In organ transplant recipients with lymphomas associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the EBV immortalizing/transforming genes are expressed in the malignant tissue. But in Burkitt's lymphoma and in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, the EBV and HTLV-1 immortalizing/transforming genes are not detectably expressed. In Burkitt's lymphoma, it is suggested that the dysregulated myc gene renders the growth effects of Epstein-Barr virus latency genes superfluous. No comparable proto-oncogene translocation or activation has yet been identified in HTLV-1 lymphoma/leukemia.","['Ambinder, R F']",['Ambinder RF'],"['Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*microbiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",49,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1990 Aug;4(4):821-33.,0889-8588 (Print) 0889-8588 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

In these subclones, the ability of one clone to produce IL-2 correlated well with that to produce IFN-gamma. Three C5B2 subclones: clone no. 28, a high IL-2 producer, clone no. 61, an intermediate IL-2 producer, and clone no. 40, a non-producer, were selected and examined for differences in signal transduction mechanisms. Since the three subclones were shown to express about the same number of IL-1 binding sites with similar affinities, the loss of ability to produce IL-2 was not due to decreased cell-surface receptor or changes in receptor property. In support of this, IL-1 induced expression of the IL-2 receptor (Tac/p55 antigen) to the same extent on the three subclones. The levels of conventional intracellular second messengers were compared and it was revealed that loss of responsiveness was closely related to the subclones' degree of (poly)phosphoinositide (PI) turnover, protein kinase C (PKC) activation and cyclic AMP formation in response to PHA. Moreover, resting intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations were found to be increased in subclones with attenuated IL-2 production. These results indicate that the variation of IL-1-induced production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in this T-cell line is attributed to the difference in the PHA-mediated signal transduction pathway and, presumably, to the different regulation of intracellular cyclic AMP.","['Yagisawa, H', 'Kasahara, T', 'Mukaida, N', 'Yamashita, K', 'Shioiri-Nakano, K']","['Yagisawa H', 'Kasahara T', 'Mukaida N', 'Yamashita K', 'Shioiri-Nakano K']","['Department of Medical Biology and Parasitology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-1/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1990 Oct;71(2):242-50.,0019-2805 (Print) 0019-2805 (Linking),,PMC1384311,,,,,,,

Experimental findings indicate that PDGF is involved in development and/or maintenance of physiological functions of certain normal blood cells. Also, PDGF synthesis correlates with certain blood cell proliferative diseases caused either spontaneously or associated with viral infection. There is increasing evidence that the diverse effects of PDGF in both normal and abnormal physiological functions of blood cells may be regulated at the level of its receptor. New experimental findings are discussed relating to PDGF receptors in normal leukemic, and virally-infected human cells of myeloid and lymphocytic lineages. At specific developmental stages this regulation may take the form of PDGF and its receptor being expressed or co-expressed; the unmodified or modified form of receptor that specifically interacts with PDGF; the cellular site at which the PDGF-receptor interacts with its ligand; and co-expression of the PDGF-receptor with other receptors associated with specific cell lineage or functions. Elucidation of events involved in synthesis, processing, and interactions of PDGF isoforms and their respective receptors will enable us to develop pharmacological means that may either interfere with, or enhance these desired blood cell functions.

HL-60 is the parent line that will terminally differentiate; 1E3 is a derived line that will not terminally differentiate.

There was a 2- to 3-fold decline in topoisomerase II activity within the nuclear extracts from phorbol-treated HL-60 cells but not from phorbol-treated 1E3 cells. Immunoblotting experiments with anti-topoisomerase II antibodies indicated that phorbol treatment produced a structural change in the immunoreactive topiosomerase II in HL-60 nuclear extracts but produced no change in 1E3 topoisomerase II. Phorbol ester treatment also produced a decline in the level of topoisomerase II gene expression in HL-60 but not in 1E3 cells. By contrast, the cytotoxicity of etoposide in both lines was decreased following phorbol treatment.

M-BCR was rearranged and chromosome in situ hybridization showed an ABL insertion between 5' and 3' M-BCR on an apparently normal chromosome 22. The association of 5' BCR and 3' ABL at the 5' junction of the chromosome 9 insert was typical of that found for the BCR-ABL fusion gene in other patients with the standard t(9;22) and CML. With an M-bcr-3' probe, we cloned and characterized a 3' junction fragment. Field inversion gel electrophoresis and chromosome in situ hybridization studies using a probe isolated from genomic DNA 5' of the junction showed that 3' M-BCR was joined to a region of chromosome 9q34 rich in repetitive sequences and lying some distance 3' of ABL. The chromosome 9 insert was at least 329 kilobases long and included 3' ABL and a larger portion of chromosome 9q34. Our results allowed us to exclude transposon- or retroviral-mediated insertion of ABL into chromosome 22. Instead, we favored a two-translocation model in which a second translocation reconstituted a standard t(9;22)(q34;q11) but left the chromosome 9 insert, including 3' ABL, in chromosome 22.","['Morris, C M', 'Heisterkamp, N', 'Kennedy, M A', 'Fitzgerald, P H', 'Groffen, J']","['Morris CM', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Kennedy MA', 'Fitzgerald PH', 'Groffen J']","[""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, CA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Chimera/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Nov 1;76(9):1812-8.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)83100-0 [pii]'],,"['CA47073/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,"['ABL', 'M-BCR']"

Conventional methods of diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) leukemia rely on the interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell morphology, which may produce ambiguous results in the presence of minimal leukemic involvement. A methodology has been developed for immunophenotyping small numbers of CSF cells while preserving cell morphology. CSF samples from 33 children with CD10 (common ALL antigen [CALLA]) positive ALL were examined at initial presentation using both conventional morphology and this combined immunohistopathologic technique. Six (18%) of the samples contained lymphoblasts or cells considered morphologically suspicious for leukemic involvement. Nine additional samples (27% of the total) had normal CSF morphology, but contained increased numbers of CALLA positive cells. Twelve of the 33 samples were also examined for the simultaneous presence of nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and demonstrated increased numbers of cells positive for both TdT and CD10.

Differences in the extent of HIV-1 replication in these animal cells can be observed. Replication is best in human cells, but occurs substantially in cells from many animal species including mink, horse, and bush wallaby. Virus production in murine and avian cells is very limited. These results confirm that the major block to HIV-1 infection of animal cells is at the cellular surface but that intracellular regulation of viral replication is also involved. Moreover, an enhancement of HIV-1 cytopathic effects can be seen in human cells co-infected by MuLV. All these data suggest phenotypically mixed viruses might be useful for developing an animal model system for studying AIDS, and that the pathological expression of HIV-1 could be modified by the presence in cells of other retroviruses.

Replication of HIV-1 and of other complex primate retroviruses, including human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), requires the expression in trans of a virally encoded post-transcriptional activator of viral structural gene expression termed Rev (HIV-1) or Rex (HTLV-I). We demonstrate that the previously defined L open reading frame of visna virus encodes a protein, here termed Rev-V, that is required for the cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced RNA that encodes the viral envelope protein. Transactivation by Rev-V was shown to require a cis-acting target sequence that coincides with a predicted RNA secondary structure located within the visna virus env gene. However, Rev-V was unable to function by using the structurally similar RNA target sequences previously defined for Rev or Rex and, therefore, displays a distinct sequence specificity. Remarkably, substitution of this visna virus target sequence in place of the HIV-1 Rev response element permitted the Rev-V protein to efficiently rescue the expression of HIV-1 structural proteins, including Gag, from a Rev- proviral clone. These results suggest that the post-transcriptional regulation of viral structural gene expression may be a characteristic feature of complex retroviruses.","['Tiley, L S', 'Brown, P H', 'Le, S Y', 'Maizel, J V', 'Clements, J E', 'Cullen, B R']","['Tiley LS', 'Brown PH', 'Le SY', 'Maizel JV', 'Clements JE', 'Cullen BR']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rev/*genetics', 'Gene Products, rex/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Nucleotide Mapping', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics', 'Visna-maedi virus/*genetics', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Oct;87(19):7497-501. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.19.7497.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),['10.1073/pnas.87.19.7497 [doi]'],PMC54774,,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1990 Dec;87(23):9508'],,,,['env']

Several nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), acting as ligand-inducible transcription factors, have been characterized and indirect evidence suggests that they have distinct roles. One of the most intriguing properties of retinoic acid is its ability to induce in vivo differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells into mature granulocytes, leading to morphological complete remissions. Because the RAR alpha gene maps to chromosome 17q21 (ref. 14), close to the t(15;17) (q21-q11-22) translocation specifically associated with APL, we analysed RAR alpha gene structure and expression in APL cells. We report here that, in one APL-derived cell line, the RAR alpha gene has been translocated to a locus, myl, on chromosome 15, resulting in the synthesis of a myl/RAR alpha fusion messenger RNA. Using two probes located on either side of the cloned breakpoint, we have found genomic rearrangements of one or other locus in six patients out of eight, demonstrating that the RAR alpha and/or myl genes are frequently rearranged in APL and the breakpoints are clustered. These findings strongly implicate retinoic acid receptor alpha in leukaemogenesis.","['de The, H', 'Chomienne, C', 'Lanotte, M', 'Degos, L', 'Dejean, A']","['de The H', 'Chomienne C', 'Lanotte M', 'Degos L', 'Dejean A']","['Unite de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique, INSERM U.163, CNRS URA 271, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA Probes', 'Exons', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,1990/10/11 00:00,1990/10/11 00:01,['1990/10/11 00:00'],"['1990/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1990 Oct 11;347(6293):558-61. doi: 10.1038/347558a0.,0028-0836 (Print) 0028-0836 (Linking),['10.1038/347558a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,['RAR&agr;']

First, only a small fraction of cells are infected in the peripheral blood and lymphatic tissue may serve as a reservoir for infection. Second, infected cells may harbor only a small number of copies of the viral sequences. Third, a latent infection marked by transcriptional dormancy is often established thereby obviating the use of proteins or RNA to detect the viruses. Fourth, closely related but distinct members of the onco-and lenti-virus families may complicate specific detection of a particular virus. An additional hurdle is viral heterogeneity. HIV variants, for example, have been identified within and among individuals harboring this virus. Accordingly, sensitive and specific detection of the human retroviruses seemingly requires specific amplification of viral DNA sequences prior to detection. In this regard, an in vitro DNA amplification procedure using DNA polymerase and termed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) initially applied to human genetic diseases has been successfully applied to human retroviruses. A PCR-based assay has demonstrated utility for detecting infection: (1) prior to the generation of detectable antibodies, (2) in individuals with ambiguous or indeterminate serological status, (3) for neonatal screening, (4) by a specific type or multiple viruses, and (5) in therapeutic trials to allow the monitoring of infected cell load and viremia. It is also unlikely that the viruses identified to date represent all of the retroviruses responsible for human disease.

Core proteins of HIV can be detected on the surface of follicular dendritic cells, electron microscopy reveals cell-free HIV and virus replication in the same location, and in situ hybridization shows that the majority of cells with mRNA of HIV can be found in germinal centers (GC). Double immunohistochemical labeling of lymphocyte populations suggests that one of the most important events in HIV lymphadenitis with explosive follicular hyperplasia is the accumulation of CD8+CD45R0+ lymphocytes in the lymph nodes.

We later showed that Gross Passage A retrovirus superinfection in mice resulted in decreased antibody production and diminished allograft rejection. We have studied in some detail the immunosuppression which occurs subsequent to infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) as characterized by profoundly depressed T and B lymphocyte responses and decreased production of gamma-interferon. Injection of staphylococcal protein A (SPA) corrected these deficient immune responses, cleared circulating FeLV from blood and produced a regression of FeLV-induced lymphomas and leukemias. The immunosuppressive properties of FeLV and certain other retroviruses have been linked to the transmembrane viral envelope peptide, p15E. Cianciolo et al synthesized a 17-amino acid viral component which shares sequence homology with a highly conserved region of p15E. In vitro analyses have shown that this synthetic retroviral peptide suppresses T and B cell functions, inhibits the generation of cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses and dramatically alters the morphology and distribution of monocytes. The latter finding, along with reports that cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage play a critical role in the initiation of human immunodeficiency infection, suggests that monocytes and macrophages may play a crucial role in retroviral infection and some of the associated immunodeficiencies associated with retroviral infection.","['Good, R A', 'Ogasawara, M', 'Liu, W T', 'Lorenz, E', 'Day, N K']","['Good RA', 'Ogasawara M', 'Liu WT', 'Lorenz E', 'Day NK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, All Children's Hospital, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Lymphology,Lymphology,0155112,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '99273-04-8 (CKS 17)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*microbiology', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*immunology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Peptides/*immunology', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",28,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lymphology. 1990 Jun;23(2):56-9.,0024-7766 (Print) 0024-7766 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

We report here that each of three CWD lymphomas produced infectious xenotropic murine leukemia virus related to Bxv-1. In Southern blot experiments, these proviruses hybridized to probes that were specific for the xenotropic envelope and Bxv-1 U3 region sequences. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a cloned CWD xenotropic provirus, CWM-S-5X, revealed that the envelope gene was closely related to but distinct from those of other known xenotropic viruses. In addition, the U3 region of CWM-S-5X contained a viral enhancer sequence that was identical to that found in MCF 247, a recombinant AKR virus that is thought to contain the Bxv-1 enhancer. Finally, restriction enzyme sites in the CWM-S-5X provirus were analogous to those reported within Bxv-1. These results establish that the virus progeny of Bxv-1 have the potential to donate pathogenic enhancer sequences to recombinant polytropic murine leukemia viruses.

MuSV-124 contains inactive murine leukemia virus env gene splice sites (termed 5' env and 3' env) as well as cryptic sites in the gag and v-mos genes (termed 5' gag and 3' mos) which are activated for thermosensitive splicing by a 1,487-base intronic deletion in the MuSV-124 derived MuSVts110 retrovirus. To determine conditions permissive for splice site activation, we examined MuSV-124 mutants deleted in the 1,919-base intron bounded by the 5' gag and 3' mos sites. Several of these deletions activated thermosensitive splicing either at the same sites used in MuSVts110 or in a previously unreported temperature-sensitive splice event between the 5' gag and 3' env sites. These data suggested that the thermosensitive splicing phenotype characteristic of MuSVts110 required neither a specialized intron nor selection of a particular 3' splice site. The 3' env and 3' mos sites were found to compete for splicing to the 5' gag site; the more upstream 3' env site was exclusively used in MuSV-124 mutants containing both sites, whereas selection of the 3' mos site required removal of the 3' env site. Branchpoint sequences were found to have a potential regulatory role in thermosensitive splicing. Insertion of a beta-globin branchpoint sequence in a splicing-inactive MuSV-124 mutant activated efficient nonthermosensitive splicing at the 3' mos site, whereas a mutated branchpoint activated less efficient but thermosensitive splicing.","['de Mars, M', 'Cizdziel, P E', 'Murphy, E C Jr']","['de Mars M', 'Cizdziel PE', 'Murphy EC Jr']","['Department of Tumor Biology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genes, env', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics', 'Temperature']",,1990/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Nov;64(11):5260-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.11.5260-5269.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.11.5260-5269.1990 [doi]'],PMC248562,"['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Cell culture and animal studies showed that one of these inserts was very resistant to infection and oncogenesis by subgroup A field strains of avian leukosis virus. Therefore, this represents a model system for introducing genes from the pathogen into the host to induce host resistance to the pathogen. Future studies should be aimed at developing more efficient systems for introducing replication-defective retroviral vectors or cloned DNA into the germ line of poultry so that the regulation of gene expression can be studied and transgenic technology can be applied to the improvement of this highly reproductive group of farm animals.","['Crittenden, L B', 'Salter, D W']","['Crittenden LB', 'Salter DW']","['US Department of Agriculture, Regional Poultry Research Laboratory, East Lansing, MI 48823.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Reprod Fertil Suppl,Journal of reproduction and fertility.

Loss of viraemia was accompanied by the increasing synthesis of virus-neutralizing antibodies. In spite of strong virus-neutralizing antibodies, virus was detected by the cocultivation assay in duck tissues throughout the observation period up to 5 years. In the viraemic phase of infection, we found integrated proviruses in various tissues, preferentially in stomach muscle tissue and in the thymus. The long-term persistence of virus was frequently accompanied by liver necrosis and neoplastic diseases. Injection of td PR-C virus into early embryos resulted in more pronounced infection accompanied by an increased copy number of viral DNA per cell, high mortality and remarkable atrophy of thymus tissue in infected ducklings.","['Nehyba, J', 'Svoboda, J', 'Karakoz, I', 'Geryk, J', 'Hejnar, J']","['Nehyba J', 'Svoboda J', 'Karakoz I', 'Geryk J', 'Hejnar J']","['Department of Cellular and Viral Genetics, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Prague.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Ducks/*microbiology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Viremia/physiopathology']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1990 Sep;71 ( Pt 9):1937-45. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-71-9-1937.,0022-1317 (Print) 0022-1317 (Linking),['10.1099/0022-1317-71-9-1937 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

To directly investigate the transforming properties of this factor, we constructed a replication-defective murine retrovirus that expresses the human sequence coding for TGF alpha. Infection of NIH/3T3 cells with the TGF alpha retrovirus led to the integration of a transcriptionally active provirus and overexpression of biologically active TGF alpha, but failed to induce morphologic transformation. Similarly, the TGF alpha retrovirus failed to induce morphologic transformation of five other types of rodent fibroblasts. We also investigated the effect of TGF alpha expression on the growth of BALB/MK mouse keratinocytes, which require epidermal growth factor (EGF) for proliferation. We show that exogenously added TGF alpha is an extremely potent mitogen for BALB/MK cells. However, retroviral expression of TGF alpha in BALB/MK cells failed to relieve dependence on exogenously added EGF (or TGF alpha) for cell growth. These results suggest that overexpression of TGF alpha does not, by itself, transform rodent fibroblasts or keratinocytes.","['Finzi, E', 'Fleming, T', 'Pierce, J H']","['Finzi E', 'Fleming T', 'Pierce JH']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1990 Oct;95(4):382-7. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12555464.,0022-202X (Print) 0022-202X (Linking),"['S0022-202X(90)90213-P [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12555464 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The clonal rat osteogenic sarcoma cells, UMR 106-06, which have several phenotypic properties of osteoblasts, expressed 300 LIF receptors per cell, with an apparent KD of 60 pM. Treatment of calvarial osteoblasts or UMR 106-01 cells with LIF resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of plasminogen activator (PA) activity. Both calvarial osteoblasts and osteogenic sarcoma cells were shown by Western blotting and reverse fibrin autography to produce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the production of which was increased by LIF treatment. Northern blot analysis revealed that LIF treatment resulted in a rapid (peak 1 hour), dose-dependent increase in mRNA for PAI-1. LIF treatment of the preosteoblast cell line, UMR 201, enhanced the alkaline phosphatase response of these cells to retinoic acid. Each of the osteoblast-like cell types (calvarial osteoblasts, UMR 106-06, and UMR 201) was shown to produce LIF by bioassay and, by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), was shown to express low levels of mRNA for LIF. These data establish that cells of the osteoblast lineage are targets for LIF action. The reported anabolic effects of this cytokine on bone formation in vivo could be related to inhibition of protease activity. LIF may be an important paracrine modulator in bone, or perhaps an autocrine one, based on the evidence for its production by osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cells.","['Allan, E H', 'Hilton, D J', 'Brown, M A', 'Evely, R S', 'Yumita, S', 'Metcalf, D', 'Gough, N M', 'Ng, K W', 'Nicola, N A', 'Martin, T J']","['Allan EH', 'Hilton DJ', 'Brown MA', 'Evely RS', 'Yumita S', 'Metcalf D', 'Gough NM', 'Ng KW', 'Nicola NA', 'Martin TJ']","[""St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Department of Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Plasminogen Inactivators)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Growth Inhibitors', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/chemistry', 'Plasminogen Activators/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Plasminogen Inactivators/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1990 Oct;145(1):110-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041450116.,0021-9541 (Print) 0021-9541 (Linking),['10.1002/jcp.1041450116 [doi]'],,['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

This possibility was evaluated by measuring the effects of inhibitors of topoisomerase II on the induction of the differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ monomyelocytic leukemia cells. Differentiation of this cell line was induced along the granulocytic pathway by treatment with the topoisomerase II inhibitors novobiocin (150-300 microM), teniposide (20-50 nM), etoposide (0.1 microM), elsamicin (0.5 microM), and doxorubicin (40 nM). Maturation was assessed by the morphological appearance of mature forms of the granulocytic lineage, an increase in cell surface Fc receptors, the ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium, and the loss of proliferative capacity. In contrast, the non-topoisomerase II-reactive agent cisplatin and the topoisomerase I-reactive drug camptothecin did not cause the maturation of WEHI-3B D+ cells. Aclacinomycin A and retinoic acid, which are known efficacious inducers of the differentiation of this cell line, affected topoisomerase II extracted from WEHI-3B D+ cells in vitro, causing concentration-dependent inhibition of the strand-passing activity of the enzyme. Treatment of WEHI-3B D+ cells with novobiocin at 150 microM for 3 h or with teniposide at 50 nM for 24 h resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in etoposide-induced protein-DNA cross-links. Nuclear proteins in 0.35 M NaCl extracts from cells treated with novobiocin at 150 microM for 3 h or with teniposide at 50 nM for 24 h showed a slight increase in topoisomerase II activity compared to untreated cells. No changes in topoisomerase II levels, as measured by immunoblotting, were detected after treatment of WEHI-3B D+ cells with 150 microM novobiocin or 50 nM teniposide during the first 2 days of treatment. At day 3 of treatment, however, a decrease in topoisomerase II was observed in cells treated with either drug, possibly due to decreased cellular proliferation consequent to cell differentiation. The findings support the conclusion that topoisomerase II may have a role in the induction of granulocytic differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ leukemia cells.","['Rappa, G', 'Lorico, A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Rappa G', 'Lorico A', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Novobiocin/pharmacology', 'Teniposide/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Oct 15;50(20):6723-30.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

To gain insight into the mechanisms involved in regulating TNF responsiveness, we have examined TNF receptor expression on neoplastic B-CLL cells. We have demonstrated that freshly isolated neoplastic B cells from patients with CLL did not express TNF receptors. After 1 day of incubation in culture medium, TNF receptors were detectable in the range of 540 to 1,500/cell. Kinetic experiments revealed that receptor expression was half-maximal after 3 hours of culturing and required de novo protein synthesis. The Scatchard plots of TNF-alpha binding indicated a single set of high-affinity TNF receptors with a dissociation constant of 70 pmol/L. TNF receptor expression in vitro was found in all examined cases. All cytokines tested, with the exception of IL-2, did not influence the expression of TNF receptors. The TNF receptor expression is enhanced in B-CLL cells cultured in the presence of interleukin-2 when compared with the receptor expression of cells cultured in medium alone. Our data suggest that neoplastic B-CLL cells in patients with stable disease do not express TNF receptors in vivo and that an unknown mechanism suppressing TNF receptor expression in vivo may play a role in growth regulation of neoplastic B cells.","['Digel, W', 'Schoniger, W', 'Stefanic, M', 'Janssen, H', 'Buck, C', 'Schmid, M', 'Raghavachar, A', 'Porzsolt, F']","['Digel W', 'Schoniger W', 'Stefanic M', 'Janssen H', 'Buck C', 'Schmid M', 'Raghavachar A', 'Porzsolt F']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,1990/10/15 00:00,1990/10/15 00:01,['1990/10/15 00:00'],"['1990/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Oct 15;76(8):1607-13.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)75233-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The Bmax values for TCII receptors on proliferating K562 and HL-60 cells were 4,500 and 2,700 per cell, respectively. Corresponding dissociation constants (kd) were 8.0 x 10(-11) mol/L and 9.0 x 10(-11) mol/L. Rabbit TCII also bound to K562 and HL-60 cells but with slightly reduced affinities. Calcium was required for the binding of transcobalamin II to K562 cells. Brief treatment of these cells with trypsin resulted in almost total loss of surface binding activity. After removal of trypsin, surface receptors for TCII slowly reappeared, reaching pretrypsin treatment densities only after 24 hours. Reappearance of receptors was blocked by cycloheximide. TCII receptor densities on K562 and HL-60 cells correlated inversely with the concentration of cobalamin in the culture medium. This suggests that intracellular stores of cobalamin may affect the expression of transcobalamin receptors. Nonproliferating stationary-phase K562 cells had low TCII receptor densities (less than 1,200 receptors/cell). However, the density of TCII receptors increased substantially when cells were subcultured in fresh medium. Up-regulation of receptor expression coincided with increased 3H-thymidine incorporation, which preceded the resumption of cellular proliferation as measured by cell density. In the presence of cytosine arabinoside, which induces erythroid differentiation, K562 cells down-regulated expression of TCII receptors. When HL-60 cells were subcultured in fresh medium containing dimethysulfoxide to induce granulocytic differentiation, the up-regulation of TCII receptors was suppressed. This event occurred well before a diminution of 3H-thymidine incorporation and cessation of proliferation. Thus, changes in the regulation of expression of TCII receptors correlate with both the proliferative and differentiation status of cells.","['Amagasaki, T', 'Green, R', 'Jacobsen, D W']","['Amagasaki T', 'Green R', 'Jacobsen DW']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195-5139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcobalamins)', '0 (transcobalamin receptor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcobalamins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Vitamin B 12']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Oct 1;76(7):1380-6.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)75314-0 [pii]'],,['DK35265/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Moreover, little is known concerning the types of genes that can alter the ability of hematopoietic progenitors to differentiate and cause transformation. One approach to the latter has been to use retroviral induced IL-3-dependent myeloid leukemia cell lines to identify transforming genes by their activation through insertional mutagenesis. This approach has implicated alterations in c-myb in transformation and has identified a novel transcriptional factor of the zinc finger family that is frequently activated in murine myeloid leukemias and in some cases of human AML. Using this approach it should be possible to identify additional myeloid transforming genes. The identification and characterization of the genes will provide important information and approaches to the study of the regulation of differentiation in normal hematopoiesis.","['Ihle, J N', 'Morishita, K', 'Matsugi, T', 'Bartholomew, C']","['Ihle JN', 'Morishita K', 'Matsugi T', 'Bartholomew C']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Transcription Factors']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;352:329-37.,0361-7742 (Print) 0361-7742 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Chronic exposure to 1,3-butadiene results in a high incidence of thymic lymphoma in B6C3F1 mice that is not observed in Sprague-Dawley rats. Studies at the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology have focused on evaluating the potential of endogenous ecotropic retroviral background to influence susceptibility to 1,3-butadiene leukemogenesis. These studies have compared the pathogenesis and incidence of thymic lymphoma between B6C3F1 and NIH Swiss mice. Proviral ecotropic sequences are truncated in the NIH Swiss mouse, and the virus is not expressed. Chronic exposure to 1,3-butadiene (1250 ppm) for up to 1 year resulted in a fourfold difference in the incidence of thymic lymphoma between B6C3F1 and NIH Swiss mice. These results provide presumptive evidence for retrovirus involvement since NIH Swiss mice lack ecotropic viruses and appear to be relatively resistant to induction of lymphoma by 1,3-butadiene. Other explanations appear to be less likely in light of the fact that target organ toxicity has been determined to be virtually identical between the two strains during the preleukemic phase of 1,3-butadiene exposure.","['Irons, R D']",['Irons RD'],"['Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butadienes/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Species Specificity', 'Thymus Neoplasms/chemically induced/etiology']",42,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1990 Jun;86:49-55. doi: 10.1289/ehp.908649.,0091-6765 (Print) 0091-6765 (Linking),['10.1289/ehp.908649 [doi]'],PMC1567772,,,,,,,

PMA-treated cells became growth arrested, were slightly larger and irregular in shape, adhered better to the culture flask surface, and expressed the glycoprotein IIIa on their surfaces. The morphological changes induced by PMA treatment were associated with the disappearance of actin from the cytosol and presumably reflect PMA-induced actin polymerization. Megakaryocytic differentiation was accompanied by about a 3-fold decrease in the specific phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (PTPase) activity in the particulate membrane fraction, whereas the activity in the soluble cytosol fraction increased about 3-fold. The decrease of PTPase activity in the particulate membrane fraction could be attributed to the disappearance of at least 1 distinct PTPase form displaying an apparent native Mr of 200,000 and a reduction in activity of a Mr 43,000 PTPase found associated with membranes of all cells examined to date. The increase of PTPase activity in the cytosol fraction manifested itself by the appearance of a new Mr 40,000 PTPase and a reduction of a Mr 60,000 PTPase. These results suggest the existence of several growth- and/or differentiation-related PTPase activities in K562 cells.","['Butler, T M', 'Ziemiecki, A', 'Friis, R R']","['Butler TM', 'Ziemiecki A', 'Friis RR']","['Institute for Clinical and Experimental Cancer Research, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Microfilament Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*pathology', 'Microfilament Proteins/*analysis', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Oct 1;50(19):6323-9.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

In AKR mice tumors appear very early and at high incidence after a single dose of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, while in other strains they appear later and at lower incidences. In an attempt to determine the potential role of AKR ecotropic murine leukemia virus loci in this process, congenic mice of NFS/N background, into which the highly productive ecotropic murine leukemia virus loci AKv-1 or AKv-2 has been transferred, were challenged with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Although they had a lower incidence of thymic lymphomas than did the parental donor AKR, the NS.AKv-1 mice had a tumor incidence twice that of NFS/N or NS.AKv-2. However, no difference in timing was noted, and these three strains demonstrated tumor appearance much later than that of AKR/N.

BCECF was calibrated in the pH range from 5 to 7 using the nigericin technique of Thomas and co-workers (J. A. Thomas, R. N. Buchsbaum, A. Zimniak, and E. Racker. Biochemistry 18: 2210-2218, 1979). Exchange rate increases as pHi is lowered below pH 7.00. At low pH (pH below 6.3), the dependence of Na(+)-H+ exchange rate on intracellular proton activity is well fitted by the Michaelis-Menten equation with a maximum exchange velocity of 33.7 +/- 2.4 mmol H(+).1 cell water-1.min-1 and a half-saturation constant of 1.35 +/- 0.28 microM (corresponding to a minus log of the Michaelis constant of 5.89). However, a Hill plot reveals that the Hill coefficient changes gradually from one to two when pH is changed from 5 to 7, ruling out Michaelian kinetics. The dependence of exchange flux on internal protons is well fit in the full pH range from 5 to 7 by a simple kinetic model (essential activation) with modifier and transport sites for internal proton binding. At low pH, failure to correct BCECF measurement of pHi for contribution to fluorescence signal from extracellular dye and for quenching of intracellular BCECF leads to an artifactual increase in the measured Hill coefficient. These two findings (increase in Hill coefficient as pHi is increased and artifactual increase in Hill coefficient because of methodological reasons) provide a good explanation for the wide range of Hill coefficients reported in the literature.","['Restrepo, D', 'Cho, D S', 'Kron, M J']","['Restrepo D', 'Cho DS', 'Kron MJ']","['Monell Chemical Senses Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', ""85138-49-4 (2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein)"", '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Biological', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1990 Sep;259(3 Pt 1):C490-502. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1990.259.3.C490.,0002-9513 (Print) 0002-9513 (Linking),['10.1152/ajpcell.1990.259.3.C490 [doi]'],,['GM-42495/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

However, when weanling DBA/2 mice are treated percutaneously with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), ecotropic virus replication is induced in almost all of the treated mice. Previous studies have shown that this induction results from DMBA-induced reverse mutations in codon 3 that allow efficient virus replication. In addition to ecotropic virus replication, DMBA also induces lymphomas in 100% of the treated mice. These results have raised the possibility that ecotropic virus replication is causally associated with the development of lymphomas in DBA/2 mice, perhaps via the insertional activation or mutation of cellular proto-oncogenes. To test this possibility, we compared lymphoma incidence after percutaneous DMBA treatment in DBA/2J-dv/dv mice, which carry two copies of Emv-3, with lymphoma incidence in DBA/2J-d+18J/d+18J mice, which lost both copies of Emv-3 by homologous recombination involving the long terminal repeat sequences. The results of this study conclusively demonstrated that Emv-3 is not causally associated with the development of DMBA-induced lymphomas in DBA/2J mice. Interestingly, histopathological and molecular analyses of the lymphomas indicated that the majority of the lymphomas in both strains of mice were of the B-cell lineage. This was unanticipated, since the majority of chemically induced lymphomas in other inbred strains are thymic lymphomas, presumably of the T-cell lineage. Thus, DBA/2 mice appear to present a unique model system for the investigation of chemically induced B-cell lymphomas in mice.","['Mercer, J A', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G']","['Mercer JA', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, National Cancer Institute Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Maryland 21701.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/genetics/immunology/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Virus Replication']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Oct;64(10):5199-203. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.10.5199-5203.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.10.5199-5203.1990 [doi]'],PMC248018,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The FeLV env glycoprotein expressed by recombinant FHV was processed and transported to the cell surface much as in FeLV infection, with the exception that proteolytic processing to yield the mature gp70 and p15E proteins was less efficient in the context of herpesvirus infection. Glycosylation of the env protein was not affected; modification continued in the absence of efficient proteolytic processing to generate terminally glycosylated gp85 and gp70 proteins. A recombinant FHV containing the FeLV gag and protease genes expressed both gag and gag-protease precursor proteins. Functional protease was produced which mediated the proteolytic maturation of the FeLV gag proteins as in authentic FeLV infection. Use of these recombinant FHVs as live-virus vaccines may provide insight as to the role of specific retroviral proteins in protective immunity.

Both substances engage distinct guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein-coupled receptors on a variety of cell types, thereby activating a signaling cascade that results in the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, and in functional responses such as neutrophil chemotaxis and smooth muscle contraction. Little is known about the structure of PAF and C5a receptors or about the intracellular signaling pathways used by them. We have used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to demonstrate acquired C5a and PAF receptor activity in oocytes injected with mRNA from the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 differentiated with dibutyryl cAMP. Activity was determined by measuring acquired ligand-dependent efflux of intracellular 45Ca2+ and by measuring ligand-activated transmembrane currents in voltage clamped oocytes. C5a receptor activity was confined to a single sharp peak in sucrose gradient fractionated RNA that corresponded to a transcript size of 2 kb. In contrast, PAF receptor activity was broadly distributed in size fractionated RNA from 3.5 to 6 kb. This suggests that multiple transcripts of different sizes may encode a functional PAF receptor. Both ligands activated their respective receptor in a concentration-dependent and a structure-dependent manner. The acquired C5a-dependent calcium efflux activity was inhibited by pertussis toxin whereas the PAF receptor activity was not, suggesting that the two receptors couple to different G-proteins. These data establish the Xenopus oocyte as a model system for studying the molecular and functional properties of the C5a receptor and the PAF receptor(s) of phagocytic cells.","['Murphy, P M', 'Gallin, E K', 'Tiffany, H L']","['Murphy PM', 'Gallin EK', 'Tiffany HL']","['Bacterial Diseases Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Weight', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Oocytes', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phagocytes/*physiology', '*Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'RNA, Messenger/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Receptors, Complement/*genetics', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology', 'Xenopus laevis']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Oct 1;145(7):2227-34.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

The myelotoxic actions of AZT are well known but its effect on platelets is not clear. We studied the effect of AZT at 1 and 2.5 mg/ml in drinking water on platelets in a murine model of AIDS. Three stages of the disease were examined, as determined by the serum IgM levels and other physical features. As early as 15 days after the initiation of drug treatment, AZT was found to significantly increase platelet production.

Our results show that amino-terminal deletions are sufficient for oncogenic activation of c-abl and high levels of oncogenic activities were generated by a deletion of 114 codons from the 5' end that deleted the SH3 region. A deletion of 53 codons from the 5' end (inclusive of deletions seen in Hardy-Zuckerman 2 feline sarcoma virus and BCR-ABL gene products) that retains the SH3 region of c-abl resulted in the generation of low levels of transforming activity. This transforming potential was substantially increased with the introduction of a G----A point mutation in codon 832 that is present in v-abl.

T cell lineage was proven by genotypic and immunophenotypic analyses in 15 of the 20 cases; five were of ambiguous lineage. All of the non-B lineage cases were of diffuse histology with a large cell component (DLCL). Twelve cases expressed the Ki-1 antigen; five of these cases also demonstrated a translocation with a break at 5q35. Patients with Ki-1 positive DLCL and t(5q35) had a younger median age compared with non-B cell DLCL without t(5q35). The Ki-1 positive patients had a higher frequency of skin involvement and lower incidence of bone marrow involvement compared with Ki-1 negative DLCL. Survival analysis was performed on 86 cases of B cell DLCL and 18 cases of non-B cell DLCL which were serially ascertained prior to receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Median duration of complete remission was significantly longer in the B cell compared with the non-B cell DLCL groups; there was only a trend for decreased overall survival in the non-B cell group. Among the subset of non-B cell lymphomas, overall survival of patients with Ki-1 expressing DLCL was significantly longer than those with Ki-1 negative DLCL, who had a median survival of less than a year.

After BMT, serum IgG anti-TT antibody titer and in vitro IgG anti-TT antibody production in recipients were assayed sequentially. IgG anti-TT antibody titer in serum increased from about day 20 after BMT. In addition, spontaneous IgG anti-TT antibody producing B cells and TT antigen-specific memory B cells derived from donors were also detected in peripheral blood and bone marrow of recipients from about day 60. We therefore considered that antigen-specific immunity of bone marrow donors is transferable to recipients with BMT, and the immunity continued for a long time in the recipients after BMT. The effectiveness of cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine on antibody production was next investigated in healthy adults. Live vaccine induced the production of humoral antibody but envelope vaccine did not.

DbcAMP was found to produce a rapid time- and dose-dependent inhibition of HL-60 cell proliferation, reaching a maximum after 48 hr treatment of the cells with 250-500 microM. This was associated with morphologic alterations consistent with maturing PMN. Using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, we found that dbcAMP-treated HL-60 cells expressed some, but not all, surface markers characteristic of mature phagocytes. Thus receptors for the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP); the monocyte/granulocyte markers My-8, Mo-1, and Leu-15; as well as the monocyte markers Mo-2 and My-4 were identified on the cells. In contrast, dbcAMP-treated cells did not express the PMN-specific antigen DL1.2. We also found that dbcAMP-treated HL-60 cells produced hydrogen peroxide in response to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). However, the magnitude of this response was significantly less than that observed in mature PMN. In contrast, fMLP-stimulated levels of hydrogen peroxide production were comparable in both cell types. In addition, despite the fact that dbcAMP-treated cells expressed fMLP receptors, they did not exhibit directed migration toward this chemotactic peptide. Taken together, these data suggest that dbcAMP-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is incomplete.","['Sirak, A A', 'Laskin, J D', 'Robertson, F M', 'Laskin, D L']","['Sirak AA', 'Laskin JD', 'Robertson FM', 'Laskin DL']","['Department of Pharmacology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08855-0789.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Butyrates)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*immunology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1990 Oct;48(4):333-42. doi: 10.1002/jlb.48.4.333.,0741-5400 (Print) 0741-5400 (Linking),['10.1002/jlb.48.4.333 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

CAM exerts similar effects (S- and G2-phase arrest, entrance to higher DNA ploidy, low initial cytotoxicity) on human lymphocytic MOLT-4 leukemia cells. In contrast, treatment of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells with CAM results in the immediate (occurring as early as 2 h after treatment) death of S- and G2+M-phase cells; the dead cells exhibit decreased DNA stainability with intercalating dyes, suggestive of DNA degradation. Although CAM is less cytotoxic to another human myelogenous leukemic cell line, KG1, the latter cells also respond like HL-60, namely by selective death in S and G2.

Gamma-Interferon (gamma IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are produced constitutively after BMT and have anti-viral properties. To study the effects of these cytokines on CMV interaction with host cells, we have used patient marrow fibroblasts since marrow stroma is a target for CMV infection correlating with myelosuppression in vivo. Both gamma IFN and TNF are constitutively produced by recipient CD3+ and CD16+ lymphocytes, but not by their marrow fibroblasts. Secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells is increased if they are cultured with host fibroblasts infected with CMV in vitro and the levels of gamma IFN and TNF produced are within the range that protects fresh fibroblasts from CMV infection. Constitutive secretion of cytokines by lymphocytes declines by 8 weeks after BMT, a time when the risk of CMV disease increases sharply. The in vitro phenomenon that we have described needs to be evaluated in correlative studies on individual BMT recipients to determine whether such a cytokine-mediated defense mechanism against CMV may operate in vivo.","['Duncombe, A S', 'Meager, A', 'Prentice, H G', 'Grundy, J E', 'Heslop, H E', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Brenner, M K']","['Duncombe AS', 'Meager A', 'Prentice HG', 'Grundy JE', 'Heslop HE', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vimentin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/drug effects/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Vimentin/analysis']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Sep 1;76(5):1046-53.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)74509-X [pii]'],,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,

Optimal activation was achieved by 10 mM NaHCO3 in all cases; NaCl, sodium formate, sodium acetate, NaN3, and Na2SO3 at 10 mM did not cause activation. Activation could be masked if assay solutions which had extensively absorbed atmospheric CO2 were used. Activation of the human CCRF-CEM FPGS was examined in detail. Km and Vmax values for pteroyl substrates (aminopterin or methotrexate) and L-glutamate increased proportionally in the presence of NaHCO3; there was thus no apparent change in the catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) of the FPGS reaction with these substrates. However, NaHCO3 increased the efficiency of the reaction with respect to ATP by decreasing its apparent Km while increasing the Vmax of the reaction. NaHCO3 also activated FPGS activity when folic acid, dihydrofolic acid and tetrahydrofolic acid were substrates. The relative distribution of products synthesized from methotrexate or tetrahydrofolate by FPGS was not altered by addition of NaHCO3. The potency of 5,8-dideazapteroylornithine, an FPGS-specific inhibitor, was not changed by the presence of NaHCO3 (IC50 = 0.4 microM). These results suggest that FPGS activity with folates and classical antifolates may be activated at physiological concentrations of NaHCO3. In addition, inadvertent contamination of assay solutions with bicarbonate from atmospheric CO2 may cause artifacts in the determination of activity levels and kinetic constants of FPGS.","['Bolanowska, W E', 'Russell, C A', 'McGuire, J J']","['Bolanowska WE', 'Russell CA', 'McGuire JJ']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Bicarbonates)', '118675-83-5 (5,8-dideazapteroylornithine)', '8MDF5V39QO (Sodium Bicarbonate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bicarbonates/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ornithine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Peptide Synthases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Rats', 'Sodium/*pharmacology', 'Sodium Bicarbonate', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1990 Sep;281(2):198-203. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(90)90432-x.,0003-9861 (Print) 0003-9861 (Linking),"['0003-9861(90)90432-X [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(90)90432-x [doi]']",,"['CA13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The transforming ability of AEV is due primarily to the oncogene v-erb-B. A recombinant murine retrovirus has been constructed by inserting a chimeric gag-v-erb-B gene into a Moloney murine leukemia virus based vector. This retrovirus was used to examine v-erb-B-induced transformation of murine hematopoietic cells. Infection of murine primary fetal liver, adult bone marrow or adult spleen cells with the recombinant virus generated large hemoglobinized erythroid colonies in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Generation of such colonies usually requires the presence of erythropoietin (Epo) and interleukin-3 (IL-3). These growth-factor independent colonies were shown to be derived from early (BFU-E) and not late (CFU-E) erythroid progenitor cells, and the effect was not attributable to growth factors elicited by the virus-producing cell lines. In order to confirm that the recombinant virus was responsible for this transformation of BFU-E to growth factor independence, bone marrow cells from post 5-fluorouracil treated mice were infected and used to repopulate lethally-irradiated mice. Growth factor-independent BFU-E were obtained in up to 30% of day-13 spleen colonies and it was shown by DNA analysis that cells from these colonies contained integrated provirus. Our results indicate that v-erb-B transforms early erythroid progenitors to growth factor independent growth and subsequent differentiation to erythrocytes -a process that normally requires Epo plus either IL-3 or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).","['Miller, M', 'Kennewell, A', 'Takayama, Y', 'Bruskin, A', 'Bishop, J M', 'Johnson, G', 'Symonds, G']","['Miller M', 'Kennewell A', 'Takayama Y', 'Bruskin A', 'Bishop JM', 'Johnson G', 'Symonds G']","[""Children's Medical Research Foundation, Camperdown, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic']",,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Aug;5(8):1125-31.,0950-9232 (Print) 0950-9232 (Linking),,,"['CA25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

There was no significant difference in the activity of any enzyme between HL-60 and CCRF-CEM, Colo-205 and HeLa-S3, and human lung cancerous tissue and human colon cancerous tissue. Compared between the acute leukemia cell lines and the solid tumor cell lines, the UR kinase activity was high in both cell lines. The OPRTase and UR Prylase activities were low in the solid tumor cell lines. In the cancerous tissues, both the UR kinase and TdR kinase activities were low, but the UR Prylase and TdR Prylase activities were markedly high. The results suggest that the intracellular activation of 5-fluorouracil varies with different human cancerous cells. When the anti-cancer activity of 5-fluorouracil is tested in vitro, the difference of fluoropyrimidine metabolism in subcultured cell lines from that in the cancerous tissue should be taken in account.","['Uchida, M', 'Kamiya, K', 'Yoshimura, T', 'Sasaki, K', 'Tsutani, H', 'Nakamura, T', 'Ho, D H']","['Uchida M', 'Kamiya K', 'Yoshimura T', 'Sasaki K', 'Tsutani H', 'Nakamura T', 'Ho DH']","['1st Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Gan Chiryo Gakkai Shi,Nihon Gan Chiryo Gakkai shi,7505713,"['EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.10 (Orotate Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.3 (Uridine Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.4.2.4 (Thymidine Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.48 (Uridine Kinase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Fluorouracil/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Orotate Phosphoribosyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Pentosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/*metabolism', 'Thymidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Thymidine Phosphorylase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Uridine Phosphorylase/*metabolism']",,1990/05/20 00:00,1990/05/20 00:01,['1990/05/20 00:00'],"['1990/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Gan Chiryo Gakkai Shi. 1990 May 20;25(5):990-6.,0021-4671 (Print) 0021-4671 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that apoptosis of various murine cell types, induced by a variety of stimuli, required RNA and/or protein synthesis. However, when human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 or microtubule-disrupting agents, in the presence of inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis, apoptosis of these cells was neither abrogated nor delayed. Furthermore, the presence of either cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or actinomycin D, an RNA synthesis inhibitor, alone was found to induce large scale apoptosis of these cells. Apoptosis in these cells was characterized by cell and chromatin condensation followed by nuclear and DNA fragmentation. In common with many other studies, this DNA fragmentation was found to have an approximately 200-bp multiple pattern, which is consistent with the activation of an endogenous endonuclease which cleaves at internucleosomal sites. Calcium-dependent endonuclease activity of this type was also detected in the isolated nuclei of untreated HL-60 cells. The morphologic and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis were found to precede cell death, as measured by trypan blue uptake and were completely distinct from death caused by toxic stimuli such as azide, ethanol, or heat treatment. Similar experiments with six other human cell lines confirmed that this phenomenon was not peculiar to the HL-60 cell line. These results suggest that certain dividing cell populations do not require RNA or protein synthesis to undergo apoptosis and further, that continuous transcription and translation of some regulatory protein(s) may be required to maintain control over the apoptotic ""machinery"" of such cells.","['Martin, S J', 'Lennon, S V', 'Bonham, A M', 'Cotter, T G']","['Martin SJ', 'Lennon SV', 'Bonham AM', 'Cotter TG']","[""Department of Biology, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, County Kildare, Republic of Ireland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/*pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",,1990/09/15 00:00,1990/09/15 00:01,['1990/09/15 00:00'],"['1990/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Sep 15;145(6):1859-67.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

We investigated the expression of receptors for TNF-alpha, a monocyte-derived cytokine, on the surface of hairy cells from seven HCL patients before and after treating them with IFN-alpha. Iodinated TNF-alpha binding experiments showed the presence of high affinity TNF-alpha receptors in six patients, but no specific binding was detected in the seventh. Scatchard's analysis revealed the presence of a single class of receptors, with 130 to 1200 sites/cell (mean 420) and Kd values of 0.37 to 0.89 nM. The TNF-alpha-R complex was identified by cross-linking as a single band of 94 kDa. Treatment of the patients with 3 x 10(6) U of IFN-alpha 2a markedly increased the number of TNF-alpha-R at 24 or 48 h, without changing the Kd. In the patient who lacked receptor expression on his tumor cells, high affinity TNF-alpha-R were detected at 48 h after IFN injection.

Virus particles are assembled in the nuclei of keratinized cell layer. The genome organization is identical to the murine polyomavirus genetic map including, in particular, the existence of a coding capacity for an early gene product analogous to the middle T antigen. The virus and the cloned DNA can immortalize primary cells and transform established cell lines from rodent origin. The HaPV can also induce lymphoma and leukemia after inoculation into newborn animals from a Potsdam Syrian hamster colony geographically separated from the colony affected by the spontaneous epitheliomas. The tumor incidence is high (30-80%), the latency short (4-8 weeks). The lymphomas are virus free but contain large amounts of nonrandomly deleted viral genomes. Transgenic mice produced by microinjection of HaPV DNA into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs of Gat: NMRI mice develop both, epitheliomas and lymphomas. The mice tumors contain extrachromosomal viral DNA. A search for a cellular host fully permissive for HaPV productive cycle in vitro lead to the conclusion that the hamster cells represent the most permissive context for the HaPV genome replication; however, in only one cell line the virus can be propagated by successive productive cycles leading to the establishment of a persistent infection.","['Scherneck, S', 'Feunteun, J']","['Scherneck S', 'Feunteun J']","['Central Institute of Cancer Research, Academy of Sciences, G.D.R., Robert-Rossle-Institute, Berlin-Buch.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Arch Geschwulstforsch,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0372411,,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma/*microbiology', 'Cricetinae', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Mesocricetus', 'Polyomavirus/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Skin Neoplasms/*microbiology']",49,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1990;60(4):271-8.,0003-911X (Print) 0003-911X (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Here we report on the characterization of a novel common viral integration site in BXH-2 myeloid leukemias, designated Evi-2. Within the cluster of viral integration sites that define Evi-2, we identified a gene that has the potential for encoding a novel protein of 223 amino acids. This putative proto-oncogene possesses all of the structural features of a transmembrane protein. Within the transmembrane domain is a ""leucine zipper,"" suggesting that Evi-2 is involved in either homopolymer or heteropolymer formation, which may play an important role in the normal functioning of Evi-2. Interestingly, the human homolog of Evi-2 has recently been shown to be tightly linked to the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis locus, suggesting a role for Evi-2 in human disease as well.","['Buchberg, A M', 'Bedigian, H G', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G']","['Buchberg AM', 'Bedigian HG', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Evi2a protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Library', 'Information Systems', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Software', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Sep;10(9):4658-66. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.9.4658-4666.1990.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),['10.1128/mcb.10.9.4658-4666.1990 [doi]'],PMC361055,"['CA31101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['GENBANK/M34896', 'GENBANK/M34897']",

The mechanism by which RA acts is unclear. Recently, several retinoic acid receptors (RAR) have been cloned. We studied expression of RAR-alpha mRNA by RNA blots in hematopoietic cells blocked at different stages of differentiation. All hematopoietic cells expressed RAR-alpha mRNA (3.4, 4.5 kb) including KG-1 (myeloblasts); HL-60 (promyelocytes); ML3, THP-1, U937 (myelomonoblasts and monoblasts); K562 (erythroblasts); and S-LB1 (T-lymphocytes). In addition, transformed cells from four non-hematopoietic tissues also expressed RAR-alpha mRNA. Steady-state levels of RAR-alpha mRNA were not affected by induction of terminal differentiation of HL-60 cells to either granulocytes or macrophages. Furthermore, both actively proliferating and resting lymphocytes from the same individuals expressed equal concentrations of RAR-alpha mRNA. Taken together, data suggest that level of expression of RAR-alpha mRNA is not related to cellular proliferation. We also showed that exposure to ligand (all-trans retinoic acid) did not change levels of RAR-alpha mRNA in three different cell types. Half-life of RAR-alpha mRNA was short (0.7 h) as determined by measuring decay of message after addition of actinomycin D. Consistent with this finding, accumulation of RAR-alpha mRNA increased in cells of three lines as their protein synthesis was inhibited. In summary, hematopoietic cells of different lineages and stages of differentiation constitutively express RAR-alpha mRNA. This expression is unaffected either by terminal differentiation or cell cycle. The RAR-alpha mRNA is short-lived and super-inducible by a protein synthesis inhibitor.","['Kizaki, M', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Lin, C W', 'Miller, C W']","['Kizaki M', 'Koeffler HP', 'Lin CW', 'Miller CW']",['UCLA Department of Medicine 90024.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Half-Life', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(7):645-55. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90020-a.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),"['0145-2126(90)90020-A [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(90)90020-a [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The authors intended in this report to determine whether asbestos fibers have any effect on the differentiation processes of HL-60 cells induced with DMSO. The cells were induced to differentiate by incubation with 1.25% DMSO for 4 days. A decrease in the percentage of c-myc-protein-positive cells and an increase in the number of C3bi receptor (CD11b) positive cells were observed after differentiation. When crocidolite (50 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture dishes at the beginning of the experiments, the differentiation was inhibited. An increase in the percentage of c-myc-protein-positive cells and a decrease in that of C3bi-receptor-positive cells were observed compared with the cells induced with DMSO alone. It has been reported that DMSO activates phospholipid- and Ca2(+)-dependent protein kinase and induces the differentiation of HL-60 cells.

IN protein has a site-specific nuclease activity that cleaves 2 nucleotides from the sequence present at the 3' ends of MoMLV DNA made by reverse transcription. This reaction generates the recessed 3' ends that are normal precursors for integration. IN protein also possesses the integration activity that joins these recessed 3' ends of the viral DNA to a staggered cut, made by IN protein, in the target DNA. Short duplex oligonucleotides, corresponding to the ends of MoMLV DNA, serve as the viral DNA substrate for both the cleavage and integration reactions; there are no special requirements for the DNA that acts as the target for integration.

Adult mice given injections of Moloney murine sarcoma/leukemia virus complex 1 day or 2 wk after monoclonal antibody treatment died with progressing sarcomas at the inoculation site; mice challenged 4 wk after such treatment, when CD4+ cells recovered their functional activity, behaved like conventional mice; i.e., they spontaneously regressed the virus-induced sarcomas. Mice with progressing tumors did not generate virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, despite a normal cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response to unrelated antigens, and they became virus carriers as demonstrated by Moloney murine leukemia virus antigen expression on their lymphoid cells a few days after virus injection. Moreover, the observed T-lymphocyte unresponsiveness was not due to the activity of specific suppressor T-cells. The findings indicate that the transient functional depletion of CD4+ cells at the time of virus administration provides appropriate environmental conditions for the spread of virus and facilitates tolerance induction.","['Biasi, G', 'Mazzocchi, M', 'Facchinetti, A', 'Panozzo, M', 'Zanovello, P', 'Collavo, D', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","['Biasi G', 'Mazzocchi M', 'Facchinetti A', 'Panozzo M', 'Zanovello P', 'Collavo D', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']","['Institute of Oncology, CIRC, University of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/*immunology', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Sep 1;50(17 Suppl):5703S-5706S.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

This non-aggressive or latent phase may be manifested by functional abnormalities of both T and B cells, even in the absence of critical reductions in lymphocyte numbers. At present, it is not clear whether the immune abnormalities in either the asymptomatic phase or in clinical AIDS are due solely to direct effects of HIV-1 or whether they also reflect host immunoregulatory mechanisms. In this article, by Charles Via, Herbert Morse and Gene Shearer, the immune abnormalities associated with early HIV-1 infection are compared with immune abnormalities found in three murine models of autoimmunity and immunodeficiency, and it is suggested that host mechanisms contribute to defective helper T (TH)-cell function early in the course of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, two murine models appear relevant to the study of late HIV-1 infection and suggest a role for CD8+ T cells in the prevention of symptomatic AIDS.","['Via, C S', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Shearer, G M']","['Via CS', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Shearer GM']","['Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine and Research Service, Loch Raven VA Medical Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Immunol Today,Immunology today,8008346,['0 (Interleukin-1)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/etiology/immunology', 'Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/immunology', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-1/deficiency', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology']",75,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Today. 1990 Jul;11(7):250-5. doi: 10.1016/0167-5699(90)90099-u.,0167-5699 (Print) 0167-5699 (Linking),"['0167-5699(90)90099-U [pii]', '10.1016/0167-5699(90)90099-u [doi]']",,,,,,,,

An extended period of time was allowed to pass after infection with BLV, which had been checked up through specific serological and virological examinations. The cattle belonged to different age groups and stages of infection (with and without haematological alterations [preleukosis], with incipient tumour development [swelling of externally visible and palpable lymph nodes]). Controls included BLV-infected cows as well as test animals to which isotonic saline had been applied or healthy BLV-free cattle in which the clostridium strain had been used. The serological investigation was carried out in a blind test. 3 of 6 BLV-infected spore-treated heads of cattle responded positively to the cancer test, while the other 3 were negative. The 3 cows with positive cancer test were haematologically and serologically leucosis-positive animals with clinically detectable enlargement of lymph nodes. The 3 negative ones of this group, also serologically and haematologically leucosis-positive, were younger animals without signs of tumorous process. 3 spore-treated BLV-free cows and 2 BLV-infected animals, treated with isotonic saline, were cancer test-negative, as well. Finally, 4 BLV-infected and 2 BLV-free cattle, all of them without spore injection, were completely cancer test-negative. 1 cow of the BLV-infected group did not produce spore antibodies after spore treatment, while 1 cow of the BLV-free untreated control group developed spore antibodies.","['Wittmann, W', 'Fabricius, E M', 'Schneeweiss, U', 'Schaepe, C', 'Benedix, A', 'Weissbrich, C', 'Schwanbeck, U']","['Wittmann W', 'Fabricius EM', 'Schneeweiss U', 'Schaepe C', 'Benedix A', 'Weissbrich C', 'Schwanbeck U']","['VEB Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut Insel Riems, Member to VEB Kombinat fur Veterinarimpfstoffe, GDR.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Exp Veterinarmed,Archiv fur experimentelle Veterinarmedizin,0372410,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*biosynthesis', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Clostridium/*immunology', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Spores, Bacterial/immunology']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Exp Veterinarmed. 1990;44(2):205-12.,0003-9055 (Print) 0003-9055 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

In vitro antiviral activity of DDC against FeLV was dependent upon the target cell used for infection. DDC (5 to 10 microM) inhibited FeLV infection of feline lymphoid cells by greater than 80%, while 6.07 to 12.13 microM DDC was required to similarly inhibit infection of feline fibroblasts. However, 43 to 384 microM DDC was needed to inhibit FeLV infection of primary bone marrow cells by greater than 80%. These in vitro results suggest that, although relatively low doses of DDC may be adequate to prevent infection of feline lymphoid cells, 8- to 80-times-higher doses may be necessary to block infection of bone marrow cells, a primary target cell type for FeLV infection. In vivo studies with DDC consisted of pharmacokinetic and toxicity determinations and evaluation of the prophylactic antiviral activity against FeLV in cats. Clearance and half-life values for DDC in cats were 6.5 ml/min per kg and 54.7 min, respectively. In the prophylactic studies, DDC was administered by continuous intravenous infusion at doses of 22, 15, 10, and 5 mg/kg per h for 28 days in most animals. Cats were challenged intravenously with FeLV 1 to 3 days after drug treatment began. Doses of 22 and 15 mg/kg per h were extremely toxic, causing death in 8 of 10 cats. The mg/kg per h dose was slightly toxic, causing chronic progressive thrombocytopenia over the 28-day treatment period. Of 10 cats given 10 to 5 mg of DDC per kg per h, only one was completely protected from FeLV antigenemia. However, conversion to positive FeLV antigenemia status was delayed by 2 to 7 weeks in seven of nine remaining animals. Interestingly, FeLV infection of bone marrow cells, as indicated by FELV antigen in peripheral blood neutrophils, was only slightly delayed by 0 to 2 weeks, except in the case of the one protected cat, and usually preceded conversion to antigenemia. This pattern of neutrophils becoming antigen positive before detection of antigenemia was not seen in FeLV challenge control animals and indicates that the antiviral activity of DDC may be incomplete during DDC treatment. Results of our in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that feline bone marrow cells may remain partially susceptible to FeLV infection at tolerated doses, while other somatic target tissues (i.e., lymphoid or epithelial tissues) may be protected from infection. Incomplete inhibition of FeLV infection permitted focal bone marrow infection to develop in cats given DDC. These loci of infection served as virus reservoirs which, subsequent to discontinuation of DDC treatment, permitted spread of infection to tissues previously protected during treatment.","['Polas, P J', 'Swenson, C L', 'Sams, R', 'Cheney, C M', 'Hayes, K A', 'Tarr, M J', 'Kociba, G J', 'Mathes, L E']","['Polas PJ', 'Swenson CL', 'Sams R', 'Cheney CM', 'Hayes KA', 'Tarr MJ', 'Kociba GJ', 'Mathes LE']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Half-Life', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Zalcitabine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity']",,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1990 Jul;34(7):1414-21. doi: 10.1128/AAC.34.7.1414.,0066-4804 (Print) 0066-4804 (Linking),['10.1128/AAC.34.7.1414 [doi]'],PMC175992,['N01-AI-62525/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The BLV envelope gene of RVV mO-HA/ATI and LO1-HA/ATI or of RVV mO-HA/7.5kD was expressed under control of the promoter of A-type inclusion body (ATI) protein gene of cow-pox virus or vaccinia virus 7.5-kD protein gene, respectively. The vaccinia virus strain, LC16mO, was used as vector for RVV mO-HA/ATI and mO-HA/7.5kD, and strain LO-1 was used for RVV LO1-HA/ATI. Strains LC16mO and LO-1 are attenuated vaccine virus strains originating from the Lister original vaccinia virus. All 3 kinds of constructed RVV expressed gp60 in cultured rabbit kidney cells after infection; mO-HA/ATI expressed more antigen than did mO-HA/7.5kD. Rabbits vaccinated with RVV produced considerable antibody capable of inhibiting syncytium formation, as well as antibody with virion-binding ability. The RVV that used ATI promoter induced higher antibody titer than did the RVV that used 7.5-kD promoter. Results indicate that BLV gp60 is responsible for induction of neutralizing antibodies that suppress in vitro formation of syncytia among BLV-infected cells. Applicability of RVV, especially those using ATI promoter, was evaluated in a vaccine against bovine leukosis.","['Ohishi, K', 'Suzuki, H', 'Maruyama, T', 'Yamamoto, T', 'Funahashi, S', 'Miki, K', 'Ikawa, Y', 'Sugimoto, M']","['Ohishi K', 'Suzuki H', 'Maruyama T', 'Yamamoto T', 'Funahashi S', 'Miki K', 'Ikawa Y', 'Sugimoto M']","['Corporate Research and Development Laboratory, Tonen Corp, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/immunology', 'Plasmids/*genetics/immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Vaccinia virus/*genetics/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/*genetics']",,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 1990 Aug;51(8):1170-3.,0002-9645 (Print) 0002-9645 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Moreover, similar enhancement of TM by these agents was also observed in another human leukemia cell line, HEL, which has megakaryocytic markers. In contrast to the marked enhancement of TM expression by these agents, the expression of the other megakaryocytic markers including platelet glycoproteins IIb/IIIa, Ib, von Willebrand factor and beta-thromboglobulin was not stimulated in MEG-01s or HEL cells.

To search for mechanisms of resistance to HIV independent of CD4 expression, HIV expression was studied in human and mouse cells normally resistant to HIV infection by introducing infectious virus by transfection of HIV DNA or infection with HIV pseudotyped with amphotropic or polytropic murine leukemia viruses. The results indicated that even when barriers to viral entry were bypassed, mouse NIH 3T3 cells and Dunni cells still showed a marked reduction in number of cells expressing HIV compared with the human cells studied, although the intensity of immunostaining of individual positive mouse cells was indistinguishable from that seen on permissive human cell lines. CD4 expression in mouse cells or human brain or skin cells did not influence the number of HIV foci observed after transfection with HIV DNA or infection with pseudotyped HIV. These results suggested that in addition to a block in the usual HIV fusion and entry process, CD4-positive mouse cells differed from human cells in exhibiting partial resistance to HIV infection which acted at a postpenetration step in the infection cycle. This resistance was partially overcome when mouse cells were infected by direct exposure to human lymphocytes producing HIV pseudotyped by amphotropic murine leukemia virus.","['Chesebro, B', 'Wehrly, K', 'Maury, W']","['Chesebro B', 'Wehrly K', 'Maury W']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Disease, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'HIV/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Sep;64(9):4553-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.9.4553-4557.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.9.4553-4557.1990 [doi]'],PMC247927,,,,,,,

The chimeric virus EECC, composed of the 5' gag-pol of 61E fused to the env-3' LTR of 61C, also induces immunodeficiency. The 61C (or EECC) gp80 can be distinguished from that of 61E on the basis of antigenic recognition, size, and rate of posttranslational processing. We found that the nascent precursor polypeptides of the two viruses were the same size; however, the 61E gp80 rapidly shifted to a smaller size and was subsequently cleaved to gp70, whereas EECC gp80 maintained its nascent size and was cleaved to gp70 only after a prolonged time. Endo-beta-N-acetyl glucosaminidase H and N-glycanase digestions of newly formed glycoproteins resulted in a similar banding pattern for both viruses, indicating that both contained the same number of oligosaccharide side chains and that all of these were high mannose sugars. The metabolic inhibitors of glycosylation, castanospermine or N-methyldeoxynojirimycin, prevented both the rapid trimming of 61E gp80 and its cleavage to gp70. Treatment with mannosidase inhibitors, however, did not affect 61E gp80 processing or size, suggesting that retention of glucose residues on EECC was responsible for these distinguishing properties of the glycoprotein. The pathological consequence of aberrant viral glycoprotein processing was evaluated in feline 3201 T lymphocytes, which are infectable by both 61E and EECC but are killed only by EECC. As in fibroblasts, the EECC glycoprotein produced in lymphocytes was larger, antigenically distinct, and processed more slowly than was the glycoprotein of 61E. Castanospermine treatment of 61E-infected 3201 T cells, however, not only abrogated the antigenic differences between the 61E and EECC glycoproteins but also resulted in a cytopathic effect. Our results suggest that (i) intracellular accumulation of EECC envelope glycoprotein may occur consequent to retention of glucose residues on carbohydrate side chains and (ii) a strong correlation exists between delayed glycoprotein processing and cytopathicity in FeLV-FAIDS-infected T lymphocytes.","['Poss, M L', 'Quackenbush, S L', 'Mullins, J I', 'Hoover, E A']","['Poss ML', 'Quackenbush SL', 'Mullins JI', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.96 (Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'Q0I3184XM7 (castanospermine)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cat Diseases', 'Cats', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chimera', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/genetics', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/microbiology/veterinary', '*Indolizines', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Sep;64(9):4338-45. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.9.4338-4345.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.9.4338-4345.1990 [doi]'],PMC247901,"['R01-AI-25273/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Deletion analysis points to a critical function of a region within the repeat unit related to the recognition sequences for nuclear factor I proteins but distinct from the sites previously analyzed in related viruses. Nuclear proteins binding to the critical site were detected in NIH 3T3 cells and in mouse livers. A protein fraction binding to this site was purified from mouse livers by ion-exchange and DNA affinity chromatography and shown to have nuclear factor I properties. Mutations that caused a partial or complete reduction of the in vitro binding were introduced into an Akv long terminal repeat with one 99-base-pair repeat copy driving a reporter gene, and the expression activities of the mutants in NIH 3T3 cells were found to correspond to their in vitro binding activities. This correlation strongly supports the role of nuclear factor I proteins in Akv expression. Residual expression activity was, however, detected in mutants devoid of in vitro binding. This residual activity may relate to the presence of additional sequences with homology to nuclear factor I binding sites both within and outside the repeat region. The ability of these sites to bind crude and purified protein fractions with nuclear factor I activity was analyzed, and the role of the sites within and outside the repeat region for control of gene expression of Akv and related viruses is discussed.","['Olsen, H S', 'Lovmand, S', 'Lovmand, J', 'Jorgensen, P', 'Kjeldgaard, N O', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Olsen HS', 'Lovmand S', 'Lovmand J', 'Jorgensen P', 'Kjeldgaard NO', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Plant Physiology, University of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Y-Box-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (YBX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', '*CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NFI Transcription Factors', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Y-Box-Binding Protein 1']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Sep;64(9):4152-61. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.9.4152-4161.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.9.4152-4161.1990 [doi]'],PMC247879,,,,,,,

A Cancer and Leukemia Group B report.",221-6,"Esorubicin (4'-deoxydoxorubicin, DxDx) has undergone extensive Phase II investigation for the treatment of cancer. Based on in vitro and animal data, esorubicin may possess less myocardial toxicity when compared to doxorubicin. One hundred thirty-six patients with histologically or cytologically documented non-small cell lung cancer or advanced breast cancer were enrolled in two concurrent CALGB clinical trials using esorubicin at a dose of 30 mg/m2 administered intravenously every 21 days. No patient had previously received an anthracycline agent or had evidence of severe cardiovascular disease. Cardiotoxicity was observed in eleven patients. Four patients developed symptoms of congestive heart failure and three asymptomatic patients had a significant fall in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as measured by gated pool heart scan. Four patients had cardiac signs or symptoms of indeterminate relationship to esorubicin therapy. Of 44 patients receiving more than four cycles of therapy, 36 patients (82%) had serial gated pool heart scans permitting assessment of subclinical myocardial toxicity. A 5% drop in LVEF was observed following approximately 240 mg/m2 esorubicin; a 10% drop was observed after approximately 480 mg/m2. If further clinical studies are undertaken with esorubicin, investigators are advised to monitor cardiac function frequently once the cumulative esorubicin dose exceeds 240 mg/m2. If congestive failure appears during therapy, prompt cessation of esorubicin and institution of inotropic agents may provide effective palliation. Normal myocardial function may be restored within several months.","['Ringenberg, Q S', 'Propert, K J', 'Muss, H B', 'Weiss, R B', 'Schilsky, R L', 'Modeas, C', 'Perry, M C', 'Norton, L', 'Green, M']","['Ringenberg QS', 'Propert KJ', 'Muss HB', 'Weiss RB', 'Schilsky RL', 'Modeas C', 'Perry MC', 'Norton L', 'Green M']","['Harry S.

In this study we compare the expression of CALLA/NEP in terms of antigenic density and enzymatic activity at the cell surface and of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels on granulocytes, leukemic cells, and CALLA-transfected COS-1 cells. Mature granulocytes, the only readily available source of normal human CALLA, express relatively low but constant levels of antigen, NEP activity (3.5 pmol/min/10(6) cells), and mRNA. The two major CALLA-mRNA species of 6.5 kb and 3.8 kb, observed to date in a variety of cells and tissues, were also found in four independent granulocyte preparations. With leukemia cell lines, a correlation was established between the density of CALLA antigen and the level of enzymatic activity (3.4 to 21.0 pmol/min/10(6) cells). This paper constitutes the first report of NEP activity on blast cells derived from patients with non-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); the levels of activity were variable (1.5 to 35.9 pmol/min/10(6) cells for six cases) but correlated with the level of CALLA assessed by flow cytometry. Heterogeneous levels of expression of the CALLA-mRNA species were also observed in non-T ALL cases that correlated with the level of CALLA expression at the surface of these cells. Very high levels of NEP activity were achieved by transfecting COS-1 cells with pSV-CALLA; 20% of the transfected cells were CALLA+ and expressed 550 pmol/min/10(6) cells. Extracts prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with pSV-CALLA (carrying human NEP cDNA) and pSVENK19 (carrying rabbit NEP-cDNA), respectively, gave Michaelis constant (Km) values of 50 mumol/L and similar inhibition curves with thiorphan. Thus the recombinant proteins encoded by these two genes have similar enzymatic properties, confirming the high degree of their structural relatedness. The expression of high levels of CALLA/NEP on COS-1 cells should allow the use of this system to test the effects of specific mutations on activity and might lead to the understanding of the role of CALLA in the onset and/or progression of leukemia.","['Tran-Paterson, R', 'Boileau, G', 'Giguere, V', 'Letarte, M']","['Tran-Paterson R', 'Boileau G', 'Giguere V', 'Letarte M']","['Division of Immunology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Endopeptidases/*analysis/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/*analysis/enzymology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/immunology/*pathology', 'Neprilysin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/immunology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Simian virus 40/genetics/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",,1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Aug 15;76(4):775-82.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)82453-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

There is a considerable degree of overlap in the biological effects of these two growth factors, but little is known about the mechanisms of postreceptor signal transduction. We have investigated the effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 on protein tyrosine-kinase activity in a human cell line, MO7E, which proliferates in response to either factor. Tyrosine-kinase activity was detected using immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for phosphotyrosine. GM-CSF and IL-3 were found to induce a nearly identical pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation using both one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Tyrosine phosphorylation of two cytosolic proteins in particular was increased more than 10-fold, a 93-Kd protein (pp93) and a 70-Kd protein (pp70). Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp93 and pp70 was observed within 1 minute, reached a maximum at 5 to 15 minutes, and gradually decreased thereafter. Other proteins of 150, 125, 63, 55, 42, and 36 Kd were also phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to both GM-CSF and IL-3, although to a lesser degree. Tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on the concentration of GM-CSF over the range of 0.1 to 10 ng/mL and on IL-3 over the range of 1 to 30 ng/mL. Stimulation of MO7E cells with 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or cytokines such as G-CSF, M-CSF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of pp93 or pp70, suggesting that these two phosphoproteins are specific for GM-CSF-or IL-3-induced activation. The extent and duration of phosphorylation of all the substrates were increased by pretreatment of cells with vanadate, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Importantly, culture of MO7E cells with vanadate (up to 10 mumol/L) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in GM-CSF-or IL-3-induced proliferation of up to 1.8-fold. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may be important for GM-CSF and IL-3 receptor-mediated signal transduction and that cell proliferation may be, at least partially, regulated by a balance between CSF-induced protein-tyrosine kinase activity and protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity.","['Kanakura, Y', 'Druker, B', 'Cannistra, S A', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Torimoto, Y', 'Griffin, J D']","['Kanakura Y', 'Druker B', 'Cannistra SA', 'Furukawa Y', 'Torimoto Y', 'Griffin JD']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism/pharmacology/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/metabolism/pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/blood/enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",,1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Aug 15;76(4):706-15.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)82445-8 [pii]'],,"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

In the present study, membranes prepared from HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were used to examine the mechanism by which these ATP receptors activate phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) under defined in vitro conditions. Micromolar concentrations of the receptor agonists ATP, UTP, and ATP gamma S stimulated the GTP-dependent formation of inositol bisphosphate (IP2) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) in washed membranes prepared from undifferentiated HL-60 cells prelabeled with [3H]inositol. The stimulatory effects of these nucleotides on PI-PLC appeared to be mediated through a GTP binding protein since minimal inositol polyphosphate accumulation was observed in the absence of guanine nucleotides. The increased inositol polyphosphate formation triggered by these nucleotide receptor agonists did not result from inhibition of GTP breakdown. Neither was it a consequence of increased [3H]polyphosphatidylinositol levels resulting from enhanced activity of membrane-associated PI- or PIP-kinases. Instead, the stimulated phospholipase activity was apparently receptor-mediated. The rank order of potency observed in these in vitro membrane assays (ATP = UTP greater than ATP gamma S much greater than TTP greater than CTP much greater than beta, gamma-CH-ATP) was similar to that observed with intact HL-60 cells.

The concentration of vanadate necessary to inhibit the expression of this gene was similar to that required for the vanadate-mediated activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. To determine whether vanadate could inhibit PEPCK gene transcription, a series of chimeric genes containing several deletions in the P-enolypyruvate carboxykinase promoter between -550 and -68 was linked to the structural genes for either amino-3-glycosyl phosphotransferase (neo) or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and introduced into hepatoma cells using three methods: (a) infection with a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus, (b) transfection and stable selection for neo expression, or (c) transient expression of chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase. In FTO-2B hepatoma cells infected with retrovirus, vanadate rapidly (within 1 h) inhibited transcription of the PEPCK-neo gene and blocked induction of gene expression caused by the addition of either Bt2cAMP or dexamethasone to the cells. Vanadate was not a general transcription inhibitor since, it like insulin, stimulated the expression of the c-fos gene. Also, the inhibitory effect of vanadate was rapidly reversible in FTO-2B cells since PEPCK gene expression could be stimulated by Bt2cAMP and dexamethasone after removal of vanadate. A series of 5' deletions in the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter (-550 to +73) was ligated to the structural gene for neo and stably transfected into hepatoma cells. Sequences responsive to vanadate were detected between -109 and -68. This result was confirmed using H4IIE hepatoma cells transiently expressing the PEPCK-CAT gene. The most likely target for vanadate in that region of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter is cAMP regulatory element 1 which maps from -91 to -84. A comparison of the inhibitory effects of insulin and vanadate in this system indicated a major difference in the site of action of these two compounds on PEPCK gene transcription.","['Bosch, F', 'Hatzoglou, M', 'Park, E A', 'Hanson, R W']","['Bosch F', 'Hatzoglou M', 'Park EA', 'Hanson RW']","['Pew Center for Molecular Nutrition, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 4.1.1.32 (Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genes/*drug effects', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*enzymology/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP)/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",,1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Aug 15;265(23):13677-82.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(18)77402-4 [pii]'],,"['DK 21859/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 24451/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

IFN-gamma (100 units/ml) or cholera toxin (10(-9) M) alone only marginally induced various differentiation-associated characteristics such as NBT-reducing activity, phagocytic activity, a-naphthyl acetate esterase activity and surface markers. However, when combined with each other, they significantly induced these markers. Other cAMP-inducing agents such as prostaglandin E2, forskolin, epinephrine and isoproterenol did not induce NBT-reducing activity, either alone or in combination with IFN-gamma. However, all these cAMP-inducing agents significantly increased intracellular cAMP levels. Tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 6 or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone did not induce NBT-reducing activity, but they could induce activity when combined with cholera toxin. These results suggest that enhancement of induction of differentiation by cholera toxin in combination with IFN-gamma or other cytokines may not be merely due to increased cAMP levels.

In the present study, a model for fibroblast-mediated HuIFN-alpha gene therapy for the treatment of chronic myelocytic leukemia is described. Human IFN-alpha 5 complementary DNA was inserted into a bovine papilloma virus plasmid vector (BMGNeo) containing a neomycin resistance gene. The recombinant plasmid (BMGNeo-IFN) was transfected into NIH/3T3 fibroblasts by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, and stably transformed cells were isolated by G418 selection. A fibroblast clone secreting a large amount of HuIFN into the culture supernatant was selected by radioimmunoassay using anti-HuIFN-alpha monoclonal antibodies. Southern blot analysis revealed that the transformed cells contained approximately ten copies of the BMGNeo-IFN plasmid per cell, and Northern blot analysis demonstrated high expression of HuIFN-alpha mRNA in the cells. This fibroblast clone strongly suppressed proliferation of a HuIFN-alpha-sensitive chronic myelocytic leukemia cell line (KU812) during cocultivation in vitro. When the HuIFN-alpha-producing fibroblasts were implanted into nude mice bearing KU812 tumors by the subcutaneous diffusion chamber method, tumor growth in vivo was also significantly suppressed.

It appears that this DNA-binding activity is modulated by the extreme carboxy terminal region. The amino acid sequences of the putative ets DNA-binding domain at its carboxy terminal region showed a helix-turn-helix secondary structure.

The agent displayed both human and murine solid tumor selectivity in vitro in a soft agar disk diffusion assay, relative to its activity against murine L1210 leukemia. In vivo it was highly active against solid tumors colon adenocarcinoma 38 and pancreas ductal carcinoma 03, which was consistent with the cellular cytotoxicity seen in the disk diffusion assay. A log cell kill of greater than 4.0 was demonstrated in vivo against both models. PD115934 was administered by both bolus and infusional therapy. After completion of these trials, it was determined that this compound was a schedule category III agent, i.e., a schedule-independent agent with peak plasma level toxicity. The main toxicity encountered with infusional therapy was myelosuppression. With bolus therapy, central nervous system toxicities were dose limiting. On the basis of our preclinical infusion studies, we recommend a 2-h infusion twice weekly in humans in order to obtain a total dose of 360 mg/m2 over 8 weeks.","['LoRusso, P', 'Wozniak, A J', 'Polin, L', 'Capps, D', 'Leopold, W R', 'Werbel, L M', 'Biernat, L', 'Dan, M E', 'Corbett, T H']","['LoRusso P', 'Wozniak AJ', 'Polin L', 'Capps D', 'Leopold WR', 'Werbel LM', 'Biernat L', 'Dan ME', 'Corbett TH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48202-0188.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', 'L24XJN68OW (NSC 366140)']",IM,"['Acridines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/*drug therapy', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",,1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Aug 15;50(16):4900-5.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['CA-43886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

2165202,NLM,MEDLINE,19900828,20131121,4,7,1990 Jul,Role for cyclic AMP in the postreceptor control of cytokine-stimulated stromal cell growth factor production.,471-9,"We examined the role of augmented formation of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the mediation of stromal cell growth factor production that occurs constitutively or upon cytokine stimulation. Clonal murine marrow adherent cell lines were stimulated under serum-free conditions by interleukin-1 (IL-1) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and one (+/+ -1.LDA11) was found to produce low quantities of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF identity was confirmed by the ability of supernatants from stromal cells to promote proliferation of the factor-dependent cell line FDC-P1, neutralization of this activity by antiserum to GM-CSF, and by Northern blot analysis. However, optimal concentrations of IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), in combination, led to synergistic (greater than 5-fold higher quantity) GM-CSF production compared with either stimulus alone in the +/+ -1. LDA11 cell line, capable of GM-CSF production after only single stimulation with IL-1 or LPS. In addition, synergistic stimulation by IL-1 and TNF-alpha led to equivalent high amounts of GM-CSF in another cell line incapable of GM-CSF production after induction with only IL-1 or LPS. Any of several means to raise intracellular cAMP levels, including addition of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8Br cAMP) (0.25-1mM), pertussis toxin (20-100 ng/ml), or addition of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) (1 microM), failed to stimulate GM-CSF production alone and strongly inhibited GM-CSF production in stromal cells stimulated by IL-1, LPS, or the synergistic combination of IL-1 and TNF-alpha. In addition, PGE1 and pertussis intoxication were agonists of adenylate cyclase in membranes of marrow adherent cells, whereas IL-1 and LPS were not. The role for regulators of intracellular cAMP was specific because any of the cAMP agonists alone, or in the presence of cytokine stimulators of stromal cells, strongly enhanced IL-6 production, an event known to be cAMP-responsive. Thus, acute formation of intracellular cAMP is a negative regulator of stromal cell GM-CSF production mediated by cytokines, but positively regulates IL-6 production and may be an important determinant of cytokine-directed marrow microenvironmental function. These findings on the requirement for augmentation versus inhibition of cytokine-mediated production of hemopoietic growth factors might be applied to an analysis of marrow stromal cell heterogeneity.","['Derigs, H G', 'Burgess, G S', 'Klingberg, D', 'Nahreini, T S', 'Mochizuki, D Y', 'Williams, D E', 'Boswell, H S']","['Derigs HG', 'Burgess GS', 'Klingberg D', 'Nahreini TS', 'Mochizuki DY', 'Williams DE', 'Boswell HS']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism/physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/cytology/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Jul;4(7):471-9.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

An unusual element of this kind has been isolated from human DNA on the basis of its relatedness to the integrase-coding domain of the pol gene of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). The element, termed Hs5, is related to FeLV only over a short region of 81 nucleotides predicted to encode the carboxyl terminus of the FeLV integrase protein, p46pol. The region of relatedness between Hs5 and FeLV identifies a short conserved amino acid stretch which is shared among distantly related retroviruses. The conservation of this sequence, its position, and predicted secondary structure suggest that it may represent a conserved substrate binding site or active site of the integrase enzyme. Nucleotide sequence analysis of Hs5 reveals that it is not an intact retrovirus, but contains only the 3' terminus of pol and a defective env gene without apparent long terminal repeat; Hs5 is unusual among human endogenous retrovirus-like elements in this respect.","['Levy, L S', 'Lobelle-Rich, P A', 'Elder, J H', 'Payne, S', 'Montelaro, R C']","['Levy LS', 'Lobelle-Rich PA', 'Elder JH', 'Payne S', 'Montelaro RC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1990 Jul;71 ( Pt 7):1613-8. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-71-7-1613.,0022-1317 (Print) 0022-1317 (Linking),['10.1099/0022-1317-71-7-1613 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The effects of this hematopoietin are dependent upon the differentiation status of the myeloid cell and range from proliferation of early myeloid progenitor cells to activation of neutrophil and monocyte function. In addition, many of the biological effects of GM-CSF are shared with interleukin-3 (IL-3), a distantly related lymphokine. In this study, we have characterized the GM-CSF receptor of myeloid cells at various stages of differentiation by comparing the binding characteristics and surface regulation of this receptor in early versus late myeloid cells. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of high affinity receptors on normal neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloblasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Neutrophils expressed significantly higher numbers of receptors, with an approximately 2-fold lower affinity, when compared with other myeloid cells. Two different patterns of GM-CSF receptor regulation and binding were observed. In the first pattern, the GM-CSF receptor of neutrophils was rapidly down-regulated by GM-CSF itself, by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and by the calcium ionophore A23187, and it was not competed for by IL-3 (class I receptor). In contrast to the neutrophil receptor, the GM-CSF receptor of the myeloblast demonstrated resistance to the down-regulatory effects of GM-CSF itself, PMA, and A23187, and it was completely competed for by IL-3 (class II receptor). In some cases of acute myeloid leukemia and monocytes, a mixed pattern of partial PMA responsiveness and partial competition by unlabeled IL-3 was observed, suggesting the coexpression of both class I and II receptors in these cells. In these cells, after down-regulation of the class I receptor by PMA, the remaining receptors were shown to be completely cross-competed for by IL-3, further supporting the hypothesis that these cells have a mixture of class I and II receptors. Chemical cross-linking of radiolabeled GM-CSF to myeloid cells revealed the labeling of three proteins (156, 126, and 82 kDa) which were identical in cells expressing either class I or II binding sites. These data show that there are differentiation-associated differences in the regulation of the GM-CSF receptor which may have important physiological consequences.","['Cannistra, S A', 'Koenigsmann, M', 'DiCarlo, J', 'Groshek, P', 'Griffin, J D']","['Cannistra SA', 'Koenigsmann M', 'DiCarlo J', 'Groshek P', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/07/25 00:00,1990/07/25 00:01,['1990/07/25 00:00'],"['1990/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jul 25;265(21):12656-63.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)38394-2 [pii]'],,"['CA 36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SO7RR05526-26/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

We have found that the well known murine mastocytoma P815 is suitable. These cells express no Fc epsilon RI, lack mRNA for the alpha and beta subunits of the receptor, but contain some mRNA for gamma chains. After transfection with the cDNA for each of the subunits, stable clones could be isolated which expressed several hundred thousand normal Fc epsilon RI and synthesized large amounts of mRNA for alpha, beta, and gamma, the last at 3-fold higher levels than in the untransfected cells. Aggregation of the transfected receptors led to opening of presumptive calcium channels and to activation of phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, and protein kinase C. The kinetics and other characteristics of the signals were similar to those observed after stimulation of the rat tumor mast cells from which the receptor genetic material had been derived but were smaller in magnitude. These weaker signals most likely result from an overall reduced reactivity exhibited by the P815 cells since stimulation by other ligands led to weaker or even no responses. The cells failed to degranulate after either receptor aggregation or reaction with ionophores with or without phorbol ester. Both the transfected and untransfected P815 cells express Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma RII) which, interestingly, independently triggered similar responses despite their apparently simpler subunit structure.","['Miller, L', 'Alber, G', 'Varin-Blank, N', 'Ludowyke, R', 'Metzger, H']","['Miller L', 'Alber G', 'Varin-Blank N', 'Ludowyke R', 'Metzger H']","['Section on Chemical Immunology, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin, Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myosins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Recombinant Proteins/ultrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",,1990/07/25 00:00,1990/07/25 00:01,['1990/07/25 00:00'],"['1990/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jul 25;265(21):12444-53.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)38366-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 lowered the EC50 value for PDBu from 49 to 7.1 nM. In binding experiments, where intact cells were incubated with [3H]PDBu at 37 degrees C, addition of A23187 increased the number of binding sites for the phorbol ester. Pretreatment of cells with A23187 was not sufficient to increase [3H]PDBu binding; A23187 had to be combined with phorbol ester in order to enhance [3H]PDBu binding. PDBu treatment translocated protein kinase from the cytosol to the membrane. This effect of the phorbol ester could be enhanced with A23187 whereas A23187 per se had no effect on protein kinase C distribution. From these data it is concluded that the synergism between A23187 and PDBu, monitored as enhancement of NECA-stimulated cAMP accumulation and increase in [3H]PDBu binding, is paralleled by translocation of the enzyme to the particulate fraction of the cells. The finding that cells where the cellular content of protein kinase C had been translocated to the membrane compartment bound more [3H]PDBu than control cells also suggests that [3H]PDBu binding to intact cells reflects the amount of membrane bound-, rather than the total cellular-enzyme content.","['Nordstedt, C']",['Nordstedt C'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,1990/06/12 00:00,1990/06/12 00:01,['1990/06/12 00:00'],"['1990/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1990 Jun 12;188(6):349-57. doi: 10.1016/0922-4106(90)90195-4.,0014-2999 (Print) 0014-2999 (Linking),['10.1016/0922-4106(90)90195-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Comparison of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and methyl methanesulphonate.,126-33,"The time course of development of thymic lymphoma, which occurs spontaneously in mice of the AKR strain, is accelerated by the methylating agents N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and methyl methanesulphonate (MMS). Since MNU is a potent mutagen inducing G----A transition mutations and MMS a relatively weak mutagen, it was of interest to examine the genetic alterations associated with each class of the chemically induced tumors and to compare these alterations with those found in the spontaneous tumors. The same spectrum of genetic alterations was found for MMS-induced and spontaneous thymomas. Both showed rearrangements of c-myc and Pim-1 genes that appeared to result from integration of recombinant mink cytopathic focus-forming (MCF) proviruses but failed to reveal evidence for activation of ras oncogenes, either by DNA transfection experiments or by hybridization of DNA to specific oligonucleotide probes. Some alteration in c-myc and Pim-1 genes were also found in MNU-induced tumors, but, mainly, these involved integration of ecotropic-like rather than recombinant MCF viruses. Furthermore, MNU-induced tumors frequently (in 24% of thymomas) contained G----A transition mutations, activating the Ki-ras oncogene at codon 12 position 2. Another feature that distinguishes the MNU-induced tumors from those occurring in untreated and MMS-treated mice was the consistently high level of c-myc mRNA that occurred in the absence of c-myc gene rearrangement. Taken together, the data indicate that the mechanisms of development of tumors following treatment with MNU and MMS are distinct, and that the effect of MMS is probably to speed up the process of viral leukemogenesis.","['Warren, W', 'Clark, J P', 'Gardner, E', 'Harris, G', 'Cooper, C S', 'Lawley, P D']","['Warren W', 'Clark JP', 'Gardner E', 'Harris G', 'Cooper CS', 'Lawley PD']","['Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London Hospital Medical College, England.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)', 'AT5C31J09G (Methyl Methanesulfonate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, ras', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', '*Methyl Methanesulfonate', '*Methylnitrosourea', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*pathogenicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Proviruses', 'Thymoma/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1990;3(3):126-33. doi: 10.1002/mc.2940030305.,0899-1987 (Print) 0899-1987 (Linking),['10.1002/mc.2940030305 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

NPY-(18-36) discriminates NPY receptor subtypes in vitro.,E131-9,"We studied the possibility of multiple neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor subtypes. NPY-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells was used to screen a number of NPY analogues. The potencies of three of these analogues [peptide YY (PYY), [D-Tyr-36]NPY, and NPY-(18-36)] were compared with that of NPY in the following model systems: Ca2+ mobilization and inhibition of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate accumulation in HEL cells, potentiation of vasoconstriction in the isolated rabbit ear artery, reduction of cutaneous microvascular perfusion in the rat digit, and inhibition of [3H]serotonin release in rat brain. In each of the five models, PYY was a full agonist that exhibited a similar or slightly higher potency than NPY, whereas [D-Tyr-36]NPY and NPY-(18-36) were partial agonists with lower potencies: NPY-(18-36) had a lower potency and efficacy than [D-Tyr-36]NPY in HEL cells and the rabbit ear artery, but was more effective than [D-Tyr-36]NPY for constricting cutaneous microvasculature and inhibiting serotonin release. Because of its weak partial agonism, we also tested NPY-(18-36) as an antagonist of NPY-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in HEL cells.

Anoxic or toxic damage to these organelles has been postulated to disrupt intracellular calcium compartmentalization, leading to cell death. The authors examined the potential relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium homeostasis, and irreversible injury in a model system of silica-induced toxicity to P388D1 cells. Exposure to toxic silica particles, but not to nontoxic latex heads, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, increased membrane-associated calcium, elevated free cytosolic calcium, and killed 50% to 60% of the cell population after 6 to 8 hours. To test whether disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential was sufficient to cause irreversible injury, P388D1 cells were exposed to either the proton ionophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) or to the mitochondrial inhibitor, antimycin A. Over 90% of the treated cells showed depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane as indicated by the fluorescent probe rhodamine 123. Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylbydrazone also caused an elevation in free cytosolic calcium as monitored by fura-2. However, even after 6 hours of exposure to these proton ionophores or mitochondrial inhibitors, P388D1 cells did not show increased chlorotetracycline (CTC)-induced fluorescence or loss of viability. P388D1 cells exposed to silica have been shown previously to lose 80% of their adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. The effect of reduced ATP levels on intracellular calcium homeostasis and viability was assessed by exposing P338D1 cells to FCCP in the presence of sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose, which reduced ATP content by more than 90%. Under these conditions, none of the cells were killed, and only 5.5% showed increased CTC-induced fluorescence after 6 hours. These data indicate that disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, even in combination with reduced ATP content, is not sufficient to kill P388D1 cells.","['Gleva, G F', 'Goodglick, L A', 'Kane, A B']","['Gleva GF', 'Goodglick LA', 'Kane AB']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '370-86-5 (Carbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone)', '642-15-9 (Antimycin A)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)', 'WCK1KIQ23Q (Chlortetracycline)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antimycin A/pharmacology', 'Benzofurans', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Carbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlortetracycline', 'Fluorescence', 'Fura-2', '*Homeostasis', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Silicon Dioxide/toxicity']",,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1990 Jul;137(1):43-57.,0002-9440 (Print) 0002-9440 (Linking),,PMC1877704,"['K04 ES 00127/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES 03189/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

We constructed the chimeric NEBA-1 MuLV by replacing the long terminal repeat of Cas-Br-E MuLV with that of ts-Mo BA-1 MuLV. In SWR/J or CFW/D mice, NEBA-1 MuLV induced an ataxic neurological disease characterized by clinical signs different from those induced by both parents. Although NEBA-1 MuLV did not induce lesions in novel brain areas, the spongiform lesions were more severe in deep cerebellar nuclei and in the spinal cord than those found in paralyzed mice inoculated with Cas-Br-E MuLV. By in situ hybridization, we found that the distribution of the spongiform lesions closely correlated with the distribution of the infected central nervous system cells. In the spinal cord, a close correlation was found between the number of infected cells and the severity of the spongiform degeneration. Sequencing of the substituted ts-BA-1 MuLV fragment and comparison with homologous sequences of Cas-Br-E and Moloney MuLV showed differences mainly in the U3 tandem direct repeats. Our results show that a few modifications within the U3 long terminal repeat allow the virus to cause more severe lesions in some central nervous system regions and that the severity of the spongiform degeneration correlates with the level of viral replication.","['Paquette, Y', 'Kay, D G', 'Rassart, E', 'Robitaille, Y', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Paquette Y', 'Kay DG', 'Rassart E', 'Robitaille Y', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellar Cortex/pathology', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nervous System Diseases/*microbiology/pathology', 'Neurons/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Spinal Cord/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Virulence/genetics']",,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Aug;64(8):3742-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.8.3742-3752.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.8.3742-3752.1990 [doi]'],PMC249669,,,,,,,

To investigate this further, long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) from preleukemic mice were established. Surprisingly, LTBMC from M-MuLV-inoculated preleukemic mice showed less hematopoiesis than LTBMC from control mice. This resulted from a quantitative defect in establishment of bone marrow stromal cells in the LTBMC. This phenomenon could also be observed in LTBMC from normal mice infected in vitro with a stock of M-MuLV containing a mink cell focus-forming virus (MCF) derivative (M-MCF), but not in LTBMC infected with M-MuLV alone. This implicated MCF derivatives in the reduction in bone marrow stromal cells. The phenomenon could also be detected in infected NIH 3T3 cells. Combined infection of M-MuLV plus M-MCF resulted in fewer cells, in comparison to uninfected cells or cells infected with either virus alone. Further studies indicated that this was predominantly due to an inhibition in cell growth rather than to cell lysis. The cytopathic effect did not appear to result from overreplication of viral DNA, as measured by Southern blots. Thus, combined infection with M-MuLV and an MCF derivative had cytostatic effects on cell growth.

This increase correlated with the very large increase in the (2'-5') oligo (A) synthetase mRNA level in U937 cells. No such effects were observed in HL60 cells. Furthermore, binding studies and cross-linking analysis showed that IFN-gamma modulated TNF-alpha receptors in U937 cells without altering their properties, but did not do so in HL60 cells.","['Wietzerbin, J', 'Gaudelet, C', 'Catinot, L', 'Chebath, J', 'Falcoff, R']","['Wietzerbin J', 'Gaudelet C', 'Catinot L', 'Chebath J', 'Falcoff R']","['Unite 196 INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*biosynthesis"", 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1990 Aug;48(2):149-55. doi: 10.1002/jlb.48.2.149.,0741-5400 (Print) 0741-5400 (Linking),['10.1002/jlb.48.2.149 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

ADM and MX2 showed an equivalent antitumor effect against K562. K562/ADM was highly resistant to ADM. In cellular pharmacokinetic studies, MX2 showed faster and greater influx than did ADM in both K562 and K562/ADM. The efflux of ADM was rapid in K562/ADM but not in K562. On the other hand, the efflux of MX2 was rapid in both cell lines. The formation of DNA single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks by ADM was significantly lower in K562/ADM than K562. On the other hand, formation of those breaks by MX2 was not decreased. Although some of the DNA breaks induced by MX2 were resealed, there was no difference in the degree of resealing in K562 and K562/ADM cells. On the other hand, most of the small number of DNA breaks in K562/ADM induced by ADM were resealed. The topoisomerase II activity in K562 and K562/ADM was not significantly different.

To examine the mechanisms of drug resistance to gallium, we developed a subline of HL60 cells (R cells) which is 29-fold more resistant to growth inhibition by gallium nitrate than the parent line (S cells). R cells displayed a 2.5-fold increase in transferrin (Tf) receptor expression, without a change in receptor affinity for Tf. The uptake and release of 67Ga were similar for both S and R cells. The uptake of 59Fe-Tf by S cells was inhibited by gallium nitrate over 24-48 h of incubation. In contrast, 59Fe-Tf uptake by R cells, although initially inhibited by gallium nitrate at 24 h, was no longer inhibited at 48 h of incubation. 59FeCl3 uptake by R cells was significantly greater than that of S cells, regardless of the time in culture. Despite the increase in 59Fe uptake by R cells, the ferritin content of these cells was lower than that of S cells. The ribonucleotide reductase electron spin resonance signal of R cells was comparable to that of S cells. R cells were not cross-resistant to Adriamycin, vincristine, cis-platinum or hydroxyurea. Resistance to gallium nitrate in this subline of HL60 cells results primarily from the ability of cells to overcome the gallium-induced block in iron incorporation. In addition, intracellular iron in R cells appears to traffic preferentially to a non-ferritin compartment.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Zivkovic-Gilgenbach, Z', 'Narasimhan, J', 'Antholine, W E']","['Chitambar CR', 'Zivkovic-Gilgenbach Z', 'Narasimhan J', 'Antholine WE']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'VRA0C6810N (gallium nitrate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Gallium/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Aug 1;50(15):4468-72.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,['R01 CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The Nordic Bone Marrow Transplantation Group.",413-8,"Risk factors for post-transplant relapse were analysed retrospectively in 163 patients treated with allogenic bone marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma in first to fourth remission or during relapse. Multifactorial analysis was performed according to Cox with fixed pretransplant covariates and post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and graft-versus-host (GVHD) as time-dependent covariates. Advanced stage of leukemia at the time of transplantation was an important risk factor for subsequent relapse. Furthermore, the study confirmed a graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) activity associated with chronic GVHD, including de novo chronic GVHD (intensity factor 0.08, p = 0.004). In a model excluding chronic GVHD, female donor-to-male recipient (a risk factor for GVHD), was associated with decreased post-transplant relapse risk (intensity factor 0.3, p = 0.008), suggesting that an allo-reaction against a minor transplantation antigen (Hy) may mediate antileukaemic activity. A decrease of the relapse risk by a factor 0.18 was observed in recipients with AML as well as ALL when the donor was CMV seropositive (p = 0.0002). This effect was restricted to patients who had laboratory evidence of post-transplant CMV infection. When CMV infection occurred and donor was seropositive the relapse risk was reduced by a factor 0.035. The effect was not mediated through an increased occurrence of grade 2-4 acute or chronic GVHD and could not be explained by a statistical bias due to censoring of patients who died in remission. Rather, donor CMV immunity was associated with GVHD independent GVL activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jacobsen, N', 'Badsberg, J H', 'Lonnqvist, B', 'Ringden, O', 'Volin, L', 'Rajantie, J', 'Nikoskelainen, J', 'Keiding, N']","['Jacobsen N', 'Badsberg JH', 'Lonnqvist B', 'Ringden O', 'Volin L', 'Rajantie J', 'Nikoskelainen J', 'Keiding N']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytomegalovirus/classification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Serotyping', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Jun;5(6):413-8.,0268-3369 (Print) 0268-3369 (Linking),,,,['Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Jan;7(1):69.

In order to clarify whether a target cell of leukemic transformation in AMkL is a cell committed to megakaryocytic lineage, or a multipotential stem cell, we examined AMkL patients with regard to: a) the presence of myelodyplastic features in residual erythroid and granulocytic cells, b) coexistence of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive blasts with megakaryoblasts, and c) the presence of the same chromosomal abnormality in erythroid and granuloid colony-forming cells as seen in megakaryoblasts. Regarding the former two items, results were compared with those from megakaryoblastic crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML-MkBC) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down syndrome (DS-TMD), which are thought to be multipotential stem cell disorders. Among 18 patients with AMkL, three, all complicating myelofibrosis, had marked myelodysplastic changes of erythroid series and/or granulocytic series. In 4 out of 7 patients with CML-MkBC, 5 out of 8 patients with DS-TMD, and 7 out of 18 patients with AMkL, MPO-positive blasts, even though rare, were observed in addition to PPO-positive blasts. All except one of these patients with AMkL also showed complicating myelofibrosis. In one case of AMkL with myelofibrosis, chromosomal analysis of cultured cells of individual colonies revealed that all the analysable metaphases from both CFU-GM and BFU-E had the same chromosomal abnormality as megakaryoblasts. This study has clarified that a considerable proportion of AMkL cases, particularly those with complicating myelofibrosis or showing acute myelofibrosis, arise against the background of a multipotential stem cell disorder, even if blasts are exclusively megakaryocytic in phenotype.","['Koike, T', 'Urushiyama, M', 'Narita, M', 'Saitoh, H', 'Ishida, F', 'Imashuku, S', 'Morioka, Y', 'Utsumi, J', 'Ishizuka, T', 'Tsuruta, T']","['Koike T', 'Urushiyama M', 'Narita M', 'Saitoh H', 'Ishida F', 'Imashuku S', 'Morioka Y', 'Utsumi J', 'Ishizuka T', 'Tsuruta T', 'et al.']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)'],IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Granulocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Peroxidase/metabolism']",,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1990 Aug;34(4):252-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830340404.,0361-8609 (Print) 0361-8609 (Linking),['10.1002/ajh.2830340404 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

To produce cells resistant to the maturation-inducing effects of butyric acid, two strategies were followed. First, HL-60 cells were mutagenized and cultured in soft agar with inducing concentrations of butyric acid. Four clones were isolated resistant to a wide variety of differentiation inducers, including butyric acid. Second, HL-60 cells were cultured in gradually increasing concentrations of butyric acid until a normal growth rate was achieved in medium containing greater than 1 mM butyric acid. These cells retained their ability to be induced to mature to neutrophils with dimethylsulfoxide, retinoic acid, and actinomycin D; and to monocyte/macrophage like cells with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3. However, they no longer underwent terminal differentiation when butyric acid was added in increasing concentration, even when cytotoxic concentrations were used. The mutagenized clones cells appeared permanently butyrate resistant, but the selected clones reverted to the wild-type state when grown in the absence of butyric acid. The selected cells continued to express myeloperoxidase; the mutagenized lines did not. Thus, by using two different protocols, HL-60 cells resistant to the cytotoxic and maturation-inducing effects of butyric acid can be produced that have varied phenotypic characteristics.","['Fischkoff, S A', 'Hoessly, M C', 'Rossi, R M']","['Fischkoff SA', 'Hoessly MC', 'Rossi RM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-4283.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Butyrates)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '9H154DI0UP (Ethyl Methanesulfonate)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Apr;4(4):302-6.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Since PER-315 cells represent immature thymocytes, this new cell line may provide a model to further investigate the IL-2 receptor structure present at this stage of T cell differentiation.","['Kees, U R', 'Ford, J', 'Ranford, P R', 'Dawson, V M']","['Kees UR', 'Ford J', 'Ranford PR', 'Dawson VM']","['Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cell Line/immunology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Culture Media', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Apr;4(4):292-6.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

A 25-30% additional antiviral effect was achieved in vitro when AZT was combined with human recombinant alpha interferon 2a (IFN alpha). Oral administration of AZT (20 mg/kg three times daily) to cats resulted in plasma concentrations of 3 micrograms/ml at 2 h post-administration with a T1/2 of approximately 1.60 h. Administration of AZT alone or in combination with IFN alpha or interleukin-2 (IL-2) throughout a 6-week treatment period enabled cats to resist challenge with FeLV-FAIDS. In contrast, those cats treated with IFN alpha or IL-2 alone became persistently antigenemic (core protein p27) in parallel with placebo-treated controls. Antigenemia remained undetectable in AZT-treated cats throughout an 80-day period post-inoculation (38 days after treatment was withdrawn). However, latent FeLV-FAIDS in bone marrow was detectable by in vitro culture of progenitor cells in the presence of hydrocortisone. Serial analysis of circulating p27 antigen, neutralizing antibody, and quantification of latent, reactivatable virus indicated that those animals receiving AZT in combination with IFN alpha were most able to resist FeLV-FAIDS challenge. This work provides additional evidence that early presymptomatic treatment employing combination chemoimmunotherapy can be effective in medical intervention of retroviral infection.","['Zeidner, N S', 'Rose, L M', 'Mathiason-DuBard, C K', 'Myles, M H', 'Hill, D L', 'Mullins, J I', 'Hoover, E A']","['Zeidner NS', 'Rose LM', 'Mathiason-DuBard CK', 'Myles MH', 'Hill DL', 'Mullins JI', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cats', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/complications', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/drug effects/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1990;3(8):787-96.,0894-9255 (Print) 0894-9255 (Linking),,,['N01 A1 72663/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Among various anti-Id that were typed serologically as internal image Ab2 of the mouse mammary tumor virus tumor-associated Ag gp52, only one induced protective immunity and was effective in immunotherapy. In this study we compared the structural, idiotypic, and network properties of the protective and nonprotective antiidiotypic antibodies. The DNA sequence of the variable regions of six anti-Id was determined. The VH sequence of four Ab2, including the protective Ab2, are highly homologous, whereas the VL sequences differ and were assigned to different Vk families. In addition, the DH sequence region of the same four Ab2 are identical, whereas one is highly homologous and another one without homology. Search for amino acid sequence homologies between the Ab2 and gp52 showed the strongest similarities in the CDR2 of the L chain from the protective Ab2. In addition, the CDR2 region also had homology with a T cell epitope on gp52. The biologic basis of effective idiotypic mimicry was studied at the level of Ab3 induced by the Ab2. Id inhibition analysis using Ab3 induced by either protective or nonprotective Ab2, revealed differences.

A distinct gene product with homology to other matrix metalloproteinases.,11421-4,"We have identified and sequenced a cDNA encoding human neutrophil collagenase from a lambda gt11 cDNA library constructed from mRNA extracted from the peripheral leukocytes of a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia. The library was screened with an oligonucleotide probe constructed from the putative zinc-binding region of fibroblast collagenase. Eleven positive clones were identified, of which the one bearing the largest insert (2.2 kilobases (kb)) was sequenced. From the nucleotide sequence of the 2.2-kb cDNA clone we have deduced a 467-amino acid sequence representing the entire coding sequence of the enzyme. The deduced protein was confirmed as neutrophil collagenase by conformity with the amino-terminal sequence analyses of three tryptic peptides of purified neutrophil collagenase. The cDNA clone hybridizes to a 3.3-kb mRNA present in RNA extracted from human bone marrow but did not hybridize with RNA isolated from U937 cells induced to differentiate with phorbol myristate acetate. Neutrophil collagenase was found to possess 57% identity with the deduced protein sequence for fibroblast collagenase with 72% chemical similarity. Certain regions of the molecule, including the putative zinc-binding region, are highly conserved. When compared with the published sequence for fibroblast collagenase, neutrophil collagenase contains four additional sites for glycosylation. Medium from COS-7 cells transfected with a pcDNA1 eucaryotic expression vector containing cDNA for neutrophil collagenase degraded type I collagen into the three-quarter, one-quarter fragments characteristic of mammalian interstitial collagenase activity. Thus, definitive evidence based on the cDNA sequence confirms the neutrophil collagenase is a distinct gene product and a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases.","['Hasty, K A', 'Pourmotabbed, T F', 'Goldberg, G I', 'Thompson, J P', 'Spinella, D G', 'Stevens, R M', 'Mainardi, C L']","['Hasty KA', 'Pourmotabbed TF', 'Goldberg GI', 'Thompson JP', 'Spinella DG', 'Stevens RM', 'Mainardi CL']","['Department of Anatomy, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38104.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Library', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*genetics', 'Microbial Collagenase/blood/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection']",,1990/07/15 00:00,1990/07/15 00:01,['1990/07/15 00:00'],"['1990/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jul 15;265(20):11421-4.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)38413-3 [pii]'],,"['AI-22603/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-39166/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-39472/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['GENBANK/J05556'],

Synthetic lipid A precursor Ia (compound 406), which has no interleukin 1 (IL-1)-inducing activity toward monocytes, had strong differentiation-inducing activity toward the LPS-sensitive clone. The combined treatment of the LPS-sensitive clone with LPS and recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) did not further increase the degree of differentiation induced by LPS alone. By contrast, the LPS-resistant clone was markedly induced to differentiate by LPS in the presence of rTNF. Combined treatment of the LPS-resistant clone with LPS and other cytokines such as recombinant IL-1 alpha, recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and interferon-gamma was not effective in inducing marked synergistic differentiation.

Upon differentiation, these human promyelocytic leukemia cells express a chemotactic formyl peptide receptor, which is coupled through a guanine nucleotide-binding protein to phospholipase C. Stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe results in changes in intracellular pH which are thought to be mediated by protein kinase C regulation of Na+/H+ antiporter function. Acute LiCl treatment (10 mM) was without any effect on Na+/H+ activity. However, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with 1 or 10 mM LiCl for at least 5 days resulted in a marked attenuation of fMet-Leu-Phe effects on Na+/H+ activity. In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, which lack fMet-Leu-Phe receptors, intracellular acidification induced by the proton ionophore nigericin generates an alkalinization response. Chronic (but not acute) Li+ treatment also resulted in an inhibition of the nigericin-mediated response. Furthermore, stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter by the phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, was also markedly attenuated by chronic LiCl treatment, suggesting an impairment of protein kinase C activity. In contrast, fMet-Leu-Phe-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ and phospho-inositide breakdown were unchanged in cells treated with Li+ for 5 days. These results indicate that chronic but not acute Li+ treatment alters intracellular pH regulation possibly at a site distal to the fMet-Leu-Phe receptor.","['Bitran, J A', 'Potter, W Z', 'Manji, H K', 'Gusovsky, F']","['Bitran JA', 'Potter WZ', 'Manji HK', 'Gusovsky F']","['Clinical Pharmacology Section, Laboratory of Clinical Science, NIMH, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '7YNJ3PO35Z (Hydrogen)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen/metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Lithium/*pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",,1990/04/25 00:00,1990/04/25 00:01,['1990/04/25 00:00'],"['1990/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1990 Apr 25;188(4-5):193-202. doi: 10.1016/0922-4106(90)90002-f.,0014-2999 (Print) 0014-2999 (Linking),['10.1016/0922-4106(90)90002-f [doi]'],,,,,,,,

All but one out of 12 cell lines showed between 50 and 85% F23.1+ cells in the uncloned cell population which is noticably higher than the approximately 13% level amongst the Ig- normal spleen cell population. There was a high frequency (approximately 50%) of F23.1+ clones from five of these cell lines. The frequency of F23.1 binding cells in the Ig-, CD4/CD8-depleted spleen population is only 0.2%, which gives a precursor frequency in spleen of less than 0.002%. This reflects selective isolation of CD4-CD8- alpha beta+ cells which express V beta 8 gene products by this culture scheme. The requirement for RadLV in induction of these cell lines has been established, suggesting that this retrovirus may selectively stimulate CD4-CD8-F23.1+ T cells.

In this study, we have further elucidated the regulation of these channels in the human T-leukemic cell line, JURKAT. Stimulation with either OKT3 or PHA induced a prompt influx of Ca2+ as assessed by MN2+ quenching of intracellular fura-2 fluorescence. When cytosolic free Ca2+ transient was partially buffered by loading the cells with BAPTA, neither agonist could induce Ca2+ entry into the cells as depicted by the lack of quenching of the fluorescence signal by Mn2+. This is in good agreement with our previous data on agonist-induced 45Ca2+ influx demonstrating that a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ due to agonist-induced mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, could, directly or indirectly via the inositol cycle, initiate Ca2+ influx in these cells. Further support of this idea comes from the data demonstrating that agonist-induced mobilization of Ca2+ precedes the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. The present findings show that agonist-stimulation significantly increased the levels of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 after only 5 s, indicating that one or both of these substances could play a role in the regulation of Ca2+ influx. However, when agonist-induced Mn2+ influx was totally abolished, by partially buffering the cytosolic free Ca2+ rise, the formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was not affected. Consequently, the dependence of an initial rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ for the subsequent regulation of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, can be dissociated from the formation of both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4.","['Ng, J', 'Gustavsson, J', 'Jondal, M', 'Andersson, T']","['Ng J', 'Gustavsson J', 'Jondal M', 'Andersson T']","['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '102850-29-3 (inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'O448IDK23O (Quin2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Benzofurans', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Manganese', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/06/12 00:00,1990/06/12 00:01,['1990/06/12 00:00'],"['1990/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Jun 12;1053(1):97-105. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(90)90031-8.,0006-3002 (Print) 0006-3002 (Linking),"['0167-4889(90)90031-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(90)90031-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Microscopic examination revealed a diffuse effacement of lymph node structure due to the presence of histiocytes intermingled with a variable number of anaplastic large lymphoid cells. The latter, in some cases, were isolated, while in others they were arranged in clusters or were diffusely present in residual sinuses. The large anaplastic cells expressed the activation markers CD30 (Ki-1), CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor), CD70 (Ki-24) and Ki-27, as well as varying combinations of T-associated molecules. The histiocytes expressed lysozyme and the CD11b (C3bi-R), CD11c (p150, 95) CD14, CD68 (KPI) and Ber-Mac3 antigens. Double staining with the antibody Ki-67 demonstrated that the proliferating components were the CD30-positive cells and not the histiocytes. T-cell receptor beta gene rearrangements were shown in three cases tested. The patients responded well to aggressive chemotherapy and nine are still alive, eight in complete remission.

The toxicity of zidovudine was evaluated in SPF cats experimentally infected with FeLV. At initiation of the zidovudine study, all cats were antibody positive for FeLV antigens but clinically asymptomatic. Four cats were also viremic. Thirteen, 6- to 10-month-old cats were divided into five dosage groups and given zidovudine po at 0, 7.5, 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg daily in three equally divided doses for 32 to 34 days. Titers of circulating virus antigen remained constant; however, three of six cats receiving the higher doses of zidovudine (greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg) showed an increase in antibody titers to FeLV. Administration of zidovudine resulted in a progressive anemia, dependent upon dose and time. Macrocytes were observed prior to the development of anemia and were also found in several nonanemic cats. Repeated measures regression analyses indicated that an increased dose of zidovudine was associated with decreased packed cell volume, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin. As determined from the packed cell volume, the analyses indicate that anemia is induced only by the two highest doses of zidovudine. The regression model indicates that daily doses of 60 and 30 mg/kg are expected to induce anemia by Day 4 and Day 13, respectively. Progressive absolute neutropenia was observed in the greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg groups. Histopathologic lesions consisted of marked bone marrow hypercellularity in cats given greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg zidovudine and splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis in cats given greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg. Thus, oral toxicity of zidovudine in the cat is manifested by a dose-related anemia and neutropenia as observed in humans.","['Haschek, W M', 'Weigel, R M', 'Scherba, G', 'DeVera, M C', 'Feinmehl, R', 'Solter, P', 'Tompkins, M B', 'Tompkins, W A']","['Haschek WM', 'Weigel RM', 'Scherba G', 'DeVera MC', 'Feinmehl R', 'Solter P', 'Tompkins MB', 'Tompkins WA']","['Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana 61801.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Fundam Appl Toxicol,Fundamental and applied toxicology : official journal of the Society of Toxicology,8200838,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Anemia/chemically induced', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cats', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erythrocyte Count/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematocrit', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Zidovudine/*toxicity']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fundam Appl Toxicol. 1990 May;14(4):764-75. doi: 10.1016/0272-0590(90)90301-y.,0272-0590 (Print) 0272-0590 (Linking),['10.1016/0272-0590(90)90301-y [doi]'],,"['AI-27665/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43676/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Although differentiating and undifferentiated HL-60 cells exhibited similar steady-state levels of [Ca2+]i, cells induced to differentiate by dibutyryl-cAMP, at 48 h, exhibited enhanced Ca2+ influx rate, measured by non-steady state 45Ca2+ uptake, and augmentation of FMLP-stimulated Ca2+ influx. At 120 h the above cells responded to FMLP but not to Con-A, by a marked augmentation of Ca2+ influx, and elevated levels of [Ca2+]i. On the other hand HL-60 cells induced to differentiate by retinoic acid responded, as described above, to Con-A but not to FMLP. HL-60 cells grown in the presence of cholera-toxin, were reported to express high levels of FMLP-receptors without expressing cell differentiation. We have demonstrated that, in these cells the Ca2+ influx rate was unchanged, moreover, FMLP-stimulated Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i rise were low. These findings strongly suggest that the presence of receptor is not sufficient for FMLP-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i. A link between increased Ca2+ influx rate, acquired upon induction of differentiation, and receptor mediated response in these cells is proposed.","['Aviram, A', 'Rephaeli, A', 'Shaklai, M']","['Aviram A', 'Rephaeli A', 'Shaklai M']","['Hematology Division, Beilinson Medical Center, Petach-Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Calcium,Cell calcium,8006226,"['0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Concanavalin A/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Calcium. 1990 Apr;11(4):269-74. doi: 10.1016/0143-4160(90)90003-d.,0143-4160 (Print) 0143-4160 (Linking),"['0143-4160(90)90003-D [pii]', '10.1016/0143-4160(90)90003-d [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Since DNA topoisomerase II is a major protein of the nuclear matrix, we asked if alterations in nuclear matrix topoisomerase II might be important in this form of multidrug resistance. Pretreatment of drug-sensitive CEM cells for 2 h with either 5 microM VM-26 or 3 microM m-AMSA reduced the specific activity of newly replicated DNA on the nuclear matrix by 75 and 50%, respectively, relative to that of the bulk DNA. However, neither VM-26 nor m-AMSA affected the relative specific activity of nascent DNA isolated from the nuclear matrices of drug-resistant CEM/VM-1 cells. The decatenating and unknotting activities of DNA topoisomerase II were 6- and 7-fold lower, respectively, in the nuclear matrix preparations from the CEM/VM-1 cells compared to parental CEM cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the amount of immunoreactive topoisomerase II in the nuclear matrices of the CEM/VM-1 cells was decreased 3.2-fold relative to that in CEM cells, but there was no significant difference in the amount of enzyme present in the nonmatrix (1.5 M salt soluble) fractions of nuclei from these cell lines. Increasing the NaCl concentration used in the matrix isolation procedure from 0.2 to 1.8 M resulted in a progressive decrease in the specific activity of topoisomerase II in matrices of CEM/VM-1 but not CEM cells, which suggested that the association of the enzyme with the matrix is altered in the resistant cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fernandes, D J', 'Danks, M K', 'Beck, W T']","['Fernandes DJ', 'Danks MK', 'Beck WT']","['Department of Biochemistry, Bowman Gray School of Medicine of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', ""51264-17-6 (4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-o-anisidide)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Crithidia/drug effects/*enzymology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 May 1;29(17):4235-41. doi: 10.1021/bi00469a028.,0006-2960 (Print) 0006-2960 (Linking),['10.1021/bi00469a028 [doi]'],,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

In response to rTNF-alpha, HCL cells from five of eight patients showed a 3 to 23-fold thymidine incorporation above their unstimulated controls. The effect was time and dose dependent with a maximum between 10 and 25 ng/ml rTNF-alpha after 120-hr incubation. rLT (1-50 ng/ml), however, could not enhance DNA synthesis in six of six cases. Cell number of rTNF-alpha stimulated cells ranged from 2-3 x 10(6)/ml from days 0-50 whereas cell number of unstimulated controls decreased from 3 x 10(6)/ml at day 0 to 0.01-0.02 x 10(6)/ml after 50 days in culture. rTNF-alpha induced proliferation could be suppressed in all HCL cell populations by 0.3 ng/ml recombinant interferon alpha (100 U/ml rIFN-alpha). TNF binding studies in two patients revealed that both TNF-sensitive HCL cells (1,990 +/- 148 receptors/cell) as well as TNF-insensitive HCL cells (1,261 +/- 101 receptors/cell) express specific receptors for TNF-alpha. These data show that rTNF-alpha and rLT have different effects on the growth of HCL cells.

One such virus is the replication defective component of the Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) complex, called Friend spleen focus forming virus (F-SFFV). This virus induces erythroblastosis, and a virion envelope-related glycoprotein, gp55, encoded by F-SFFV has been suggested as the pathogenic gene. The role of the gp55 gene is, however, yet unclear in the apparently multistep erythroleukemogenesis. By separately producing transgenic mice harboring the whole F-SFFV DNA, the gp55 gene alone under the control of the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) and the gp55 gene under the control of cytoplasmic beta actin transcriptional regulatory unit, we show here that the gp55 gene is capable of inducing neoplastic proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells specifically in the absence of helper virus and other F-SFFV sequences. Under the control of the viral LTR the gp55 expression was detected only in leukemic tissues, but under the control of cytoplasmic beta-actin regulatory sequences, the gp55 was also expressed in a variety of normal tissues including preleukemic normal spleens. The development of erythroleukemia was suppressed under the genetic background of C57B1/6 mouse (resistant to F-MuLV; Fv-2rr), and required additional events even under the background of DDD mouse (susceptible to F-MuLV; Fv-2ss). The p53 and Spi-1 genes were frequently aberrant in transplanted tumors and cell lines derived from them, but were not in primary leukemic spleens.","['Aizawa, S', 'Suda, Y', 'Furuta, Y', 'Yagi, T', 'Takeda, N', 'Watanabe, N', 'Nagayoshi, M', 'Ikawa, Y']","['Aizawa S', 'Suda Y', 'Furuta Y', 'Yagi T', 'Takeda N', 'Watanabe N', 'Nagayoshi M', 'Ikawa Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Tsukuba Life Science Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', '*Genes, Viral', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pedigree', 'Spleen/cytology/microbiology/pathology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics']",,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1990 Jul;9(7):2107-16.,0261-4189 (Print) 0261-4189 (Linking),,PMC551930,,,,,,,

Embedding into agarose plugs did not protect nuclei, as opposed to cells, from detergent-induced fragmentation. The phenomenon is strikingly analogous to the double-strand DNA cleavage reactions mediated by topoisomerase II.

A fusion gene containing 452 nucleotides of 5' noncoding sequence linked to a promoterless human growth hormone gene directed the transcription of the latter in MEL cells but not in mouse fibroblasts, T cells, B cells, or macrophagelike cells, suggesting that this promoter functions in an erythroid-specific manner.","['Youssoufian, H', 'Zon, L I', 'Orkin, S H', ""D'Andrea, A D"", 'Lodish, H F']","['Youssoufian H', 'Zon LI', 'Orkin SH', ""D'Andrea AD"", 'Lodish HF']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Gene Library', '*Genes', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Jul;10(7):3675-82. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.7.3675-3682.1990.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),['10.1128/mcb.10.7.3675-3682.1990 [doi]'],PMC360810,"['1K11 HL02277-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL32253/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['GENBANK/M38133'],

Five clones of pLC1, pLC2, pLC3, pLC4, and pLC5 obtained from the 5 respective bands were analysed by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blot hybridization using gene-specific probes of FeLV. The results have clearly demonstrated that pLC4 and pLC5 contained large deletions in the pol and part of gag regions, while the full-length proviruses could be observed in pLC1 and pLC2. Furthermore, pLC3 contained part of a variant FeLV genome having an EcoRI site in its gag region.

Elevated antibody activity against BLV as determined by biotinylated protein A and peroxidase-labelled streptavidin tended to occur more frequently in MS patients than in controls. No such difference was found, however, when peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against human kappa chain were used for detection of antibodies reacting with BLV. Immunoblotting revealed no difference between the MS and the control group when anti-kappa antibodies were used to detect antibody binding to BLV antigens. The protein A method revealed significantly decreased antibody activity against a BLV antigen with molecular weight of about 29 kD in MS compared with controls, whereas a significant rise in number of MS patients responding to a component of about 53 kD was observed. The differences between the 2 detection systems could be due to unspecific reactions.

Examination of a bank of 21 naturally occurring FeLV-positive feline lymphomas revealed that FeLV proviral integration occurs at flvi-1 in four independent tumors (19%). Independent integrations occurred within a 2.4-kilobase region of flvi-1, the probability of which by random chance can be estimated as 10(-16). Several lines of evidence, including sequence analysis of the long terminal repeat, demonstrated that proviruses integrated at flvi-1 are exogenously acquired and are oriented in the same transcriptional direction with respect to the locus. Molecularly cloned flvi-1 did not hybridize with probes representing several previously described proviral integration domains or with probes representing 10 oncogenes. The natural feline lymphomas examined in this study were heterogeneous with respect to tissue of origin, cell type, and number of monoclonal proviral integrations. The four tumors in which flvi-1 is interrupted were classified as members of a phenotypic subgroup containing seven lymphomas, i.e., at least four (57%) of seven lymphomas of this type contained FeLV proviral integration at flvi-1. Members of this phenotypic subgroup are non-T-cell lymphomas isolated from the spleen and contain an average of three proviruses, compared with an average of eight among all of the tumors examined. The small number of proviral integrations in tumors of this subgroup suggests that an early proviral integration event into flvi-1 can induce malignant change.","['Levesque, K S', 'Bonham, L', 'Levy, L S']","['Levesque KS', 'Bonham L', 'Levy LS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cat Diseases/*genetics/microbiology', 'Cats', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/microbiology/physiopathology/*veterinary', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping']",,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Jul;64(7):3455-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.7.3455-3462.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.7.3455-3462.1990 [doi]'],PMC249607,,,,,,['GENBANK/M37971'],

Following infection with HSV, both PMA--treated and untreated cells correctly transcribe the viral immediate-early genes at levels comparable to those observed in fully permissive cell types, but immediate-early RNA and protein are detected only in the PMA-treated cells. Hence PMA acts by relieving an early block to HSV infection caused by the rapid turnover of immediate-early RNA. This block is not caused by the production of soluble inhibitors and can also be relieved by treatment with other agents that cause macrophage differentiation such as 1, 25 dihydroxycholecalciferol. These findings therefore indicate that the non-permissivity of undifferentiated U937 cells for HSV is mediated by post-transcriptional regulation of immediate-early gene expression.","['Kemp, L M', 'Estridge, J K', 'Brennan, A', 'Katz, D R', 'Latchman, D S']","['Kemp LM', 'Estridge JK', 'Brennan A', 'Katz DR', 'Latchman DS']","['Department of Biochemistry, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Dihydroxycholecalciferols)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/pathology', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Genes, Regulator/physiology', 'Genes, Viral/physiology', 'Herpes Simplex/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism/microbiology/pathology', 'Phagocytes/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Viral', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology']",,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1990 Jun;47(6):483-9. doi: 10.1002/jlb.47.6.483.,0741-5400 (Print) 0741-5400 (Linking),['10.1002/jlb.47.6.483 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Our study was designed to explore whether such factors are produced by K 562 malignant cells and whether these have a broader effect in altering neutrophil functions. After 48 h of in vitro culture of K 562 cells, the culture medium and the cells were separated, lyophilized, and extracted with ethanol. These K 562 products, i.e., either the cell or supernatant extract, inhibited both nonstimulated locomotion and locomotion induced either by FMLP or activated serum. Furthermore, K 562 products inhibited neutrophil adherence and oxidative burst induced by opsonized zymosan, whereas oxidative burst induced by PMA or FMLP was not altered. K 562 products had an inhibitory effect on the PMN binding to iC3b-coated particles. They did not modify Mo1 expression of resting cells, did not alter the up-regulation of the receptor induced by FMLP but inhibited the FMLP-induced capping of Mo1 Ag. Con A capping was also inhibited. Actin polymerization in FMLP-stimulated PMN, as measured by flow cytometry and phalloidin binding to F-actin, was inhibited by K 562 products. The inhibitory factor present in K 562 products (cell and culture supernatant) was purified in three steps including gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and IEF. The eluted active fraction corresponded to single band of about 8 kDa on SDS-PAGE. From these experiments, it is concluded that K 562 malignant cells in culture contain and release a low molecular mass factor (congruent to 8 kDa) that inhibits all adherence-related functions of neutrophils, whereas it does not alter FMLP- or PMA-induced oxidative burst. Further studies are needed to assess whether products of other tumor cells also act on the neutrophil by inhibiting adherence-related functions, Mo1 function and capping, and actin polymerization.","['Amar, M', 'Amit, N', 'Huu, T P', 'Chollet-Martin, S', 'Labro, M T', 'Gougerot-Pocidalo, M A', 'Hakim, J']","['Amar M', 'Amit N', 'Huu TP', 'Chollet-Martin S', 'Labro MT', 'Gougerot-Pocidalo MA', 'Hakim J']","['INSERM U. 294, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Xavier Bichat, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Concanavalin A)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*physiology', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Peptide Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Complement/physiology', 'Receptors, Concanavalin A/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Jun 15;144(12):4749-56.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

The present work, however, gives evidence that barbiturates inhibit inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in both intact and permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells by an effect on GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). Inhibition of hydrolysis was observed when intact cells were stimulated with antigen (DNP24 BSA) or with oligomers of IgE. The inhibition was dependent on the concentration and type of barbiturate used with an order of inhibitory action of secobarbital less than S(-) pentobarbital less than pentobarbital less than R(+) pentobarbital less than phenobarbital. The relatively inactive analogue, (1'RS, 3'SR) 3-hydroxypentobarbital caused little (less than 30% at 1 mM) or no inhibition (at 0.1-0.5 mM). In permeabilized cells, the hydrolysis induced by DNP24 BSA and the nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, GTP gamma S (2-100 microM), was also inhibited by pentobarbital. The inhibition of hydrolysis was decreased as pH increased, and was no longer apparent at pH 7.8, a possible indication that the inhibitory effect was due to the unionized form of the drug. In permeabilized cells, the inhibition by pentobarbital occurred in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and was uncompetitive in nature (Km = 7.1 microM for GTP in controls vs. 1.6 microM in the presence of 0.5 mM pentobarbital). Taken together, the data suggest that barbiturates alter the activity of G-proteins independently of Ca2+, and the inhibition may depend on both the hydrophobic properties and the stereospecific and structural features of the molecule.","['Robinson-White, A J', 'Muldoon, S M', 'Elson, L', 'Collado-Escobar, D M']","['Robinson-White AJ', 'Muldoon SM', 'Elson L', 'Collado-Escobar DM']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anesthesiology,Anesthesiology,1300217,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Barbiturates)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '1P7H87IN75 (Secobarbital)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'I4744080IR (Pentobarbital)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Barbiturates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoglobulin E/pharmacology', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Pentobarbital/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Secobarbital/pharmacology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anesthesiology. 1990 Jun;72(6):996-1004. doi: 10.1097/00000542-199006000-00009.,0003-3022 (Print) 0003-3022 (Linking),['10.1097/00000542-199006000-00009 [doi]'],,['1R29 GM38021-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Anesthesiology. 1990 Jun;72(6):959-61.

Transgenic chickens were only made by retroviral vectors based on avian leukemia virus (ALV) and reticuloendotheliosis (REV) genomes. A replication-defective retroviral vector is preferentially used because these do not induce infectious virus. Since chickens are lacking endogenous REV sequences, a replication defective REV vector is most useful for practical application. Transgenic disease resistance is most likely obtained by blocking of viral receptors. By this approach recently transgenics with resistance against ALV infection were made at the Regional Poultry Disease Laboratory in East Lansing. Inhibition of virus replication by antisense DNA, which is complementary to viral mRNA, is promising for the future. Considerable research efforts still have to be made, however. Production of biomedical proteins will most likely be the first practical use of transgenic chickens. For the time being, vaccines will be used for the control of infectious diseases. The current live-virus vaccines will be replaced by inactivated (sub-unit) vaccines and thereafter by recombinant DNA vaccines based on viral vectors.","['de Boer, G F', 'van Woensel, P A']","['de Boer GF', 'van Woensel PA']","['Centraal Diergeneeskundig Instituut, Afd.

It is likely to be recommended for routine use in healthy children, either administered singly or as a combination of MMR. Healthy children who have been immunized develop excellent antibody and cell-mediated responses to VZV in the absence of significant adverse effects, and they are well protected against subsequent infection with VZV. Although it will not be known for certain for many years, it seems most unlikely that immunization will result in an increased incidence of zoster, a secondary type of infection with VZV that is caused by reactivation of latent VZV. Varicella vaccine may also be given to healthy adults who have never had chickenpox with a great degree of success, although its protection is somewhat less effective than in children. Leukemic children who are at high risk for developing severe or fatal varicella also derive a great deal of protection from varicella vaccine, but the vaccine must be administered to them with great caution. Other viral vaccines that may be licensed in the future but that are not as fully developed as varicella vaccine include vaccines against CMV, hepatitis A, HSV, and AIDS. These are in various degrees of study, and, should any of them be licensed, it is uncertain whether they would be live attenuated, recombinant, or subunit vaccines. It is hoped, however, that they will eventually be licensed for future use because if effective, they could significantly decrease morbidity and mortality of infants, children, and adults.","['Gershon, A A']",['Gershon AA'],"['College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Clin North Am,Pediatric clinics of North America,0401126,"['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Chickenpox Vaccine', 'Child', 'Forecasting', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Licensure', 'Risk Factors', 'United States', 'Vaccines, Attenuated', '*Viral Vaccines']",73,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Clin North Am. 1990 Jun;37(3):689-707. doi: 10.1016/s0031-3955(16)36911-5.,0031-3955 (Print) 0031-3955 (Linking),"['S0031-3955(16)36911-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0031-3955(16)36911-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The method permitted preselection for fusion of transformants producing antibodies of certain specificities and/or class. Fourteen HuMAbs, primarily of the IgM class, have been obtained. Those IgM HuMAbs obtained from patients with active diseases, e.g. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (3 HuMAbs), and HIV infection (4 HuMAbs), were found to have a relatively broad spectrum of reactivity with cell lines of various hematopoietic lineages and normal cells, although several show selective reactivity with T cell lineage tumors or a selected population of cells. HuMAbs from normal donors of both the IgG and IgM class were obtained. The IgM HuMAbs from one volunteer reacted primarily with autologous and allogeneic macrophages (autologous PBM from the other patients were not available) as well as a diverse number of hematopoietic cell lines. From others, the IgG HuMAbs demonstrated a more restricted spectrum of reactivity, while the IgM HuMAbs reacted with both autologous and allogeneic normal cells. Thus, the B cell repertoire contains cells capable of secreting cell surface reactive antibodies and many of these antibodies express characteristics of autoantibodies. Those that did not react with autologous or allogeneic PBM may react with other autoantigens which have been expressed on the malignant cells used as screening targets or may represent true antitumor antibodies.","['Posner, M R', 'Elboim, H S', 'Tumber, M B', 'Cannon, T J']","['Posner MR', 'Elboim HS', 'Tumber MB', 'Cannon TJ']","['Roger Williams Cancer Center, Providence, RI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hybridoma,Hybridoma,8202424,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hybridoma. 1990 Apr;9(2):97-110. doi: 10.1089/hyb.1990.9.97.,0272-457X (Print) 0272-457X (Linking),['10.1089/hyb.1990.9.97 [doi]'],,"['R01 AI26926/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA50054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Thus far, only three cases have been reported, each terminating in myeloid leukemia. The macrophage/monocyte rather than T-cell origin of ""plasmacytoid T-cells"" in reactive lymph nodes has been suggested in the past, but there has been no extensive investigation to demonstrate whether the PTLs are also of this lineage. The authors now report on a patient with PTL who had a long history of clinically stable idiopathic myelofibrosis. Immunocytochemical staining of the neoplastic plasmacytoid cells, with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies used on fresh-frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections, showed that the neoplastic cells expressed several macrophage/monocyte-associated markers, i.e., CD31, CD36 (thrombospondin receptor), and CD68 (KP1). Other markers of the macrophage/monocyte lineage (e.g., CD11b, CD11c, CD16) were absent. The neoplastic cells lacked B-cell-associated antigens and lacked most T-cell-associated markers, with the exception of CD2 and CD4. These findings are in close agreement with those of previous studies on normal plasmacytoid T-cells and support the macrophage/monocytic origin of PTL. Molecular hybridization studies provided additional support for the nonlymphoid origin of the plasmacytoid cells by demonstrating the absence of T-cell-receptor beta-chain and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements in the neoplastic cells.

On the other hand, the same sequence can be included in the pathogenic retrovirus genome, as shown by oligonucleotide mapping. However, since the complete env gene sequence was not known, the comparison of genomic nucleotide sequences was not possible. Therefore an avian endogenous provirus with an intact env gene was cloned from a chicken gene bank and the regions coding for the C terminus of the gp85 and gp37 proteins were sequenced. Comparison of this sequence with those of other retroviruses proved that one of the pathogenic viruses associated with osteopetrosis is a cross between avian endogenous virus and Rous sarcoma virus. Retroviruses and, especially, endogenous retroviruses are traditionally of the most developed models of viral carcinogenesis. Many endogenous retroviruses are implicated in neoplastic transformation of the cell. For instance, endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus of some inbred lines appears to be the only causative agent in these mammary cancers. Other even nonpathogenic murine endogenous retroviruses are involved in the origination of MCF-type recombinant acute leukosis viruses. Some endogenous retroviruses are implicated in the transduction or activation of cellular protooncogenes. Our interest in endogenous viruses is based on their ability to make cells resistant to exogenous retroviruses. Expression of their major envelope glycoprotein leads to cellular surface receptor blockage and imparts immunity to infection by the related leukemia retroviruses.

In TCR gamma, rearrangement of C gamma was seen in six of 20 cases of ATLL-W, none of three ATLL-O cases and three of six cases of non-ATLL. V gamma rearrangement occurred in 14 of 18 cases of ATLL-W, one of two cases of ATLL-O, and three of six cases of non-ATLL.

The incidence rate of rearrangement of V gamma families of V gamma 1, V gamma 2, and V gamma 3 was nearly the same in each group, except for deletion of V gamma 3, which was often observed in ATLL but was absent in non-ATLL.

Other reported differentiation events include diminished cell proliferation and the induction by gamma-interferon (IFN gamma) of Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G1 (Fc gamma RI). In this study, we differentiated U937 cells and high Fc gamma RI-expression mutants of U937 cells by treating them with IFN gamma. We compared the time courses over which surface Fc gamma RI became maximal, NADPH oxidase activity was induced, and the antiproliferative effect of IFN gamma was detected. Oxidase activity was measured by stimulating cells with PMA or by activating surface Fc gamma RI using aggregated human IgG1 or second antibody crosslinking of mAb 32/Fc gamma RI complexes. We found that IFN gamma in the absence of additional lymphokines induced high levels of oxidase activity in maximally differentiated U937 cells with even higher levels in the fully differentiated high-Fc gamma RI expression mutants (greater than 8 nmoles/10(6) cells/min for A12.13 cells). Over the course of differentiation, maximal induced levels of Fc gamma RI were reached after 1 to 2 days of IFN gamma treatment, prior to the antiproliferative effect of the lymphokine. In contrast, oxidase activity was induced after a lag of approximately 2 days, becoming maximal only after 4 to 6 days of IFN gamma treatment. This comparison of the induction of Fc gamma RI with that of oxidase activity triggered through Fc gamma RI indicated that the rapid increase of surface receptor was not accompanied by a completion of the pathway of Fc gamma RI-mediated oxidase activity. However, the time courses of induction detected by PMA and Fc gamma RI-agonists were coincident suggesting that the development of oxidative capacity could be due to the induction of components required by both the PMA- and surface receptor-mediated pathways. There are several oxidase components that are known to be IFN gamma-inducible, such as the oxidase flavoprotein, a b558 cytochrome peptide, and oxidase-requiring cytosolic components, and it is possible that one or a set of these components could be the limiting factor(s) for IFN gamma-induced oxidase activity.","['Pfefferkorn, L C', 'Guyre, P M', 'Fanger, M W']","['Pfefferkorn LC', 'Guyre PM', 'Fanger MW']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Receptors, Fc/*analysis', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1990 Mar;27(3):263-72. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(90)90139-q.,0161-5890 (Print) 0161-5890 (Linking),['10.1016/0161-5890(90)90139-q [doi]'],,"['AI19053/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

To investigate the relationship between transformation and trans-activation by v-myb, we constructed 15 in-frame linker insertion mutants. The 12 mutants which transformed myeloid cells also trans-activated gene expression, whereas the 3 mutants which did not transform also did not trans-activate. This implies that trans-activation is required for transformation by v-myb. One of the transformation-defective mutants localized to the cell nucleus but failed to bind DNA. The other two transformation-defective mutants localized to the cell nucleus and bound DNA but nevertheless failed to trans-activate. These latter mutants define two distinct domains of p48v-myb which control trans-activation by DNA-bound protein, one within the amino-terminal DNA-binding domain itself and one in a carboxyl-terminal domain which is not required for DNA binding.","['Lane, T', 'Ibanez, C', 'Garcia, A', 'Graf, T', 'Lipsick, J']","['Lane T', 'Ibanez C', 'Garcia A', 'Graf T', 'Lipsick J']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Transposable Elements', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', '*Oncogenes', 'Plasmids', 'Quail', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation']",,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Jun;10(6):2591-8. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.6.2591-2598.1990.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),['10.1128/mcb.10.6.2591-2598.1990 [doi]'],PMC360617,"['KO4-CA-01457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-43592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Genes of the MHC were shown to exert a major influence on the development of disease and the extent of virus spread in mice infected as adults. Strains bearing the b, f, k, q, r, and s haplotypes were moderately to highly susceptible to MAIDS whereas mice of the d haplotype were the most resistant. Resistance to disease was strongly associated with inhibition of mink cell focus-inducing virus spread and, to a lesser extent, with inhibition of ecotropic virus expression. Mapping studies localizing resistance associated with the d haplotype to H-2Dd were confirmed by the demonstration that B6 mice carrying this gene as a transgene or by recombination were resistant to disease. Penetrance of resistance to disease associated with expression of H-2Dd was markedly influenced by MHC genes mapping to the left of H-2D and by non-MHC loci such that some strains bearing this gene were highly susceptible to MAIDS. The combined effects of MHC and background genes among 40 strains examined yielded a remarkably wide spectrum of disease phenotypes with the onset of advanced disease ranging from 10 wk to 72 wk postinfection. Resistance to disease in moderately to highly resistant strains was shown to develop with age.

A possible regulatory mechanism for TNF-alpha production.,8751-9,"We examined the characteristics of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors expressed on immature mouse myeloid leukemic cells (M1), M1 cells induced to differentiate into macrophages, and macrophage cells (Mm1 cells) by binding studies with radioiodinated TNF. Scatchard analysis of TNF binding revealed that a single class of high affinity receptor was present and that 750-1,100 receptors were expressed on each immature M1 cell. The number of TNF receptors was increased 1.5-2-fold on differentiated M1 cells and 4-5-fold on Mm1 cells with no change in affinity. The addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) up-regulated the expression of TNF receptors in differentiated M1 cells and Mm1 cells, while immature M1 cells were insensitive to IFN-gamma. The number of TNF receptors on the differentiated cells was increased 4-5-fold by the treatment with IFN-gamma with no change in the binding constant. The affinity of TNF receptors to human TNF-alpha (Kd = 1.7-2.8 nM) was lower than that to murine TNF-alpha (Kd = 0.2-0.7 nM). The assays for cell growth and [3H]thymidine incorporation suggested that no relation exists between the sensitivity of the cells to TNF-alpha and the number of TNF receptors. Enhancement of TNF-mediated cytotoxicity by the treatment with IFN-gamma did not correlate with increases in the number of TNF receptors. Cytolytic assays using L929 cells demonstrated that the amount of constitutive and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of TNF-alpha was markedly increased during differentiation. Both the constitutive expression and IFN-gamma-mediated superinduction of TNF receptors, and the constitutive and LPS-induced secretion of TNF-alpha were closely related to the extent of cellular differentiation along the monocytic pathway. The time course of LPS-induced TNF-alpha activity showed a rise-and-decline profile with a peak at 2 h. On the other hand, the time course of the number of cell surface TNF receptors showed a decline-and-rise profile, a mirror image of the TNF-alpha activity time course profile in the supernatant. Anti-TNF-alpha antibody treatment blocked the LPS-induced down-regulation of TNF receptors and increased TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation.

Tumor ascertainment was through death certificates and the tumor registries maintained in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The rationale for the study stemmed from the evidence that a significant proportion of such childhood tumors as retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor arise on the basis of a mutant gene inherited from one parent plus a second somatic cell mutation involving the allele of this gene. Gonadal radiation doses were calculated by the recently established DS86 system, supplemented by an ad hoc system for those children for one or both of whose parents a DS86 dose could not be computed but for whom an ad hoc dose could be developed on the basis of the available information. The total data set consisted of (1) a cohort of 31,150 live-born children one or both of whose parents received greater than 0.01 Sv of radiation at the time of the atomic bombings (average conjoint gonad exposure 0.43 Sv) and (2) two suitable comparison groups totaling 41,066 children. Altogether, 43 malignant tumors were ascertained in the children of exposed parents, and 49 malignant tumors were ascertained in the two control groups. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed no increase in malignancy in the children of exposed parents. However, examination of the data suggested that only 3.0-5.0% of the tumors of childhood that were observed in the comparison groups are associated with an inherited genetic predisposition that would be expected to exhibit an altered frequency if the parental mutation rate were increased.

First-generation fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the number of antigen-specific antibody-producing clones generated. Hybrid cell colonies that initially secreted antibodies were selected from first-generation heteromyelomas to function as second-generation fusion partners. Although fusion efficiencies for both generations did not differ, the second-generation heteromyelomas yielded a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones. Fusion of hteromyelomas with either lymph node cells or splenocytes indicated that fusion with lymph node cells results in a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones, whereas fusion efficiency was found to be higher with splenocytes. The optimal time intervals between the final booster injection and fusion were found to be 4 days for splenocytes and 7 days for lymph node cells.

FIV infections were confirmed by Western blot analysis, antibodies against the 15 and 27 kDa proteins being used as definitive markers. FIV infection was diagnosed in one cat sampled in 1968 and in eight other cats sampled before 1975 in New York City. Illnesses exhibited by coinfected cats were similar to those of cats infected with FeLV only. Two unrelated cats with multicentric fibrosarcomas were found to be simultaneously infected with FIV, FeLV, and feline sarcoma virus. FIV was less contagious than FeLV in 73 cats residing in an exposure household between 1977 and 1980 as determined by evaluation of sera collected sequentially. In this household, 15 resident cats became FeLV infected whereas no cats contracted FIV infection. Comparison of serologic results from 53 cats with leukemia/lymphoma and matched controls confirmed a strong correlation between FeLV viremia and leukemia/lymphoma. A significant correlation between FIV infection and lymphoproliferative malignancies was also found independent of FeLV infection.","['Shelton, G H', 'Grant, C K', 'Cotter, S M', 'Gardner, M B', 'Hardy, W D Jr', 'DiGiacomo, R F']","['Shelton GH', 'Grant CK', 'Cotter SM', 'Gardner MB', 'Hardy WD Jr', 'DiGiacomo RF']","['Feline Retrovirus Immunology Program, Pacific Northwest Research Foundation, Seattle, Washington 98122.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cat Diseases/epidemiology/*microbiology/transmission', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*veterinary', 'Serologic Tests', 'United States/epidemiology']",,1990/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1990;3(6):623-30.,0894-9255 (Print) 0894-9255 (Linking),,,"['R01CA-16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA-21620/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA-43371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

However, suppressive doses of single-agent AZT caused anemia after 20 days of therapy. Combining rHuIFN-alpha A/D with AZT allowed drastic dose reductions for each agent while maintaining greater than or equal to 93% inhibition of splenomegaly. No clinically significant toxicity was seen. Computer analysis with the isobologram technique and combination index method showed that these combination regimens were highly synergistic. A 20-day course of AZT + rHuIFN-alpha A/D started 4 h after virus exposure was protective against RLV viremia and disease.

In both cell lines, a good correlation with HCPT-induced cytotoxicity was observed. Similar results were achieved in wild-type cells treated with m-AMSA.

The data suggest that the principle mechanisms for HCPT-induced cytotoxicity in HL-60 and HL-60/m-AMSA cells are inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I and production of protein-associated DNA strand breaks.","['Ling, Y H', 'Andersson, B S', 'Nelson, J A']","['Ling YH', 'Andersson BS', 'Nelson JA']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University of Texas M.

We have studied the expression of the EPA/TIMP gene at the mRNA and protein levels during 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced megakaryoblastic differentiation of K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Northern hybridization analysis showed that the EPA/TIMP mRNA was increased within 3 hours of TPA-induction and reached maximal levels (about 50-fold induction) during the first day of treatment. The expression of mRNAs for two major metalloproteinases, collagenase-I and stromelysin, were activated in parallel in the differentiation-induced K562 cells. The increase of EPA/TIMP mRNA correlated with increased EPA/TIMP protein biosynthesis and secretion: the TPA-induced cells secreted substantially enhanced amounts of metabolically labeled proteins, of which EPA/TIMP represented up to 50% after the first day of treatment (over 100-fold induction). The induction of EPA/TIMP mRNA was associated with its increased transcription. EPA/TIMP induction required continuous protein synthesis, being completely inhibited by addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide simultaneously with TPA, but only partially inhibited in a time-dependent manner if cycloheximide was added after TPA. Unlike in other cells tested, the jun and c-fos transcription factor mRNAs showed a prolonged biphasic induction response in K562 cells during TPA treatment. This response was associated with enhanced activity of a transfected recombinant reporter plasmid containing binding sites for the jun/fos transcription factor complex (AP-1) similar to the TPA-responsive element (TRE) sequence we found in the EPA/TIMP gene promoter. We suggest that the induction of EPA/TIMP and several other genes specific for the differentiating K562 cells may be a consequence of the sustained activation of immediate early genes encoding transcription factors, such as jun and c-fos.","['Alitalo, R', 'Partanen, J', 'Pertovaara, L', 'Holtta, E', 'Sistonen, L', 'Andersson, L', 'Alitalo, K']","['Alitalo R', 'Partanen J', 'Pertovaara L', 'Holtta E', 'Sistonen L', 'Andersson L', 'Alitalo K']","['Transplantation Laboratory, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microbial Collagenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 May 15;75(10):1974-82.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)84327-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

In the SFFVDF genome, the env deletion was filled in with the corresponding env sequence of Friend mink cell focus-forming virus, whereas the 6-base-pair duplication and the single base insertion near the 3' terminus of SFFV env remained intact. SFFVDF was nonpathogenic in adult mice. During passage of SFFVDF through newborn mice, we recovered various pathogenic variant SFFVs. Molecular analyses of variant SFFV genome DNAs revealed the presence of a distinct deletion in each env gene, which was similar but not identical to that in the wild-type SFFV env. Starting with the SFFVDF genome DNA, other mutant SFFV genome DNAs were constructed in which the sequence coding for the gp70/p15E proteolytic cleavage site present in the SFFVDF genome was modified by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to prevent the cleavage. These mutant SFFVs were also nonpathogenic. These results indicate that for the pathogenic activity of gp55, a certain env deletion is necessary which causes production of a gp70-p15E fusion protein with an absence of at least the N-terminal one-third of the p15E-coding region.","['Watanabe, N', 'Nishi, M', 'Ikawa, Y', 'Amanuma, H']","['Watanabe N', 'Nishi M', 'Ikawa Y', 'Amanuma H']","['Laboratory of Gene Technology and Safety, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, rev/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genes, rev', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics']",,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Jun;64(6):2678-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.6.2678-2686.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.6.2678-2686.1990 [doi]'],PMC249446,,,['J Virol 1990 Nov;64(11):5694'],,,,

Binding of [3H]VD3 was saturable, with approximately 2000-3000 sites/cell, and half-maximal binding occurring at 0.21-0.33 nM. Treatment of RWLeu-4 cells with VD3 induced 24R-hydroxylase activity, a marker of vitamin D3 responsiveness in many tissues. Exposure of RWLeu-4 cells to VD3 also inhibited proliferation and DNA synthesis with a 50% effective dose of 3.5-10 nM within 72 h; in addition, protein and RNA synthesis were inhibited by VD3 treatment. Exposure of RWLeu-4 cells to 5 nM VD3 for 72 h caused 50% of the cells to differentiate into macrophage/monocyte type cells as judged by nitroblue tetrazolium staining and adherence to plastic. Progressive expression of cell surface maturation-specific antigens of the monocyte/macrophage lineage was induced by treatment of RWLeu-4 cells with VD3 for 24 to 72 h at doses that inhibited cellular proliferation. c-myc RNA, which is constitutively expressed in RWLeu-4 cells, increased after 0.5 h of treatment with 50 nM VD3 and then rapidly decreased to barely detectable levels after 4 h of treatment. Finally, the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity associated with the p210bcr-abl oncogene product was decreased approximately 50% by VD3 treatment. Because of the presence of a functional receptor-effector system for VD3 and multiple biological responses to the hormone, these cells provide a unique model system with which to probe the specific effects of VD3 on cell growth and differentiation in chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Lasky, S R', 'Bell, W', 'Huhn, R D', 'Posner, M R', 'Wiemann, M', 'Calabresi, P', 'Eil, C']","['Lasky SR', 'Bell W', 'Huhn RD', 'Posner MR', 'Wiemann M', 'Calabresi P', 'Eil C']","['Department of Medicine, Roger Williams General Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/physiology', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase']",,1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 May 15;50(10):3087-94.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['P30-CA13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA38687/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA50558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Exploiting the additional immune privilege of the anterior chamber of the nude mouse eye, a novel method of direct heterotransplantation of cells from childhood leukemias and lymphomas has been developed. The establishment and characterization of 18 lymphoid xenograft cell lines maintained in the nude mouse intraocular model are reported. Cell sources for heterotransplantation were specimens of bone marrow, peripheral blood, or lymphomatous masses obtained at either diagnosis or recurrence of disease in the patients. The 18 patients and resultant cell lines were grouped into four immunophenotypic categories: Category 1, B-lineage (pre-B and early pre-B), ""common"" acute lymphatic leukemias; Category 2, cell lines of similar immunophenotype derived from patients with unusual features; Category 3, B-cell neoplasms and cell lines; and Category 4, neoplasms and cell lines in part or totally of T-cell origin. With reference to these groupings, rates of ingraftment from clinical specimens varied according to immunophenotype and disease status: Category 1, 1 of 15 at diagnosis, 5 of 7 at relapse; Category 2, 1 of 1 at diagnosis, 2 of 2 at relapse; Category 3, 6 of 6 at diagnosis; and Category 4, 2 of 9 at diagnosis, 1 of 1 with persistent disease. Rearrangements of the genes for immunoglobulin heavy chain or kappa light chain and for beta subunit of the T-cell receptor gene were demonstrated according to immunophenotype, with the exception of one cell line which showed no rearrangements. Evidence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA was shown in only one cell line, of B-cell immunophenotype. Cytology, histopathology, and electron microscopy in representative patient and xenograft samples demonstrated correlations between the specimens of origin and cells or sections from ingrafted tumors in mice. It is concluded that the direct heterotransplantation of cells from childhood leukemias and lymphomas to the anterior chamber of the nude mouse eye provides a relevant and reproducible model for the maintenance and study of human lymphoid neoplasms.","['White, L', 'Trickett, A', 'Norris, M D', 'Tobias, V', 'Sosula, L', 'Marshall, G M', 'Stewart, B W']","['White L', 'Trickett A', 'Norris MD', 'Tobias V', 'Sosula L', 'Marshall GM', 'Stewart BW']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Unit, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Anterior Chamber', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 May 15;50(10):3078-86.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase in purified rat brain synaptosomal membranes by these lipids, in contrast to ouabain, was subject to membrane surface dilution and unaffected by whether the reaction was started with KCl, NaCl, or ATP. Kinetic analysis indicated that the analogues, again dissimilar to ouabain, were likely to interact directly or indirectly with sodium-binding sites of Na,K-ATPase located at the intracellular surface of the plasma membrane, a conclusion also supported by studies using the inside-out vesicles of human erythrocyte membranes. The studies also showed that ouabain (but not the lipids) increased the affinity constant of Na,K-ATPase for K+, whereas the lipids (but not ouabain) increased that for Na+. The lipids also inhibited 86Rb uptake by intact human leukemia HL60 cells at potencies quite comparable to those seen for inhibition of purified protein kinase C or Na,K-ATPase. It is suggested that Na,K-ATPase (sodium pump) might represent a hitherto unrecognized site of action for the lipid analogues, and that the antineoplastic effects of the agents might be due to, in part, inhibition of both protein kinase C and Na,K-ATPase and perhaps other membrane-associated enzymes.","['Zheng, B', 'Oishi, K', 'Shoji, M', 'Eibl, H', 'Berdel, W E', 'Hajdu, J', 'Vogler, W R', 'Kuo, J F']","['Zheng B', 'Oishi K', 'Shoji M', 'Eibl H', 'Berdel WE', 'Hajdu J', 'Vogler WR', 'Kuo JF']","['Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phospholipids)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)']",IM,"['Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 May 15;50(10):3025-31.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['CA-29850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

In normal, mature cells, myeloperoxidase occurs exclusively as a dimer of Mr 150,000 while in immature leukemia cells, there are both monomeric (Mr 80,000) as well as dimeric species. Like other lysosomal enzymes, myeloperoxidase is synthesized as a larger glycosylated precursor (Mr 91,000) that undergoes processing through single-chain intermediates (Mr 81,000 and 74,000) to yield mature heavy (Mr 60,000) and light (Mr 15,000) subunits. To study the assembly of dimeric myeloperoxidase, azurophilic granules were isolated from either unlabeled or pulse-labeled ([35S]methionine/cysteine) HL-60 cells, and myeloperoxidase was extracted and separated into monomeric and dimeric forms by FPLC gel filtration chromatography. Steady-state levels of dimeric and monomeric myeloperoxidase were found to account for 67% and 33%, respectively, of the total peroxidase activity and were correlated with the levels of associated heme as measured by absorption at 430 nm. Labeled myeloperoxidase polypeptides were immunoprecipitated using a monospecific rabbit antibody and were identified and quantitated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/fluorography and liquid scintillation counting.

It was given in continuous i.v. infusion from day--8 to day 30 after BMT at a dose of 0.3 micrograms/kg/h. The patients were studied according to the risk factors for VOD: diagnosis, intensification of the conditioning and previous liver abnormalities. The diagnosis of VOD was made on at least two of the following factors: weight gain, hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascitis, pain of the right upper quadrant, increased platelet consumption. 109 patients were studied, 50 were treated by PGE1 and 59 did not receive it. The actuarial incidence of VOD was 12.2% in the PGE1 group and 25.5% in the non PGE1 group (P = 0.05). In acute leukaemia, the incidence was 39.1% in the non-treated group and 12.8% in the PGE1 treated group (P = 0.02). Patients with previous hepatitis had an incidence of 62.5% in the non treated group and 15.5% in the treated group (P = 0.05). A positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology seemed to increase the risk of VOD: the incidence of VOD was 31.4% in non-treated patients and 22% in PGE1 treated patients. The multivariate analysis of the risk factors for VOD shows that unfavourable factors were: recipient positive CMV serology (P = 0.06), hepatic disease prior to transplant (P = 0.02) and the absence of PGE1 treatment (P = 0.02). This study suggests that prophylactic PGE1 treatment may decrease the incidence of VOD in patients treated for leukaemia by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Gluckman, E', 'Jolivet, I', 'Scrobohaci, M L', 'Devergie, A', 'Traineau, R', 'Bourdeau-Esperou, H', 'Lehn, P', 'Faure, P', 'Drouet, L']","['Gluckman E', 'Jolivet I', 'Scrobohaci ML', 'Devergie A', 'Traineau R', 'Bourdeau-Esperou H', 'Lehn P', 'Faure P', 'Drouet L']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Alprostadil/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/complications', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Liver Diseases/complications', 'Risk Factors']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Mar;74(3):277-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02583.x.,0007-1048 (Print) 0007-1048 (Linking),['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02583.x [doi]'],,,['Br J Haematol. 1991 May;78(1):138-9.

Thrombin caused a transient fall in PtdInsP and PtdInsP2 levels, accompanied by a rise in diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid, indicative of a classical phospholipase C/diacylglycerol kinase pathway. However, the rise in phosphatidic acid preceded that of diacylglycerol, which is inconsistent with phospholipase C/diacylglycerol kinase being the sole source of phosphatidic acid. In the presence of ethanol, thrombin and other agonists (platelet-activating factor, adrenaline and ADP, as well as fetal-calf serum) stimulated the appearance of phosphatidylethanol, an indicator of phospholipase D activity. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and the protein kinase C activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) also elicited phosphatidylethanol formation, although A23187 was at least 5-fold more effective than PMA. Phosphatidylethanol production stimulated by agonists or A23187 was Ca2(+)-dependent, whereas that with PMA was not. These result suggest that phosphatidic acid is generated in agonist-stimulated HEL cells by two routes: phospholipase C/diacylglycerol kinase and phospholipase D.

Approximately 50 EBV genome equivalents were contained in CG2 and CG3 cells. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate the expression of EBV-encoded antigen (EBNA) in almost all cells of these two lines.

However, the biological significance of this heterogeneity and the mechanisms by which it is generated are poorly understood. We have studied a mouse model in which the envelope gene structure of lymphoma-associated viruses appears to be controlled by a single host gene. The inoculation of HRS and CWD mice with a leukemogenic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) results in recombination between the injected virus and envelope gene sequences of endogenous retroviruses. The genomes of HRS (class I) env recombinants and CWD (class II) env recombinants differ in the sequences encoding the NH2-terminal portion of the transmembrane envelope protein (TM). We have shown that an HRS gene linked to the MHC on chromosome 17 mediates a dominant selection for recombinant retroviruses with the class I envelope gene structure. CBA mice, which share the H-2k haplotype with HRS, also carry the dominant allele at this locus. This system provides a useful model for studies of host factors involved in the selection of specific variants of pathogenic retroviruses.","['Coppola, M A', 'Thomas, C Y']","['Coppola MA', 'Thomas CY']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville 22908.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1990 May 1;171(5):1739-52. doi: 10.1084/jem.171.5.1739.,0022-1007 (Print) 0022-1007 (Linking),['10.1084/jem.171.5.1739 [doi]'],PMC2187913,"['5-T32-CA-09109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-32995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

We found that neonatal CWD mice that were injected with the phenotypic mixture of the spontaneous CWD class II env recombinant, CWM-T-15, and the AKR endogenous ecotropic virus, Akv 623, developed non-T-cell lymphomas more rapidly than controls inoculated with either virus alone or with a CWD ecotropic virus. In contrast, CWN-T-25, a class II env MuLV that was recovered from a CWD mouse injected with the AKR ecotropic virus SL3-3, dramatically accelerated the onset of T-cell lymphomas in the same assay. Southern blots of the tumor DNAs from each set of animals revealed the integration of recombinant and ecotropic proviruses. We also found that there were differences in the nucleotide sequences of the viral enhancer elements of the CWD viruses. The results indicate that (1) the two CWD class II env recombinants that were tested contained oncogenic determinants; (2) phenotypic mixing with ecotropic viruses was required for the full expression of the pathogenic potential of the CWM-T-15 recombinant; and (3) the distinct phenotypes of the CWD viruses likely reflected the differences in the origin of the viral enhancer element.","['Thomas, C Y', 'Coppola, M A', 'Holland, C A', 'Massey, A C']","['Thomas CY', 'Coppola MA', 'Holland CA', 'Massey AC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Hospital, Charlottesville 22908.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', '*Recombination, Genetic']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1990 May;176(1):166-77. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(90)90241-i.,0042-6822 (Print) 0042-6822 (Linking),['10.1016/0042-6822(90)90241-i [doi]'],,"['AI 07957/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['GENBANK/M34722', 'GENBANK/M34723', 'GENBANK/M34724', 'GENBANK/M34725']",

In normal mouse tissues the gene is expressed in the embryonic neural tube, suggesting a developmental function, while in Drosophila the homolog of int-1 is the segment polarity gene wingless. In order to study the protein products of int-1 we have derived fibroblast cell lines infected with multiple copies of a retroviral vector expressing int-1 cDNA. By Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation we have identified a 44 kd form of int-1 protein which is secreted from these cells. The 44 kd species is distinct from the major intracellular forms of int-1 protein as judged by its slower mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by its longer half-life in pulse-chase experiments. Under normal growth conditions, little or none of the 44 kd protein is detectable in the cell culture medium but instead the majority is found associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The protein appears to bind heparin in vitro, suggesting that it might bind glycosaminoglycans in the ECM.

Maturing HL-205 cells acquired either granulocytic or monocytic markers, namely, reactivity with the murine OKM1 monoclonal antibody, expression of nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, and staining for nonspecific esterase. The maturing K-562-J cells stained with benzidine, which indicates the presence of hemoglobin, an erythroid maturation marker. Although the acquisition of the maturation markers in both HL-205 and K-562-J cells was time dependent up to 6 days, the kinetics of this induction differed between the two cell types. Despite the in vitro inhibitory effect of genistein, treatment of either HL-205 or K-562-J cells with 150 micrograms/ml genistein for up to 16 h did not alter topoisomerase II activity (as determined by the unknotting assay) in their nuclear extracts. Analysis with the anti-phosphotyrosine PY-20 murine monoclonal antibody indicated that treatment of K-562-J cells with genistein decreased the reactivity of the antibody with two of the cellular proteins. However, no reactivity with the PY-20 antibody was detected in untreated or genistein-treated HL-205 cells. An early event in the HL-205 and K-562-J cells, occurring after only 1 h of treatment with 30-200 micrograms/ml genistein, was the induction of DNA damage as measured by an alkaline elution assay.

Sensitivity to virus-induced T-cell lymphomagenesis was shown to involve early occurrence of Thy-positive PLC, found predominantly among thymocytes, whereas resistance was rather related with early identification of PLC-Thy-negative cells mostly among bone marrow cells. PLC were further characterized in the sensitive (BL/6 + A-RadLV) and resistant (BL/6 + D-RadLV) situations by testing in parallel the tumorigenic potential (using the transplantation bioassay method) and type of thymus and bone marrow cell populations separated by different methods such as size fractionation by centrifugal elutriation, cytotoxic elimination of lymphocytes, or panning. The early occurring PLC among thymocytes of BL/6 mice 10-20 days following infection with A-RadLV were shown to be cortisone-resistant, Thy+, CD4+, and/or CD8+ medium size dividing thymocytes. PLC among thymocytes of BL/6 mice + D-RadLV, identified among the medium and large cell fractions, were shown to be cortisone-resistant Thy-, CD4-CD8- lymphocytes. High tumorigenic potential of PLC was demonstrated only among unseparated or separated (on size basis) bone marrow cells of BL/6 + D-RadLV (72-84%), whereas unseparated or separated fractions of bone marrow from BL/6 + A-RadLV had a low lymphomagenic potential (15-20%). The parallelism between the bone marrow fractions that induced optimal thymus cellularity following reconstitution of lethally irradiated mice and optimal lymphomagenicity stress the prothymocyte characteristics of PLC among bone marrow cells of BL/6 mice infected with D-RadLV. It is suggested that in resistant and sensitive haplotypes RadLV variants infect different cell populations and thereby induce PLC which differ in their capacity to present associative MuLV antigens with self H-2.","['Gokhman, I', 'Peled, A', 'Haran-Ghera, N']","['Gokhman I', 'Peled A', 'Haran-Ghera N']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', 'V27W9254FZ (Cortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cortisone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 May 1;50(9):2554-61.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

As compared to the non-FeLV-exposed specific-pathogen-free (SPF) control cat neutrophil CL responses, both viremic and nonviremic FeLV-exposed cats showed significant decreases in their CL responsiveness. Neither ultraviolet light-inactivated FeLV (UV-FeLV) nor protein components (FeLV-p15E and FeLV-p27) caused a significant decrease in the CL responses of the SPF cat neutrophils.

Rat-1 cells and rat embryo fibroblasts (REF) immortalized by c-myc or E1A were transfected with a specific EBV DNA fragment coding for EBNA-1. Cloned cell lines which constitutively expressed this antigen were infected with HSV-1. Our results indicate that in EBNA-1-expressing cells, virus growth was higher than in control cells for different virus strains or rodent cell lines. This increase was maximal when cells were infected at low multiplicity, as determined by virus growth, and correlated with the stimulation of viral DNA synthesis. REF + c-myc and Vero cells were cotransfected by an EBNA-1 expression vector driven by Moloney murine leukaemia virus LTR and HSV-1 immediate-early (alpha 0) or early thymidine kinase upstream promoter regulatory regions linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding sequences as effectors. In both cell lines, stimulation of CAT expression by EBNA-1 was observed only with the immediate-early promoter.

The fos/jun heterodimer has a higher affinity to the TRE and stimulates transcription of responsive genes more than the jun homodimer. The association of these two oncoproteins may play a central role in signal transduction and regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. We further defined the regulation of fos and jun by studying their inducibility by second messengers in cells of hematopoietic origin. In THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells fos and jun mRNA levels are regulated in a coupled manner by second messengers activated after membrane phospholipid turnover. Addition of phospholipase C to cells, as well as stimulation of protein kinase C and release of intracellular Ca2+, caused a rapid induction of fos and jun mRNA levels, but the induction of jun mRNA showed a more persistant and less transient pattern than fos. In contrast to the phosphoinositol system, stimulation of the adenylate cyclase pathway in THP-1 cells induced only fos transcription whereas jun mRNA levels remained unchanged. A similar uncoupling of fos and jun inducibility was found after phorbol ester addition to the human erythroleukemia cell line HEL and the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60. The uncoupling of fos and jun levels might predispose cells to the formation of combinatorial transcription complexes of a different composition and activity than the fos/jun heterodimer. Indeed, nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells before or after activation of the phosphinositol or adenylate cyclase second messenger pathways revealed a correlation in fos and jun expression and specific binding of the heterocomplex to a TRE sequence.","['Auwerx, J', 'Staels, B', 'Sassone-Corsi, P']","['Auwerx J', 'Staels B', 'Sassone-Corsi P']","['Department of Developmental Biology, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Second Messenger Systems/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",,1990/01/25 00:00,1990/01/25 00:01,['1990/01/25 00:00'],"['1990/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 Jan 25;18(2):221-8. doi: 10.1093/nar/18.2.221.,0305-1048 (Print) 0305-1048 (Linking),['10.1093/nar/18.2.221 [doi]'],PMC330257,,,,,,,

While oncogenes such as v-myc and v-abl have been demonstrated to abrogate the requirement for exogenous growth factors, none have been shown to have an effect on the differentiation of these cell lines. In this report, we demonstrate that the introduction and expression of Abelson murine leukemia virus into a myeloblast progenitor cell line can promote further differentiation along the monocytic lineage. There is a marked alteration in cell morphology, the acquisition of Mac-1 antigen expression, the induction of nonspecific esterase expression and the induced ability to phagocytize opsonized zymosan. Thus, the expression of Abelson murine leukemia virus protein in interleukin-3-dependent hematopoietic progenitors can provide differentiation-inducing signals in cells which are arrested in differentiation. The potential role of Abelson murine leukemia virus gene products in normal hematopoietic cell differentiation and in transformation is discussed.","['Keller, J R', 'Ruscetti, S K', 'Ruscetti, F W']","['Keller JR', 'Ruscetti SK', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Biological Carcinogenesis Development Program, Program Resources, Inc., NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Maryland 21701.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl', '*Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Apr;5(4):549-55.,0950-9232 (Print) 0950-9232 (Linking),,,['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

This provirus is defective; it is very poorly expressed in young DBA/2 mice. The defect in Emv-3 is caused by a single base substitution in codon 3 of p15gag. The resulting amino acid substitution inhibits myristylation of the gag precursor and subsequent virus assembly. Despite this defect, percutaneous treatment of DBA/2 mice with the carcinogen and mutagen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induces ecotropic murine leukemia virus replication in virtually all treated mice. We hypothesized that this induction is the result of a DMBA-induced reverse mutation in codon 3 of p15gag which allows for efficient myristylation. We tested this hypothesis by isolating ecotropic viruses from DMBA-treated mice and determining the DNA sequences of selected regions of p15gag, including codon 3. In support of the above-described model, all of the viruses examined contained single nucleotide substitutions in codon 3. In addition, most of the replication-competent viruses that were sequenced appeared to result from simple mutation of Emv-3 rather than recombination with other endogenous murine leukemia viruses.

The chimeric Abelson murine leukemia viruses were able to mediate morphological and oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells and were able to abrogate the interleukin-3 dependence of a lymphoid cell line. We also found that a virus that contained both TPK and carboxy-terminal Drosophila abl regions had no in vitro transforming activity for primary bone marrow cells and lacked the ability to induce tumors in susceptible mice. A virus that replaced only a portion of the v-abl TPK region with that of Drosophila abl had low activity in in vitro bone marrow transformation and tumorigenesis assays.

The two visna virus peptides also inhibited the enzymatic activity of protein kinase C, thus providing a possible molecular mechanism by which they inhibit immune function.","['Ruegg, C L', 'Clements, J E', 'Strand, M']","['Ruegg CL', 'Clements JE', 'Strand M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Visna-maedi virus/immunology/*physiology']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 May;64(5):2175-80. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.5.2175-2180.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.5.2175-2180.1990 [doi]'],PMC249376,"['AI-28206/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-21916/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-23039/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The cis-acting sequences that control transcriptional induction by tax and by cyclic AMP are in close proximity within the HTLV-I promoter. By using a protein kinase A (PKA)-deficient S49 mutant cell line, the response of the viral promoter to cyclic AMP was shown to depend on PKA, whereas the response to tax did not require the activity of this enzyme. Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR by tax, however, decreased in PKA-deficient and adenylate cyclase-deficient cells. The evidence presented supports largely independent mechanisms of promoter induction by cyclic AMP and tax but also suggests a role for PKA-mediated phosphorylation in the regulation of HTLV-I LTR-driven gene expression by tax.","['Kadison, P', 'Poteat, H T', 'Klein, K M', 'Faller, D V']","['Kadison P', 'Poteat HT', 'Klein KM', 'Faller DV']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/deficiency/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Genes, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinases/deficiency/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 May;64(5):2141-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.5.2141-2148.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.5.2141-2148.1990 [doi]'],PMC249372,['T32CA099361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Interleukin-1 production was not affected but the numbers of splenic B cells were increased by the infection. 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) administered (a) intraperitoneally three times daily for 24 days beginning 4 h after virus inoculation in doses of 60 to 480 mg/kg/day, (b) in drinking water for 22 days beginning 4 h after virus inoculation in doses of 22 to 216 mg/kg/day, or (c) in drinking water for 29 days beginning 6 days after virus inoculation in doses of 22 to 216 mg/kg/day markedly inhibited FV-induced disease. In the mice receiving early-initiated AZT therapy, FV-induced splenomegaly and hematocrit values were inhibited and infectious centers in the spleen and FV titers in the plasma were reduced to below detectable levels at the higher AZT dosage levels. The percent of total T cells in splenic lymphocytes was increased in the infected, AZT-treated mice. In the intraperitoneal experiment, FV disease-induced death was prevented by treatment with all doses of AZT. Neutralizing antibody to FV was significantly reduced in all AZT-treated groups. Toxicologic manifestations of these AZT treatments included splenic enlargement and reduced hematocrit, although all treated, uninfected mice survived the treatments, gained weight, and displayed no significant effects on enumeration of T and B cells.","['Morrey, J D', 'Warren, R P', 'Okleberry, K M', 'Burger, R A', 'Johnston, M I', 'Sidwell, R W']","['Morrey JD', 'Warren RP', 'Okleberry KM', 'Burger RA', 'Johnston MI', 'Sidwell RW']","['AIDS Research Program, Utah State University, Logan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Genotype', 'HIV Infections/blood/*drug therapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/*drug therapy', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Zidovudine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1990;3(5):500-10.,0894-9255 (Print) 0894-9255 (Linking),,,['N01-AI-72662/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

VSV (MLV-E) pseudotype infection in five out of six mouse and rat cell lines was inhibited by NH4Cl, indicating that infection proceeds via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In contrast, NH4Cl treatment has no effect on the infection of XC cells in which MLV-E induces syncytia.

Its actions are mediated through its binding to cell surface CSF-1 receptors (CSF-1R) that exhibit ligand-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. CSF-1R-induced phosphorylation of intracellular protein substrates initiates a cascade of biochemical reactions that relay signals to the cell nucleus, elicit transcription of CSF-1-responsive genes and culminate in cell division. The actions of the CSF-1R kinase can be interrupted by binding of certain monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular domain of the receptor or by agents which activate protein kinase C and accelerate receptor turnover. CSF-1R is encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene, and specific genetic alterations, which constitutively activate the receptor kinase, provide sustained signals for cell growth leading to cell transformation. Perturbations in the structure or expression of the c-fms proto-oncogene might therefore contribute to leukemia.","['Sherr, C J']",['Sherr CJ'],"[""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Signal Transduction']",109,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1990 Jan;8 Suppl 1:46-60; discussion 60-2. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530080706.,0737-1454 (Print) 0737-1454 (Linking),['10.1002/stem.5530080706 [doi]'],,['R35-CA47064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Role of histidine and metals.,6693-9,"Activated neutrophils cause extensive DNA damage in neighboring nonphagocytic cells. To determine whether compounds in the extracellular milieu participate in the DNA damage process, murine neutrophils were cocultivated with target tumor cells in media of varying composition. Using the alkaline elution assay, it was found that the level of strand breaks induced was significantly higher (2.8-fold) in complex cell culture media than in minimal phosphate-buffered saline. Addition of amino acids in general and of histidine in particular increased the level of damage nearly to that observed in complete media (2.7- and 2.1-fold, respectively). The histidine stimulation was concentration-dependent and reached a maximum at 100-400 microM. The mechanism whereby this occurred is not proven but probably derived from chelation of metals and participation in a site-specific Fenton reaction. Addition of the cell-impermeable chelator EDTA dramatically inhibited induction of strand breaks by neutrophils in complete media and prevented the enhancement of damage induced by histidine in phosphate-buffered saline. None of the effects on neutrophil-induced damage could be attributed to modulation of the oxidative burst activity of the cells (O2- and H2O2 production). Histidine also enhanced induction of strand breaks by reagent H2O2. However, EDTA had no effect or actually increased the level of damage induced by both a bolus of H2O2 and a flux of H2O2 generated by glucose oxidase. The cell-permeable chelator o-phenanthroline inhibited both neutrophil- and H2O2-induced damage. The results indicate that secondary reactions involving extracellular amino acids and metals contribute significantly to neutrophil-induced DNA damage to neighboring cells. Moreover, the data show that the mechanism whereby neutrophils induce this damage cannot be attributed solely to secretion of H2O2.","['Shacter, E', 'Lopez, R L', 'Beecham, E J', 'Janz, S']","['Shacter E', 'Lopez RL', 'Beecham EJ', 'Janz S']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Metals)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Histidine/*pharmacology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Metals/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Plasmacytoma', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism']",,1990/04/25 00:00,1990/04/25 00:01,['1990/04/25 00:00'],"['1990/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Apr 25;265(12):6693-9.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)39206-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The system consisted of 2 lymphoma clones (A/63-I and A/63-2) derived from a single thymoma (A/63) induced by a wild-type Abelson-Moloney viral complex. Phenotype and genotype analyses revealed that both clones were derived from transformation of early T-cell precursors. An in vivo study of the colonizing potential following intravenous (i.v.) injection of clones showed that only the A/63-I cell clone colonized the liver. This observation was confirmed by quantitative analysis of organ distribution of both cell clones consecutive to i.v. injection of 125IUdR-labelled cells. In the same way, an in vitro study of the invasive potential of both clones was performed on frozen liver sections and showed that only the A/63-I cell clone had the ability to attach to liver. This specific adhesion was inhibited by L-fucose, D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (D-GalNAc) and with D-galactose- and L-fucose-containing neoglycoproteins. Differences in cell surface carbohydrates of the 2 cell clones were detected using various lectins: peanut agglutinin (PNA), Dolichos biflorus (DBA), Aleuria aurantia (AAA) and Galactia tenuiflora agglutinins (GTA). A/63-I was found to react strongly with PNA, DBA and GTA, and the removal of sialic acid by neuraminidase treatment increased DBA and PNA receptor sites of A/63-2 as compared to A/63-I. The present data suggest that cell-surface GalNAc, galactosyl and fucosyl residues are responsible for the ability of the A/63-I cell clone to recognize liver tissue probably through binding to a Kupffer-cell-associated lectin.","['Vavasseur, F', 'Berrada, A', 'Heuze, F', 'Jotereau, F', 'Meflah, K']","['Vavasseur F', 'Berrada A', 'Heuze F', 'Jotereau F', 'Meflah K']","['Universite de Nantes, CHRU-Hotel-Dieu, Laboratoire de Biochimie Medicale, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (galactose receptor)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/*secondary', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*metabolism']",,1990/04/15 00:00,1990/04/15 00:01,['1990/04/15 00:00'],"['1990/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 Apr 15;45(4):744-51. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910450429.,0020-7136 (Print) 0020-7136 (Linking),['10.1002/ijc.2910450429 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Initial therapy with the BMFT-ALL protocol (Bundesministerium fur Forschung und Technologie) reduced leukemic cells only marginally. The following high-dose Ara-C, mitoxantrone (HAM) chemotherapy led to a cell reduction of 75% and to a drastic change in cell morphology from initially 90% blasts to mainly small lymphoid cells. Immunophenotype, which showed 90% CD7-positive cells in the beginning with a prevalence of helper (60%) over suppressor cells (15%) remained fairly constant until the onset of HAM chemotherapy, which led to a sharp fall and a subsequent slow increase in all T-cell markers. In contrast to pretherapeutic findings, CD7 was now only expressed on the small cells and not on blast cells. Southern blot analysis of the T-cell receptor configuration revealed an initially monoclonal population with rearranged T beta gene. A new band appearing during the clinically ineffective therapy was indicative for development of a second small population which did, however, not emerge in immunophenotype analysis. This second population was eliminated by the HAM chemotherapy, leaving back the initial clone responsible for the final fatal outcome. No activity of the multidrug resistance gene could be detected by Northern blotting.","['Reichle, A', 'Volkmann, M', 'Pachmann, K', 'Diddens, H', 'Emmerich, B', 'Rastetter, J']","['Reichle A', 'Volkmann M', 'Pachmann K', 'Diddens H', 'Emmerich B', 'Rastetter J']","['I.

The lack of lineage specificity of immunoglobulin heavy chain and T-cell receptor beta and gamma gene probes in acute leukemia is well established. However, immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangement traditionally has been considered a highly specific indicator of a clonal B-lineage process. The authors describe a case of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in which Southern blot hybridization studies showed rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene. Unexpectedly, the immunoglobulin kappa light chain gene also was rearranged; no immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement was seen. Kappa rearrangement was confirmed with the use of three restriction endonucleases. No rearrangements were seen from normal skin tissue, making a restriction enzyme site polymorphism highly unlikely. Northern blot studies showed a normal-size, T-cell receptor beta chain gene transcript; no immunoglobulin RNA was identified. These results describe the first reported case of kappa light chain gene rearrangement in a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The findings emphasize the necessity of interpreting molecular hybridization studies in conjunction with routine morphology and immunophenotyping studies.","['Hanson, C A', 'Thamilarasan, M', 'Ross, C W', 'Stoolman, L M', 'Schnitzer, B']","['Hanson CA', 'Thamilarasan M', 'Ross CW', 'Stoolman LM', 'Schnitzer B']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0602.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics/immunology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Phenotype']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1990 Apr;93(4):563-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/93.4.563.,0002-9173 (Print) 0002-9173 (Linking),['10.1093/ajcp/93.4.563 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Investigation of the growth factor-independent phenotypes indicated that at least two different mechanisms for growth factor independence existed. One mechanisms was the activation of the IL-3 gene by mutation resulting in the constitutive expression of IL-3 and autocrine regulated growth. A second mechanisms results in IL-3-independent growth in a manner in which (1) constitutive tyrosine kinase activity was not seen and (2) c-myc transcription was constitutively activated. Interestingly, in these cells both the tyrosine phosphorylation and c-myc transcriptional pathways are still activatable following IL-3 stimulation. At present, the exact nature of the mutation that results in this phenotype is not known.","['Isfort, R J']",['Isfort RJ'],"['Human and Environmental Safety Division, Procter and Gamble Company, Miami Valley Laboratories, Cincinnati, Ohio 45239-8707.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'Q150359I72 (Azaguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azaguanine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Gene Frequency/*genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Markers', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/analysis', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-3/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tyrosine/genetics/metabolism']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 1990 Mar;16(2):109-21. doi: 10.1007/BF01233041.,0740-7750 (Print) 0740-7750 (Linking),['10.1007/BF01233041 [doi]'],,['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Somat Cell Mol Genet 1990 Jul;16(4):411'],,,,

As a first step toward identifying these host proteins, we have isolated and characterized several flat revertant cell lines from transformed lines carrying v-abl. Clonal transformed cell lines used as parental strains were prepared by infecting Rat-2 fibroblasts with A-MuLV, using M-MuLV as helper. A rhodamine dye screening procedure was used to obtain three clones of morphologically flat revertant cells. Each of the three lines was non-refractile and contact inhibited. All the lines retained a transformation-competent copy of A-MuLV; all released high titers of virus capable of inducing foci on previously uninfected Rat-2 cells.

We demonstrate that this transcript initiates from a promoter upstream of the germ line epsilon class-switch recombination region (S epsilon region). The major germ line C epsilon transcript contains a small 5' exon contributed by sequences upstream of the S epsilon region spliced to the normal C epsilon exons. Treatment of splenic B lymphoid cells with LPS plus IL-4 induces the expression of transcripts from the germ line epsilon transcription unit followed by expression of normal immunoglobulin epsilon heavy-chain mRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that similar treatment of transformed precursor B cell lines induces the expression of germ line epsilon transcripts followed by class switching to epsilon expression in these lines. This is the first demonstration of switching to epsilon in cells of the pre-B stage. The general structure of the germ line epsilon transcript and transcription unit is similar to that previously characterized for germ line gamma 2b transcripts. However, expression of these two germ line transcription units in B-lineage cells is inversely regulated by IL-4 (plus LPS) treatment, correlating with the effects of these treatments on switching to these loci.","['Rothman, P', 'Chen, Y Y', 'Lutzker, S', 'Li, S C', 'Stewart, V', 'Coffman, R', 'Alt, F W']","['Rothman P', 'Chen YY', 'Lutzker S', 'Li SC', 'Stewart V', 'Coffman R', 'Alt FW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin epsilon-Chains)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin/drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin epsilon-Chains/*genetics', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Apr;10(4):1672-9. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.4.1672-1679.1990.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),['10.1128/mcb.10.4.1672-1679.1990 [doi]'],PMC362272,"['AI200047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK01336/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['GENBANK/M34229', 'GENBANK/M34240']",

Both HIV-1 rev (rev1) and HIV-2 rev (rev2) could work in conjunction with this fragment. Further mapping showed that a 272-bp subfragment within the 1,042-bp region was sufficient as an RRE.

We also utilized this system to examine the ability of the rex genes of human T-cell leukemia virus types I and II to functionally substitute for rev. These experiments showed that complementation by both the rexI and rexII proteins required the presence of an RRE.

In the upstream enhancer region unique to BL/VL3, we detected several sequence-specific complexes, one with T-lymphocyte extracts but not with fibroblast extracts. This U3 region, UEB, may be important for the T-cell specificity of BL/VL3 RadLV. In the enhancer, which has been uniquely rearranged in this virus, we identified three specific protein-binding sites. Two of them showed characteristics of the LVb and core binding sites previously described for other murine retroviruses. But one binding site, identified as Rad-1, is unique to BL/VL3 RadLV and was found downstream, only 1 nucleotide from the core sequence. Rad-1 has a corelike motif on the minus strand, and the factor that binds to it could be competed by a BL/VL3 core-containing fragment. Moreover, the protein-DNA contacts involve the typical three core Gs separated by one T. These results suggest that Rad-1 binds a factor identical or similar to the core-binding factor. Our data suggest that the LVb, core, and Rad-1 motifs may be sufficient for this enhancer, most likely in association with other U3 long terminal repeat sequences, to promote a high rate of transcription of BL/VL3 RadLV in its specific target cells (thymocytes).","['Gorska-Flipot, I', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Gorska-Flipot I', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Apr;64(4):1566-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.4.1566-1572.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.4.1566-1572.1990 [doi]'],PMC249291,,,,,,,

Resistant cell lines were derived by exposure to either amsacrine or doxorubicin. The resistance factor was calculated as the ratio of the mean IC50 value for the resistant cell line to that for the parent line. IC50 was defined as the concentration of drug inhibiting cell growth to 50% of that in control (drug-free) cultures. Patterns of cross-resistance were visualized by plotting the deviations of resistance factors from the mean resistance factor, on a logarithmic scale. Considerable variations in resistance factors were noted for each cell subline as the amsacrine substituents were altered. Four main patterns were evident: a transport-related multidrug-resistance pattern (three sublines), a pattern similar to that for a murine P388 leukemia subline resistant to amsacrine, and two patterns not observed previously. Since some of the sublines tested showed evidence of altered topoisomerase II activity, it appears that changes in the resistance pattern in these lines may reflect changes in the stability of the ternary complexes formed by the drug, the altered enzyme, and the DNA. The resistance factor was reduced from more than 100-fold to about 13-fold in three of the sublines tested and from eightfold to twofold in two others. This finding suggests that appropriate drug design may overcome several forms of multidrug resistance in human leukemia and other types of cancer.","['Finlay, G J', 'Baguley, B C', 'Snow, K', 'Judd, W']","['Finlay GJ', 'Baguley BC', 'Snow K', 'Judd W']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland Medical School, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1990/04/18 00:00,1990/04/18 00:01,['1990/04/18 00:00'],"['1990/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 Apr 18;82(8):662-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/82.8.662.,0027-8874 (Print) 0027-8874 (Linking),['10.1093/jnci/82.8.662 [doi]'],,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 Apr 18;82(8):638-9.

The analogues were tested for activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). With variations in the length of the alkyl chain, the optimal activity was achieved with two carbons between the purine base and the phosphonomethoxy functionality. Despite the structural similarity and the close pKa2 value of 8 to that of PMEG, no phosphorylation of 8 was observed by the bovine brain guanylate kinase. Since all isosteric analogues of PMEG (7-9) were not inhibitory against HSV-1 and HSV-2, the presence of the 3'-oxygen atom in the PME purines proved critical for anti-HSV activity. Introduction of the 1'-methyl group on the PMEG side chain significantly reduced its anti-HSV activity. Analogue 11, which is a mimic of the phosphate by incorporation of the alpha,alpha-difluoro carbon, was ineffective against HSV-1 and HSV-2. These results suggest that the structural requirements of PME purines for anti-HSV activity appear to be very strict.","['Kim, C U', 'Luh, B Y', 'Misco, P F', 'Bronson, J J', 'Hitchcock, M J', 'Ghazzouli, I', 'Martin, J C']","['Kim CU', 'Luh BY', 'Misco PF', 'Bronson JJ', 'Hitchcock MJ', 'Ghazzouli I', 'Martin JC']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pharmaceutical Research and Development Division, Wallingford, Connecticut 06492.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Purines)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Organophosphonates/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Purines/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/drug effects', 'Simplexvirus/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1990 Apr;33(4):1207-13. doi: 10.1021/jm00166a019.,0022-2623 (Print) 0022-2623 (Linking),['10.1021/jm00166a019 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Varicella Vaccine Collaborative Study Group.,661-6,"Protection against varicella infection was assessed in leukemic children and healthy young adults who were immunized with live attenuated varicella vaccine. Attack rates of breakthrough infection following household exposure to varicella in 102 children and 26 adults were similar whether one or two doses of vaccine had been given. The mild breakthrough illness was also similar after one or more doses. Specific antibody titers were similar 1 year after immunization whether individuals had received one or two doses. Humoral and cell-mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was lower in these vaccinees than in persons who had experienced natural varicella infection. Protection after natural infection in adult family members exposed to varicella was superior to that in vaccinees; none developed varicella infection. These observations suggest that immunization induces less protection than does natural disease in leukemic children and young adults. This may be partly due to the nature of the vaccine virus, but because responses of adults were similar to those of leukemic children, it suggests also that both of these groups have impaired immune responses to VZV. Boosting of humoral immunity after exposure to VZV was common and was observed in healthy adults with past natural infection and in vaccinated adults and leukemic children.","['Gershon, A A', 'Steinberg, S P']","['Gershon AA', 'Steinberg SP']","['Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York City.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Chickenpox/*prevention & control', 'Chickenpox Vaccine', 'Child', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/immunology', '*Viral Vaccines/immunology']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 1990 Apr;161(4):661-6. doi: 10.1093/infdis/161.4.661.,0022-1899 (Print) 0022-1899 (Linking),['10.1093/infdis/161.4.661 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

It is likely the V kappa and VH genes arose from these respective germ-line genes via somatic mutation or from closely related genes. V kappa III genes have frequently been used by other IgMk mAb especially those with rheumatoid factor activity, and the VH26 gene with no somatic mutation has been used by several anti-DNA antibodies, suggesting the possibility of preferential association of these or related germ-line genes with autoantibodies. The minor differences between the sequences of POP's VH and V kappa genes and sequences used by other autoantibodies, may be responsible for this antibody's crossreactivity with myelin and, as a result, the autoimmune neuropathy.","['Spatz, L A', 'Wong, K K', 'Williams, M', 'Desai, R', 'Golier, J', 'Berman, J E', 'Alt, F W', 'Latov, N']","['Spatz LA', 'Wong KK', 'Williams M', 'Desai R', 'Golier J', 'Berman JE', 'Alt FW', 'Latov N']","['Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/*genetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics', 'Autoantibodies/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelin Sheath/*immunology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Apr 1;144(7):2821-8.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,"['1R01 NS25187/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '2R01 20047/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,"['GENBANK/M29466', 'GENBANK/M29467', 'GENBANK/M29468', 'GENBANK/M29469', 'GENBANK/M29470']",

This activation is associated with TNF gene expression. The intracellular signaling mechanisms responsible for this effect, however, are unknown. The present studies demonstrate that LPS induces TNF transcripts in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Because previous studies have demonstrated that eicosanoids are involved in the regulation of TNF gene expression in these cells, we examined the effects of LPS on activation of the arachidonic acid cascade. The results demonstrate that LPS stimulates phospholipase A2 activity and the hydrolysis of both 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and 1-steroyl 2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, there was no detectable effect of LPS on activation of protein kinase C. We also demonstrate that inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity with bromophenacyl bromide or quinacrine blocks the induction of TNF transcripts by LPS. These findings suggested that LPS induces TNF gene expression through formation of arachidonic acid metabolites. Indeed, similar results were obtained with mellitin, a known activator of phospholipase A2 and eicosanoid production. Previous studies have also suggested that TNF mRNA levels are increased in HL-60 cells by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and, in the present work inhibitors of this enzyme blocked LPS-induced TNF expression. Moreover, the cyclooxygenase metabolite, PGE2, as well as dibutyryl cAMP, inhibited the induction of TNF transcripts by LPS. Taken together, these results suggest that LPS induces TNF gene expression through activation of phospholipase A2 and that the level of this induction is regulated by activity of the 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways.","['Mohri, M', 'Spriggs, D R', 'Kufe, D']","['Mohri M', 'Spriggs DR', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'PN0FRW1G4Z (4-bromophenacyl bromide)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Ketoconazole/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*physiology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Melitten/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Quinacrine/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Apr 1;144(7):2678-82.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,"['CA-42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

2156871,NLM,MEDLINE,19900501,20171116,143,1,1990 Apr,Role of Na+/H+ exchange in the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent growth of a leukemic cell line.,133-9,"The growth of the human leukemia cell line AML-193 in a serum-free medium is strictly dependent on the presence of the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is one of the major regulators of the myelomonocytic lineage. At present, little is known about the mechanisms by which this growth factor transduces the signal intracellularly. The results of this study demonstrate that GM-CSF needs the operation of a Na+/H+ exchanger, which is located in the plasma membrane of almost every vertebrate cell. In fact, the GM-CSF-dependent proliferation of AML-193 cells is strongly reduced in the presence of the amiloride analog EIPA, a specific inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger. When acidified, AML-193 cells are able to recover the original pHi in a Na(+)-dependent and EIPA-inhibitable way; this demonstrates for the first time the presence of the Na+/H+ exchanger in these cells. Finally, GM-CSF, at doses superimposable to those needed for triggering proliferation, induces in AML-193 cells a sustained alkalinization, which is dependent on a operating Na+/H+ exchange, as it is inhibited by EIPA. These results suggest that GM-CSF, like other growth factors in other cell systems, exerts its mitogenic activity in AML-193 cells by inducing a Na+/H+ exchanger-mediated rise in pHi.","['Caracciolo, D', 'Pannocchia, A', 'Treves, S', 'Ghigo, D', 'Gallo, E', 'Tarella, C', 'Bussolino, F', 'Turrini, F', 'Tamponi, G', 'Bosia, A']","['Caracciolo D', 'Pannocchia A', 'Treves S', 'Ghigo D', 'Gallo E', 'Tarella C', 'Bussolino F', 'Turrini F', 'Tamponi G', 'Bosia A']","['Department of Medicine and Experimental Oncology, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '3GC547293P (5-dimethylamiloride)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",IM,"['Amiloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1990 Apr;143(1):133-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041430118.,0021-9541 (Print) 0021-9541 (Linking),['10.1002/jcp.1041430118 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Maximal expression of the fMLP receptor was achieved 48 h after microinjection of RNA. Dose-response experiments revealed a K0.5 of 9.5 nM fMLP which is in good agreement with the dissociation constants of the fMLP receptor complex in human neutrophils. Furthermore, the fMLP-induced Ca2+ mobilization in Xenopus oocytes was blocked by the fMLP receptor inhibitor t-butoxycarbonyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Size fractionation of the RNA and microinjection of the individual fractions indicated that messenger RNA for the fMLP receptor is between 1.5 and 2.0 kilobases. Reconstitution of the fMLP receptor into Xenopus oocytes can be employed to isolate the cDNA encoding the fMLP receptor as well as to study the regulation of the fMLP receptor in a functional system.","['Coats, W D Jr', 'Navarro, J']","['Coats WD Jr', 'Navarro J']","['Department of Physiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts 02118.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Oocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Xenopus laevis']",,1990/04/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/04/15 00:00'],"['1990/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Apr 15;265(11):5964-6.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)39276-2 [pii]'],,['R01AR39602/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

When cytosol was electrophoresed through gels containing detergent, a major band of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity showed a marked shift in mobility.

Introduction of human CSF-1R enables mouse NIH-3T3 cells to form colonies in agar in response to human CSF-1 and to proliferate in serum-free medium supplemented with CSF-1, albumin, transferrin and insulin. Similarly, expression of human CSF-1R in interleukin 3-dependent mouse FDC-P1 myeloid cells enables them to grow in CSF-1. High levels of CSF-1R expression in FDC-P1 cells can induce factor-independent growth which is abrogated by a 'neutralizing' monoclonal antibody to the receptor.

Conditioning regimens consisted of: melphalan at a dosage greater than 140 mg/m2 for all patients; in addition, 2 received Endoxan 120 mg/kg and 1 busulfan 16 mg/kg. Autologous marrow rescue was infused 24 h after the conditioning regimen. Severe, but reversible aplasia and mucositis were the most common toxicities. Three patients died from this procedure, 2 from infection and 1 from secondary leukemia. Twelve out of 15 patients evaluated responded (80%) showing evidence of activity in patients who did not respond to first line chemotherapy. Duration of response was short, especially for patients treated for progressive disease rather than in partial or complete response at the time of high doses chemotherapy. With a median follow up of 23 months (range 8.54) 19 patients survived (15 with non-evolutive disease) leading to a projected survival rate of 39% between 27 months and 5 years.

Previously, we have shown that receptors for GM-CSF and IL-3 are often coexpressed on AML cells. Here we present experiments with purified AML blasts, normal monocytes, and granulocytes that were conducted to analyze the properties of GM-CSF and IL-3 binding proteins in more detail. On AML cells from eight cases we demonstrate two types of GM-CSF receptors: one with low affinity (dissociation constant [kd] 5.1 to 24.8 nmol/L) and one with a high affinity (kd 31 to 104 pmol/L). These AML cells also expressed high affinity receptors for IL-3 (kd 24 to 104 pmol/L). Cross-competition experiments showed that an excess concentration of nonlabeled IL-3 completely prevented the high affinity binding of radiolabled GM-CSF. This competition occurred at 37 degrees C as well as 4 degrees C. Low affinity GM-CSF binding was not affected by IL-3. Binding of radiolabeled IL-3 could be prevented by nonlabeled GM-CSF. In certain cases, this competition was complete, whereas in others only partial (49% to 77%) reduction of the radiolabeled IL-3 binding was seen. On the basis of these ligand binding features, we propose the existence of three receptor types on AML cells: (1) low affinity GM-CSF receptors that do not bind IL-3, (2) dual high affinity GM-CSF/IL-3 receptors, and (3) high affinity IL-3 receptors that do not bind GM-CSF. We could also demonstrate these receptor types on normal monocytes. In addition, a fourth type of receptor was apparent on normal granulocytes (4), incapable of binding IL-3 and with an intermediate affinity for GM-CSF (approximately 400 pmol/L). Chemical crosslinking showed that GM-CSF and IL-3 both bind to proteins with molecular weight values of 130, 105, and 75, which provides additional evidence for the existence of a common GM-CSF/IL-3 receptor complex.","['Budel, L M', 'Elbaz, O', 'Hoogerbrugge, H', 'Delwel, R', 'Mahmoud, L A', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Touw, I P']","['Budel LM', 'Elbaz O', 'Hoogerbrugge H', 'Delwel R', 'Mahmoud LA', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw IP']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/metabolism', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/immunology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Thermodynamics']",,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Apr 1;75(7):1439-45.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)83164-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Here we describe that with a monoclonal antibody, directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO), the immunological diagnosis of AML is possible in most cases. A monoclonal antibody against lactoferrin (LF) was used to detect more mature myeloperoxidase-containing cells. Of the cell samples tested from 206 different patients with AML, 95% were found to express myeloperoxidase in more than 15% of lactoferrin-negative cells. Compared with other myeloid-reactive monoclonal antibodies (VIM2, anti-CD13, anti-CD14, anti-CD15 and anti-CD33), a higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for AML was found. No significant correlation with the FAB classification was found. In most patients, more MPO-positive cells were detected by the monoclonal antibody than by the cytochemical staining. This could be due to the recognition of enzymatically inactive precursor forms of myeloperoxidase by the antibody.

We report here the development and characterization of an etoposide-resistant human leukaemic CCRF-CEM cell line, CEM/VP-1. The cell line was 15-fold more resistant to etoposide than the parental CEM cells and exhibited cross-resistance to other topoisomerase II inhibitors including teniposide, m-AMSA, and doxorubicin. CEM/VP-1 cells exhibited only a low level cross-resistance to the Vinca alkaloids, vinblastine and vincristine, known inhibitors of mitotic spindle formation. As a first step in defining the mechanism of resistance to etoposide, we compared the levels of topoisomerase II activity and its drug sensitivity in nuclear extracts from the resistant and sensitive CEM cells. As determined by a kinetoplast DNA decatenation assay, the level of DNA topoisomerase II activity in CEM/VP-1 nuclear extracts was approximately 2-fold lower than that in CEM cells, and the activity appeared to be resistant to inhibition by etoposide. Furthermore, the DNA topoisomerase II activity in CEM/VP-1 nuclear extracts did not promote the etoposide-dependent cleavage of pBR322 DNA observed with extract from sensitive cells. These results suggest that etoposide resistance in the CEM/VP-1 cell line may at least in part be due to an altered topoisomerase II, or associated factor, resulting in a reduced ability to induce DNA cleavage in the presence of drug.","['Patel, S', 'Austin, C A', 'Fisher, L M']","['Patel S', 'Austin CA', 'Fisher LM']","[""Department of Cellular and Molecular Sciences, St George's Hospital Medical School, University of London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Kinetoplast)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/enzymology', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis', 'DNA, Circular/analysis/drug effects', 'DNA, Kinetoplast', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/*antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1990 Feb;5(1):149-57.,0266-9536 (Print) 0266-9536 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Cisplatin does not generally show preferential toxicity in hypoxic cells, as do nitroimidazoles. It is proposed that attachment of a nitroimidazole could add a degree of hypoxic selectivity to Pt agents. Platinum complexes containing one nitroimidazole ligand bind to DNA and show higher toxicity in hypoxic than aerobic CHO cells. Cis and trans isomers of complexes with misonidazole (a 2-nitroimidazole) and metronidazole (a 5-nitroimidazole) are compared with respect to binding to DNA (approximately the same), reduction potential (trans miso greater than cis miso greater than cis metro greater than trans metro), and toxicity (trans greater than cis miso, cis greater than trans metro, with trans miso approximately cis metro in hypoxia, despite significantly different reduction potentials). The effect of platination on nitroimidazole toxicity is not entirely explained by DNA binding and increased reduction potential. These compounds do not exhibit cross resistance with cisplatin in L1210 resistant cells. This factor, their selectivity for hypoxia, and preliminary results in vivo indicating potentiation of anti-tumor activity by the vasoactive compound, hydralazine, which increases tumor hypoxia, suggest further development of these compounds for use in tumors with resistant hypoxic portions.","['Skov, K A', 'Adomat, H', 'Chaplin, D J', 'Farrell, N P']","['Skov KA', 'Adomat H', 'Chaplin DJ', 'Farrell NP']","['Medical Biophysics Unit, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['140QMO216E (Metronidazole)', '8FE7LTN8XE (Misonidazole)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Aerobiosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/chemical synthesis/*toxicity', 'Cell Hypoxia/*drug effects', 'Cisplatin/chemical synthesis/*toxicity', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Metronidazole/chemical synthesis/*toxicity', 'Misonidazole/chemical synthesis/*toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1990 Feb;5(1):121-8.,0266-9536 (Print) 0266-9536 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

We have assessed the effect of the DNA intercalator 3-nitrobenzothiazolo(3,2-a)quinolinium (NBQ) on the DNA topoisomerase I and II activities. NBQ has no effect on the activity of purified topoisomerase I, whereas it induced purified topoisomerase II binding to DNA without inducing DNA scission. Above 30 microM, NBQ stimulated formation of double- and single-strand breaks mediated by topoisomerase II in plasmid DNA. Using the alkaline elution technique we determined that NBQ induced single-strand and DNA-protein-associated breaks in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. At sublethal concentrations (less than or equal to 1 microM), NBQ induce HL-60 cells to differentiate. Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage induced by mAMSA was substantially reduced in NBQ-differentiated cells.

Very large erythroid colonies containing 100,000 to 200,000 cells were seen in the infected group. Only small erythroid colonies were seen in the uninfected control cultures. The cells in the large erythroid colonies from infected cultures expressed the ras gene as demonstrated by immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody to p21, the ras gene product. The infected cells were not immortal since they did not yield secondary colonies upon replating.

All cases of enzootic bovine lymphoma examined contained 1 to 4 BLV proviral copies in tumor DNA and revealed immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (Ig). Tumors were further characterized immunohistochemically with a panel of 8 monoclonal antibodies to bovine lymphocyte determinants and B cell differentiation markers. The majority of cases examined expressed Ia/DR, 11 of 17 cases also expressed surface IgM, frequently with another Ig isotype. To definitively characterize the stage of B cell differentiation represented in the transformed phenotype, genotypic evidence of isotype switching was examined in these tumors. Our results demonstrated that enzootic bovine lymphomas are tumors of mature B cells with common characteristics, suggesting that pressures associated with BLV infection which favor tumor development are manifested late in B cell ontogeny, possibly during the isotype switch period.","['Heeney, J L', 'Valli, V E']","['Heeney JL', 'Valli VE']","['TNO Radiobiological Institute, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia/etiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*veterinary', 'Proviruses', '*Transformation, Genetic']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 1990 Mar;62(3):339-46.,0023-6837 (Print) 0023-6837 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

The increase in [3H]inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate is rapid but transient after fMLP stimulation, whereas MTX-induced increase in [3H]inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate occurs at a slower rate and is sustained over time. In both cases increases in [Ca++]i, measured with fura-2, parallel the formation of inositol trisphosphate. MTX-mediated stimulation of inositol phosphate formation is inhibited in the absence of calcium, whereas the response to fMLP is not. The calcium ionophore ionomycin stimulates the formation of inositol phosphates in differentiated HL-60 cells. The magnitude of the response is smaller than that obtained with MTX. Ionomycin also induces a rapid but sustained increase of [Ca++]i. In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, neither fMLP nor ionomycin induce significant inositol phosphate formation, and the increase in [Ca++]i elicited by ionomycin is transient. In contrast, the effects of MTX on phosphoinositide breakdown and on [Ca++]i in undifferentiated cells are nearly identical to those elicited by MTX in differentiated cells. In the presence of the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA, fMLP, ionomycin and MTX still stimulate the generation of inositol phosphates. Guanyl nucleotides and calcium stimulate phospholipase C activity in membrane preparations from differentiated HL-60 cells. fMLP stimulates the enzyme only in the presence of GTP. MTX has no effect on membrane phospholipase C activity.","['Gusovsky, F', 'Bitran, J A', 'Yasumoto, T', 'Daly, J W']","['Gusovsky F', 'Bitran JA', 'Yasumoto T', 'Daly JW']","['Laboratory of BioOrganic Chemistry, National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Oxocins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', ""85233-21-2 (5,5'-difluoro-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic"", 'acid)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '9P59GES78D (maitotoxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Marine Toxins/*pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', '*Oxocins', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/analysis']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1990 Feb;252(2):466-73.,0022-3565 (Print) 0022-3565 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Sequence data presented demonstrate that ALV-induced tumors and one cell line (DT40) derived therefrom continue to diversify their light chain genes outside of the bursal environment. Diversification within these tumor cells seems to occur by gene conversion events comparable with those observed in bursal B cells. Sequence analysis of spontaneously arising surface immunoglobulin negative subclones of the DT40 cell line revealed frameshifts within the rearranged light chain genes which most likely resulted from non-functional recombination events. Superimposed gene conversion events can repair these frameshifts leading to re-expression of surface immunoglobulin.,"['Buerstedde, J M', 'Reynaud, C A', 'Humphries, E H', 'Olson, W', 'Ewert, D L', 'Weill, J C']","['Buerstedde JM', 'Reynaud CA', 'Humphries EH', 'Olson W', 'Ewert DL', 'Weill JC']","['Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chickens', 'Exons', '*Gene Conversion', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Introns', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1990 Mar;9(3):921-7.,0261-4189 (Print) 0261-4189 (Linking),,PMC551754,"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32295/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Although lymphoid development was not detectably affected in young E mu-v-abl mice, three transgenic lines shared a high predisposition to develop clonal plasmacytomas that secreted IgA or IgG. The unexpected absence of pre-B lymphomas suggests that Abelson virus generates such tumors by infecting an early lymphoid progenitor cell that has not yet activated the heavy chain enhancer. Most plasmacytomas bore a rearranged c-myc gene, apparently as a result of spontaneous translocation to the Igh locus. Moreover, progeny of a cross with analogous E mu-myc mice rapidly developed oligoclonal plasmacytomas. Thus, the collusion of v-abl with c-myc is stage specific, efficiently transforming plasma cells but not pre-B cells or B cells.","['Rosenbaum, H', 'Harris, A W', 'Bath, M L', 'McNeall, J', 'Webb, E', 'Adams, J M', 'Cory, S']","['Rosenbaum H', 'Harris AW', 'Bath ML', 'McNeall J', 'Webb E', 'Adams JM', 'Cory S']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Genes, Viral', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1990 Mar;9(3):897-905.,0261-4189 (Print) 0261-4189 (Linking),,PMC551750,['CA43540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Even though the use of TK as a clinical marker is rapidly increasing there has been no attempt to characterize the serum TK in a wider extent, i.e.; with respect to Mw or other biochemical parameters. Therefore sera with high TK or DNAp activities derived from patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, B12-deficiency and leukaemia were fractionated by gel exclusion chromatography. The TK activity eluted as two peaks, one major TK activity with an apparent molecular weight (Mw) or 730 kD and one minor TK activity corresponding to a Mw of 58 kD. The amount of TK activity at 58 kD varied between 7 and 23% of total activity, depending on the serum fractionated. The DNAp activity in sera from patients with malignant disease and B12 deficiency eluted as a single peak corresponding to a Mw of 240 kD. A DNAp with a different Mw (greater than 1000 kD) was recovered from 1 of 3 investigated immunosuppressed patients with CMV infection. A similar pattern of enzyme forms was observed when sera were separated by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The effect of high salt and various reaction solution components on the enzymes were studied. The only condition found that affected the molecular forms of TK was the state of reduction. Incubation of sera with high concentrations of dithioerythritol (DTE) (400 mM) prior to separation transferred all serum TK to the 58 kD form, it also converted most of the serum DNAp from the 240 kD form to a smaller form (56 kD) without affecting the total recovery of enzymatic activity. The reaction product from both TK forms was exclusively monophosphate and none of the TK forms could efficiently utilize cytidine triphosphate as phosphate donor. The substrate kinetics of the small serum TK fraction was identical with those of an enzyme with similar size purified from proliferating HeLa cells, indicating that both serum TK activities are forms of TK 1, the proliferation associated cellular isozyme.","['Karlstrom, A R', 'Neumuller, M', 'Gronowitz, J S', 'Kallander, C F']","['Karlstrom AR', 'Neumuller M', 'Gronowitz JS', 'Kallander CF']","['Department of Medical Virology, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Nucleic Acid Precursors)', '6892-68-8 (Dithioerythritol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.4.4 (Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.4.9 (dTMP kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*blood/metabolism', 'Dithioerythritol/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Nucleic Acid Precursors/biosynthesis', 'Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/blood', 'Protein Denaturation/drug effects', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood/metabolism']",,1990/01/18 00:00,1990/01/18 00:01,['1990/01/18 00:00'],"['1990/01/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/18 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1990 Jan 18;92(1):23-35. doi: 10.1007/BF00220716.,0300-8177 (Print) 0300-8177 (Linking),['10.1007/BF00220716 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Synthesis and biological activity of ring D and ring E modified analogues of camptothecin.,972-8,"The total synthesis of the pentacyclic camptothecin analogues 3 and 4 in 11 steps from p-tolualdehyde is described. The overall shape of compound 3 is the same as that of potent, naturally occurring camptothecin (1a). Despite the near spatial identity of 3 and 1b (racemic, (20RS)-camptothecin) from a three-dimensional standpoint, the 9KB and 9PS cytotoxicity assays indicate at least a 40-60-fold decrease in activity of 3 compared to that of 1b, and the isomer 4 was inactive. Similarly, studies of the inhibition of topoisomerase I activity indicated only slight activity for 3 and no activity for 4.

More recently, EBV-positive human T cell lymphomas have been recognized and human T cell lines containing the EBV genome have been established in vitro. To understand better the interaction of EBV with T cells, we decided to determine first whether human peripheral blood T lymphocytes express receptors for EBV. Using flow cytometry we examined the binding of both lymphocyte-transforming (B95-8) and non-transforming (P3HR-1) strains of EBV to T lymphocyte subpopulations, using a double labelling technique with T cell-specific phycoerythrinated monoclonal antibodies (Leu 2a) and fluoresceinated viral preparation. Our results suggest that, in general, about 50% of the CD8+ (or suppressor/cytotoxic) T cell subpopulation from both EBV-seropositive and -seronegative individuals can bind EBV. EBV receptor expression on these T cells was about 10 and 51 times less than that on Molt-4 and Raji (an EBV receptor-positive B cell line) cells, respectively. The specificity of this binding was demonstrated by the inhibition of attachment of viral preparations preincubated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the viral ligand (gp240/350), and by preincubating these target T cells with unlabelled virus. We were unable to detect EBV-induced antigens in infected T cells, suggesting that, as in Molt-4 cells, virus internalization may not occur in fresh T cells and/or that the virus receptor may not be completely functional. We were also unable to detect C3d (or CR2) receptors on these T cells, or to inhibit virus attachment by treating the targets with an anti-CR2 monoclonal antibody (OKB7), suggesting that the EBV receptor on CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes is different from that on B cells.","['Sauvageau, G', 'Stocco, R', 'Kasparian, S', 'Menezes, J']","['Sauvageau G', 'Stocco R', 'Kasparian S', 'Menezes J']","['Laboratory of Immunovirology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Ste-Justine Hospital, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Complement 3d', 'Receptors, Virus/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/analysis/*microbiology']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1990 Feb;71 ( Pt 2):379-86. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-71-2-379.,0022-1317 (Print) 0022-1317 (Linking),['10.1099/0022-1317-71-2-379 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Molecular clones of FeLV-GM1 proviruses were obtained and studied by restriction enzyme mapping, blot hybridization and partial DNA sequence analysis. Two types of clone were isolated; the first was a replication-competent FeLV of subgroup A, resembling other low or minimally pathogenic FeLV-A isolates; the second was replication-defective with extensive deletions and mutations in gag and pol, although it has an intact env gene of subgroup B phenotype. Large segments of the defective proviruses, from the 5' leader sequence upstream of the gag gene to the 5' half of the env gene, show structural hallmarks of endogenous FeLV-related proviruses. Infectious FeLV-GM1 viruses recovered after transfection were tested for their leukaemogenic potential in newborn cats. Early polyclonal myeloproliferative changes were observed in cats inoculated with FeLV-A/GM1 alone, although these were more pronounced in animals receiving the full FeLV-AB/GM1 complex reconstituted by cotransfection of the defective virus FeLV-B with its FeLV-A helper. Analysis of viruses in the bone marrow showed that replication of the subgroup B component is delayed and restricted to a proportion of cats. Most of the infected cats developed persistent abnormalities of haematopoiesis and one progressed to disseminated myeloid leukaemia. The defective recombinant FeLV-B/GM1 appears to play an indirect but important role in myeloid leukaemogenesis.","['Tzavaras, T', 'Stewart, M', 'McDougall, A', 'Fulton, R', 'Testa, N', 'Onions, D E', 'Neil, J C']","['Tzavaras T', 'Stewart M', 'McDougall A', 'Fulton R', 'Testa N', 'Onions DE', 'Neil JC']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Bearsden, Glasgow, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cat Diseases/*microbiology', 'Cats', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics/physiology', 'Genes, gag', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Proviruses/*genetics/physiology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1990 Feb;71 ( Pt 2):343-54. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-71-2-343.,0022-1317 (Print) 0022-1317 (Linking),['10.1099/0022-1317-71-2-343 [doi]'],,,,,,,['GENBANK/D00732'],

Undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells each exhibit a high capacity to incorporate and metabolize [3H]PAF at 37 degrees C; however, the amount of [3H]PAF that is assimilated by both cell populations is greatly reduced and its metabolism abolished at less than or equal to 4 degrees C. At 0 degrees C HL-60 granulocytes bind more [3H]PAF than their undifferentiated counterparts. Binding to differentiated cells reaches equilibrium within 80 min and is saturable, reversible and specific; PAF receptor antagonists WEB 2086, L-659,989, BN 52021, and kadsurenone abolish this specific [3H]PAF binding. In contrast, [3H]PAF uptake by undifferentiated HL-60 cells is neither saturable nor sensitive to specific receptor antagonists. Scatchard analyses reveal 5850 +/- 850 binding sites per differentiated HL-60 cell with a dissociation constant of 0.66 +/- 0.15 nM. In the presence of cytochalasin B, PAF (200 nM) induces degranulation only in differentiated cells and this response also is blocked by PAF receptor antagonists. Our results demonstrate that HL-60 cells develop specific and functionally active PAF receptors only after chemically induced differentiation into granulocytes.","['Vallari, D S', 'Austinhirst, R', 'Snyder, F']","['Vallari DS', 'Austinhirst R', 'Snyder F']","['Medical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Tennessee 37831-0117.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosaminidase/metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Mar 15;265(8):4261-5.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)39556-0 [pii]'],,['HL-21709-09/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Twenty-six Mpmv loci were mapped to chromosomal regions by matching proviral strain distribution patterns to those of previously assigned genes. Like other endogenous nonecotropic MLVs, Mpmv loci were present on several chromosomes in all strains examined. We pooled recombinant inbred strain linkage data from 110 MLV loci and selected marker genes in order to construct a chromosomal linkage map. Every mouse chromosome was found to harbor at least one proviral insertion, and several regions contained multiple integrations. However, the overall distribution of the 110 mapped proviruses did not deviate significantly from a random distribution. Because of their polymorphism in inbred strains of mice, and the ability to score as many as 57 proviruses per strain using only three hybridization probes, the nonecotropic MLVs mapped in common strains of mice offer a significant advantage over older methods (e.g., biochemical or individual restriction fragment polymorphisms) as genetic markers. These endogenous insertion elements should also be useful for assessing strain purity, and for studying the relatedness of common and not-so-common inbred strains.","['Frankel, W N', 'Stoye, J P', 'Taylor, B A', 'Coffin, J M']","['Frankel WN', 'Stoye JP', 'Taylor BA', 'Coffin JM']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genetics,Genetics,0374636,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Linkage', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genetics. 1990 Feb;124(2):221-36. doi: 10.1093/genetics/124.2.221.,0016-6731 (Print) 0016-6731 (Linking),['10.1093/genetics/124.2.221 [doi]'],PMC1203916,"['CA33093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM18684/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35-CA44385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Genetics 1990 Jun;125(2):455'],,,,

EBV-transformed LCL and EBV genome-negative leukemic B cells showed identical chromosome aberrations and IgH gene rearrangements. In the present study we have analyzed the effect of exogenous cytokines [interleukin (IL) 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, tumor necrosis factor, lymphotoxin, transforming growth factor beta, (TGF-beta)] and anti-IgM antibodies on the in vitro proliferation of EBV- leukemic B cells and EBV-converted LCL. In contrast to conventional chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B cells of the patient DUL spontaneously proliferated for up to two weeks in the absence of exogenous lymphokines. The spontaneous proliferative capacity of clonal DUL B cells was not modulated by IL 1, IL 3, IL 6, TNF or LT. In vitro growth of DUL B cells was increased, however, by exogenous recombinant (r)IL 2, and was abrogated by TGF-beta, rIL 4 and anti-IgM. rIL 4 not only inhibited spontaneous B cell proliferation but also neutralized the enhancing effect of rIL 2. In contrast, growth of the EBV-transformed DUL LCL was not affected by any of these factors. These data demonstrate that in vitro infection and transformation of a clonal B cell population by EBV induces a switch in responsiveness to rIL 4, TGF-beta and anti-IgM. In addition, this report is the first to demonstrate an inhibitory effect of rIL 4 on a spontaneously proliferating human leukemic B cell clone.","['Janssen, O', 'Gillis, S', 'Kabelitz, D']","['Janssen O', 'Gillis S', 'Kabelitz D']","['Institute of Immunology, University of Heidelberg, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factors/pharmacology']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1990 Jan;20(1):7-14. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830200103.,0014-2980 (Print) 0014-2980 (Linking),['10.1002/eji.1830200103 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Between December 1985 and June 1986, weaned heifers were dehorned using the gouge method at the time of brucellosis vaccination. Using logistic regression, the estimated probability for a nondehorned heifer to seroconvert within three months after brucellosis vaccination (0.08) was significantly less than that for heifers dehorned after a noninfected heifer (0.46) or than that for heifers dehorned after an infected heifer (0.85) (p = 0.039 and p less than 0.001, respectively). To evaluate risk of transmission by brucellosis vaccination, which was usually done within one month postweaning, cumulative proportions of heifers remaining uninfected were computed among heifers that did not seroconvert three months after dehorning. Because results of a Cox model analysis indicated that groups of heifers were 6.6 times more at risk of becoming infected if placed in pens holding gouge-dehorned heifers (where prevalence varied between 50 and 70%) (p less than 0.001) than other groups placed in pens without gouge-dehorned heifers (where prevalence varied between 10 and 30%), cumulative proportions of heifers remaining uninfected were computed for each type of group. The cumulative proportion of heifers remaining uninfected from weaning to first calving was 0.60 for the high prevalence group and 0.96 for the low prevalence group. No change in slope of cumulative proportions was observed before and after one month postweaning, suggesting that brucellosis vaccination was not an effective means of transmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lassauzet, M L', 'Thurmond, M C', 'Johnson, W O', 'Stevens, F', 'Picanso, J P']","['Lassauzet ML', 'Thurmond MC', 'Johnson WO', 'Stevens F', 'Picanso JP']","['Department of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Tulare 93274.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Canada,Can J Vet Res,Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,8607793,['0 (Brucella Vaccine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Brucella Vaccine/*adverse effects', 'California', 'Cattle/*microbiology/*surgery', 'Cattle Diseases/microbiology/*transmission', 'Female', 'Horns/*surgery', 'Iatrogenic Disease/*veterinary', 'Leukemia/etiology/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Can J Vet Res. 1990 Jan;54(1):184-9.,0830-9000 (Print) 0830-9000 (Linking),,PMC1255626,,,,,,,

Lipid extracts obtained from undifferentiated HL-60 cells incubated with [3H]alkylacetyl-G contained 2-4% of the label as [3H]PAF; several related metabolites were also detected. The yield of [3H]PAF could be dramatically increased by pretreating the cells with either oleic acid, an activator of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, an inhibitor of PAF acetylhydrolase. These results, together with a kinetic study of [3H]alkylacetyl-G metabolism, indicate the sequential participation of a cholinephosphotransferase for the conversion of [3H]-alkylacetyl-G to PAF and acetylhydrolase and transacylase activities in the remodeling pathway that metabolize the newly formed [3H]PAF to 1-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl(long chain)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. The dithiothreitol-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase activity capable of converting alkylacetyl-G to PAF was localized in subcellular fractions that contain CDP-choline:1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase (dithiothreitol-sensitive), as well as marker enzyme activities for the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes. Subcellular localization analyses also indicated that the majority of newly formed [3H]PAF and a large portion of its deacetylated metabolite were associated with the plasma membrane-containing fractions, whereas most of the 1-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl(long chain)-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine was present in the intracellular organelles. Incubations of HL-60 cells with exogenous [3H]PAF produced a similar subcellular distribution of metabolites. Very little (less than 10%) of the [3H]PAF produced from [3H]alkylacetyl-G was released from intact cells under a variety of incubation conditions but 50% of the de novo-derived mediator was recovered in the medium of cells that were permeabilized with saponin. Our results indicate that PAF is rapidly translocated from its intracellular site of enzymatic synthesis to the plasma membrane where it is apparently sequestered in a pool that is not accessible to extracellular acceptors in contact with intact cells.","['Vallari, D S', 'Record, M', 'Snyder, F']","['Vallari DS', 'Record M', 'Snyder F']","['Medical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Tennessee. 37831-0117.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Glyceryl Ethers)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '99945-82-1 (1-palmityl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.8.2 (Diacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Diacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferase/metabolism', 'Glyceryl Ethers/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phospholipids/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tritium']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1990 Feb 1;276(2):538-45. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(90)90756-o.,0003-9861 (Print) 0003-9861 (Linking),"['0003-9861(90)90756-O [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(90)90756-o [doi]']",,['HL-27109-09/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The SFFV env gene encodes a membrane glycoprotein, gp55, which is located on the cell surface and in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is essential both for the induction of leukaemia in vivo and erythroblast proliferation in vitro. The mechanism by which gp55 causes increased erythroblastosis and ultimately leukaemia is unknown, but a reasonable suggestion is that gp55 can mimic the action of erythropoietin by binding to its receptor (Epo-R), thereby triggering prolonged proliferation of erythroid cells. To test this possibility, we have co-expressed gp55 and the murine Epo-R in a fibroblast cell line. We show here that in such cells, the SFFV glycoprotein binds directly to Epo-R. Furthermore, when an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent lymphoid cell line was co-infected by SFFV and a virus that carries the Epo-R gene, it could grow without IL-3. We suggest that through direct binding to Epo-R, gp55 can stimulate the receptor and by-pass the normal requirement for Epo, causing prolonged proliferation of infected erythroid cells. This could be the first step of leukaemogenesis induced by Friend virus.","['Li, J P', ""D'Andrea, A D"", 'Lodish, H F', 'Baltimore, D']","['Li JP', ""D'Andrea AD"", 'Lodish HF', 'Baltimore D']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Nine Cambridge Center, Massachusetts 02142.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,1990/02/22 00:00,1990/02/22 00:01,['1990/02/22 00:00'],"['1990/02/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/22 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1990 Feb 22;343(6260):762-4. doi: 10.1038/343762a0.,0028-0836 (Print) 0028-0836 (Linking),['10.1038/343762a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

In this study, RNA from 24 human acute myelomonocytic leukemias (AML) was used to analyze the expression of the macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and its corresponding receptor (c-fms). Fifty percent of AML cells exhibited c-fms transcripts of regular length but at a lower level than in normal monocytes/macrophages. In most cases the reduced c-fms expression of AML cells was not associated with autostimulatory M-CSF expression. Only a few cases of AML showed co-expression of M-CSF and c-fms, which by contrast was regularly observed in cultivated blood monocytes and some tissue macrophage subsets. Higher levels of c-fms expression could be found in AMLs with a more mature monocytic immunophenotype. Permanent myelomonocytic cell lines expressed c-fms only after induction of monocytic differentiation. Neither the M-CSF gene nor the c-fms gene were rearranged in AML cells. In AML cells the homozygote genotype of the c-fms gene predominated. Our results do not provide evidence for the involvement of M-CSF and c-fms genes in human myeloid leukemogenesis. c-fms expression appears to indicate monocytic differentiation within the myelomonocytic lineage.

This distribution was established by the time of hatching and persisted throughout the 14 weeks of observation. The highest levels of integrated proviral DNA and viral mRNA, were present in the cerebellum, consistent with the distribution of viral antigens. Mononuclear cell infiltrates were evident throughout the CNS, consistent with an inflammatory process. However, demyelination or vacuolar changes, as observed in other retroviral-induced CNS diseases, were not detected. Clinical symptoms of progressive neurologic dysfunction, i.e., weakness or paralysis of the hindlimbs, imbalance, and ataxia, were present in 7 of 38 infected chickens before termination of the experiment at 14 weeks posthatch. Viral antigens or lymphocyte infiltration were not detected in peripheral nerves. These findings suggest that the avian system may provide a valuable model to analyze the mechanisms governing retroviral induced CNS disease.","['Ewert, D L', 'Steiner, I', 'DuHadaway, J']","['Ewert DL', 'Steiner I', 'DuHadaway J']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Avian Leukosis/microbiology/pathology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Central Nervous System/analysis/*microbiology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/microbiology/pathology', 'Cerebellum/immunology/microbiology', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Ovum/*microbiology', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Viral Core Proteins/*analysis', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*analysis']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 1990 Feb;62(2):156-62.,0023-6837 (Print) 0023-6837 (Linking),,,"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

To gain further insight into the function of this protein, a cell line, BSV65, was established which expresses biologically active Vmw65 under control of the Moloney leukemia virus long terminal repeat. This cell line was shown to specifically activate IE genes as demonstrated by transient transfection assays with reporter genes linked to HSV IE or delayed-early promoter-regulatory regions. Furthermore, by using mobility shift assays, cell extracts were shown to be capable of forming a Vmw65-containing complex with oligonucleotides that contained a TAATGARAT motif, a conserved cis-acting IE regulatory element which is required for Vmw65-mediated trans induction. BSV65 cells were able to complement HSV type 1 in 1814, a mutant which is unable to trans-induce IE gene expression and whose growth is impaired at low multiplicities of infection. Transfection of purified HSV type 1 viral DNA into BSV65 cells resulted in an approximately 200-fold increase in virus production compared with the parental cell line. In addition, in comparison to wild-type cells, infectious virus production occurred sooner and efficiency of plaque formation was higher in BSV65 cells following transfection of viral DNA but not following infection with virus. Northern (RNA) dot blot analysis of cells transfected with viral DNA showed that transcription of the IE gene Vmw175 was approximately 10-fold greater in BSV65 cells compared with wild-type cells. These results indicate that, in the presence of functional Vmw65, there is a greater probability that transfected viral DNA will lead to a productive infection.","['Werstuck, G', 'Bilan, P', 'Capone, J P']","['Werstuck G', 'Bilan P', 'Capone JP']","['Department of Biochemistry, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics/growth & development', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Vero Cells']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Mar;64(3):984-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.3.984-991.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.3.984-991.1990 [doi]'],PMC249208,,,,,,,

The unique envelope glycoprotein encoded by SFFV has been shown to be responsible for this biological effect. The recent isolation of an Epo-dependent erythroleukemia cell line, HCD-57, derived from a mouse infected at birth with Friend murine leukemia virus, afforded us the opportunity to study the direct effect of SFFVP on a homogeneous population of factor-dependent cells. The introduction of SFFVP in complex with various helper viruses into these Epo-dependent cells efficiently and reproducibly gave rise to lines which expressed high levels of SFFV and were factor independent. SFFV appears to be unique in its ability to abrogate the factor dependence of Epo-dependent HCD-57 cells, since infection of these cells with retroviruses carrying a variety of different oncogenes had no effect. The induction of Epo independence by SFFV does not appear to involve a classical autocrine mechanism, since there is no evidence that the factor-independent cells synthesize or secrete Epo or depend on it for their growth. However, the SFFV-infected, factor-independent cells had significantly fewer receptors available for binding Epo than their factor-dependent counterparts had, raising the possibility that the induction of factor independence by the virus may be due to the interaction of an SFFV-encoded protein with the Epo receptor.","['Ruscetti, S K', 'Janesch, N J', 'Chakraborti, A', 'Sawyer, S T', 'Hankins, W D']","['Ruscetti SK', 'Janesch NJ', 'Chakraborti A', 'Sawyer ST', 'Hankins WD']","['National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Mar;64(3):1057-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.3.1057-1062.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.3.1057-1062.1990 [doi]'],PMC249217,,,,,,,

The P/DACT cell line, which shows the characteristics of a transport-mediated multidrug-resistant cell line, was cross-resistant to vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and a number of acridine-substituted amsacrine derivatives, but was sensitive in vitro and in vivo to amsacrine and its analog CI-921. The P/DOX cell line was cross-resistant to amsacrine but showed a similar pattern of cross-resistance to that of P/DACT in its in vitro response to amsacrine derivatives. In contrast, the P/AMSA line was substantially cross-resistant (from 27- to 146-fold) to all acridine-substituted amsacrine derivatives. However, when the substituents on the anilino side chain of amsacrine were changed, the in vitro cross-resistance of the P/AMSA line could be substantially reduced and even overcome. Derivatives with low cross-resistance ratios were tested in vivo against the P/AMSA leukemia and, in contrast to amsacrine and CI-921, were found to be active. Since the target enzyme for amsacrine action, topoisomerase II, is thought to be structurally modified in the P/AMSA line as well as in some other multidrug-resistant lines, these results suggest the feasibility of tailoring topoisomerase II-directed drugs specifically for the altered enzymes in resistant cells. New drug design approaches are therefore available for overcoming two major types of multidrug resistance.","['Baguley, B C', 'Holdaway, K M', 'Fray, L M']","['Baguley BC', 'Holdaway KM', 'Fray LM']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland Medical School, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance', 'Intercalating Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/03/07 00:00,1990/03/07 00:01,['1990/03/07 00:00'],"['1990/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 Mar 7;82(5):398-402. doi: 10.1093/jnci/82.5.398.,0027-8874 (Print) 0027-8874 (Linking),['10.1093/jnci/82.5.398 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Increased GTP binding and hydrolysis in membranes of a murine thymoma line (EL4).,3146-52,"The post-receptor events which follow the binding of interleukin 1 (IL1) to cells are unclear. The present studies provide evidence for the activation of a guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) by IL1 in the membranes of an IL1 receptor-rich strain (NOB-1) of the EL4 murine thymoma line. IL1 alpha and beta increased the binding of the GTP analogue [35S]guanosine 5'-[gamma-thiol]trisphosphate (GTP gamma S) to membranes prepared from these cells. By 1 min after addition of IL1 there was a 2-fold enhancement in binding which was dose dependent in the range 0.1-100 ng/ml. A qualitatively similar result was obtained with IL1 beta although it was 10 times less potent. Specific neutralizing antisera to IL1 alpha and IL1 beta abolished the response. Experiments in which the concentration of [35S]GTP gamma S was varied revealed that IL1 increased the affinity of the binding sites for [35S]GTP gamma S and not their number. IL1 alpha was shown to stimulate GTPase activity in the membranes, the time and concentration dependence of this was similar to that observed for increased [35S]GTP gamma S binding. Half-maximal enhancement of [35S]GTP gamma S binding by IL1 alpha, measured after 4 min, occurred at 5% IL1 receptor occupancy. Maximal stimulation was achieved when 30% of receptors were occupied. Experiments with pertussis and cholera toxins revealed that pretreating membranes with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) inhibited by 50% the IL1-induced [35S]GTP gamma S binding and [gamma-32P]GTP hydrolysis. Cholera toxin (100 ng/ml) was without effect. However, both pertussis and cholera toxins at concentrations of 100 ng/ml inhibited IL1-induced IL2 secretion in EL4 NOB-1 cells. These results show that the IL1 receptor of a responsive thymoma line activates, and may be coupled to, a G protein(s). This is a possible mechanism of IL1 signal transduction.","[""O'Neill, L A"", 'Bird, T A', 'Gearing, A J', 'Saklatvala, J']","[""O'Neill LA"", 'Bird TA', 'Gearing AJ', 'Saklatvala J']","['Cytokine Biochemistry Group, Strangeways Research Laboratory, Worts Causeway, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,"['Alprostadil/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Epinephrine/pharmacology', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immune Sera', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thionucleotides/*metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",,1990/02/25 00:00,1990/02/25 00:01,['1990/02/25 00:00'],"['1990/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Feb 25;265(6):3146-52.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)39746-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

In an effort to understand the genetic basis of these phenomena, the integrated ecotropic RadLV genome has been examined in a number of primary RadLV-induced tumors, as well as thymomas adapted to in vitro passage; considerable heterogeneity was observed. Examination of these polymorphic viral sequences should help define the viral gene(s) involved in the biological effects of RadLV infection; toward this end, integrated RadLV genomes were molecularly cloned and examined. The genomes and their flanking sequence were characterized by restriction enzyme analysis. Three unique viral genomes were obtained which represent four integration sites. The three RadLV genomes are shown to carry polymorphisms of the original tumor. Following DNA transfection, one of the three genomes replicated in and reinfected both mouse thymocytes and fibroblasts, but not mink fibroblasts in vitro.

Irradiation-reduced somatic cell hybrids can be used to construct detailed genetic and physical maps of individual chromosome bands and to systematically clone genes responsible for hereditary diseases on the basis of their chromosomal position. To assess this strategy, we constructed a panel of hybrids that selectively retain the portion of human chromosome band 11p13 that includes genes responsible for Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation (constituting the WAGR syndrome). A hamster-human hybrid containing the short arm of chromosome 11 as its only human DNA (J1-11) was gamma-irradiated and fused to a Chinese hamster cell line (CHO-K1). We selected secondary hybrid clones that express MIC1 but not MER2, cell-surface antigens encoded by bands 11p13 and 11p15, respectively. These clones were characterized cytogenetically by in situ hybridization with human repetitive DNA and were tested for their retention of 56 DNA, isozyme, and antigen markers whose order on chromosome 11p is known. These cell lines appear to carry single, coherent segments of 11p spanning MIC1, which range in size from 3000 kb to more than 50,000 kb and which are generally stable in the absence of selection. In addition to the selected region of 11p13, two cell lines carry extra fragments of the human centromere and two harbor small, unstable segments of 11p15. As a first step to determine the size and molecular organization of the WAGR gene complex, we analyzed a subset of reduced hybrids by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A small group of NotI restriction fragments comprising the WAGR complex was detected in Southern blots with a cloned Alu repetitive probe. One of the cell lines (GH3A) was found to carry a stable approximately 3000-kb segment of 11p13 as its only human DNA. The segment encompasses MIC1, a recurrent translocation breakpoint in acute T-cell leukemia (TCL2), and most or all of the WAGR gene complex, but does not include the close flanking markers D11S16 and delta J. This hybrid forms an ideal source of molecular clones for the developmentally fascinating genes underlying the WAGR syndrome.","['Glaser, T', 'Rose, E', 'Morse, H', 'Housman, D', 'Jones, C']","['Glaser T', 'Rose E', 'Morse H', 'Housman D', 'Jones C']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Aniridia/*genetics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Probes', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/*radiation effects', 'Intellectual Disability/*genetics', 'Syndrome', '*Urogenital Abnormalities', 'Wilms Tumor/*genetics']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1990 Jan;6(1):48-64. doi: 10.1016/0888-7543(90)90447-3.,0888-7543 (Print) 0888-7543 (Linking),"['0888-7543(90)90447-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0888-7543(90)90447-3 [doi]']",,"['T32 GM007753/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '2T 32 GM07753-56/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM27882/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The compounds included doxorubicin, daunorubicin, two doxorubicin stereoisomers (4'-epimer and beta-anomer), and five chromophore-modified derivatives, with a wide range of cytotoxic activity and DNA binding affinity. Cleavage of 32P-end-labeled DNA fragments was visualized by autoradiography of agarose and polyacrylamide gels. Structure-activity relationships indicated that alterations in the chromophore structure greatly affected drug action on topoisomerase II. In particular, removal of substituents on position 4 of the D ring resulted in more active inducers of cleavage with lower DNA binding affinity. The stereochemistry between the sugar and the chromophore was also essential for activity. All the active anthracyclines induced a single region of prominent cleavage in the entire SV40 DNA, which resulted from a cluster of sites between nucleotides 4237 and 4294. DNA cleavage intensity patterns exhibited differences among analogues and were also dependent upon drug concentration. Intensity at a given site depended on both stimulatory and suppressive effects depending upon drug concentration and DNA sequence. A good correlation was found between cytotoxicity and intensity of topoisomerase II mediated DNA breakage.","['Capranico, G', 'Zunino, F', 'Kohn, K W', 'Pommier, Y']","['Capranico G', 'Zunino F', 'Kohn KW', 'Pommier Y']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Teniposide/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,1990/01/16 00:00,1990/01/16 00:01,['1990/01/16 00:00'],"['1990/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 Jan 16;29(2):562-9. doi: 10.1021/bi00454a033.,0006-2960 (Print) 0006-2960 (Linking),['10.1021/bi00454a033 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

We found the sensitivity of IGA and morphologic examination in detecting bone marrow involvement by malignant lymphoma to be 91% and 82%, respectively. In 11 cases there was agreement between the morphologic findings and IGA. In 8 of these 11 cases, IGA confirmed the morphologic involvement of the bone marrow by demonstrating clonal rearrangement of either the immunoglobulin heavy- and/or light-chain or the T-cell receptor beta chain (TCR) genes. In 3 of these 11 cases, morphology showed no involvement and IGA showed germline configurations for both the immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain or the TCR genes. In 2 additional cases the techniques proved to be complementary, as involvement was detected by only 1 of the 2 procedures. In 1 of these 2 cases, IGA showed gene rearrangement while morphologic examination was negative for involvement by NHL, while in the other case, morphologic examination showed involvement by NHL, but IGA did not show gene rearrangement. IGA was also useful in determining the clonality of solitary lymphoid nodules in the 2 remaining cases when morphologic interpretation was equivocal. In the 12 cases with bone marrow involvement, the immunophenotype and immunogenotype agreed in 11 cases. In the one case in which there was a discordance between the immunophenotype and immunogenotype, the immunophenotype was incorrectly interpreted as B-cell lineage, while the immunogenotype demonstrated a T-cell lineage. IGA also demonstrated a clonal population in 1 case of T-chronic lymphocytic leukemia where other techniques could not demonstrate the clonality of the pathologic process. IGA analysis may detect bone marrow involvement in NHL which may not be detected by morphologic examination because of patchy distribution.","['Ellison, D J', 'Hu, E', 'Zovich, D', 'Pinter-Brown, L', 'Pattengale, P K']","['Ellison DJ', 'Hu E', 'Zovich D', 'Pinter-Brown L', 'Pattengale PK']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Immunoglobulin A)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoglobulin A/analysis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1990 Mar;33(3):160-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830330303.,0361-8609 (Print) 0361-8609 (Linking),['10.1002/ajh.2830330303 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

To determine whether multiple recombinations on a single kappa allele can contribute to the formation of productive V-J genes through corrective recombinations, we have examined several Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B-cell clones which rearrange the kappa locus during cell culture. Clonal cell lines which had rearranged one kappa allele nonproductively while maintaining the other allele in the germ line configuration were grown, and secondary subclones, which subsequently expressed kappa protein, were isolated and examined for further kappa rearrangement. A full spectrum of rearrangement patterns was observed in this sequential cloning, including productive and nonproductive recombinations of the germ line allele and secondary recombinations of the nonproductive allele. The results show that corrective V-J recombinations, with displacement of the nonproductive kappa gene, occur with a significant frequency (6 of 17 kappa-producing subclones). Both deletion and maintenance of the primary (nonfunctional) V-J join, as a reciprocal product, were observed.","['Feddersen, R M', 'Van Ness, B G']","['Feddersen RM', 'Van Ness BG']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Feb;10(2):569-76. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.2.569-576.1990.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),['10.1128/mcb.10.2.569-576.1990 [doi]'],PMC360841,['GM37687/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

To investigate whether the reduced formation of drug-induced DNA breaks was due to alteration of DNA topoisomerase II activity, nuclear extracts and partially purified enzymes from the sensitive line and the resistant subline were compared. DNA topoisomerase II activity in 0.35 M NaCl nuclear extracts from sensitive cells was approximately 1.7 times higher than that found in extracts from resistant cells, as determined by ability to unknot P4 phage DNA. In addition, it was found that teniposide-stimulated topoisomerase II DNA cleavage activity of nuclear extract from resistant cells was at least 10-fold lower than that from sensitive cells. This differential sensitivity paralleled a similar drug response of nuclei, as determined by the alkaline elution method. However, partially purified DNA topoisomerase II showed similar drug sensitivity in both cell lines. This finding suggests the presence of a modulating factor, which may be lost during purification. These results, indicating a reduction of both catalytic activity and DNA cleavage activity of DNA topoisomerase II in P388 multidrug-resistant cells, emphasize the importance of DNa topoisomerase function in the resistance mechanism. Thus, the concomitant involvement of multiple mechanisms could explain the high degree of resistance of these cells.","['De Isabella, P', 'Capranico, G', 'Binaschi, M', 'Tinelli, S', 'Zunino, F']","['De Isabella P', 'Capranico G', 'Binaschi M', 'Tinelli S', 'Zunino F']","['Division of Experimental Oncology B, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'Teniposide/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1990 Jan;37(1):11-6.,0026-895X (Print) 0026-895X (Linking),,,,,,,,,

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Varicella Vaccine Collaborative Study Group.,184-9,"To examine whether the live varicella vaccine virus is attenuated, we analyzed varicella vaccine-induced contact cases of clinical chickenpox in healthy siblings of immunized children with leukemia. A rash developed approximately 1 month later in 156 children with leukemia who had been vaccinated. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from 25 of these children. Of 88 known susceptible healthy siblings who were exposed to a vaccine with a rash and from whom follow-up information was available, there was evidence of infection in 15 (17%). Of 15 siblings with seroconversion, 11 (73%) also acquired a mild rash with an average of 38 lesions and no accompanying systemic symptoms. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from four of the contact siblings. Tertiary transmission was documented once. Contact siblings with seroconversion were protected during future household exposure to chickenpox, which occurred in four instances. There was a direct relationship between transmission from vaccinees to varicella-susceptible close contacts and the presence and number of skin lesions in children with leukemia after vaccination. We conclude that in the transmission of varicella, the virus probably originates from skin lesions of infected persons and reaches the respiratory tract of those with secondary cases by the airborne route. On the basis of the mildness of the contact illness, the higher-than-normal rate of subclinical primary infection with varicella-zoster virus in contacts, and the lower-than-normal rate of spread of the vaccine virus to susceptible children in the household, we further conclude that the vaccine virus is attenuated.

Basophils were obtained from the peripheral blood of a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia undergoing basophilic differentiation after purification on a density gradient of metrizamide. Binding studies with 125I-labeled IL-3 and 125I-labeled GM-CSF demonstrated that basophils express a single class of high-affinity receptors for each of these molecules. Saturation binding curves with 125I-labeled IL-3 revealed that IL-3 bound specifically to basophils, and analysis according to the method of Scatchard revealed that basophils express 800 to 900 receptors per cell with an apparent dissociation constant of 2.6 x 10(-11) mol/L. Saturation-binding curves with 125I-labeled GM-CSF revealed that basophils express 100 to 200 receptors per cell with an apparent dissociation constant of 4 x 10(-11) mol/L.

ECs that are stimulated by certain agonists, including thrombin and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1), generate molecular signals that induce the adhesion of PMNs (endothelial cell-dependent neutrophil adhesion). Our experiments demonstrate that the mechanism of binding induced by thrombin is distinct from that induced by the cytokines based on the time courses, the requirement for protein synthesis, and differential binding of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells to ECs activated by the two classes of agonists. The rapid EC-dependent PMN adhesion (initiated in minutes) that occurs when the ECs are stimulated by thrombin is temporally coupled with the accumulation of platelet-activating factor, a biologically active phosphoglyceride that remains associated with ECs and that activates PMNs by binding to a cell surface receptor. A portion of the newly synthesized platelet-activating factor (PAF) is on the EC surface, as demonstrated by experiments in which the rate of hydrolysis of PAF synthesized by activated ECs was accelerated by extracellular PAF acetylhydrolase. When ECs were treated with exogenous PAF they became adhesive for PMNs; the PMN binding was prevented by incubating the ECs with PAF acetylhydrolase or by treating the PMNs with competitive PAF receptor antagonists. Thus PAF associated with the EC plasma membrane induces PMN binding, an observation supported by experiments in which PAF in model membranes (liposomes) stimulated rapid PMN adhesion to ECs and to cell-free surfaces. In addition, competitive antagonists of the PAF receptor inhibited the binding of PMNs to ECs activated by thrombin and other rapidly acting agonists, but not to ECs activated by tumor necrosis factor alpha, indicating that PAF that is endogenously synthesized by ECs can mediate neutrophil adhesion. These experiments demonstrate a novel mechanism by which a cell-associated phospholipid, PAF, can serve as a signal for an intercellular adhesive event.","['Zimmerman, G A', 'McIntyre, T M', 'Mehra, M', 'Prescott, S M']","['Zimmerman GA', 'McIntyre TM', 'Mehra M', 'Prescott SM']","['Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Biological Factors/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cytokines', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/analysis', 'Neutrophils/cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Phospholipids/metabolism/physiology', 'Platelet Activating Factor/analysis/*metabolism/physiology', '*Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Thrombin/pharmacology']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1990 Feb;110(2):529-40. doi: 10.1083/jcb.110.2.529.,0021-9525 (Print) 0021-9525 (Linking),['10.1083/jcb.110.2.529 [doi]'],PMC2116010,"['HL34127/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL35828/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Previously, we found that a subline selected for resistance to TNF cytolysis (U937/R) was much less motile and more plastic-adherent than the parental line. In the present study we show that U937 and U937/R cells have different glycoforms of a 105-kDa cell-surface glycoprotein. This protein is predominantly N-glycosylated and has the physicochemical properties of the LAMP-I glycoprotein. In nude mice, U937 cells are highly malignant whereas U937/R cells form a benign, encapsulated tumour.

Addition of GDP (3-50 microM) reduced basal photolabeling to a greater extent than photolabeling stimulated by FMLP. FMLP did not stimulate photolabeling of proteins modified by pertussis toxin. Leukotriene B4 and C5a also stimulated photolabeling of 40 kDa proteins. The results indicate that (i) the major G-protein in HL-60 cells, Gi2, requires Mg2+ for basal and receptor-stimulated activity, (ii) effective receptor-mediated activation of G-proteins is observed at mM concentrations of Mg2+, and (iii) receptor agonists apparently reduce the affinity of G-proteins for GDP.","['Offermans, S', 'Schafer, R', 'Hoffmann, B', 'Bombien, E', 'Spicher, K', 'Hinsch, K D', 'Schultz, G', 'Rosenthal, W']","['Offermans S', 'Schafer R', 'Hoffmann B', 'Bombien E', 'Spicher K', 'Hinsch KD', 'Schultz G', 'Rosenthal W']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Binding Sites/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Complement C5a/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukotriene B4/*pharmacology', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,1990/01/15 00:00,1990/01/15 00:01,['1990/01/15 00:00'],"['1990/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1990 Jan 15;260(1):14-8. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(90)80054-m.,0014-5793 (Print) 0014-5793 (Linking),"['0014-5793(90)80054-M [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(90)80054-m [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Treatment with TGF-beta alone did not significantly affect growth or differentiation of HL60 cells, while it significantly inhibited proliferation and induced monocytic differentiation of a small percentage of U937 cells. Combinations of TGF-beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) acted in synergy to inhibit cell proliferation and to induce monocytic differentiation of both HL60 and U937 cells. In contrast, no synergy was observed when HL60 cells were treated with TGF-beta in various combinations with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and retinoic acid. Examination of TNF-alpha receptor expression on HL60 and U937 cells showed that these cell lines expressed comparable levels of high-affinity TNF-alpha binding sites. Treatment of HL60 and U937 cells with TGF-beta did not induce significant changes in TNF-alpha receptor expression in either cell line. In contrast, HL60 cells expressed much lower levels of TGF-beta receptors than did U937 cells. Treatment of both HL60 and U937 cells with TNF-alpha induced a dose-dependent increase in expression of TGF-beta receptors, suggesting that the synergy between TNF-alpha and TGF-beta may result, at least in part, from upregulation of TGF-beta receptor expression by TNF-alpha.","['De Benedetti, F', 'Falk, L A', 'Ellingsworth, L R', 'Ruscetti, F W', 'Faltynek, C R']","['De Benedetti F', 'Falk LA', 'Ellingsworth LR', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Faltynek CR']","['Laboratory of Biochemical Physiology, Program Resources, Inc., National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21701.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Feb 1;75(3):626-32.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)85746-2 [pii]'],,['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The binding was rapid, specific, time dependent, and saturable. Scatchard analysis of the 125I-GM-CSF binding to peripheral blood neutrophils indicated the presence of a single class of binding site (Kd = 99 +/- 21 pM; 2,304 +/- 953 sites/cell). However, for peripheral blood monocytes and two GM-CSF-responsive myeloid cell lines (U-937 and TF-1), the Scatchard plots were biphasic curvilinear, which were best fit by curves derived from two binding site model: one with high affinity (Kd1 = 10-40 pM) and the other with low affinity (Kd2 = 0.9-2.0 nM). For U-937 cells, the number of high-affinity receptors was 1,058 +/- 402 sites/cell and that of low-affinity receptors was estimated to be 10,834 +/- 2,396 sites/cell. Cross-linking studies yielded three major bands with molecular masses of 150 kDa, 115 kDa, and 95 kDa, which were displaced by an excess amount of unlabeled GM-CSF, suggesting 135-kDa, 100-kDa, and 80-kDa species for the individual components of the human GM-CSF receptor.

Dornburg and H. M. Temin, Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:2328-2334, 1988). To provide further evidence that this retrovirus-mediated gene transfer occurred through an RNA intermediate, we constructed retroviral vectors containing an intron from a cellular gene. This intron was lost in a cDNA gene formed after infection with retroviral particles, establishing that an RNA intermediate had existed. Retroviral vectors with additional encapsidation sequences were constructed. The presence of a murine leukemia virus encapsidation sequence in an mRNA transcribed from the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene increased the efficiency of encapsidation into spleen necrosis virus vector particles and the formation of cDNA genes by approximately 2 orders of magnitude.","['Dornburg, R', 'Temin, H M']","['Dornburg R', 'Temin HM']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Genes', 'Genes, Regulator', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Introns', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Feb;64(2):886-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.2.886-889.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.2.886-889.1990 [doi]'],PMC249185,"['CA-07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Previous reports claimed on the one hand that MA can bind tightly and with a high degree of specificity to avian sarcoma and leukemia virus RNA in vitro and on the other that it cannot bind to RNA at all. We found that MA purified by any of several methods does bind to RNA, as measured by its ability to cause retention of radioactive RNA on nitrocellulose membranes in a filtration assay. However, this interaction is weak and lacks specificity. The interaction of MA with RNA was barely detectable by classical sedimentation analysis, and from this observation we estimate that the intrinsic MA-RNA association constant is ca. 10(3) M-1, at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the constant describing the interaction of the viral nucleocapsid protein (NC) (p12gag) with RNA, ca. 10(6) M-1. Separately purified phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated MA species bound RNA equally. We also found that MA can bind to DNA with an affinity similar to that for RNA.

Since the precise location of the DLS as well as the mechanism and role(s) of RNA dimerization remain unclear, we analyzed the dimerization process of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) genomic RNA. For this purpose we derived an in vitro model for RNA dimerization. By using this model, murine leukemia virus RNA was shown to form dimeric molecules. Deletion mutagenesis in the 620-nucleotide leader of MoMuLV RNA showed that the dimer promoting sequences are located within the encapsidation element Psi between positions 215 and 420. Furthermore, hybridization assays in which DNA oligomers were used to probe monomer and dimer forms of MoMuLV RNA indicated that the DLS probably maps between positions 280 and 330 from the RNA 5' end. Also, retroviral nucleocapsid protein was shown to catalyze dimerization of MoMuLV RNA and to be tightly bound to genomic dimer RNA in virions. These results suggest that MoMuLV RNA dimerization and encapsidation are probably controlled by the same cis element, Psi, and trans-acting factor, nucleocapsid protein, and thus might be linked during virion formation.","['Prats, A C', 'Roy, C', 'Wang, P A', 'Erard, M', 'Housset, V', 'Gabus, C', 'Paoletti, C', 'Darlix, J L']","['Prats AC', 'Roy C', 'Wang PA', 'Erard M', 'Housset V', 'Gabus C', 'Paoletti C', 'Darlix JL']","['Labo-Retro, Centre de Recherche de Biochimie et Genetique Cellulaires du C.N.R.S., Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)']",IM,"['Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/metabolism', '*Genes, Regulator', '*Genes, Viral', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Core Proteins/metabolism']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Feb;64(2):774-83. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.2.774-783.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.2.774-783.1990 [doi]'],PMC249172,,,,,,,

The four viral interference groups are ecotropic MuLV; mink cell focus inducing virus (MCF); amphotropic MuLV; and 10A1, a recombinant derivative of amphotropic MuLV that uses a unique receptor but also retains affinity for the amphotropic MuLV receptor. We report here that 10A1 infects rat and hamster cells, unlike its amphotropic parent. We isolated an infectious molecular clone of 10A1 and present here the sequences of the env genes and enhancer regions of amphotropic MuLV and 10A1. The deduced amino acid sequences of amphotropic MuLV and 10A1 gp70su are remarkably similar to those of MCF and xenotropic MuLV (for which mouse cells lack receptors), with 64% amino acids identical in the four groups. We generated a consensus from these comparisons. Further, the differences are largely localized to a few discrete regions: (i) amphotropic MuLV has two short insertions relative to MCF, at residues 87 to 92 and 163 to 169, and (ii) amphotropic MuLV and MCF are totally different in a hypervariable region, which is greater than 30% proline, at residues approximately 253 to 304. 10A1 closely resembles amphotropic MuLV in its N terminus but contains an MCF-type hypervariable region. These results suggest the possibility that receptor specificity is localized in these short variable regions and further that the unique receptor specificity of 10A1 is due to the novel combination of amphotropic MuLV and MCF sequences rather than to the presence of any novel sequences. The Env proteins of ecotropic MuLV are far more distantly related to those of the other four groups than the latter are to each other. We also found that the enhancer regions of amphotropic MuLV and 10A1 are nearly identical, although 10A1 is far more leukemogenic than amphotropic MuLV.","['Ott, D', 'Friedrich, R', 'Rein, A']","['Ott D', 'Friedrich R', 'Rein A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Maryland 21701.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Helper Viruses/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Feb;64(2):757-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.2.757-766.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.2.757-766.1990 [doi]'],PMC249170,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['GENBANK/M33469', 'GENBANK/M33470', 'GENBANK/M55596', 'GENBANK/M55597', 'GENBANK/M59191']",

Of 10 FeLV-FIV carrier cats, 5 died of experimentally induced FIV infection, compared with 2 deaths in 10 cats infected only with FeLV and 1 death in 7 cats infected only with FIV. FIV-infected cats with preexistent FeLV infections developed severe depression, anorexia, fever, diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, and leukopenia 4 to 6 weeks after infection and were moribund within 2 weeks of the onset of signs, whereas cats infected only with FIV developed much milder self-limiting gross and hematologic abnormalities. Pathologic findings in dually infected cats that died were similar to those observed previously in cats dying from uncomplicated primary FIV infection but were much more widespread and severe. Coinfection of asymptomatic FeLV carrier cats with FIV did not increase the levels of FeLV p27 antigen present in their blood over that seen in cats infected with FeLV alone. The amount of proviral FIV DNA was much higher, however, in dually infected cats than in cats infected only with FIV; there was a greater expression of FIV DNA in lymphoid tissues, where the genome was normally detected, and in nonlymphoid tissues, where FIV DNA was not usually found. Dually infedted cats that recovered from the primary stage of FIV infection remained more leukopenic than cats infected with FIV or FeLV alone, and their CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratios were inverted. One of these cats developed what was considered to be an opportunistic infection. It was concluded, therefore, that a preexistent FeLV infection in some way enhanced the expression and spread of FIV in the body and increased the severity of both the resulting transient primary and chronic secondary stages of FIV infection. This study also demonstrated the usefulness of the FIV model in studying the role of incidental infectious diseases as cofactors for immunodeficiency-causing lentiviruses.","['Pedersen, N C', 'Torten, M', 'Rideout, B', 'Sparger, E', 'Tonachini, T', 'Luciw, P A', 'Ackley, C', 'Levy, N', 'Yamamoto, J']","['Pedersen NC', 'Torten M', 'Rideout B', 'Sparger E', 'Tonachini T', 'Luciw PA', 'Ackley C', 'Levy N', 'Yamamoto J']","['Department of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, Viral', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*complications/microbiology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*complications/physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Retroviridae/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications/physiopathology']",,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Feb;64(2):598-606. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.2.598-606.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.2.598-606.1990 [doi]'],PMC249149,"['AI25802-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-AI25802-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

In three patients, we found evidence of a germ cell origin of the acute leukemias. A 19-year-old male developed an acute myeloblastic leukemia 11 months after presenting with an MGCT; karyotypes of the two tumors showed them to be clonally related, both showing an i(12p), a cytogenetic marker of germ cell tumors. A 16-year-old male with probable Klinefelter's syndrome presented simultaneously with acute monocytic leukemia and an MGCT; although the MGCT was not karyotyped, the leukemia showed an i(12p). A 23-year-old male developed concurrently an MGCT and acute myelomonocytic leukemia; the leukemia cells coexpressed myelomonocytic antigens (HAM56, My4, My9) and cytokeratin, suggesting dual differentiation, myeloid and germ cell. Evidence for a germ cell origin of the acute leukemias in the three other patients was not obtained, although in all three the MGCT and the leukemia occurred simultaneously, supporting an etiologic relationship. Hence, these leukemias may represent another form of non-germ cell malignancy developing in germ cell tumors. All patients died of the leukemia, with a median survival of less than 2 months.

The ability of splenic APC from LP-BM5 MuLV-inoculated B10 mice to induce soluble Ag-specific proliferation of cloned Th cells was decreased progressively during the infection. The APC defect was found to be due neither to the decreased expression of Ia Ag nor to the insufficient production of IL-1. It was demonstrated that cloned Th stimulated with virus-infected splenic APC displayed the increased [Ca2+]i with severely decreased inositol phospholipid metabolism, which probably led to the defect of Th proliferative responses. These results suggested that the failure of Th to respond to soluble Ag in MAIDS is at least in part due to a selective defect in signal transduction caused by abnormal APC.","['Mizuochi, T', 'Mizuguchi, J', 'Uchida, T', 'Ohnishi, K', 'Nakanishi, M', 'Asano, Y', 'Kakiuchi, T', 'Fukushima, Y', 'Okuyama, K', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Mizuochi T', 'Mizuguchi J', 'Uchida T', 'Ohnishi K', 'Nakanishi M', 'Asano Y', 'Kakiuchi T', 'Fukushima Y', 'Okuyama K', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'et al.']","['Department of Blood Products, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Jan 1;144(1):313-6.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

The early increase in [Ca2+]i was transient, falling to a sustained level which returned to base line after 10-15 min. In Ca2+-free medium, PUFAs still caused an early increase in [Ca2+]i but rapidly returned to basal. Depletion of endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ pool by addition of OKT3 (antibodies to CD3 of the T3-antigen receptor complex) to JURKAT cells (in Ca2+-free medium) abolished the PUFAs-mediated [Ca2+]i increase and vice versa. By using saponin-permeabilized JURKAT cells, the intracellular free Ca2+ released by PUFAs was found to be the non-mitochondrial, ATP-dependent sequestered Ca2+ pool which is sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. However, PUFAs do not induce any apparent increase in inositol phosphates in JURKAT cells. No Ca2+ influx was detected in JURKAT cells when stimulated with PUFAs. A correlation was observed between both the carbon chain length and the number of double bonds with the ability to mobilize cytosolic free [Ca2+]i in the w-3 PUFAs. These results demonstrate that PUFAs stimulate the release of Ca2+ from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pool in the endoplasmic reticulum of JURKAT cells via a mechanism independent of inositol lipid hydrolysis.","['Chow, S C', 'Jondal, M']","['Chow SC', 'Jondal M']","['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Benzofurans', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,1990/01/15 00:00,1990/01/15 00:01,['1990/01/15 00:00'],"['1990/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jan 15;265(2):902-7.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)40135-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Cells grown in serum-containing medium differentiated less than cells in serum-free medium due to several factors, including albumin binding of retinoic acid. Addition of an inhibitor (sphinganine) of protein kinase C, an enzyme that participates in cellular responses to many serum factors, facilitated the retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Cells treated with both retinoic acid and sphinganine produced more superoxide when stimulated by formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; hence, this combination generated a more functional population of cells.

There was some heterogeneity in the number of GM-CSF binding sites per cell. To determine whether the low level of binding to some patient samples may be attributed to receptor occupancy by an endogenous source of GM-CSF, we devised an acid wash procedure that could remove surface-bound GM-CSF without affecting receptor properties. We thus document that GM-CSF specific binding to AML blasts before or after acid wash was the same, indicating that the observed heterogeneity in binding is not the result of receptor occupancy by an endogeneous source of GM-CSF. Saturation analyses are in favor of the presence of two classes of binding sites on AML blasts: a high-affinity receptor that binds GM-CSF with a dissociation constant (kd) of 3 to 73 pmol/L and a second class of low-affinity receptor that binds GM-CSF with a kd of 1 to 10 nmol/L. Binding studies with two established cell lines KG-1, and IRCM-8 also showed the presence of two classes of binding sites with high and low affinities. Analysis of GM-CSF titration curves in culture indicate that the median effective concentration required for stimulation of blast colony formation (EC50 = 5-36 pmol/L) were in the range of the kd of the high-affinity binding site, suggesting that this high-affinity binding site mediates the proliferative response.","['Onetto-Pothier, N', 'Aumont, N', 'Haman, A', 'Bigras, C', 'Wong, G G', 'Clark, S C', 'De Lean, A', 'Hoang, T']","['Onetto-Pothier N', 'Aumont N', 'Haman A', 'Bigras C', 'Wong GG', 'Clark SC', 'De Lean A', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jan 1;75(1):59-66.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)85818-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial prophylaxis was begun at the time of initiation of chemotherapy. Thirty patients received ofloxacin tablets (300 mg orally every 12 hours) plus a nystatin suspension. Thirty-two patients received vancomycin capsules (500 mg orally every eight hours) and polymyxin capsules (100 mg orally every eight hours) plus a nystatin suspension. RESULTS: In the group of patients receiving ofloxacin, there were a lower number of acquired gram-negative bacillary organisms per patient (0.13 versus 1.37, p less than 0.00005), fewer patients with documented infection (11 of 30 versus 21 of 32, p = 0.04), and fewer cases of gram-negative septicemia (zero of 30 versus five of 32, p = 0.05). Ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant, p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects, p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin. However, except for a reduction of Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection by ofloxacin, neither ofloxacin nor vancomycin/polymyxin was effective in eliminating colonization or infection with viridans group streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or other gram-positive organisms. Only three isolates of ofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Enterobacter aerogenes) were isolated from surveillance cultures, but none caused infection. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that oral ofloxacin is a more tolerable and efficacious alternative to vancomycin/polymyxin for prevention of serious gram-negative bacillary infections in granulocytopenic patients. More effective prophylaxis of gram-positive infections, however, is still needed.","['Winston, D J', 'Ho, W G', 'Bruckner, D A', 'Gale, R P', 'Champlin, R E']","['Winston DJ', 'Ho WG', 'Bruckner DA', 'Gale RP', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA Center for the Health Sciences.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Polymyxins)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/etiology/*microbiology', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Bacterial Infections/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Digestive System/microbiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fungi/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharynx/microbiology', 'Ofloxacin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Polymyxins/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Vancomycin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1990 Jan;88(1):36-42. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(90)90125-w.,0002-9343 (Print) 0002-9343 (Linking),"['0002-9343(90)90125-W [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(90)90125-w [doi]']",,['CA-23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Furthermore, Reh-CM induces PDE-resistant HL-60-1E3 cells to respond to PDE and lyse target cells. Additionally, both HL-60 and HL-60-1E3 cells exposed to Reh-CM for 3 days produce superoxide anion and express cell surface antigens present on mature mononuclear phagocytes. No colony-stimulating factor (CSF) or interferon (IFN) activity was detected in Reh-CM, and differentiation activity (DA) was not removed from Reh-CM by insolubilized anti-IFN gamma. While Reh-CM is antiproliferative against a panel of cell lines, its spectrum of activity is different than tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and neither TNF alpha nor TNF beta inhibit proliferation of HL-60-1E3 or induce these cells to respond to PDE. The differentiation factor (DF) material has been partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and is non-dialyzable; unstable to heat, acid, or alkali treatment; and the activity is not blocked by anti-IL-6 or anti-IFN alpha.

Inhibition of purified rat brain synaptosome Na,K-ATPase by these lipid metabolites, unlike that by ouabain, was subject to membrane dilution (i.e. inhibition being counteracted by increasing amounts of membrane lipids). Kinetic analysis, using the purified enzyme, indicated that sphingosine and lyso-PC were likely to interact, directly or indirectly, with Na+-binding sites of Na,K-ATPase located at the intracellular face of plasma membranes, a conclusion also supported by studies on Na,K-ATPase and 22Na uptake using the inside-out vesicles of human erythrocyte membranes. The studies also showed that ouabain (but not sphingosine and lyso-PC) increased the affinity constant (K0.5) for K+, whereas sphingosine and lyso-PC (but not ouabain) increased K0.5 for Na+. Sphingosine and lyso-PC inhibited 86Rb uptake by intact human leukemia HL-60 cells at potencies comparable to those for inhibitions of purified Na,K-ATPase and protein kinase C. It is suggested that Na,K-ATPase (sodium pump) might represent an additional target system, besides protein kinase C, for sphingosine and possibly other lipid second messengers.","['Oishi, K', 'Zheng, B', 'Kuo, J F']","['Oishi K', 'Zheng B', 'Kuo JF']","['Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Oleic Acids)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Lipids/physiology', 'Oleic Acid', 'Oleic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Sodium Channels/*drug effects', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sphingosine/*pharmacology', 'Swine', 'Synaptosomes/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/01/05 00:00,1990/01/05 00:01,['1990/01/05 00:00'],"['1990/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jan 5;265(1):70-5.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),['S0021-9258(19)40196-8 [pii]'],,"['CA-36777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-15696/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-17608/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Molecular structure and function studies were initiated to determine the basis of its unique macrophage-transforming potential. Characterization of the genomic structure showed that the virus evolved by recombination of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) and a virus of the Friend-mink cell focus-forming virus family. Structural analysis of MHSV showed two regions of the genome that are basically different from the Ha-MuSV: (i) the ras gene, which is altered by a point mutation in codon 181 leading to a Cys----Ser substitution of the p21 protein, and (ii) the U3 region of the long terminal repeat, which is largely derived from F-MCFV and contains a deletion of one direct repeat as well as a duplication of an altered enhancer-like region. Biological studies of Ha-MuSV, MHSV, and recombinants between the two viruses show that the U3 region of the MHSV long terminal repeat is essential for the malignancy and specificity of the disease.

This domain consists of multiple sets of interspersed repetitive elements, including 11 copies of a conserved 16-bp palindromic sequence with the consensus CCATTGACGTCAATGG. These series I repeats contain an 8-bp core TGACGTCA that resembles the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element (CRE) of cellular genes. In transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in K562 human erythroleukemia cells, a set of deleted variants of the IE94 promoter all responded up to 15-fold to induction by cAMP. However, successive removal of most of the SCMV 16-bp motifs reduced basal expression over 20-fold. The cAMP stimulation was also manifested at the steady-state RNA level after SCMV infection of K562 cells and was detectable within 1.5 h after treatment of DNA-transfected cells. Addition of a single 30-bp oligonucleotide encompassing the 16-bp palindrome conveyed up to 10-fold cAMP responsiveness onto a heterologous weak promoter but had no effect on basal expression. In contrast, two or more adjacent copies produced 20- to 40-fold increases in basal expression and provided greater than 200-fold activation in the presence of cAMP. Similar effects were obtained when the oligonucleotides were placed in a downstream location relative to the reporter gene. Studies with mutant oligonucleotides revealed that both the core CRE and the flanking sequence portions of the 16-bp elements were essential for enhancer function. Both components were also important for maximum cAMP responsiveness. Band shift assays with fractionated nuclear extracts from Raji lymphocytes revealed multiple competable complexes with cellular DNA-binding factors that recognized the series I elements. Three distinct CREB-like factors were detected that required only the core 8-bp elements for binding. We conclude that the 16-bp series I repeats provide a major contribution to the constitutive enhancer properties of the IE94 promoter and also act as functional CREs. The cAMP response properties appear likely to play a key role in reactivation of the virus from a latent state in appropriately differentiating cell types.","['Chang, Y N', 'Crawford, S', 'Stall, J', 'Rawlins, D R', 'Jeang, K T', 'Hayward, G S']","['Chang YN', 'Crawford S', 'Stall J', 'Rawlins DR', 'Jeang KT', 'Hayward GS']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Cytomegalovirus/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Jan;64(1):264-77. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.1.264-277.1990.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),['10.1128/JVI.64.1.264-277.1990 [doi]'],PMC249099,"['R01 CA22130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I AI24576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM07445/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

This report is the investigation of the dental situation of these patients. The result were as follows: 1. The ratio of patients with blood diseases in our clinic was 0.7%. The patients with leukemia were most frequent. 2. Most of the first visit-patients with blood diseases were children aged 6, while the general patients group was younger. The ages of first visit-patients corresponded to the most frequent ages of primary diseases. 3. The majority of their chief complaints were ""the treatment of decayed teeth for caries"". Others were ""the extraction of loose teeth for exchange"" or ""the diseases of oral soft tissues"". 4. The patients visited our clinic from all over Niigata prefecture, some of which visited from a great distance and were introduced by Niigata University Medical Hospital. 5. As to the treatment of decayed teeth for caries, the patients with hemophilia had a large number of treated teeth as compared with the other diseases.

This was not due to a change in number or affinity of GM-CSF receptors, but possibly resulted from an other cellular mechanism. The AML-193 differentiated cells acquired the ability to phagocytose glutaraldehyde-fixed E.coli in a similar fashion to mature macrophages. In addition the PMA-differentiated AML-193 cells now secreted a factor which specifically inhibited the binding of interleukin-1 (IL-1) to its receptor on the murine thymoma cell line EL-4.6.1C10. The synthesis of this inhibitor was further increased by the addition of GM-CSF or IL-3. Pulse labelling experiments showed that this activity was due to a 26 kDa protein that bound to the IL-1 receptor even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta, and this binding was only antagonized by IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta. In contrast, peripheral monocytes obtained from the blood of normal donors, when induced with either GM-CSF or IL-3, produced large quantities of inhibitor in the absence of PMA.

We therefore analyzed whether IL 6 has the potential to trigger the full differentiation program directly or whether its effect on M1 cells is mediated through IFN-beta or through the activation of genes that are typically induced by IFN-beta. We first tested whether IL 6 could induce IFN-beta mRNA. Using a reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction procedure, we found that IFN-beta mRNA was induced by IL 6. By Northern analysis we determined that IL 6 also caused a significant increase in 2',5'-AS gene expression. IL 6, however, induced the expression of two mRNA species (1.7 and 2.4 kb), whereas IFN-beta mainly induced the expression of the 1.7-kb species. Enhancement of 2',5'-AS gene expression by IL 6 was observed even when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. Furthermore, IL 6-induced growth arrest of M1 cells was not inhibited by anti-IFN-beta antibodies. Thus induction of 2',5'-AS gene expression is a primary response to IL-6 and not secondary to the induction of IFN-beta.","['Bickel, M', 'Dveksler, G', 'Dieffenbach, C W', 'Ruhl, S', 'Midura, S B', 'Pluznik, D H']","['Bickel M', 'Dveksler G', 'Dieffenbach CW', 'Ruhl S', 'Midura SB', 'Pluznik DH']","['Division of Cytokine Biology, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*biosynthesis/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Interferon Type I/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Fc/physiology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1990 Jul;2(4):238-46. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(90)90023-m.,1043-4666 (Print) 1043-4666 (Linking),"['1043-4666(90)90023-M [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(90)90023-m [doi]']",,,,['Cytokine. 1990 Nov;2(6):473.

This has now been explored by studying the binding of 125I-protein A to normal and CML erythrocytes. There is increased binding of 125I-protein A in CML erythrocytes compared to normal erythrocytes. Since binding of autologous IgG is responsible for removal of erythrocytes from the circulation, the above findings suggest that CML erythrocytes are likely to be prematurely removed from the circulation, accounting for anemia.","['Kundu, M', 'Basu, J', 'Chakrabarti, P']","['Kundu M', 'Basu J', 'Chakrabarti P']","['Department of Chemistry, Bose Institute, Calcutta.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Biochem Biophys,Indian journal of biochemistry & biophysics,0310774,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Ankyrins)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)', '0 (Sulfates)', ""27816-59-7 (4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid)"", ""Q1O6DSW23R (4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid)""]",IM,"[""4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid"", ""4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology"", 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/*chemistry', 'Ankyrins', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/metabolism', 'Sulfates/metabolism']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Indian J Biochem Biophys. 1990 Dec;27(6):456-9.,0301-1208 (Print) 0301-1208 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

In this paper the expression, specificity and modulation of GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors on M-07e cells are described. The specificity of the binding was demonstrated by the failure of other cytokines to compete, at 4 degrees C, with GM-CSF or IL-3 receptors. In addition, IL-3 was found to compete as well as GM-CSF for GM-CSF receptors while GM-CSF was a weak competitor for IL-3 receptors. Quantitative binding studies and Scatchard plot analysis revealed the presence of a single class of high-affinity GM-CSF binding sites (405 +/- 27.4 sites per cell, dissociation constant at the equilibrium 52 +/- 20 pM) and the presence of high and low-affinity regions for IL-3 binding sites (27 +/- 12 and 416 +/- 92 sites per cell for the high and low affinity regions respectively, dissociation constant at the equilibrium, 58 +/- 22 pM and 5.7 +/- 2.0 nM respectively). Finally, in agreement with the hierarchical down-modulation model, we found that IL-3 can down-modulate both IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors while GM-CSF can down-modulate only its own receptors. The present results suggest that M-07e cells, in spite of their neoplastic nature, share, with murine bone marrow cells, similar growth factor receptor regulatory mechanisms. This cell line may be regarded as a candidate model to investigate the physiological events triggered by growth factors binding to human haemopoietic cells.","['Brizzi, M F', 'Avanzi, G C', 'Veglia, F', 'Clark, S C', 'Pegoraro, L']","['Brizzi MF', 'Avanzi GC', 'Veglia F', 'Clark SC', 'Pegoraro L']","['Istituto di Medicina Interna, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Oct;76(2):203-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07872.x.,0007-1048 (Print) 0007-1048 (Linking),['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07872.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Attempts to improve results have focused on decreasing GVHD by drug regimens or removing donor T-cells. Studies using T-cell depletion by different techniques have improved survival in groups with higher median patient age. These methods have had varying effects on incidence of GVHD, graft failure, and relapse.

Both newborn infants and fetuses were studied. There was an excess of males, especially among newborn DS children, which was related to a failure at paternal first meiosis. A positive sex ratio was found in all newborn infants as well as in free trisomics as in those with de novo translocations. Survival was studied in the cohort of 278 infants born 1980 to 1985.

The abnormal leukemic line involved an isochromosome of the long arm of chromosome 9[i(9q)] in 3 cases.

A significant cause of treatment failure was late marrow recurrence in the DS children. Host toxicity was striking in these children. Severe congenital heart disease present in one-third contributed to 2 deaths during antileukemia therapy. Hyperglycemia secondary to diabetogenic agents and repeated bronchitis were common toxicities. Intolerance to the antifolate methotrexate with severe gastrointestinal and skin toxicities was universal.

We have, in fact, been able to confirm the presence of the ETS2 gene dosage in triplicate occurring in occult human 21 chromosome abnormalities. It is known that ERG and ETS2 gene translocations occur in certain specific leukemias associated with defined chromosome rearrangements [e.g., t(8;21)]. Moreover, it is known that DS individuals are at greater risk for leukemic disease than their normal familial cohorts, implying that trisomy of that region of human chromosome 21 may play a role in the development of this type of neoplasia. The human ETS genes, first identified in our laboratory, are highly conserved, being found from lower organisms, like Drosophila and sea urchin, to humans. In mammals, the ETS genes are structurally distinct, located on separate chromosomes; they are transcriptionally active and differentially regulated. The ETS2 protein is phosphorylated and turns over with a half-life of approximately 20 min. After activation with the tumor promoter, TPA, the level of ETS2 elevates 5- to 20-fold. The properties of the ETS2 protein, such as nuclear localization, phosphorylation, rapid turnover, and response to protein kinase C, indicate that this protein belongs to a group of oncogene proteins thought to have regulatory functions in the nucleus. In the mouse thymus ets-1 and ets-2 are 8-10-fold higher, respectively, in the CD4+ subset than in other subsets examined, suggesting a role in T-cell development for these genes. Cells transfected with the cellular ets-2 gene, expressing higher levels of ets-2 products, showed a stimulated proliferation response, abolished their serum requirement and formed colonies in soft agar that could induce tumors in nude mice. Collectively, these data suggest that this family of genes might play a role in controlling specific steps of the signaling transduction pathway. Thus, the ETS genes, as other genes with homology to viral oncogenes, might be instrumental in regulating cellular growth and differentiation, as well as organismal development.","['Papas, T S', 'Watson, D K', 'Sacchi, N', 'Fujiwara, S', 'Seth, A K', 'Fisher, R J', 'Bhat, N K', 'Mavrothalassitis, G', 'Koizumi, S', 'Jorcyk, C L']","['Papas TS', 'Watson DK', 'Sacchi N', 'Fujiwara S', 'Seth AK', 'Fisher RJ', 'Bhat NK', 'Mavrothalassitis G', 'Koizumi S', 'Jorcyk CL', 'et al.']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21701-1013.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Med Genet Suppl,American journal of medical genetics.

A study was conducted to identify the chromosome breakpoints and to evaluate whether site specificity for chromosome breakage and rearrangement may exist which may explain the predisposition phenomenon. DS lymphocytes at the G1 phase of the cell cycle were irradiated with 300, 450, and 600 rad of X-rays. Cells were harvested after 3 days in culture and 193 G-banded karyotypes were analyzed to identify the induced chromosome abnormalities. Out of 273 breakpoints identified, 122 were involved in the formation of stable chromosome rearrangements and 151 in the formation of unstable abnormalities. The Poisson analysis of these breakpoints demonstrated that 16 chromosome bands located in chromosomes 1, 3, 7, 12, 17, 19 and X were preferentially involved in breakage and rearrangement (P less than 0.05). These 16 bands are also found to be locations of ""cancer breakpoints,"" oncogenes, or fragile sites. Many abnormal cells were observed to carry stable chromosome rearrangements only. Therefore, these cells are presumed to be compatible with survival and to be ""initiated"" in the transformation process. We propose that similar stable and site-specific chromosome rearrangements may exist in proliferating cells in DS individuals after exposure to clastogens and that this abnormality predisposes them to develop leukemia.","['Shafik, H M', 'Au, W W', 'Whorton, E B Jr', 'Legator, M S']","['Shafik HM', 'Au WW', 'Whorton EB Jr', 'Legator MS']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med Genet Suppl,American journal of medical genetics.

This fragile site has also been related to a specific rearrangement in M4 acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. In view of the high incidence of acute leukemia in DS subjects, we studied the expression of 16q22 in lymphocyte cultures treated with 5-bromodeoxyuridine or alpha-interferon. We also studied whether the repair deficiency of DS cells could affect the expression of aphidicolin-induced fragile sites. The level of chromosomal aberrations was compared with that found in aphidicolin-treated cultures from 12 normal subjects of the same age. We found neither spontaneous or BrdU-induced fragility at 16q22 nor induction by alpha-interferon.

Cytotoxicity against k562 cells was measured by a 4-h 51Cr-release assay. The IL-2-mediated cytotoxicity was paradoxically increased at around a concentration (10 nM) MTX. Such a low concentration of MTX showed no anti-proliferative effect on cell growth. This enhancement with 10 nM MTX was shown only in an E-rosette+ (E+) population, but not in E-rosette- (E-). In addition, when E+ cells were treated with an anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody plus complement after incubation with IL-2 and MTX, MTX-induced enhancement was lost, suggesting that an E+CD16+ cell population was mainly involved in this augmentation. Positively sorted E+CD16+ cells showed similar enhancement of cytotoxicity after treatment with IL-2 plus MTX. On the other hand, MTX treatment did not show the phenotypical changes including of the E+CD16+ cells, indicating that this treatment did not affect the differentiation and proliferation of the specific cell subset.

For those given flucloxacillin, the mean number of days to change of antibiotics was 7.8 in the prophylaxis group and 5.1 in the treatment group. In the teicoplanin arm, the mean number of days to change antibiotics was 6.8 in the prophylaxis group and 6.1 in the treatment group. Two patients in the flucloxacillin arm developed drug rashes. Four patients developed rigors after teicoplanin administration and one asthmatic became wheezy. One patient had a progressive rise in creatinine, but overall the patients having teicoplanin did not have any appreciable increase of renal toxicity compared to the flucloxacillin arm. Blood cultures were positive prior to commencement in the treatment group in nine patients, and during treatment in six patients. Organisms grown were Gram-positive in 14 patients.

At 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. Patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol violation or death due to other causes. A total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. Teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. The diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (34), Hodgkin's disease (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). Forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). Blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. Organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), Escherichia coli (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), Klebsiella sp.

B (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and P. fluorescens (1), In-vitro testing showed that all Gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and Gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. There were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), Strep. sangius (1), Strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and P. maltophilia (1). Both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. There is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. In view of the very high incidence of Gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in all febrile neutropenic patients.","['Lim, S H', 'Smith, M P', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Machin, S J']","['Lim SH', 'Smith MP', 'Goldstone AH', 'Machin SJ']","['Department of Haematology, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Glycopeptides)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', '61036-62-2 (Teicoplanin)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Catheterization, Peripheral/adverse effects', 'Ceftazidime/therapeutic use', 'Ciprofloxacin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fever/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Glycopeptides/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Teicoplanin', 'Time Factors']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Dec;76 Suppl 2:41-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07935.x.,0007-1048 (Print) 0007-1048 (Linking),['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07935.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Like others (ICAAC, 1989) we have stressed the new life-threatening problems with Streptococcus mitis and Strep. sanguis. Considering the regular sensitivity of Gram-positive organisms to T, it is possible that the introduction of the glycopeptide at the onset of aplasia may be helpful. The high incidence of fungal infection or superinfection supports the routine use of an effective antifungal agent when fever is still present or relapse occurs. Our study was designed to assess the prevention of (1) staphylococcal and streptococcal infections using T when the central catheter is being placed, and (2) candida infection by the simultaneous use of a new anti-mycotic agent fluconazole (F) administered once-daily. Patients were randomized into two arms of the study. Arm A received T 6 mg/kg/d and F 3 mg/kg/d starting when the catheter was put in place. If fever occurred, C 50 mg/kg/d and amikacin (A) 15 mg/kg/d were added and T increased to 10 mg/kg/d. If a febrile relapse occurred, amphotericin B was added. In arm B the combination of the three agents T 10 mg/kg/d, C 50 mg/kg/d and A 15 mg/kg/d was started only if there was fever. Amphotericin B was used in febrile relapses. Forty-six patients were eligible (23 in each arm; no statistically significant differences between the two groups). The mean age of the patients was 8 years and mean duration of aplasia 23 and 24 d. Results were as follows: arm A the duration of T + F alone was 10 d, 22 patients had a febrile episode with 1 Gram-positive, 11 Gram-negative and one candida strain isolated in eight patients. C + A were effective in 72% of these patients. There were no deaths. In arm B, fever occurred in all patients during the first 6 d, with eight Gram-positive and six Gram-negative organisms isolated in nine patients. C + T + A were successful in 83% of patients.

Ceftazidime in combination with an aminoglycoside, i.e. netilmicin, has been established as a combination schedule offering low or even avoiding therapy-related toxicity. We evaluated teicoplanin for suspected Gram-positive infections after inadequate response to initial beta-lactam and aminoglycoside combination therapy. All 11 patients so far included in this study received either an allogeneic (five patients) or an autologous (six patients) bone marrow transplant for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, high grade) or other malignant diseases. All patients developing a primary septicaemia of unknown origin (10 patients) or a catheter related septicaemia (one patient) were treated with 400 mg teicoplanin, administered i.v. once daily in combination with a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside (ceftazidime 2 g, i.v., t.i.d., netilmicin 400 mg once daily). All 11 patients responded to therapy, 10 patients were clinically cured, one patient improved under therapy. The therapeutic regimen was well tolerated and adverse drug reactions did not occur. We have not observed any delayed take of prolonged neutropenia or thrombocytopenia with this therapeutic regimen when compared to other bone marrow transplant patients who did not receive this antimicrobial therapy. Our preliminary results suggest that teicoplanin is a potentially effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent in bone marrow transplant patients with infections not responding primarily to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.","['Lang, E', 'Schmid, J', 'Fauser, A A']","['Lang E', 'Schmid J', 'Fauser AA']","['Department of Haematology, Med.

A search for a mutation in a controlling region of the first exon of c-myc also failed to demonstrate any new abnormality at the time of blastic crisis. While some differences in the transcript levels for several genes (c-myc, p53, histone H3, MRS) were detected, these differences could be ascribed to differences in the proportions of immature cells during the chronic and blastic phases. The data suggested that the c-myc transcripts in blastic phase cells and in immature chronic phase cells differ in that the latter contain some c-myc transcripts that are not polyadenylated. Differences in c-myc transcript half-life could contribute to the differences in the behaviour of chronic phase and blastic phase immature cells.","['Preisler, H D', 'Agarwal, R', 'Sato, H', 'Singh, P K', 'Wang, Z Q', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Preisler HD', 'Agarwal R', 'Sato H', 'Singh PK', 'Wang ZQ', 'Sandberg AA']","['Barrett Center for Cancer Prevention, Research and Treatment, Cincinnati, OH 45267-0501.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1990;26(9):960-5. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(90)90620-9.,0959-8049 (Print) 0959-8049 (Linking),['10.1016/0277-5379(90)90620-9 [doi]'],,['CA 41285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Six rats were euthanatized at biweekly intervals, and spleen weight, total spleen cellularity, and differential spleen cell counts were correlated with hemograms and osmotic fragility. Sequential changes in splenic architecture were correlated with hematologic parameters. Monoclonal antibodies defining all T lymphocytes (W3/13), T helper-inducer cells (W3/25), and T suppressor cells (OX-8) were used to identify T cells in immunocytochemical techniques on spleen sections, as well as in fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis of spleen cell suspensions. The onset of hemolytic anemic at 7 weeks after transplantation coincided with the first detection of tumor cells in the spleen and peripheral blood. Tumor cells first accumulated in the marginal zones, and then they infiltrated the red pulp sinusoids. Although the leukemia caused dispersion of the splenic lymphoid tissue, there was no significant lymphopenia, and the relative number of helper (W3/25+) and suppressor (OX-8+) lymphocytes did not change. Because the induction of anemia was a relatively early event in splenic involvement, we concluded that anemia was unrelated to disruption of lymphoid architecture; furthermore, it does not appear to be caused by changes in the numbers of regulatory T lymphocytes.","['Stromberg, P C', 'Kociba, G J', 'Grants, I S', 'Krakowka, G S', 'Rinehart, J J', 'Mezza, L E']","['Stromberg PC', 'Kociba GJ', 'Grants IS', 'Krakowka GS', 'Rinehart JJ', 'Mezza LE']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Ohio State University, Columbus.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,,IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic/*etiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Organ Size', 'Osmotic Fragility', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Spleen/*pathology', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory']",,1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 1990 Nov;27(6):397-403. doi: 10.1177/030098589902700603.,0300-9858 (Print) 0300-9858 (Linking),['10.1177/030098589902700603 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

PC anticoagulant activity and factor IX, X and II coagulant activity decreased proportionally to their half-lives to a nadir of 50-60% of pretreatment values after 2-5 L-ase infusions, suggesting that inhibition of protein synthesis rather than consumption is the main mechanism responsible for the observed changes. Free PS antigen levels declined at a rate similar to total PS antigen, reaching a nadir of 56% of pretreatment values after 3 L-ase infusions; however due to C4b-binding protein levels higher than total PS levels (p less than 0.05), they were constantly lower than the corresponding total PS antigen levels (0.05 less than p less than 0.001). This implicates that total PS antigen levels cannot be taken as an indicator of PS activity. No differences between the antigenic levels and the anticoagulant activities of PC and free PS could be observed suggesting that L-ase does not affect the mechanisms of vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of Gla-residues. The faster rate of decline of PC and PS activities relative to that of factor II may be responsible for the onset of an hypercoagulable state during the early phase of L-ase treatment.","[""Vigano'D'Angelo, S"", 'Gugliotta, L', 'Mattioli Belmonte, M', 'Cascione, M L', 'Pattarini, E', ""D'Angelo, A""]","[""Vigano'D'Angelo S"", 'Gugliotta L', 'Mattioli Belmonte M', 'Cascione ML', 'Pattarini E', ""D'Angelo A""]","['Servizio di Coagulazione, IRCCS H.S.Raffaele, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Complement Inactivator Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein C)', '0 (Protein S)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.4.- (Carbon-Carbon Ligases)', 'EC 6.4.- (glutamyl carboxylase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amides/metabolism', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/drug effects', 'Blood Proteins/drug effects', '*Carbon-Carbon Ligases', 'Carrier Proteins/drug effects', '*Complement Inactivator Proteins', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ligases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Protein C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein S']",,1990/09/15 00:00,1990/09/15 00:01,['1990/09/15 00:00'],"['1990/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 1990 Sep 15;59(6):985-94. doi: 10.1016/0049-3848(90)90122-s.,0049-3848 (Print) 0049-3848 (Linking),['10.1016/0049-3848(90)90122-s [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Animals exposed to virus as neonates exhibit a marked depression in virus-specific T cell function as measured by the virtual absence of in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity responses and in vitro proliferative responses to virally infected stimulator cells. Further, serum obtained from neonatally treated mice failed to either immunoprecipitate viral proteins or neutralize virus in an in vitro plaque assay, suggesting the concurrent induction of a state of B cell hyporesponsiveness. The specificity of this effect at the levels of both T and B cells was demonstrated by the ability of neonatally treated mice to respond normally after adult challenge with either irrelevant reovirus or influenza virus. The replication of Gross virus within both stromal and lymphocytic compartments of the neonatal thymus suggests that thymic education plays a key role in the induction of immunologic nonresponsiveness to viruses.","['Korostoff, J M', 'Nakada, M T', 'Faas, S J', 'Blank, K J', 'Gaulton, G N']","['Korostoff JM', 'Nakada MT', 'Faas SJ', 'Blank KJ', 'Gaulton GN']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology/physiology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Reference Values', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Virus Replication']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1990 Dec 1;172(6):1765-75. doi: 10.1084/jem.172.6.1765.,0022-1007 (Print) 0022-1007 (Linking),['10.1084/jem.172.6.1765 [doi]'],PMC2188776,"['AI-287150/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-00193/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

In this study we analyzed whether other subset-specific functional molecules were expressed in GL183- NK cells. To this end, mice were immunized with the PE29 (CD3-CD16+GL183-) NK clone. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were selected by screening the hybridoma supernatants for their ability to trigger the cytolytic activity of clone PE29 against the human myelomonocytic leukemia U937. The EB6 mAb (IgG1) triggered the PE29 clone, but not a GL183+ clone used as a control. EB6+ cells ranged between 1 and 13% of peripheral blood lymphocytes and were largely included in the CD3-CD16+CD56+ cell populations (only less than 2% of EB6+ cells were CD3+). Analysis of resting or activated CD3-CD16+ populations, or clones for the expression of EB6 or GL183 mAbs, allowed us to identify four distinct, phenotypically stable, NK subsets (EB6+GL183-; EB6+GL183+; EB6-GL183+; EB6-GL183-). Similar to GL183 mAb, the EB6 mAb selectively triggered the NK subset expressing the corresponding surface antigen to lyse human tumor cell lines including U937, IGROV-I, M14, and A549. In addition, EB6 mAb sharply inhibited the cytolytic activity of EB6+ clones against P815, M12, and P3U1 murine target cells. In EB6+GL183+ (""double-positive"") clones both EB6 and GL183 mAb inhibited the redirected killing of P815 cells induced by anti-CD16, anti-CD2 mAbs and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Similar to GL183 molecules, molecules precipitated by EB6 mAb were represented by either single 58-kD chain or double chains of 55 and 58 kD (with no detectable differences in EB6+GL183- or EB6+GL183+ clones). In sequential immunoprecipitation experiments using the double-positive clones CEG52 and CA25.50, preclearing of cell lysates with EB6 or GL183 mAb removed only EB6 or GL183 molecules, respectively, thus indicating that the two antigenic determinants are carried by two distinct molecules. Peptide map analysis indicated that EB6 (or GL183) molecules precipitated from double-positive clones were identical to the corresponding molecules isolated from single-positive ones. On the other hand, comparison of the EB6 and GL183 maps revealed peptides that were unique to each molecule, although most of the major peptides migrated to identical positions. We further investigated whether correlation existed between the phenotypic assignment of NK clones and their ability to mediate specific lysis of normal allogeneic cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Moretta, A', 'Bottino, C', 'Pende, D', 'Tripodi, G', 'Tambussi, G', 'Viale, O', 'Orengo, A', 'Barbaresi, M', 'Merli, A', 'Ciccone, E']","['Moretta A', 'Bottino C', 'Pende D', 'Tripodi G', 'Tambussi G', 'Viale O', 'Orengo A', 'Barbaresi M', 'Merli A', 'Ciccone E', 'et al.']","['Istituto di Istologia ed Embriologia Generale, Universita di Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1990 Dec 1;172(6):1589-98. doi: 10.1084/jem.172.6.1589.,0022-1007 (Print) 0022-1007 (Linking),['10.1084/jem.172.6.1589 [doi]'],PMC2188758,,,,,,,

Of the 20 patients, all 14 patients who were 3 years old and less were diagnosed as having acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) by use of platelet-specific monoclonal antibodies and platelet peroxidase (PPO) reaction in electron microscopy. They were characterized by the presence of bone marrow fibrosis, having a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a poor response to chemotherapy. Only one patient has remained in continuous complete remission for more than 1 year. Acute leukemia in six patients who were older than 4 years was classified as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In one of six patients classified as ALL, the leukemic blasts simultaneously expressed myeloid-associated surface antigens. All six patients achieved a complete remission and have remained in continuous complete remission and have remained in continuous complete remission from 10 to 52 months from the initial diagnosis. Although it has been suggested that the distribution of types of acute leukemia in patients with DS is similar to that in normal children, the present study shows that the distribution of acute leukemia types is quite different from that in patients without Down's syndrome.","['Kojima, S', 'Matsuyama, T', 'Sato, T', 'Horibe, K', 'Konishi, S', 'Tsuchida, M', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Kigasawa, H', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Okamura, J']","['Kojima S', 'Matsuyama T', 'Sato T', 'Horibe K', 'Konishi S', 'Tsuchida M', 'Hayashi Y', 'Kigasawa H', 'Akiyama Y', 'Okamura J', 'et al.']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Blood Platelets/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*immunology', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Neprilysin', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Dec 1;76(11):2348-53.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)84862-9 [pii]'],,,['Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2542-3.

We have now shown that freshly isolated normal pre-B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu- fraction of adult mouse bone marrow) adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site, as shown in a serum-free adherence assay, and they lose this functional ability on differentiation in vivo into B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu+ fraction). Similarly, cells from an immortalized but stromal cell-dependent and nontumorigenic murine pre-B cell line originally derived from a Whitlock-Witte culture were also found to adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site. Moreover, in the presence of anti-FN receptor antibodies, the ability of this immortalized pre-B cell line to proliferate when co-cultured with a supportive stromal cell line (M2-10B4 cells) was markedly reduced (down to 30% of control). This suggests that pre-B cell attachment to FN on stromal cells may be an important component of the mechanism by which stromal cells stimulate normal pre-B cell proliferation and one that is no longer operative to control their more differentiated progeny. Two differently transformed pre-B cell lines, both of which are autocrine, stromal-independent, tumorigenic in vivo, and partially or completely differentiation-arrested at a very early stage of pre-B cell development, did not bind to FN. In addition, anti-FN receptor antibodies were much less effective in diminishing the ability of these tumorigenic pre-B cells to respond to M2-10B4 cell stimulation, which could still be demonstrated when the tumorigenic pre-B cells were co-cultured with M2-10B4 cells at a sufficiently low cell density. Analysis of cell surface molecules immunoprecipitated from both the nontumorigenic and tumorigenic pre-B cell lines by an anti-FN receptor antibody showed an increase in very late antigen (VLA) alpha chain(s) in both tumorigenic pre-B cell lines and a decrease in the beta 1 chain in one. Interestingly, all of the pre-B cell lines expressed similar amounts of messenger RNA for the beta 1 chain of the FN receptor. These results suggest that alteration of FN receptor expression on pre-B cells may represent a mechanism contributing to the outgrowth of leukemic pre-B cells with an autocrine phenotype and capable of stromal cell-independent, autonomous growth.","['Lemoine, F M', 'Dedhar, S', 'Lima, G M', 'Eaves, C J']","['Lemoine FM', 'Dedhar S', 'Lima GM', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Fibronectin', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/immunology/physiology']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Dec 1;76(11):2311-20.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)84857-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Although infection by either agent leads to symptoms of immunodeficiency, recent studies suggest potential differences in the time course and severity of these diseases. In this report, the transcriptional regulation and induction of these retroviruses were analyzed. We report that the regulation of HIV-2 differs from that of HIV-1: a distinct T-cell activation pathway, triggering of the CD3 component of the T-cell receptor complex, stimulates HIV-2 but not HIV-1 gene expression. The response to T-cell receptor stimulation in HIV-2 is mediated partly by an upstream regulatory element, termed CD3R, which is recognized by a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, NF-CD3R. Jurkat T leukemia cell lines containing HIV-2 provirus also showed increased viral replication after stimulation of the T-cell receptor complex, in contrast to HIV-1. These findings suggest that transcriptional regulation and induction of HIV-2 differ from HIV-1 and raise the possibility that different cofactors contribute to the activation of HIV-1- and HIV-2-associated AIDS.","['Markovitz, D M', 'Hannibal, M', 'Perez, V L', 'Gauntt, C', 'Folks, T M', 'Nabel, G J']","['Markovitz DM', 'Hannibal M', 'Perez VL', 'Gauntt C', 'Folks TM', 'Nabel GJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic/drug effects', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HIV-2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Plasmids', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Dec;87(23):9098-102. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.23.9098.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),['10.1073/pnas.87.23.9098 [doi]'],PMC55111,"['AI26865/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

No significant exocytosis occurs in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This absolute requirement for Ca2+ is eliminated by suspending the cells in a hypotonic buffer containing 60 to 80 mM K+; Na+ cannot substitute for K+. Optimal Ca2(+)-independent exocytosis occurs in a buffer containing 20 mM dipotassium Pipes, pH 7.1, 40 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose, 7 mM Mg acetate, 0.1% BSA, and 1 mM EGTA. The cells maintain this Ca2(+)-independent exocytosis even if they are preincubated with 1 mM EGTA for 40 min at 37 degrees C before triggering. Exocytosis is eliminated as isotonicity is approached by adding sucrose, NaCl, KCl, or potassium glutamate to the buffer. Quin 2 fluorescence measurements reveal only a very small rise in [Ca2+]i when the cells are triggered in hypotonic buffer in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and the presence of 1 mM EGTA. In isotonic buffer, degranulation does not occur under conditions that lead to such a small rise in [Ca2+]i. Sustained IgE receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, which is also Ca2+ dependent in isotonic buffer, becomes independent of Ca2+ in the hypotonic buffer. In fact, the rate of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in hypotonic buffer in the absence of Ca2+ (and presence of 1 mM EGTA) is twice that observed in isotonic buffer in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. These data show that in hypotonic buffer, the requirement of IgE receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis for extracellular Ca2+ is eliminated, and degranulation proceeds with a [Ca2+]i of 0.1 microM, the baseline level of [Ca2+]i found in resting cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in isotonic buffer, the Ca2+ requirement for mast cell degranulation is for the generation of second messengers via hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositols.","['Hohman, R J', 'Hultsch, T', 'Talbot, E']","['Hohman RJ', 'Hultsch T', 'Talbot E']","['Allergic Diseases Section, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Hypotonic Solutions)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Degranulation', '*Exocytosis', 'Hydrolysis', 'Hypotonic Solutions/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Potassium/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Dec 1;145(11):3876-82.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Binding affinities were examined with equilibrium and kinetic measurements, and we found that epsilon/C gamma 3 (mIgE with C epsilon 4 replaced by C gamma 3) was indistinguishable from mIgE. The huIgG1 and the other chimeric Ig, which did not contain both C epsilon 2 and C epsilon 3, did not bind detectably to rat basophilic leukemia cells (Ka less than 10(6) M-1). The ability of these chimeric Ig to stimulate a cellular response (degranulation) in the presence of multivalent Ag was also tested. The epsilon/C gamma 3 was indistinguishable from mIgE in eliciting a high level of degranulation, whereas the other chimeric Ig stimulated no response even when they were preaggregated to enhance their binding avidity. These results demonstrate that C epsilon 4 may be replaced by C gamma 3 without affecting the binding and cell activating properties of mIgE. The lack of binding by the other chimeric Ig indicates that both C epsilon 2 and C epsilon 3 are necessary for the binding interaction.","['Weetall, M', 'Shopes, B', 'Holowka, D', 'Baird, B']","['Weetall M', 'Shopes B', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']","['Department of Chemistry, Baker Laboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Recombinant Proteins/*metabolism']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Dec 1;145(11):3849-54.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,"['AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM08267/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

There is a concurrent increase in the amount of filamentous actin associated with the plasma membrane. Both the degree of receptor detergent insolubility and the rise in F-actin content are rapid with a half-maximal response of less than 1 min and can be rapidly reversed by the addition of monovalent Ag (DNP-lysine). These two early steps in the triggering of rat basophilic leukemia cells can be dissociated from each other by pretreatment of the cells with either cytochalasin or sodium azide. These reagents block the increase in F-actin but have no effect on receptor detergent insolubility. This indicates that microfilaments are not responsible for detergent insolubility of the receptor and that it may be the membrane skeleton that is interacting with the complex. This was further confirmed by the finding that cross-linking of the IgE receptors on the surface of purified plasma membranes also leads to detergent insolubility of the receptor. Therefore, all of the components necessary for detergent insolubility of the receptor are present in the plasma membrane, and cytoplasmic components are not needed. These results suggest that detergent insolubility and immobility of the cross-linked receptors are caused by multivalent interaction with the membrane skeleton. Actin filaments may then interact with these receptor-membrane skeletal complexes in order to produce large scale clustering and capping. The membrane skeleton may therefore be acting as an intermediate structure between the cell-surface receptors and microfilaments.","['Apgar, J R']",['Apgar JR'],"['Division of Membrane Biology, Medical Biology Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/physiology', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*chemistry', 'Cytoskeleton/*physiology', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*chemistry', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Dec 1;145(11):3814-22.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,"['P01-AI24526/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI26950/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Only those protectants that restored ATP levels (adenosine or hypoxanthine) could abolish the stimulatory effect of trimetrexate. Finally, it was shown that by exposing cells to various concentrations of 2,4-dinitrophenol, there was an inverse relationship between the number of DNA strand breaks produced by etoposide and the intracellular concentrations of ATP down to about 600 microM.

The use of monoclonal antibodies of VI-series in 90 patients with ALL allowed to describe an immunophenotype of the subvariants in detail. The mosaic expression of myeloid antigens CD11, CD14, CD15, CDw65 identified by MoAbs VIM-12, VIM-13, VIM-D5 and VIM-2, respectively, on blast cells of patients with AML was shown. The expression of CD11 (ICO-GM1) or CD15 (ICO-G2) was prognostically unfavorable in children with AML (p = 0.0028). The expression of T-cell markers (E-receptor, CD7, reactivity with anti-T-cell serum) on blasts was prognostically favorable in children with AML (p = 0.003).

Only 1% of individuals infected with HTLV-I develop clinical disease however. The various manifestations of an HTLV-I infection may be related to differences in the genetic backgrounds of individuals, infection with variant strains of HTLV-I, differences in viral tropism or host immune response to the virus. Whereas the humoral response to HTLV-I is well characterized, little is known about the human cellular immune response, such as the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here we report the presence of high levels of circulating HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in patients with HTLV-I associated neurological disease but not in HTLV-I seropositive individuals without neurological involvement. These cytotoxic T lymphocytes are CD8+, HLA class I- restricted and predominantly recognize the HTLV-I gene products encoded in the regulatory region pX. These findings suggest that HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of associated neurological disorders associated with HTLV-I.","['Jacobson, S', 'Shida, H', 'McFarlin, D E', 'Fauci, A S', 'Koenig, S']","['Jacobson S', 'Shida H', 'McFarlin DE', 'Fauci AS', 'Koenig S']","['Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics']",,1990/11/15 00:00,1990/11/15 00:01,['1990/11/15 00:00'],"['1990/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1990 Nov 15;348(6298):245-8. doi: 10.1038/348245a0.,0028-0836 (Print) 0028-0836 (Linking),['10.1038/348245a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

At the time of diagnosis, the plasma concentrations of BTG and PF4 were measured and were found to be high. Thus, an increased PDGF level was indirectly assumed, with the subsequent fibroblast stimulation. After treatment with low dose cytosine arabinoside, a clinical, analytical and histological remission was achieved, with a return of BTG and PF4 values to the normal range.

Three different cell lines were incubated with 20 and 5 micrograms ml-1 of TLF for various time periods; they were then washed and resuspended in buffer. Fluorescence decay measurements and time-integrated and time-gated spectra were then obtained from the cell suspensions. Similar experiments were repeated using HPD containing 60% of the active material. The experimental results show a modification of the emission spectra for both drugs depending on the incubation time; this modification is more significant for the TLF. In particular, the emission peak observed in aqueous solution at 615 nm is shifted to 630 nm as a consequence of incorporation into cells, and the gated spectra indicate that the fluorescence emission is mainly related to monomers and unfolded polymeric chains. The ratio between the intensities of the two peaks depends on the relative amount of the TLF; the peak at 615 nm is more pronounced for HPD. The results obtained seem to indicate that both the composition of the drug and the metabolic properties of the biological environment strongly influence the uptake process and the fluorescence behaviour of the incorporated sensitizer.","['Cubeddu, R', 'Ramponi, R', 'Taroni, P', 'Canti, G', 'Ricci, L', 'Supino, R']","['Cubeddu R', 'Ramponi R', 'Taroni P', 'Canti G', 'Ricci L', 'Supino R']","['C.E.Q.S.E.-C.N.R., Istituto di Fisica del Politecnico, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The two major impediments to in vitro studies of these malignancies have been the contamination of CTCL cells with normal T cells and the inability to induce a vigorous proliferative response or establish long-term cultures with standard T-cell mitogens. The ideal reagent for identifying CTCL cells in a given patient would be tumor specific. Although a monoclonal antibody to the clonotypic antigen receptor on CTCL cells would approach this ideal, it is not currently feasible to generate such antibodies for each CTCL patient. As a compromise, we chose to test an ""almost clonotypic"" reagent by examining whether monoclonal antibodies directed at the variable (V) region of the T-cell antigen receptor could be applied to CTCL. We identified three Sezary patients, who by standard T-cell phenotype and Southern blot analysis for clonality had a virtually pure peripheral blood population of leukemic cells (PBL). We then screened the PBL of these patients with a panel of seven commercially available monoclonal anti-V region antibodies and found one patients' cells reacted greater than 99% with alpha V beta 5. The other patients' cells were non-reactive. In addition, we utilized a solid-phase system to cross-link V beta 5 on the one CTCL patients' PBL cells, and found that they proliferated vigorously in the presence of 10 units of IL-2 and IL-4. Parallel cultures have been maintained for one month by restimulation twice a week. These findings suggest that anti-V region antibodies should prove useful for investigating the immunobiology of CTCL.","['Charley, M', 'McCoy, J P', 'Deng, J S', 'Jegasothy, B']","['Charley M', 'McCoy JP', 'Deng JS', 'Jegasothy B']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Pittsburgh Medical School, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*immunology/pathology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'Sezary Syndrome/immunology/pathology']",,1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1990 Nov;95(5):614-7. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12505618.,0022-202X (Print) 0022-202X (Linking),"['S0022-202X(90)91301-Q [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12505618 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Exposure of intact mouse L1210 cells to CB 3717 resulted in inactivation of cellular TS activity, yet desalted cytosol preparations from these cells retained the ability to bind FdUMP. The same effect was found with several analogs of CB 3717.

By colony-forming assay, the concentrations of fluorouridine (FUrd), fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) or FUra giving 90% cell kill (IC90) at various exposure times (texps) were obtained. With P388 cells, the curve of texps-IC90 for FUrd on a log-log scale was linear with a slope of -1, which is typical for cell cycle phase-nonspecific agents. In contrast, the curve for FdUrd showed a much steeper slope than -1, which is characteristic for cell cycle phase-specific agents. We found that the curve for FUra was exactly the same as that for FUrd, indicating that the mode of FUra action on P388 leukemia is analogous to that of FUrd. Similar results were observed with human colon and renal cancer cell lines, HT-29 and KU-2, although when the cells were exposed to relatively low concentrations of FUra for a long time, a cell cycle phase-specific action became evident.","['Inaba, M', 'Mitsuhashi, J', 'Ozawa, S']","['Inaba M', 'Mitsuhashi J', 'Ozawa S']","['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '4K0M952561 (5-fluorouridine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'V1JK16Y2JP (doxifluridine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects/physiology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Floxuridine/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Ribosomal/antagonists & inhibitors', 'S Phase/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Uridine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1990 Oct;81(10):1039-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb03343.x.,0910-5050 (Print) 0910-5050 (Linking),['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb03343.x [doi]'],PMC5917971,,,,,,,

In vitro experiments showed a UVB dose-dependent abrogation of lymphocyte responder and stimulator functions, with concurrent preservation of platelet aggregation responses. In a phase I pilot study, UVB-treated platelet concentrates were administered to four bone marrow transplant recipients. Adverse effects attributable to the transfusions were not observed, and patients showed clinically effective transfusion responses. No patient developed lymphocytotoxic HLA or platelet antibodies.

It shows that a single injection of the anti-mitotic drug, vinblasting (Vb), results in complete regression of a large L5178Y lymphoma and its metastases, but not if it is growing in an immunocompetent host. Vb-induced, immunologically mediated tumour regression was dependent on the anti-tumour function of CD8+ T cells, because regression was prevented by depleting the host of this subset of T cells 24 hr after Vb was given. Regression was also prevented by infusing the host with Vb-sensitive, CD4+ T cells from a tumour-bearing donor. These and other results are in keeping with the interpretation that Vb-induced regression of the L5178Y lymphoma depends on the ability of the drug to eliminate CD4+ suppressor T cells that are replicating, and to spare non-replicating CD8+ effector cells. It is suggested that at an advanced stage of growth of the L5178Y lymphoma the host possesses an acquired population of antigen-primed CD8+ effector T cells that are unable to become activated in response to abundant tumour antigen because of the dominant influence of CD4+ suppressor cells. Activation of these CD8+ T cells was indicated by the finding that they were rapidly converted from being cyclophosphamide (Cy) resistant to being highly Cy sensitive within 48 hr of giving Vb.","['North, R J', 'Awwad, M']","['North RJ', 'Awwad M']","['Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, New York 12983.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Immune Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Immunocompetence', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*drug effects', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1990 Sep;71(1):90-5.,0019-2805 (Print) 0019-2805 (Linking),,PMC1384226,"['CA-16642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The lack of direct relationship between synovial tissue NEP concentration and leukocytic infiltration suggests that the cellular source of NEP may be synoviocytes or fibroblasts, and that NEP may have distinctive pathogenetic roles in human arthritis.","['Sreedharan, S P', 'Goetzl, E J', 'Malfroy, B']","['Sreedharan SP', 'Goetzl EJ', 'Malfroy B']","['Department of Medicine, University of California Medical Center, San Francisco 94143-0724.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Arthritis/enzymology/*immunology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin/*metabolism', 'Synovial Membrane/enzymology/*immunology']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1990 Sep;71(1):142-4.,0019-2805 (Print) 0019-2805 (Linking),,PMC1384235,,,,,,,

Menogaril-resistant mouse leukaemia P388 cells were developed in vitro by 4 months of exposure to step-wise increasing concentrations of menogaril after which resistant cells (P388/MEN) were cloned in 320 ng ml-1 menogaril. P388/MEN cells were 40-fold more resistant to menogaril in vitro compared to P388/O and were also resistant in vivo. Resistance to menogaril was stable for at least 2 months in the absence of the drug. The results indicate that P388/MEN, although resistant to an anthracycline, did not display the typical multidrug resistant phenotype. It was not cross-resistant to several structurally unrelated drugs such as actinomycin D, cisplatin, or vinblastine, but it was cross-resistant to the anthracycline, adriamycin. Uptake and efflux of menogaril was similar in sensitive and resistant cell lines. Also, resistance was not reversed by verapamil. No major karyotypic difference was noted between P388/O and P388/MEN. There was no significant amplification or overexpression of the mdr gene in P388/MEN compared to P388/O. In contrast to P388/MEN, P388 cells resistant to adriamycin displayed the typical multidrug resistant phenotype. Glutathione content of P388/MEN cells was similar to that of P388/O and depletion of glutathione did not potentiate menogaril cytotoxicity. Therefore, we conclude that glutathione is not likely to be involved in menogaril resistance to P388/MEN cells.","['Badiner, G J', 'Moy, B C', 'Smith, K S', 'Tarpley, W G', 'Groppi, V E', 'Bhuyan, B K']","['Badiner GJ', 'Moy BC', 'Smith KS', 'Tarpley WG', 'Groppi VE', 'Bhuyan BK']","['Cancer and Infectious Diseases Research, Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8JSV4O30HQ (Menogaril)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'L059DCD6IP (Nogalamycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Menogaril', 'Mice', 'Nogalamycin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Sep;62(3):378-84. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.302.,0007-0920 (Print) 0007-0920 (Linking),['10.1038/bjc.1990.302 [doi]'],PMC1971454,,,,,,,

It is largely limited to patients with HLA-matched sibling marrow donors and those for whom phenotypically HLA-matched unrelated donors can be identified. There therefore exists a significant number of patients for whom this potentially curative therapy is not available. Autologous marrow transplantation might be an alternative approach, but concern about the infusion of leukemic cells with the autologous marrow exists. Multiple methods for removing neoplastic cells from marrow (marrow purging) have been developed. Clinical results using purged marrow in treating patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia in second or greater remission by autologous bone marrow transplantation approach those observed in allogeneic marrow transplantation. Current investigations include the development of more effective cytoreductive regimens, use of recombinant hematopoietic growth factors, improvement of marrow purging techniques, and enhancement of cell-mediated anti-leukemic activity in patients receiving autologous marrow transplants.","['Gress, R E']",['Gress RE'],"['NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Tissue Preservation/methods']",66,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 1990 Aug;4(8):35-40, 43; discussion 43-4, 47-8.",0890-9091 (Print) 0890-9091 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

Using this methodology we observed that: (i) ATP concentration and intracellular pH are highly regulated and no changes could be resolved in them upon stimulation and during exocytosis. (ii) In the absence of potassium ions in the cells' medium, a decrease is observed in the intracellular pH and ATP concentration and an increase in the Na+ concentration. (iii) From the influx of extracellular Na+ following inhibition of the Na+, K(+)-ATPase by ouabain, we estimated the inward Na+ current of resting cells to 5 x 10(7) ions/(cell.s).

Therefore, methods were developed to analyze the capacity of Lyt-2+ T-cells to respond to a syngeneic tumor in the absence of a contribution by L3T4+ T-cells. Conditions were defined in which purified Lyt-2+ T-cell populations, as well as L3T4+ T-cell populations, isolated from immune B6 spleen cells, could be induced to proliferate specifically in response to FBL, a retrovirally induced syngeneic tumor, without the addition of exogenous lymphokines. The purity of the subset responses was documented functionally by selective inhibition of the proliferative response of only the appropriate subset following addition of anti-Kb/Db or anti-I-Ab. The antigen and accessory cell (AC) requirements for triggering immune Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ T-cell populations were examined. The response of L3T4+ populations was predominantly specific for retrovirus envelope gp70, whereas Lyt-2+ populations predominantly recognized tumor antigens other than gp70, consistent with the hypothesis that some tumor antigens may be preferentially recognized by only class I- or class II-restricted T-cells. The FBL-stimulated proliferative response of each T-cell subset was dependent upon the presence of syngeneic AC. However, exogenous interleukin 1 was able to replace AC during the response of Lyt-2+ populations, whereas L3T4+ populations required AC also to biochemically process tumor-derived antigen and present it in the context of class II MHC molecules. The results suggest that under some conditions only the presence of AC or interleukin 1 may be limiting for the induction of antitumor responses by Lyt-2+ populations. These studies analyzed the ability to trigger purified Lyt-2+ T-cells in vitro following in vivo priming to tumor, and it remained possible that L3T4+ T-cells made an essential contribution during in vivo priming. Therefore, L3T4(+)-deficient mice were primed with FBL in vivo, and the Lyt-2+ T-cell response was assessed. Although priming was clearly less efficient in the absence of L3T4+ T-cells, Lyt-2+ T-cells from L3T4(+)-deficient mice proliferated and became cytolytically active following stimulation with FBL. Thus, under appropriate conditions, Lyt-2+ T-cells can generate an effective antitumor response in the absence of L3T4+ T-cells or exogenous lymphokines.","['Kern, D E', 'Klarnet, J P', 'Cheever, M A', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Kern DE', 'Klarnet JP', 'Cheever MA', 'Greenberg PD']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Lyt antibodies)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Interleukin-1/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Macrophages/cytology/*immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Phenotype', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/cytology/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Oct 1;50(19):6256-63.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07266/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

However, the signaling pathways responsible for induction of the differentiated monocytic phenotype remain unclear. The present studies demonstrate that dexamethasone blocks TPA-induced U-937 cell growth inhibition, adherence, and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase staining. The results also demonstrate that dexamethasone inhibits the appearance of c-fms transcripts associated with TPA treatment. Run-on transcription assays demonstrated that the c-fms gene is transcriptionally active in uninduced U-937 cells and that the rate of transcription is unchanged after dexamethasone and/or TPA treatment. These findings indicated that TPA increases c-fms expression by a dexamethasone-sensitive posttranscriptional mechanism. Treatment of U-937 cells with TPA was also associated with stimulation of arachidonic acid metabolism. Furthermore, dexamethasone, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2 activity, blocked TPA-induced increases in arachidonic acid release. These findings suggested that TPA may regulate certain features of monocytic differentiation, such as c-fms gene expression, through the formation of arachidonic acid metabolites. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, had no detectable effect on c-fms gene expression. However, the cyclooxygenase metabolite, prostaglandin E2, inhibited the TPA-induced increases in c-fms mRNA levels. Taken together, the results indicate that TPA regulates c-fms gene expression by a dexamethasone-sensitive mechanism and that c-fms mRNA levels are controlled by metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway.","['Stone, R M', 'Imamura, K', 'Datta, R', 'Sherman, M L', 'Kufe, D W']","['Stone RM', 'Imamura K', 'Datta R', 'Sherman ML', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acids/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",,1990/09/15 00:00,1990/09/15 00:01,['1990/09/15 00:00'],"['1990/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Sep 15;76(6):1225-32.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),['S0006-4971(20)79650-3 [pii]'],,['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Southern blot analysis of 10 leukemic T-cell lines revealed no gross genomic deletions or rearrangements. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of p53 mRNA indicated that all 10 lines produced p53 mRNA of normal size. By direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA, we detected 11 missense and nonsense point mutations in 5 of the 10 leukemic T-cell lines studied. The mutations are primarily located in the evolutionarily highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. One of the five cell lines in which a mutation was detected possesses a homozygous point mutation in both p53 alleles, while the other four cell lines harbor from two to four different point mutations. An allelic study of two of the lines (CEM, A3/Kawa) shows that the two missense mutations found in each line are located on separate alleles, thus both alleles of the p53 gene may have been functionally inactivated by two different point mutations. Since cultured leukemic T-cell lines represent a late, fully tumorigenic stage of leukemic T cells, mutation of both (or more) alleles of the p53 gene may reflect the selection of cells possessing an increasingly tumorigenic phenotype, whether the selection took place in vivo or in vitro. Previously, we have shown that the HSB-2 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line had lost both alleles of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene. Taken together, our data show that at least 6 of 10 leukemic T-cell lines examined may have lost the normal function of a known tumor suppressor gene, suggesting that this class of genes serves a critical role in the generation of fully tumorigenic leukemic T cells.","['Cheng, J', 'Haas, M']","['Cheng J', 'Haas M']","['UCSD Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Oct;10(10):5502-9. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.10.5502-5509.1990.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),['10.1128/mcb.10.10.5502-5509.1990 [doi]'],PMC361264,['34151/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Transient transfections allowed localization of enhancer activity to a 480-base-pair HincII-XbaI restriction enzyme fragment. The TCR beta enhancer was active on both the minimal simian virus 40 promoter and a TCR beta variable gene promoter in both TCR alpha/beta + and TCR gamma/delta + T cells. It displayed significantly less activity in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells and K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and no activity in HeLa fibroblasts. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the enhancer contains a consensus immunoglobulin kappa E2 motif, as well as an AP-1-binding site and a cyclic AMP response element. DNase I footprint analyses using Jurkat T-cell nuclear extracts allowed the identification of five nuclear protein-binding sites, T beta 1 to T beta 5, within the enhancer element. Deletion and in vitro mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the T beta 2- and T beta 3- and T beta 4-binding sites are each required for full transcriptional enhancer activity. In contrast, deletion of the T beta 1- and T beta 5-binding sites had essentially no effect on enhancer function. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that TCR alpha/beta + and TCR gamma/delta + T cells expressed T beta 2-, T beta 3-, and T beta 4-binding activities. In contrast, non-T-cell lines, in which the enhancer was inactive, each lacked expression of at least one of these binding activities. TCR alpha and beta gene expression may be regulated by a common set of T-cell nuclear proteins in that the T beta 2 element binding a set of cyclic AMP response element-binding proteins that are also bound by the T alpha 1 element of the human TCR alpha enhancer and the decamer element present in a large number of human and murine TCR beta promoters. Similarly, the T beta 5 TCR beta-enhancer element and the T alpha 2 TCR alpha-enhancer element bind at least one common T-cell nuclear protein. Taken together, these results suggest that TCR beta gene expression is regulated by the interaction of multiple T cell nuclear proteins with a transcriptional enhancer element located 3' of the C beta 2 gene and that some of these proteins may be involved in the coordinate regulation of TCR alpha and beta gene expression.","['Gottschalk, L R', 'Leiden, J M']","['Gottschalk LR', 'Leiden JM']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Oct;10(10):5486-95. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.10.5486-5495.1990.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),['10.1128/mcb.10.10.5486-5495.1990 [doi]'],PMC361259,['AI-29673/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['GENBANK/M58747'],

It was found that menogaril inhibited the initial polymerization rate of tubulin, indicating a possible contribution of this process to the overall cytotoxicity of menogaril.","['Wierzba, K', 'Sugimoto, Y', 'Matsuo, K', 'Toko, T', 'Takeda, S', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tsukagoshi, S']","['Wierzba K', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Matsuo K', 'Toko T', 'Takeda S', 'Yamada Y', 'Tsukagoshi S']","['Section of Anticancer Research, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Polyphosphates)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tubulin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8JSV4O30HQ (Menogaril)', 'L059DCD6IP (Nogalamycin)', 'NU43IAG5BC (triphosphoric acid)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Menogaril', 'Microtubule Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Nogalamycin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Polyphosphates/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1990 Aug;81(8):842-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02654.x.,0910-5050 (Print) 0910-5050 (Linking),['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02654.x [doi]'],PMC5918082,,,,,,,

Among the various stimuli tested, the synergistic combination of phorbol diester and VD3 was the most potent inducer of HILDA/LIF gene expression. The kinetics of mRNA accumulation on activated Mo showed a stimulation peak at 24 hr which declined thereafter. HILDA/LIF activity in culture supernatants was detected at 24 hr and reached a plateau at 72 hr of culture. In contrast to Mo, PBL did not accumulate HILDA/LIF mRNA upon culture with PDBu and VD3, whereas PHA and the combination of PDBu and A23187 induced HILDA/LIF mRNA accumulation and secretion in the culture supernatant. To exclude the possibility that HILDA/LIF was produced by contaminating PBL, highly enriched Mo preparations were used, which were devoid of T cells as assessed by the absence of TCR-beta chain mRNA transcripts. HILDA/LIF production by monocytic cells was further documented by the capacity of stimulated U937 cell conditioned medium to compete with 125I-labeled nHILDA/LIF for binding to its receptor on murine M1 cells. Under the synergistic effect of PDBu and VD3 stimulation, Mo-derived macrophages as well as HL-60 and U937 cell lines accumulated HILDA/LIF mRNA and produced this cytokine with identical kinetics as for Mo. Finally, we show that HILDA/LIF mRNA accumulation in U937 cells upon stimulation with PDBu, or the combination of PDBu and VD3, was inhibited in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX. These results document for the first time that human Mo, when stimulated appropriately in vitro, can express the HILDA/LIF gene and its product, and that intermediate proteins must be newly synthesized in this process.","['Anegon, I', 'Moreau, J F', 'Godard, A', 'Jacques, Y', 'Peyrat, M A', 'Hallet, M M', 'Wong, G', 'Soulillou, J P']","['Anegon I', 'Moreau JF', 'Godard A', 'Jacques Y', 'Peyrat MA', 'Hallet MM', 'Wong G', 'Soulillou JP']","['INSERM U211, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Dihydroxycholecalciferols)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta']",,1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1990 Oct 1;130(1):50-65. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(90)90161-j.,0008-8749 (Print) 0008-8749 (Linking),"['0008-8749(90)90161-J [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(90)90161-j [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Parameters investigated included monitoring of transcript levels of the proto-oncogenes C-MYC, C-FOS, and C-FMS, and analysis of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and of surface expression of the C3 bi receptor. Furthermore clonal proliferation of U 937 cells was assessed in soft agar cultures. The results indicate that both agents have only little effects on U 937 cells when acting alone. When combined in culture, however, they synergize to induce monocytic differentiation of U 937 cells as disclosed by significant increase of cells capable of reducing NBT and displaying surface C3 bi receptor that was accompanied by reduction of clonogenicity in colony assays. Induction of differentiation and inhibition of proliferation of U 937 cells was preceded by downregulation of transcript levels of C-MYC, increase of C-FOS mRNA, and induction of accumulation of C-FMS mRNA. By sequential use of LIF and ara-C we also demonstrate that the basis of synergism of both agents does not involve mechanisms at the level of receptor ligation but that synergism may be initiated by complementary intracellular metabolic cascades.","['Brach, M A', 'Riedel, D', 'Mertelsmann, R H', 'Herrmann, F']","['Brach MA', 'Riedel D', 'Mertelsmann RH', 'Herrmann F']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg, F.R.G.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (acidic isoferritin)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ferritins/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Complement/metabolism', 'Receptors, Complement 3b', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Sep;4(9):646-9.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,

In the other 7 children the diagnosis TMD was suggested as spontaneous or in one case interferon-induced remission occurred within 4 to 25 weeks after diagnosis. The interferon-treated patient died of SIDS at the age of 11 months. Another one of the TMD children developed fatal erythroleukaemia at the age of 2 years. Regarding initial clinical and haematological parameters, TMD was indistinguishable from true congenital leukaemie. In all patients classification according to the FAB criteria was difficult, as mainly undifferentiated or poorly differentiated myeloid blasts were seen, sometimes with erythro- or megakaryocytic features.

In this study we analyzed the protein level of c-myc and c-myb in 15 established cell lines derived from lymphopoietic disorders and in 45 samples from patients with acute or chronic lymphatic leukemias. Oncoproteins were assayed by radioimmuno-precipitation with polyclonal rabbit antibodies. In B-cell derived lines, such as Burkitt lymphoma and plasmocytoma lines, we found high amounts of c-myc and no or low amounts of c-myb. In contrast, all T-cell-derived lines revealed high levels of c-myb. In addition, T-lymphoma cell lines of low malignancy also exhibited high levels of c-myc, while T-cell lines of high malignancy (acute T-lymphoblastic leukemias) exhibited moderate levels of c-myc. Of the 45 patient samples analyzed, only three (one B-prolymphocytic and two acute T-lymphoblastic leukemias) contained detectable amounts of myc or myb protein. Corresponding to the results found in established cell lines, the B-cell sample revealed a high level of c-myc but no c-myb, while the T-cell samples revealed high levels of c-myb and no or low levels of c-myc. We therefore conclude that the predominance of c-myc or c-myb expression in malignant lymphoproliferative disorders may be associated to the B-cell or T-cell lineage, respectively. Further, regarding the T-cell lines, there is a possible correlation between cell maturation and the level of c-myc found together with a consistently elevated c-myb.","['Siegert, W', 'Beutler, C', 'Langmach, K', 'Keitel, C', 'Schmidt, C A']","['Siegert W', 'Beutler C', 'Langmach K', 'Keitel C', 'Schmidt CA']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Berlin, F.R.G.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*analysis/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'T-Lymphocytes/analysis']",,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1990;26(6):733-7. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(90)90130-l.,0959-8049 (Print) 0959-8049 (Linking),['10.1016/0277-5379(90)90130-l [doi]'],,,,,,,,
