The virus encodes a 135 kDa fusion protein which contains amino acid sequences derived from the viral Gag protein and the two cellular transcription factors c-Myb and c-Ets-1p68. Previously we have shown that like v-myb, v-ets on its own is also active in transformation, but only within the erythroid lineage. To understand better the mechanisms involved in the oncogenic activation of c-Ets-1p68, we used the polyoma PEA3 element, a known Ets binding site, to compare the sequence-specific DNA binding and transactivating properties of v-Ets and c-Ets-1p68. Using Ets protein synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in gel retardation assays, we detected little binding of c-Ets-1p68 to an oligonucleotide containing the PEA3 motif whereas v-Ets bound strongly. However, in transient cotransfection assays in chicken embryo fibroblasts both c-Ets-1p68 and v-Ets transactivated transcription from a heterologous promoter linked to PEA3 elements. Interestingly, fragments of c-Ets-1p68 with strong DNA binding activity could be produced by limited proteolysis, indicating that the DNA binding domain is repressed within the full-length molecule. By deletion mapping the DNA binding domain was localized to the most highly conserved region of the Ets-related proteins known as the ETS domain. The C-terminus as well as a region in the middle of the polypeptide chain are involved in repression of DNA binding in c-Ets-1p68. Significantly, v-Ets contains a 16 amino acid substitution at the C-terminus. Our results suggest that intramolecular repression of DNA binding is a regulatory mechanism in c-Ets-1p68 which is lost in v-Ets.","['Lim, F', 'Kraut, N', 'Framptom, J', 'Graf, T']","['Lim F', 'Kraut N', 'Framptom J', 'Graf T']","['European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (oncogene proteins v-ets)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['c-Ets', 'v-Ets']","['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Oncogenes', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",PMC556496,1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1992 Feb;11(2):643-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the characterization of Myl and of the reciprocal MylRAR (PMLRAR) and RARMyl (RARPML) fusion transcripts which are found in two classes of APL patients. Myl displays similarities with a new family of proteins of which some members are fused to protooncogenes in the transforming proteins RFP-ret and T18. The speckled nuclear localization of Myl, as well as its sequence homology with the 52 kDa component of the RO/SSA ribonucleoprotein particle, suggest that Myl may be present in a ribonucleoprotein complex. In contrast to both Myl and RAR-alpha whose localization is essentially nuclear in the presence or absence of RA, MylRAR which is largely cytoplasmic in the absence of RA appears to be translocated to the nucleus in the presence of RA. Myl and MylRAR can associate in vitro and this association is mediated by a coiled coil in the Myl sequence. In vivo this association results in a colocalization of Myl and MylRAR which is identical to that of MylRAR alone. Studies of activation of transcription from the promoters of several RA target genes indicate that MylRARs have altered transcription activation properties when compared with RAR-alpha. Most notably, MylRAR represses markedly the activity of some RA target promoters in the absence of RA. Western blot analyses of patient samples show that MylRAR is expressed to a much higher level than wild type RAR-alpha originating from the normal allele. Taken together, these results suggest that MylRAR may interfere in a dominant manner with both Myl and RAR functions.","['Kastner, P', 'Perez, A', 'Lutz, Y', 'Rochette-Egly, C', 'Gaub, M P', 'Durand, B', 'Lanotte, M', 'Berger, R', 'Chambon, P']","['Kastner P', 'Perez A', 'Lutz Y', 'Rochette-Egly C', 'Gaub MP', 'Durand B', 'Lanotte M', 'Berger R', 'Chambon P']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire des Eucaryotes, CNRS, INSERM, Faculte de Medecine 11, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['My1', 'RAR-&agr;']","['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",PMC556495,1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1992 Feb;11(2):629-42.,"['GENBANK/D13200', 'GENBANK/D13201', 'GENBANK/D13202', 'GENBANK/D13203', 'GENBANK/L07339', 'GENBANK/M94783', 'GENBANK/M94784', 'GENBANK/M94785', 'GENBANK/X63131', 'GENBANK/X63350']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we have described a nonrandom, site-specific SCL rearrangement in several T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines that juxtaposes SCL with a distinct transcribed locus, SIL. The SIL/SCL rearrangement was found in leukemic blasts from 11 of 70 (16%) newly diagnosed T-cell ALL patients, a prevalence substantially higher than that of the t(11;14) translocation, which has previously been reported as the most frequent nonrandom chromosomal abnormality in T-cell ALL. We did not detect the SIL/SCL rearrangement in the leukemic blasts from 30 patients with B-cell precursor ALL, indicating that the rearrangement was specific for T-cell ALL. Analysis of RNA from these patients indicated that an SIL/SCL fusion mRNA was formed, joining SIL and SCL in a head-to-tail fashion. The fusion occurs in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of both genes, preserving the SCL coding region. The net result of this rearrangement is that SCL mRNA expression becomes regulated by the SIL promoter, leading to inappropriate SCL expression. The resultant inappropriate expression of this putative transcription factor may then contribute to leukemic transformation in T-cell ALL.","['Aplan, P D', 'Lombardi, D P', 'Reaman, G H', 'Sather, H N', 'Hammond, G D', 'Kirsch, I R']","['Aplan PD', 'Lombardi DP', 'Reaman GH', 'Sather HN', 'Hammond GD', 'Kirsch IR']","['National Cancer Institute/Navy Medical Oncology Branch, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD 20889.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['LYL1', 'SCL']","['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 1;79(5):1327-33.,,,['S0006-4971(20)73758-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to investigate the specificity and sensitivity of this marker compared with MPO cytochemistry by light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM), and with the expression of myeloid antigens. Anti-MPO was positive (greater than 3% blasts) in all but one of the 90 AML positive by LM cytochemistry. Of 13 AML cases negative by MPO cytochemistry, six showed 3-10% blasts reactive with anti-MPO and were also positive with antibodies to CD13 and/or CD33. The presence of MPO was confirmed in four of these by EM. The overall positivity of anti-MPO in AML was 92%. Anti-MPO was negative in all but two ALL (6% and 8% positive blasts). The blasts in these two cases were also CD13, CD33 and MPO positive by EM; both were thus reclassified as biphenotypic. Another two ALL reinterpreted as biphenotypic were negative by MPO cytochemistry and anti-MPO but were MPO positive by EM and with CD13 and/or CD33.

In the current study, six newly-diagnosed JCML patients were investigated to characterize the disease further. In co-cultures, JCML cell culture supernatant as well as patient plasma obtained at diagnosis produced a striking reduction in numbers of control marrow BFU-E, CFU-GM, CFU-Meg and CFU-GEMM colonies. Monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha neutralizing antibodies (anti-TNF-alpha Ab) abolished these inhibitory properties. In sharp contrast, JCML supernatants exerted a marked growth-promoting effect on autologous JCML cells cultured in clonogenic assays. Anti-TNF-alpha Ab and anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralizing antibodies (anti-GM-CSF Ab) both reversed the stimulating effect. Recombinant GM-CSF and recombinant TNF alpha produced a profound increase in JCML colonies when tested individually and anti-GM-CSF Ab reversed the TNF-alpha effect. Expression studies of TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha receptor genes of cultured JCML cells demonstrated mRNAs for both. Further, TNF-alpha activity was assayed in a wide variety of cell culture supernatants and in normal and patients' plasma, and only the JCML specimens showed increased TNF-alpha values. Recombinant interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) also stimulated JCML colony growth, but polyclonal anti-IL-1 neutralizing antibodies did not suppress JCML colony numbers nor did it reverse the effects of TNF-alpha or GM-CSF. The evidence indicated that the JCML monokine which inhibits normal haematopoiesis is TNF-alpha and that the endogenously-produced TNF-alpha and GM-CSF from JCML cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease by acting as autocrine growth factors. IL-1 alpha also stimulates JCML cell proliferation as an accessory factor and augments the effect of GM-CSF, TNF-alpha or both.","['Freedman, M H', 'Cohen, A', 'Grunberger, T', 'Bunin, N', 'Luddy, R E', 'Saunders, E F', 'Shahidi, N', 'Lau, A', 'Estrov, Z']","['Freedman MH', 'Cohen A', 'Grunberger T', 'Bunin N', 'Luddy RE', 'Saunders EF', 'Shahidi N', 'Lau A', 'Estrov Z']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-1/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Jan;80(1):40-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06398.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06398.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The original undifferentiated cells possessed a single class of low affinity binding sites for recombinant human (rh) EPO with a Kd of 3.5 nM. Following the treatment with TPA, high affinity binding sites (Kd; 440 pM) were expressed in addition to the low affinity sites. EPO stimulated the incorporation of 3H-leucine into TPA-treated L8057 cells, and the maximal effect of EPO was observed at the same order as the Kd value of high affinity sites.

Extracts of cells newly infected with murine leukemia virus (MLV) provided the source of integration activity, and yeast TRP1ARS1 and SV40 minichromosomes served as simple models for chromatin. Both minichromosomes were used as targets for integration, with efficiencies comparable with that of naked DNA. In addition, under some reaction conditions the minichromosomes behaved as if they were used preferentially over naked DNAs in the same reaction. Mapping of integration sites by cloning and sequencing recombinants revealed that the integration machinery does not display a preference for nucleosome-free, nuclease-sensitive regions. The distributions of integration sites in TRP1ARS1 minichromosomes and a naked DNA counterpart were grossly similar, but in a detailed analysis the distribution in minichromosomes was found to be significantly more ordered: the sites displayed a periodic spacing of approximately 10 bp, many sites sustained multiple insertions and there was sequence bias at the target sites. These results are in accord with a model in which the integration machinery has preferential access to the exposed face of the nucleosomal DNA helix. The population of potential sites in chromatin therefore becomes more limited, in a manner dictated by the rotational orientation of the DNA sequence around the nucleosome core, and those sites are used more frequently than in naked DNA.","['Pryciak, P M', 'Sil, A', 'Varmus, H E']","['Pryciak PM', 'Sil A', 'Varmus HE']","['Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0502.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,['0 (Nucleosomes)'],IM,,"['Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', '*Virus Integration', 'Yeasts/genetics']",PMC556450,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1992 Jan;11(1):291-303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An unidentified low molecular weight GTP-binding protein has been proposed to modulate the activity of the NADPH oxidase. The low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins undergo posttranslational processing, including an initial covalent incorporation of an isoprenyl group. To test whether such an isoprenylation reaction might be required for the activity of the oxidase, we utilized compactin and lovastatin as inhibitors of the isoprenylation pathway. Treatment of DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells with compactin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of O2- formation in response to FMLP or phorbol myristate acetate. Cell viability was not affected nor was normal differentiation of the HL-60 cells into a neutrophil-like cell. The inhibitory effect of compactin was specifically prevented by addition of exogenous mevalonic acid to the HL-60 cells, indicating that the inhibitory effects of the drug were due to blockade of the pathway leading to isoprenoid synthesis. Addition of cholesterol, ubiquinone, or dolichol, which are also downstream products of the isoprenoid pathway, did not override the inhibitory effects of the drug. Subcellular fractions were prepared from compactin-treated cells, and the location of the compactin-sensitive factor was determined by complementation analysis in a cell-free NADPH oxidase system. The inhibited factor was localized to the HL-60 cytosol. These data suggest that an isoprenoid pathway intermediate is necessary for activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. This is likely to represent the requirement for an isoprenoid moiety in the posttranslational modification of a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein. Our studies provide support for the involvement of such a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein in NADPH oxidase activation.","['Bokoch, G M', 'Prossnitz, V']","['Bokoch GM', 'Prossnitz V']","['Department of Immunology, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Hemiterpenes)', '0 (Pentanes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0A62964IBU (isoprene)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1UQM1K0W9X (mevastatin)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",IM,,"['Butadienes/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Hemiterpenes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lovastatin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mevalonic Acid/pharmacology', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*analysis', 'NADPH Oxidases', '*Pentanes', 'Respiratory Burst/*physiology', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Terpenes/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC442866,1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 Feb;89(2):402-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI115599.,,"['GM-39434/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL48008/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1172/JCI115599 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological activity of 11 alpha-methyl-1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 closely resembled that of the natural hormone on normal and leukemic cell proliferation and bone resorption, whereas its in vivo effect on calcium metabolism of the rachitic chick was about 50% of that of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3.

The human leukemia cell line HL-60 can be induced to differentiate into a neutrophil-like cell population. Among the properties of these differentiated cells is the ability to produce reactive oxygen species when stimulated by tumor promoters. Mutagenesis induced by HL-60-generated free radicals was assessed using the M13mp2 forward mutation assay. Single-stranded M13mp2 DNA was coincubated with phorbol ester-stimulated HL-60 cells, after which mutations were scored by transfecting the DNA into SOS-induced Escherichia coli. The mutation frequency was increased 6-fold above background in DNA incubated with HL-60 cells. The majority of the mutations were single-base substitutions. However, approximately 6% of the mutations were tandem double substitutions that occurred in runs of adjacent cytidines. Overall, the mutations were clustered at apparent ""hot spots,"" many of which were similar to sites seen using iron to generate oxygen radicals. These results suggest that human cells able to produce oxygen radicals in response to tumor promoters might play a significant role in the generation of tumors.","['Reid, T M', 'Loeb, L A']","['Reid TM', 'Loeb LA']","['Joseph Gottstein Memorial Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Pathology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['DNA, Bacterial/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Mar 1;52(5):1082-6.,,"['AG-00057/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-CA-08855/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35-CA-39903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preincubation of murine macrophage-like cells, P388D1, with IL-1 alpha (0-73 pM) reduced the binding of PGE2 to these cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Scatchard analysis showed that IL-1 alpha decreased the PGE2 binding by lowering both the high and low affinity receptor binding capacities (from 0.31 +/- 0.02 to 0.12 +/- 0.01 fmol/10(6) cells for the high affinity receptor binding sites and from 2.41 +/- 0.12 to 1.51 +/- 0.21 fmol/10(6) cells for the low affinity receptor binding sites). However, the dissociation constants of the receptors of the IL-1 alpha-treated cells remained unchanged.

With respect to signal transduction, HEL cells have been used as a model system for platelets, but little attention has been paid to their phagocytic properties. We studied the effects of various receptor agonists on the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in HEL cells. Thrombin, platelet-activating factor (PAF), ATP, UTP, prostaglandins E1 and E2 (PGE1 and PGE2), the PGE2 analogue sulprostone and the stable PGI2 analogues iloprost and cicaprost increased [Ca2+]i. ADP was less effective than ATP, and UDP was unable to increase [Ca2+]i. The increases in [Ca2+]i induced by thrombin, PAF, ATP, UTP, iloprost and cicaprost were pertussis toxin-insensitive, whereas the increases induced by PGE2 and sulprostone were completely inhibited by the toxin. The increase in [Ca2+]i induced by PGE1 was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. PGE2 did not desensitize the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by iloprost, and vice versa. PGE1 desensitized the response to PGE2 and iloprost but not vice versa. Adrenaline potentiated the iloprost- but not the PGE2-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. The phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate completely blocked the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by ATP and PGE1, whereas the increases induced by thrombin and PAF were only partially inhibited. Agonists increased [Ca2+]i through release from internal stores and sustained Ca2+ influx. Thrombin stimulated Mn2+ influx, which was blocked by Ni2+. Diltiazem, isradipine, gramicidin and 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SK&F 96365) did not affect agonist-induced rises in [Ca2+]i. HEL cells contained substantial amounts of beta-glucuronidase which, however, could not be released, and they did not aggregate or generate superoxide. Our data suggest that: (1) HEL cells possess nucleotide receptors with properties similar to those of phagocytes; (2) they possess receptors for PGE2 and PGI2, and PGE1 is an agonist at both receptors; (3) agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i are mediated through pertussis toxin-sensitive as well as -insensitive signal transduction pathways; and (4) agonists increase [Ca2+]i by mobilization from internal stores and influx from the extracellular space through cation channels with properties similar to those of phagocytes and platelets.","['Schwaner, I', 'Seifert, R', 'Schultz, G']","['Schwaner I', 'Seifert R', 'Schultz G']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Epoprostenol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Platelet Activating Factor/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins E/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thrombin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology']",PMC1130683,1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1992 Jan 15;281 ( Pt 2):301-7. doi: 10.1042/bj2810301.,,,['10.1042/bj2810301 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The structure is characterized by an unusual arrangement of terminal N-acetylhexosamine residues, resulting in a pi-H hydrogen-bonding interaction between their acetamido groups.","['Levery, S B', 'Holmes, E H', 'Harris, D D', 'Hakomori, S']","['Levery SB', 'Holmes EH', 'Harris DD', 'Hakomori S']","['Biomembrane Institute, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Buffers)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Protons)', '107221-01-2 (lactogangliotetraosylceramide)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (UDPgalactosamine-galactose acetylgalactosaminyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Amides/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Buffers', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Detergents', 'Flatfishes', 'Galactosyltransferases/chemistry', 'Gangliosides/*chemistry', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Membrane Lipids/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases', 'Perciformes', 'Protons', 'Temperature']",,1992/02/04 00:00,1992/02/04 00:01,['1992/02/04 00:00'],"['1992/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1992 Feb 4;31(4):1069-80. doi: 10.1021/bi00119a016.,,"['CA42505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES04370/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'K04 CA01343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1021/bi00119a016 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these breakpoints occur within the second intron of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene. We screened a cDNA library of APL and have identified and sequenced a cDNA transcribed from the t(15;17) translocation breakpoint. The 5' end of cDNA p1715 consists of 503 bp of the RARA exon II sequence. A 1.76-kb cDNA without homology to any known gene available in GenBank was found truncated downstream. This cDNA sequence was assigned to chromosome 15 by dot blot hybridization of the flow cytometry-sorted chromosomes. We designate this fusion cDNA RARA/myl, which is different from myl/RARA reported by de The et al. (H. de The, C. Chomienne, M. Lanotte, L. Degos, and A. Dejean, Nature (London) 347:558-561, 1990). This result demonstrates that the two different types of hybrid mRNA can be transcribed from this breakpoint. We screened a non-APL cDNA library and identified a 2.8-kb myl cDNA. This cDNA is able to encode a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 78,450. Alternative splicing of the myl gene which resulted in myl proteins with different C terminals was found. Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA isolated from 17 APL patients by using the myl DNA probe demonstrated that the myl gene in 12 samples was rearranged. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of RARA gene expression in two APL RNA samples showed abnormal mRNA species of 4.2 and 3.2 kb in one patient and of 4.8 and 3.8 kb in another patient; these were in addition to the normal mRNA species of 3.7 and 2.7-kb. The myl DNA probe detected a 2.6-kb abnormal mRNA in addition to the normal mRNA species of 3.2, 4.2, and 5.5 kb. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that both RARA/myl and myl/RARA were coexpressed in samples from three different APL patients. From this study, we conclude that the t(15;17) translocation breakpoint results in the transcription of two different fusion transcripts which are expected to be translated into fusion proteins.","['Chang, K S', 'Stass, S A', 'Chu, D T', 'Deaven, L L', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Freireich, E J']","['Chang KS', 'Stass SA', 'Chu DT', 'Deaven LL', 'Trujillo JM', 'Freireich EJ']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.

Therefore MDS patients should generally be treated conservatively. Transfusions of packed red cells (given in a strict regimen to minimize the risk for secondary hemochromatosis) may be sufficient to maintain a good quality of life. Indications for cytotoxic treatment include signs of progression of the disease. In patients with symptomatic cytopenias low-dose cytarabine (ara-C) should be tried. It is essential then to monitor each patient individually and to avoid fixed treatment schedules. Standard (high-dose) chemotherapy in MDS, is associated with a high mortality and a low response rate, and should be considered only in younger patients with advanced MDS. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may be offered to younger MDS patients, when a suitable donor is available. Treatment with differentiation inducers has not met with expectations and should not be used outside clinical trials at the present. The use of recombinant hemopoietic growth factors (GF) seems promising. GF, like GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-3, and erythropoietin, can be used either alone or in combinations, to support failing peripheral blood values, and decrease the risk for lethal complications. GF can also be given together with chemotherapy, in an effort to make the leukemic clonogenic cells more susceptible to cytotoxic drugs. Other treatments for MDS include: IFN-alpha and etoposide, with responses primarily in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; hem arginate, whose role is still not clear; and corticosteroids, but only in carefully selected cases.","['Hast, R', 'Hellstrom, E']","['Hast R', 'Hellstrom E']","['Department of Medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cholecalciferol/therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992;16(1):95-100. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90107-i.,,,"['0145-2126(92)90107-I [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(92)90107-i [doi]']",60,,,,,,,,,,,

In all three series, substituents placed peri to the carboxamide sidechain (the 5-position in the acridines, and the 9-position in the phenazines and dibenzo[1,4]dioxins) enhance activity and potency. The 9-chlorodibenzodioxin-1-carboxamide was also curative against the remotely sited Lewis lung carcinoma. Several of the compounds showed much lower levels of cross-resistance to the P388/AMSA line than classical DNA-intercalating agents, which suggests that their primary mechanism of action may not be via interference with topoisomerase II alpha.

However, we report here that in the presence of low concentrations of the sTNF-Rs, effects of TNF whose induction depend on prolonged treatment with this cytokine are augmented, reflecting an attenuation by the sTNF-Rs of spontaneous TNF activity decay. Evidence that this stabilization of TNF activity by the sTNF-Rs follows from stabilization of TNF structure within the complexes that TNF forms with the sTNF-Rs is presented here, suggesting that the sTNF-Rs can affect TNF activity not only by interfering with its binding to cells but also by stabilizing its structure and preserving its activity, thus augmenting some of its effects.","['Aderka, D', 'Engelmann, H', 'Maor, Y', 'Brakebusch, C', 'Wallach, D']","['Aderka D', 'Engelmann H', 'Maor Y', 'Brakebusch C', 'Wallach D']","['Department of Medicine T, Tel-Aviv Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",PMC2119112,1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Feb 1;175(2):323-9. doi: 10.1084/jem.175.2.323.,,,['10.1084/jem.175.2.323 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies using mixed populations of bone marrow cells suggested that activin A has an indirect effect on cellular proliferation and DNA synthesis of erythroid progenitors through the mediation of accessory cells. In present studies, the cultures of purified erythroid progenitors were used to examine the effect of activin A on globin gene expression. Human erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) were partially purified from peripheral blood, and after 8 days of culture the cells generated consisted mainly of erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E). It was found that the subsequent 7-day cultures of these purified progenitors yielded similar numbers and size distributions of erythroid colonies, regardless of the presence of activin A in the cultures. In addition, these erythroid progenitor cells were responsive, in terms of stimulation of DNA synthesis, to the addition of erythropoietin, but not to treatment by activin A. Therefore, once the erythroid progenitors are depleted of accessory cells, activin A has little effect on both the proliferation and the DNA synthesis of these progenitors. However, when these purified erythroid progenitors were cultured in the presence of activin A, the levels of all alpha, beta, and epsilon globin transcripts and hemoglobins were significantly increased. In addition, disuccinimidyl suberate was found to chemically cross-link 125I-activin A to cell surface binding proteins (45 to 54 Kd) in both purified erythroid progenitors and K562 cells. The labeling of these binding proteins was specifically inhibited by the presence of unlabeled activin A, but not transforming growth factor-beta. These results suggest that, in addition to its indirect effect on DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation of erythroid progenitors, activin A directly affects the levels of globin mRNAs and hemoglobins in developing human erythroid cells through its specific surface binding receptor(s).","['Shao, L', 'Frigon, N L Jr', 'Young, A L', 'Yu, A L', 'Mathews, L S', 'Vaughan, J', 'Vale, W', 'Yu, J']","['Shao L', 'Frigon NL Jr', 'Young AL', 'Yu AL', 'Mathews LS', 'Vaughan J', 'Vale W', 'Yu J']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,,"['Activins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*physiology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inhibins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/02/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/02/11 19:15'],"['1992/02/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/02/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 1;79(3):773-81.,,"['DK40218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'MOI-RR83/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)75008-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work has examined the mechanisms responsible for this effect. Deleted forms of the c-jun promoter were linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and transfected into KG-1 cells. The results demonstrate that ara-C-induced c-jun transcription is mediated by an element between positions -74 and -20 upstream to the start site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the fragment f(-74/-20) showed an increase in binding with nuclear proteins from ara-C-treated cells as compared with untreated cells. Competition with an oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 consensus sequence indicated that ara-C stimulates binding of nuclear proteins at the AP-1 site in the c-jun promoter. These findings were confirmed in other gel shift studies with the collagenase enhancer AP-1 consensus sequence and with a DNA fragment containing an altered AP-1 site. The binding of JUN/AP-1 was maximal at 1 hour of ara-C treatment and decreased to baseline levels at 12 hours. The finding that ara-C induces AP-1 binding in the absence of protein synthesis indicated that this agent activates already synthesized JUN/AP-1. To confirm these findings, the AP-1 consensus sequence was introduced 5' to the heterologous SV40 promoter. The results show that AP-1 enhances SV40 promoter activity in ara-C-treated cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that: (1) enhancement of JUN/AP-1 activity in ara-C-treated cells involves a posttranslational modification of JUN/AP-1; and (2) binding of activated JUN/AP-1 to the AP-1 site in the c-jun promoter confers ara-C inducibility of this gene.","['Brach, M A', 'Herrmann, F', 'Kufe, D W']","['Brach MA', 'Herrmann F', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Microbial Collagenase/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*genetics/*physiology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 1;79(3):728-34.,,['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['S0006-4971(20)75002-0 [pii]'],,,['Blood. 1999 May 15;93(10):3573.

The majority of the breakpoint sites have been mapped within the second intron of the RAR alpha gene; however, the breakpoint sites on the myl gene are variable. Using primer sets derived from exon 2 or exon 3 of the RAR alpha gene and a primer derived from the myl cDNA, we were able to amplify the breakpoint sites of the fusion transcripts of all six APL RNA samples by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A DNA fragment of 290 bp (breakpoint A) was amplified using RNA samples from three patients, whereas two DNA fragments of 630 and 774 bp (breakpoint B) were amplified using RNA samples from the other three APL patients. DNA sequence analysis of the amplified fragments suggests that the APL breakpoints clustered within two different introns of the myl gene. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that fusion transcripts RAR alpha/myl and myl/RAR alpha of varying sizes were detected in patients with different breakpoint sites on the myl gene. In addition, we analyzed five APL samples in complete remission and detected t(15;17)-positive cells.

The un-cross-linked IgE-receptor complexes on cells and vesicles exhibit rotational correlation times that are consistent with those expected for freely rotating monomers, but a small fraction of these complexes on cells may be rotationally immobile. A comparison of the initial phosphorescence anisotropy values for erythrosin-labeled IgE-receptor complexes on cells and vesicles reveals a fast component of rotational motion that is greater on the vesicles and may be due to a site of segmental flexibility in the receptor itself. Dimers of IgE-receptor complexes formed with anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies appear to be largely immobile on cells, but they are mobile on vesicles with a 2-fold larger rotational correlation time than the monomeric complexes. The results suggest that dimeric IgE-receptor complexes undergo interactions with other membrane components on intact cells that do not occur on the membrane vesicles.

In order to understand this process better, we have examined the regulation of adenylate cyclase by thrombin in the megakaryoblastic HEL cell line and compared it with platelets. A notable difference was found. In HEL-cell membrane preparations, thrombin inhibited cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation by a pertussis-toxin-sensitive mechanism comparable with that observed in platelets. In contrast, when added to intact HEL cells, thrombin activated adenylate cyclase and caused an increase in cAMP formation synergistic with that produced by forskolin and prostaglandin I2. This increase, which was not seen with platelets, was accompanied by an increase in cAMP metabolism by phosphodiesterase. Like other responses to thrombin, the increase in cAMP formation required proteolytically active thrombin and was subject to homologous desensitization. An equivalent response could be evoked by the addition of a polypeptide, derived from the N-terminus of the thrombin receptor, that has been shown to activate the receptor. The effects of thrombin could not, however, be reproduced by the addition of phorbol ester and the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, nor be prevented with inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism. Preincubation of the cells with adrenaline, which inhibited Gs-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase, or pertussis toxin, which inhibited phospholipase C activation, had no effect on thrombin-induced cAMP formation. These results suggest that thrombin can regulate cAMP formation by two different mechanisms. First, thrombin can inhibit adenylate cyclase in a Gi-dependent manner. This effect predominates in HEL-cell membrane preparations, as it does in platelets, but is not detectable when thrombin is added to intact HEL cells. Instead, in intact HEL cells thrombin activates adenylate cyclase. Although clearly receptor-mediated, this response does not appear to involve Gi, Gs, protein kinase C, eicosanoid formation or changes in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.","['Brass, L F', 'Woolkalis, M J']","['Brass LF', 'Woolkalis MJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '66000-40-6 (4,5-Dihydro-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-amine)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*metabolism"", '4,5-Dihydro-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-amine/pharmacology', 'Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Epinephrine/pharmacology', 'Epoprostenol/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",PMC1130642,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1992 Jan 1;281 ( Pt 1):73-80. doi: 10.1042/bj2810073.,,['P01 HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1042/bj2810073 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP), a granulocyte inducer, significantly augmented the differentiation-inducing effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 along the monocyte/macrophage pathway. Furthermore, dbcAMP significantly potentiated the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cells to hydroxylate 1,25-(OH)2[26,27-3H]D3 to form 1,24,25-(OH)3[26,27-3H]D3. DbcAMP seemed to augment the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in part through upregulation of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor, because 10(-7) M dbcAMP increased 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor levels approximately 2.3-fold, which was similar to a 1.9-fold augmentation by the same concentrations of dbcAMP of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced cell characteristics to hydroxylate C-24 of 1,25-(OH)2[26,27-3H]D3. However, dbcAMP is also known to enhance HL-60 cell differentiation caused by other differentiation inducers. We have established another HL-60 clone which acquires resistance to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the induction of cell differentiation by a defect at the postreceptor step, as reflected by resistance to other differentiation inducers, such as retinoic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide. Even in this resistant clone, dbcAMP significantly enhanced the differentiation-inducing effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Of interest, this clone showed resistance to dbcAMP in the induction of cell differentiation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that intracellular cAMP levels were significantly lower in uremic serum-treated cells than in cells treated with normal human serum and that a significant positive correlation was found between intracellular cAMP levels and 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced cell differentiation. These data indicated that the intracellular cAMP level is one of the major determinants of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced HL-60 cell differentiation and that dbcAMP could enhance the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cells not only by increasing 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor levels but also at the postreceptor step.","['Inaba, M', 'Okuno, S', 'Koyama, H', 'Nishizawa, Y', 'Morii, H']","['Inaba M', 'Okuno S', 'Koyama H', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Morii H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka City University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,,"['Bucladesine/*administration & dosage', 'Calcitriol/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', '*Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/metabolism', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase']",,1992/02/14 00:00,1992/02/14 00:01,['1992/02/14 00:00'],"['1992/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1992 Feb 14;293(1):181-6. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(92)90382-7.,,,"['0003-9861(92)90382-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(92)90382-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two clones (called TAR-binding protein) were isolated from 750,000 lambda-gt11 plaques. The binding specificity was confirmed by Southwestern (DNA-protein) and gel retardation assays. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that TAR-binding protein is very similar to the CREB2 protein. It contains a leucine zipper structure required for dimerization, a basic amino acid domain, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites. A vector expressing CREB2 was transfected into D17 osteosarcoma cells. In the absence of the tax transactivator, the CREB2 protein and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A activate the BLV long terminal repeat at a basal expression level: trans activation reached 10% of the values obtained in the presence of tax alone. These data demonstrate that CREB2 is a cellular factor able to induce BLV long terminal repeat expression in the absence of tax protein and could thus be involved in the early stages of viral infection. In addition, we observed that in vitro tax-induced trans activation can be activated or inhibited by CREB2 depending on the presence or absence of protein kinase A. These data suggest that the cyclic AMP pathway plays a role in the regulation of viral expression in BLV-infected animals.","['Willems, L', 'Kettmann, R', 'Chen, G', 'Portetelle, D', 'Burny, A', 'Derse, D']","['Willems L', 'Kettmann R', 'Chen G', 'Portetelle D', 'Burny A', 'Derse D']","['Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Library', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemical synthesis', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",PMC240776,1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Feb;66(2):766-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.2.766-772.1992.,,,['10.1128/JVI.66.2.766-772.1992 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel motif consisting of a pair of hairpins, called hairpin pair motif, was detected in the 5' untranslated regions of the genomes of these retroviruses. A combination of computational analyses that included the assessment of phylogenetic sequence conservation by multiple alignment, the search for regions with unusual RNA folding properties, and the analysis of RNA secondary structure by suboptimal free-energy calculations highlighted the significance of this hairpin pair motif. The hairpin pair motif encompasses 70 to 80 nucleotides between the splice donor site and the gag translational initiation codon of these viruses. The motif is composed of two adjacent hairpins both with a perfectly conserved GACG tetraloop.

SC-41930 inhibited human neutrophil (PMN) superoxide generation maximally stimulated by f-Met-Leu-Phe (IC50 4 microM) and C5a (IC50 approximately 12 microM). Moreover, postreceptor stimulation of superoxide production by NaF (a G protein activator), but not by phorbol myristate acetate, was significantly inhibited by SC-41930, indicating that SC-41930 may act via attenuation of a G protein-mediated signal transduction.

N., and Hemer, M. R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10900-10904). The present studies were initiated to determine whether mammalian DG kinase purified to homogeneity possessed phosphotransferase activity toward ceramide. A high molecular weight rat brain DG kinase demonstrated Mg(2+)-(but not Ca(2+)-) dependent DG kinase activity and did not phosphorylate ceramide in the presence of either cation. In contrast, ceramide served as a competitive inhibitor with an inhibition constant (Ki) 2-6-fold greater than the Km for DG. Inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to ATP and Mg2+. A cell-permeable ceramide, N-octanoyl sphingosine (C8-cer), was used to study effects of ceramide on DG kinase in intact HL-60 cells. C8-cer induced dose- and time-dependent increases in cellular DG levels. As little as 1 microM C8-cer increased DG from a basal level of 103 to 177 pmol.10(6) cells-1, and a maximal 2.9-fold elevation to 292 pmol.10(6) cells-1 occurred with 10 microM C8-cer. DG elevation was detected after 1 min, maximal by 7.5 min, and sustained for 30 min. The DG elevation was accompanied by a reduction in 32P incorporation in phosphatidic acid in cells short term-labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, consistent with inhibition of DG kinase. In contrast, a similar elevation in the DG level induced by exogenous phospholipase C increased 32P incorporation into phosphatidic acid. C8-cer was not metabolized to sphingomyelin, indicating that DG was not generated through the phosphatidylcholine:ceramide cholinephosphotransferase reaction. DG elevation after C8-cer or phospholipase C treatment was sufficient to redistribute protein kinase C from cytosol to membrane. These findings provide evidence that ceramide may serve as a competitive inhibitor of DG kinase.","['Younes, A', 'Kahn, D W', 'Besterman, J M', 'Bittman, R', 'Byun, H S', 'Kolesnick, R N']","['Younes A', 'Kahn DW', 'Besterman JM', 'Bittman R', 'Byun HS', 'Kolesnick RN']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (Diacylglycerol Kinase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Autoradiography', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Diacylglycerol Kinase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Phosphatidic Acids/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Jan 15;267(2):842-7.,,"['CA-09207-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 16660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)48360-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Partial inhibition by pertussis toxin of enhanced superoxide formation.,143-51,"In human neutrophils, the synthetic lipopeptide, N-palmitoyl-S-[2,3- bis(palmitoyloxy-(2RS)-propyl]-(R)-cysteinyl-(S)-seryl-(S)-lysyl-( S)-lysyl-(S) -lysyl-(S)-lysine [Pam3CysSer(Lys)4], activates NADPH-oxidase catalyzed superoxide (O2-) formation through pertussis-toxin-sensitive and pertussis-toxin-insensitive mechanisms (Seifert, R., Schultz, G., Richter-Freund, M., Metzger, J., Wiesmuller, K.-H., Jung, G., Bessler, W. G. & Hauschildt, S. (1990) Biochem. J. 267, 795-802). We studied the effects of lipopeptides on differentiation of HL-60 leukemic cells. Pam3CysSer(Lys)4 enhanced phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced O2- formation (presumably through the expression of components of NADPH oxidase) in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximal effect at 100 ng/ml and a maximum at 1 microgram/ml. The effect of the lipopeptide was evident after 24 h and reached a plateau after 48 h. (2S,6S)-2-Palmitoylamino-6,7- bis(palmitoyloxy)heptanoyl-(S)-seryl-(S)-lysyl-(S)-lysyl-(S) -lysyl-(S)-lysine enhanced O2- formation as well. The effects of Pam3CysSer(Lys)4 were potentiated by dibutyryl cAMP, dimethyl sulfoxide, retinoic acid, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, interferon-gamma and tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha. Pertussis toxin, but not its B-oligomer, partially inhibited enhanced O2- formation induced by Pam3CysSer(Lys)4. O2- formation induced by arachidonic acid and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane were more sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin than O2- formation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Enhanced O2- formation induced by dibutyryl cAMP was not affected by pertussis toxin. Unlike ATP, histamine, prostaglandin E1 and the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, Pam3CysSer(Lys)4 did not increase cytosolic Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Histamine but not lipopeptides stimulated high-affinity GTPase of guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins in membranes of undifferentiated HL-60 cells. In Pam3CysSer(Lys)4-differentiated HL-60 cells, the responsiveness to the [Ca2+]i-increasing agonists, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine, C5a and leukotriene B4, was increased, whilst the responsiveness to prostaglandin E1 and isoproterenol was decreased. Pam3CysSer(Lys)4 did not inhibit proliferation of HL-60 cells but decreased transferrin receptor expression and increased C3bi receptor expression. Pertussis toxin did not affect proliferation and expression of transferrin and C3bi receptors. Dibutyryl cAMP was considerably more effective than Pam3CysSer(Lys)4 at inducing alterations in the above parameters. Our results suggest that (a) Pam3CysSer(Lys)4 induces incomplete functional differentiation of HL-60 cells through a mechanism which does not depend on a rise in [Ca2+]i and is different from that of other differentiation-inducing substances and (b) the mechanism by which Pam3CysSer(Lys)4 induces differentiation involves pertussis-toxin-sensitive and pertussis-toxin-insensitive mechanisms.","['Seifert, R', 'Serke, S', 'Huhn, D', 'Bessler, W G', 'Hauschildt, S', 'Metzger, J', 'Wismuller, K H', 'Jung, G']","['Seifert R', 'Serke S', 'Huhn D', 'Bessler WG', 'Hauschildt S', 'Metzger J', 'Wismuller KH', 'Jung G']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Freie Universitat Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '112208-00-1', '(N-palmitoyl-S-(2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl)cysteinyl-seryl-lysyl-lysyl-lysyl-lys', 'ine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lipoproteins/*pharmacology', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology']",,1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1992 Jan 15;203(1-2):143-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb19839.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb19839.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding suggests that resistance to the cytodifferentiating effects of the retinoid had been acquired. To investigate potential mechanisms of clinical resistance to RA, we serially evaluated the clinical pharmacology of the drug in APL patients treated with this agent. Leukemic cells from patients relapsing from RA treatment were cultured in the presence of RA and examined for evidence of morphologic maturation. We also studied messenger RNA expression of the newly described gene product of the (15;17) translocation in APL, PML/RA receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha). Serial pharmacokinetic studies showed that continuous daily RA treatment was associated with a marked decrease in plasma drug concentrations at the time of relapse compared with the initial day of therapy. Doubling the RA dose in six patients failed to reinduce response at the time of relapse and also failed to significantly augment plasma RA concentrations. However, leukemic cells obtained at the time of relapse from four patients retained in vitro sensitivity to the differentiating activity of RA (10(-6) mol/L). No change was observed in the pattern of PML/RAR-alpha expression assessed by Northern blot analysis at the time of relapse compared with pretreatment in two patients who were tested. These results indicate that clinical relapse and ""resistance"" to continuous treatment with all-trans RA in APL is associated with progressive reduction of plasma concentrations, potentially to levels below those that sustain differentiation of leukemic cells in vivo. Long-term success of this treatment will require the development of strategies that circumvent this pharmacologic phenomenon.","['Muindi, J', 'Frankel, S R', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Jakubowski, A', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Young, C W', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Muindi J', 'Frankel SR', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Jakubowski A', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Young CW', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/01/25 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/01/25 19:15'],"['1992/01/25 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/01/25 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 15;79(2):299-303.,,"['CA-09207-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54494/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000674/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)75026-3 [pii]'],,,,['Blood 1992 Aug 1;80(3):855'],,,,,,,,

The UCR core sequence, CGCCATTTT, binds a ubiquitous nuclear factor and mediates negative regulation of MuLV promoter activity. We have isolated murine cDNA clones encoding a protein, referred to as UCRBP, that binds specifically to the UCR core sequence. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that the UCRBP fusion protein expressed in bacteria binds the UCR core with specificity identical to that of the UCR-binding factor in the nucleus of murine and human cells. Analysis of full-length UCRBP cDNA reveals that it has a putative zinc finger domain composed of four C2H2 zinc fingers of the GLI subgroup and an N-terminal region containing alternating charges, including a stretch of 12 histidine residues. The 2.4-kb UCRBP message is expressed in all cell lines examined (teratocarcinoma, B- and T-cell, macrophage, fibroblast, and myocyte), consistent with the ubiquitous expression of the UCR-binding factor. Transient transfection of an expressible UCRBP cDNA into fibroblasts results in down-regulation of MuLV promoter activity, in agreement with previous functional analysis of the UCR. Recently three groups have independently isolated human and mouse UCRBP. These studies show that UCRBP binds to various target motifs that are distinct from the UCR motif: the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter and elements in the immunoglobulin light- and heavy-chain genes, as well as elements in ribosomal protein genes. These results indicate that UCRBP has unusually diverse DNA-binding specificity and as such is likely to regulate expression of many different genes.","['Flanagan, J R', 'Becker, K G', 'Ennist, D L', 'Gleason, S L', 'Driggers, P H', 'Levi, B Z', 'Appella, E', 'Ozato, K']","['Flanagan JR', 'Becker KG', 'Ennist DL', 'Gleason SL', 'Driggers PH', 'Levi BZ', 'Appella E', 'Ozato K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,['UCRBP'],"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",PMC364067,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Jan;12(1):38-44. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.1.38-44.1992.,['GENBANK/M73963'],,['10.1128/mcb.12.1.38-44.1992 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most important of these late effects is the development of second malignant neoplasms (SMNs), which occur in approximately 8% of children within 20 years of diagnosis of a malignancy. These secondary cancers may result (individually or in combination) from increased genetic susceptibility, the mutagenic effects of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, or chance. Whereas the development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) as an SMN is a well-recognized phenomenon, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been infrequently described as an SMN in either adults or children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report three patients treated at our institution in whom ALL developed as an SMN after treatment for neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, and Hodgkin's disease. These cases prompted us to review the published literature for cases of secondary ALL in childhood. Patients whose initial malignancy was diagnosed at age less than 16 years were classified as pediatric patients. SMNs were defined as cancers of clearly distinct histologic type occurring 6 or more months after diagnosis of the first malignant neoplasm. RESULTS: Including the three index cases, a total of 18 children with secondary ALL are reviewed, and the clinical features are discussed and compared with those of secondary ANLL. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes the published case histories of secondary ALL. The data suggest that ALL represents approximately 5% to 10% of the cases of acute leukemia that arise as SMNs in both adults and children.","['Hunger, S P', 'Sklar, J', 'Link, M P']","['Hunger SP', 'Sklar J', 'Link MP']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics', 'Neuroblastoma', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Wilms Tumor']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Jan;10(1):156-63. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.1.156.,,['CA 34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.1.156 [doi]'],56,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1992 May;10(5):866.

Pseudotyping studies with different ecotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) have shown that SFFV pseudotyped with Akv, the endogenous ecotropic virus of AKR mice, inefficiently gives rise to virus-induced erythroid bursts (vBFU-E) in vitro and fails to cause erythroleukemia in mice when compared to SFFV pseudotyped with Friend or Moloney MuLV. In order to locate the region(s) of the Akv genome responsible for its inability to act as a helper for SFFV, six different Moloney MuLV chimeras containing Akv envelope sequence substitutions were constructed. Virions with the chimeric envelopes were used to pseudotype SFFV and the complexes were analyzed for their ability to induce vBFU-E in vitro and erythroleukemia in mice. SFFV preparations pseudotyped with three of the constructs containing chimeric envelope genes efficiently gave rise to vBFU-E as did SFFV pseudotyped with Moloney MuLV. SFFV pseudotypes generated from the other three constructs, which all share a common 304-bp region located near the center of the Akv gp70 coding region, and Akv gave rise to very few vBFU-E. However, all SFFV preparations, with the exception of SFFV pseudotyped with Akv, induced erythroleukemia in mice. The results suggest that specific sequences present in the envelope gene of Akv are responsible for the inefficiency of the virus to infect erythroid target cells for SFFV, but additional Akv sequences outside those used in this study affect the ability of the Akv/SFFV virus complex to cause erythroleukemia in mice.","['Muenchau, D D', 'Ruscetti, S', 'Anderson, W F']","['Muenchau DD', 'Ruscetti S', 'Anderson WF']","['Molecular Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/microbiology', 'Erythropoiesis', '*Genes, env', 'Helper Viruses/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*growth & development', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1992 Jan;186(1):161-6. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(92)90070-6.,,,['10.1016/0042-6822(92)90070-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Pizer and E. H. Humphries, J. Virol. 63:1630-1640, 1989). The biological properties of these B-cell lymphomas are distinct from those associated with the B-cell lymphomas that develop following avian leukosis virus proviral insertion within the c-myc locus. In an extension of this study, more than 200 chickens, infected as 10- to 11-day-old embryos, were examined for development of lymphomas that possess disrupted c-myb loci. Fourteen percent developed disseminated B-cell lymphoma. In the majority of these tumors, the RAV-1 provirus had inserted between the first and second exons that code for p75c-myb. However, insertions between the second and third exons and between the third and fourth exons were also detected. In situ analysis of myb protein expression in tumor tissue revealed morphological features suggesting that the tumor originates in the bursa. Within the bursa, the lymphoma appeared to spread from follicle to follicle without compromising the structural integrity of the organ. Tumor masses in liver demonstrated heterogeneous levels of myb protein suggestive of biologically distinct subpopulations. In contrast to the morbidity data, immunohistological analysis of bursae from 4- to 6-week-old chickens at risk of developing lymphomas bearing altered c-myb loci revealed lesions expressing elevated levels of myb in 16 of 19 birds. The activated myb lymphoma displayed very poor capacity to proliferate outside its original host. Only 1 of 33 in vivo transfers of tumor to recipient hosts established a transplantable tumor. None of the primary tumor tissue nor the transplantable tumor exhibited the capacity for in vitro proliferation. Similar experimental manipulation has yielded in vitro lines established from avian B-cell lymphomas expressing elevated levels of c-myc or v-rel. The dependence on embryonic infection for development of activated-myb lymphoma suggests a requirement for a specific target cell in which c-myb is activated by proviral insertion. It is likely, moreover, that continued tumor development requires elevated expression of myb proteins within a specific cell population in a restricted stage of differentiation.","['Pizer, E S', 'Baba, T W', 'Humphries, E H']","['Pizer ES', 'Baba TW', 'Humphries EH']","['Department of Microbiology, Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas 75235.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)']",IM,['myb'],"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bursa of Fabricius/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'DNA, Viral', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/microbiology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Restriction Mapping']",PMC238312,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Jan;66(1):512-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.1.512-523.1992.,,['CA-32295/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1128/JVI.66.1.512-523.1992 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Spleen cells from the majority of these mice proliferate to high levels in the presence of the erythroid hormone erythropoietin (Epo) and can easily be established as permanent Epo-dependent cell lines. The cell lines contain multiple copies of ME26 viral DNA and express viral message and protein. An Epo receptor mRNA of normal size can be detected in these cells, and binding studies reveal a single class of lower-affinity Epo receptor with an affinity for Epo that is in the range of that previously reported for erythroid cells. The ME26 virus-induced Epo-dependent cell lines, however, appear more immature than previously described erythroid cell lines and more closely resemble early hematopoietic precursor cells, suggesting that the virus may be activating the Epo receptor in hematopoietic cells that do not normally express it. Consistent with this idea, we are able to infect an interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cell line, FDC-P2, with ME26 virus and convert it to Epo dependence. The ME26 virus-infected FDC-P2 cells, even before growth on Epo, showed a large increase in the amount of Epo receptor mRNA. However, no ME26 viral integrations can be detected adjacent to the Epo receptor gene, indicating that the virus is not activating the Epo receptor gene by promoter/enhancer insertion. Our results are more consistent with the hypothesis that the gag-myb-ets-encoded viral fusion protein, which is known to bind DNA, is directly or indirectly activating the expression of the Epo receptor gene in these cells.","['Ruscetti, S', 'Aurigemma, R', 'Yuan, C C', 'Sawyer, S', 'Blair, D G']","['Ruscetti S', 'Aurigemma R', 'Yuan CC', 'Sawyer S', 'Blair DG']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['ets', 'gag', 'myb']","['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Defective Viruses/physiology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",PMC238255,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Jan;66(1):20-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.1.20-26.1992.,,['DK 39781/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1128/JVI.66.1.20-26.1992 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

J., Baguley, B. C., Snow, K., and Judd, W., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 82: 662-667, 1990). We tested the cytotoxic and DNA-cleaving activities of two amsacrine analogues which were derivatives of 9-anilinoacridine (1'-methylcarbamate and 1'-benzenesulfonamide) against an amsacrine-resistant human leukemia cell line (HL-60/AMSA) whose resistance is due to an amsacrine-resistant topoisomerase II. Neither agent could overcome the amsacrine resistance of HL-60/AMSA. Neither agent could induce HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of DNA in an isolated biochemical system, although at high concentrations the two analogues could inhibit HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II-mediated DNA strand passage. Both analogues were at least as active, if not more active, than amsacrine against amsacrine-sensitive HL-60 and its topoisomerase II. Comparison of the cellular and biochemical results with those from computer simulation of the energy-minimized structures of amsacrine, its inactive isomer o-AMSA, and the two new active analogues suggests the following possibilities: (a) the positioning of the potential topoisomerase II-binding site (1'-anilino group) of the two new drugs resembles the positioning of this site in amsacrine; (b) the HL-60 topoisomerase II has a binding site which interacts with amsacrine and the two anilino analogues but not with o-AMSA, an analogue with altered positioning of the methoxy group; (c) the HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II interacts with reduced affinity with amsacrine and the two anilino analogues, although HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II still interacts with the structurally distinct topoisomerase II-reactive nonintercalator, etoposide; (d) because of their higher DNA binding affinity or the greater possible positions of their side groups in comparison to amsacrine, the two analogues can, at high concentrations, inhibit the strand-passing activity of HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II.","['Zwelling, L A', 'Mitchell, M J', 'Satitpunwaycha, P', 'Mayes, J', 'Altschuler, E', 'Hinds, M', 'Baguley, B C']","['Zwelling LA', 'Mitchell MJ', 'Satitpunwaycha P', 'Mayes J', 'Altschuler E', 'Hinds M', 'Baguley BC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

Furthermore, the gag-expressing rVV and the env-expressing rVV were shown to have the potential to induce HTLV-I-specific CTL in WKA and LEW rats, respectively. These results suggest that, in general, HTLV-I structural and non-structural antigens can be recognized by CTL, and their immunogenicity for the induction of HTLV-I-specific CTL may be influenced by host MHC. Successful vaccination of mice against retrovirus tumorigenicity with the viral structural components has been demonstrated. As was the case with polyoma virus-induced tumors, utilization of rVV vectors containing HTLV-I genes for potential HTLV-I vaccines in humans may become possible if target antigens recognized by each recipient CTL can be identified prior to vaccination. Another vaccine candidate will be a synthetic peptide containing each CTL epitope.

On the 6p- chromosome, the resulting DEK-CAN fusion gene is transcribed into a leukaemia-specific 5.5 kb chimaeric mRNA that encodes a putative DEK-CAN fusion protein. No transcription could be detected from the reciprocal CAN-DEK fusion on chromosome 9q+. Analysis of 17 t(6;9) ANLL cases showed that the translocation breakpoints occur in a single intron of 7.5 kb in the CAN gene (ICB9) and in a single intron of 9 kb in the DEK gene (ICB6). As a result, the presence of a t(6;9) in blood or bone marrow cells can be faithfully diagnosed by Southern blotting. Moreover, the result of the translocation is an invariable DEK-CAN transcript, which can be sensitively monitored by RNA-PCR. Surprisingly, a SET-CAN fusion gene was found in leukaemic cells from a patient with AUL. Like CAN, SET is located on chromosome 9q34, which explains the apparently normal karyotype of the leukaemic cells. The occurrence of a SET-CAN fusion gene indicates that CAN may be the relevant oncogene involved in leukaemogenesis, and that activation of CAN can be effectuated through fusion of its 3' part to either DEK or SET. As yet, the function of CAN, DEK or SET is unknown. None of the proteins shows consistent homology to any known protein sequences. However, preliminary localization data and analysis of sequence motifs suggested that DEK-CAN may have a role in transcription regulation. CAN contains several dimerization domains and a repeated motif that can function as an ancillary DNA-binding domain. DEK and SET are non-related proteins, but they share a stretch of acidic amino acids, which is also present in the fusion proteins.","['von Lindern, M', 'Fornerod, M', 'Soekarman, N', 'van Baal, S', 'Jaegle, M', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Bootsma, D', 'Grosveld, G']","['von Lindern M', 'Fornerod M', 'Soekarman N', 'van Baal S', 'Jaegle M', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Bootsma D', 'Grosveld G']","['Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*ultrastructure', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1992 Oct;5(4):857-79. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80049-1.,,,['10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80049-1 [doi]'],74,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 60 cases were confirmed in those aged below 15 years with a majority (38.3%) of the children under 3 years. The pattern shows a preponderance of Burkitt's lymphoma followed by nephroblastoma and soft tissue sarcoma as the commonest malignancies. A low relative frequency of leukaemias (8.3%) and no intracranial tumours were encountered. This pattern closely resembles that of other Nigerian reports but contrasts with the situation in Britain and America, with their high leukaemia and intracranial tumour frequency ratios. Generally, there appears to be a low prevalence of malignancies among children in Calabar and presumably the south-eastern part of Nigeria. Difficulties in their management are attributable to late presentation, high patient default rate, complete lack of radiotherapy, and shortage of chemotherapeutic agents.","['Ekanem, I A', 'Asindi, A A', 'Ekwere, P D', 'Ikpatt, N W', 'Khalil, M I']","['Ekanem IA', 'Asindi AA', 'Ekwere PD', 'Ikpatt NW', 'Khalil MI']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Nigeria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Nigeria,Afr J Med Med Sci,African journal of medicine and medical sciences,7801013,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Resources', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', '*Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Sex Factors']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Afr J Med Med Sci. 1992 Dec;21(2):63-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunofluorescence and FACS analyses showed that HTLV-I was efficiently adsorbed onto MOLT-4#8 cells. However, after adsorption, no extrachromosomal viral DNA in the cells was detected by the Southern blot method. In contrast, when MT-2 cells were cocultured with MOLT-4#8 cells, generation of extrachromosomal DNA was clearly observed. These data suggest that the cell-free HTLV-I may have difficulties in penetration, uncoating or reverse transcription. After cocultivation, MOLT-4#8 cells chronically infected with HTLV-I were cloned and analyzed. Only four provirus-positive cell lines were obtained. The transmission rate of the virus by cocultivation seemed to be low in our experimental system, although marked cell fusion was observed. Moreover, none of the cloned cell lines which harbored HTLV-I provirus expressed any viral protein. Inefficient integration and expression of the provirus might be hypothesized as compared with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmission.","['Kuroda, M J', 'Kannagi, M', 'Masuda, T', 'Harada, S']","['Kuroda MJ', 'Kannagi M', 'Masuda T', 'Harada S']","['Department of Biodefence and Medical Virology, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Intervirology,Intervirology,0364265,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Proviruses', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Virus Replication']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Intervirology. 1992;34(4):202-12. doi: 10.1159/000150284.,,,['10.1159/000150284 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we characterized the fragments of FDP in four patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), that were caused by various diseases. In the patients suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (case 1) and acute suppurative cholangitis (case 3), DD and DY/X fragments resulting from fibrinolysis accounted for the most part of the FDP fragments. In case 3, D fragments resulting from fibrinogenolysis were also observed to much less extent. In a DIC associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia (case 2), both fibrinolysis and fibrinogenolysis were increased and resulted in high levels of D, Y and DY/X fragments, concomitant with moderate levels of DD and high molecular weight (HMW) fragments in the patient's sera. The increased fibrinogenolysis in this case was attributed to accelerated activation of plasmin. In a DIC patient of case 4, who underwent an operation due to hepatocellular carcinoma, marked increase in DY/X and HMW fragments and slight increase in DD fragment were observed on the day of operation. Hyperfibrinolysis documented in case 4 was explained by both increased production of thrombin and moderately accelerated activation of plasmin. Both qualitative and quantitative changes in the fragments of FDP during the courses of treatment in two cases of DIC were also noted. In summary, each underlying disease expresses characteristic pattern of FDP fragments in DIC.","['Okumura, N', 'Furuwatari, C', 'Ishikawa, S', 'Furihata, K', 'Katsuyama, T', 'Kanai, M', 'Nakahata, T', 'Saitoh, H']","['Okumura N', 'Furuwatari C', 'Ishikawa S', 'Furihata K', 'Katsuyama T', 'Kanai M', 'Nakahata T', 'Saitoh H']","['Central Clinical Laboratories, Shinshu University Hospital, Matsumoto.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

The International Marrow Unrelated Search and Transplant (IMUST) Study.,91-107,"1. The International Marrow Unrelated Search and Transplant (IMUST) Study 1 provides novel prognostic data on outcome of unrelated-donor (UD) searches for patients with well-defined clinical characteristics. Case-types analyzed by multifactorial methods reveal the importance of HLA phenotype, ethnic mismatching, and stage of disease at search request, in predicting search outcome. White patients, with common HLA types and early disease, were least likely to suffer search failure. In contrast, searches for non-White patients with unusual HLA phenotypes and advanced disease were most likely to fail. Of importance, 70% of patients had HLA phenotypes defined as uncommon. 2. Overall donor yield at the 2 UK registries between 1989 and 1991 was 7%, significantly below expectations. Reasons for this shortfall are that theoretical predictions did not consider ethnic mismatch and logistical delays incurred by outdated UD search routines and most importantly HLA-typing inaccuracies. 3. IMUST Study 2 is a prospective multicenter-controlled cohort study comparing HLA-identical sibling donor (ID) and UD-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for factors affecting BMT outcome. Generous support was provided by 83 BMT centers worldwide. An interim analysis of 165 UD- and 368 ID-BMT, with at least 6 months follow-up after BMT, is described. Unifactorial analysis showed a probability of engraftment at day 100 of 89% after UD- compared with 98% after ID-BMT (p < 0.001). Probability of Grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (AGvHD) at 100 days was 52% after UD- compared with 42% after ID-BMT (p < 0.01). Probability of overall survival at day 400 was 42% after UD- compared with 63% after ID-BMT (p < 0.001). Survival on day 400 of those patients receiving UD-BMT for early disease was encouraging at 52%. 4. Multifactorial analysis was performed on combined data from UD- and ID-BMT cohorts to identify various factors predicting engraftment, AGvHD, and overall survival. Survival after UD-BMT was increased by center experience of UD-BMT and the use of additional pretransplant immunosuppression. Survival was decreased in UD- compared with ID-BMT, by female donor to male recipient and poor-risk disease. Engraftment was improved in ID- compared with UD-BMT, and after UD-BMT at centers experienced in UD-BMT. Engraftment worsened with the use of ex-vivo T-cell depletion for GvHD prophylaxis, in chronic myeloid leukemia, and in male recipients of female marrow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Bradley, B A', 'Hows, J M', 'Gore, S M', 'Bidwell, J L', 'Clay, T', 'Downie, T R', 'Gluckman, E', 'Howard, M R', 'Laundy, G J']","['Bradley BA', 'Hows JM', 'Gore SM', 'Bidwell JL', 'Clay T', 'Downie TR', 'Gluckman E', 'Howard MR', 'Laundy GJ']","['University of Bristol, Department of Transplantation Sciences, Medical School Unit, Southmead Centre for Medical Education, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Transpl,Clinical transplants,8812419,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'International Agencies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*statistics & numerical data']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Transpl. 1992:91-107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the characteristics of patients, donors, and selected treatments are changing. In BMT for leukemia during the 1980s there was a marked increase in transplants for early disease, the use of unrelated donors, and utilization of preparative regimens without radiation. Although treatment-related mortality declined during this period, there was only a modest decrease in relapse rates, indicating the need for more effective antileukemia strategies. The IBMTR collects data from many centers, and, as a consequence, it is uniquely suited to examine clinical situations in which patient accrual at a single institution would be insufficient for a study to be performed. In such analyses, BMT was shown to be an effective treatment for Ph1-positive ALL. Patients tended to have earlier relapses and lower probabilities of LFS than Ph1-negative ALL but the differences were not statistically significant. BMT was also shown to be effective in patients with acute leukemia failing to ever go into remission, most of whom would die within the first 6 months following diagnosis. The IBMTR is a premier example of international scientific collaboration. Its success is a consequence of the desire of investigators throughout the world to combine their clinical data for statistical analysis in order to accelerate and improve patient care.","['Rowlings, P A', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Rimm, A A', 'Sobocinski, K A', 'Zhang, M J', 'Bortin, M M']","['Rowlings PA', 'Horowitz MM', 'Rimm AA', 'Sobocinski KA', 'Zhang MJ', 'Bortin MM']","['Advisory Committee of the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Transpl,Clinical transplants,8812419,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/mortality/surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Humans', 'International Agencies', 'Leukemia/mortality/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/surgery', '*Registries', 'Survival Rate']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Transpl. 1992:83-90.,,"['CP-21161/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The elevated expression of a transfected c-myc gene inhibits the commitment and differentiation of MEL cell transformants. In the present work, we have introduced human c-myc mutants into MEL cells under the inducible promoter to define the functional domains of c-Myc involved in erythroid differentiation. The c-Myc domains necessary for commitment and differentiation are not colocalized; almost entire regions are required for inhibition of commitment, whereas domains II and IV that are essential for co-transforming activity with ras are required for inhibition of differentiation. Interestingly, mutants that delete domains for c-Myc dimerization motifs enhanced differentiation. Thus, c-Myc interferes with MEL cell differentiation by interacting with c-Myc partners and the induced protein(s) through dimerization domains. These results suggest that c-Myc may regulate commitment and differentiation by interacting with proteins through different domains.","['Ohmori, Y', 'Tanabe, J', 'Terashima, M', 'Shoji, W', 'Takada, S', 'Obinata, M']","['Ohmori Y', 'Tanabe J', 'Terashima M', 'Shoji W', 'Takada S', 'Obinata M']","['Department of Cell Biology, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,['0 (Biopolymers)'],IM,['c-myc'],"['Animals', 'Biopolymers', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 1992 Oct;168(2):203-10. doi: 10.1620/tjem.168.203.,,,['10.1620/tjem.168.203 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypercoagulation states, such as chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and nonmetastatic cerebral venous thrombosis account for about 50% of cases. Tumor emboli, as seen in intravascular malignant lymphomatosis, arteritis related to aspergillus, granulomatous angiitis with or without herpes zoster and radiation-induced atherosclerosis are rarer. Cerebral hemorrhages, excluding bleeding from the metastases of choriocarcinoma and melanoma are mainly associated with leukemia by acute disseminated intravascular coagulation as in promyelocytic leukemia, by leukostasis or by pancytopenia. Both infarction and hemorrhage rarely reveal the neoplasia. Lesions are often small and disseminated, and therefore produce a picture of diffuse acute or subacute encephalopathy rather than acute focal deficits.

The main objectives of this study were to compare the incidence of CC in a healthy and leukemic population, and also to evaluate the efficacy of three simple and inexpensive methods of detecting oral CC in predicting the occurrence of oral candidiasis. A secondary objective was to portray speciation in the examined populations. Forty-two pediatric leukemia patients and 42 healthy, age-, race-, and gender-matched control patients participated in this study. The three methods of detection were cytological examination of the oral mucosa, and direct culture methods from mucosal smears using Sabouraud's dextrose agar (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD) and Oricult-N (Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland). This study demonstrated an increased prevalence of CC in pediatric leukemia patients with the direct culture method detecting CC in a significantly greater proportion of the population (Oricult-N,P = 0.034; Sabouraud's dextrose agar, P = 0.0036). Candida albicans was the predominant species.

The weaker reaction with Ricinus communis lectin and the stronger reaction with Psathyrella velutina lectin on the inagglutinable cells with anti-A than those on the group O cells suggest that fucosyl alpha (1-2) and galactosyl beta (1-4) residues at the nonreducing end of carbohydrate chains of H antigens on the red cells were diminished, and N-acetylglucosaminyl beta (1-3) residues were sequentially exposed.

The inhibition of p53 expression by a p53 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide lead to the significant decrease of formation of mature macrophages from U 937 cells in the presence of rhGM-CSF. By contrast, the p53 sense oligodeoxynucleotide had no any effect. Furthermore, we have analysed the growth of U937 cells in the presence or absence of rhGM-CSF. The results showed that rhGM-CSF dramatically inhibited the growth of U 937 cells in the cultures. At the same time, the antisense inhibition experiment demonstrated that the inhibition of p53 expression partially diminished the growth-inhibitory effect of rhGM-CSF on U 937 cells. These results suggested that the p53 was required for the initiation of rhGM-CSF-induced differentiation of U 937 cells on one hand, and the inhibition of cell growth on the other hand.

The protein encoded by this structurally altered hybrid gene differs from the normal c-abl gene product in both molecular weight and in tyrosine kinase activity.

Additional determinants of tumor cell sensitivity include Ara-CMP incorporation into cellular DNA, the size of the competing normal metabolite, deoxycytidine/5'-triphosphate pool, and the heterogeneity in growth kinetics of tumor cells, S-phase vs cells in other phases of the cell cycle. With high-dose Ara-C, substantial amounts of Ara-CTP are formed in phases of the cell cycle. The presence of high intracellular concentration with prolonged retention of Ara-CTP could lead to the inhibition of cell growth of the cells entering S-phase as a consequence of inhibition of DNA-polymerase and/or incorporation into cellular DNA, resulting in a chain termination. Pharmacokinetically, Ara-C is rapidly eliminated from plasma. In mice, pharmacokinetic parameters of Ara-C are not sufficient predictors for the observed differences in their in vivo antitumor activity. Although these mice were bearing different tumor types (L1210 Ara-C sensitive or P-388 relatively more resistant), the observed differences in tumor response were achieved under identical plasma Ara-C concentrations and area under the concentration time curve. The observed antitumor activity in L1210 cells is primarily associated with higher Ara-CTP pools and retention (T1/2 > 4 hr) in tumor cells as compared with normal bone marrow cells. In the least responsive tumor (P-388), although Ara-CTP pools were sufficiently high, retention of the drug in tumor cells and in normal cells is poor with a T1/2 < 2 hr. Thus, unlike mice bearing leukemia L1210 cells, alteration of the mode and dose of administration of Ara-C in mice bearing P-388 could only result in increased host toxicity with no therapeutic gain. Similarly in patients with acute nonlymphocyte leukemia (ANLL), there is no significant correlation between plasma Ara-C concentration and the intracellular concentrations or retentions of Ara-CTP. In some patients the highest Ara-CTP pools in leukemic myeloblast cells are achieved at a lower level of plasma Ara-C and decrease further with the increase of plasma Ara-C. Thus, in the in vivo model system and in ANLL patients with no prior chemotherapy, Ara-CTP retention is a critical factor associated with response to this agent, in particular its direct association with duration of complete response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Rustum, Y M', 'Raymakers, R A']","['Rustum YM', 'Raymakers RA']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 1992 Dec;56(3):307-21. doi: 10.1016/0163-7258(92)90022-r.,,"['CA18420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0163-7258(92)90022-R [pii]', '10.1016/0163-7258(92)90022-r [doi]']",70,,,,,,,,,,,

The histopathologic classification of HD is divided in four sub-types, with different incidence in the pediatric age: the nodular sclerosis and the mixed cellularity are more rap-presented than the lymphocyte predominance and mostly the lymphocyte depletion. Histopathologic classification is essential for the prognosis and a correct therapeutic approach to disease. The management of HD is based on chemotherapy and radiotherapy associated; the results of treatment are more and more encouraging with a global survival over 95%. Sequelae of treatment are reduced in modern therapeutic trials: in particularly injury to somatic growth, cardiopulmonary system, gonadal and thyroid functionality is reduced by using low dose and involved fields for the early stage patients. The most important sequela in children treated for HD is the risk to developed a second malignant neoplasm; in particularly acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and non Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Children were administered the Kinetic Family Drawing-Revised (Spinetta, McLaren, Fox, & Sparta, 1981) to measure their self-image in relation to their family. Children's self-esteem was measured by the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI) (Coopersmith, 1981). The results indicated that children with leukemia did not differ in self-esteem from healthy children except on one subscale of the SEI. However, children with and without leukemia did differ on components of the self-image measure, a dimension of self-esteem. Implications of the findings are discussed.","['Mullis, R L', 'Mullis, A K', 'Kerchoff, N F']","['Mullis RL', 'Mullis AK', 'Kerchoff NF']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Matern Child Nurs J,Maternal-child nursing journal,0350761,,IM,,"['Affect', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/nursing/*psychology', 'Male', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Pediatric Nursing/methods', 'Peer Group', '*Psychology, Child', '*Self Concept']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Matern Child Nurs J. 1992 Fall-Winter;20(3-4):155-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotypes were classified into four groups according to the degree of ectopic antigen expression. We classified as Group A (91.7%, 244 of 266 cases) those expressing conventional pattern without ectopic antigen. Group B (3.0%, 8 of 266 cases) was defined to have at least two lineage specific markers and single ectopic antigen. Such a ""low grade deviation"" did not prevent a definite immunodiagnosis. Group C (4.2%, 11 of 266 cases) revealed a promiscuous coexpression of markers related to different lineages, including two cases (0.8%, 2 cases) of biphenotypic leukemia. Group D (1.1%, 3 cases) included unclassifiable immunophenotypes with no antigen or HLA-DR only expression. Both patients with biphenotypic leukemia and one patient with unclassifiable immunophenotypes failed to respond to induction chemotherapy, suggesting a poor prognosis in these patients. The incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cases with one or more ectopic surface antigens was 10 (8.1%) of the 124 AML cases. Ectopic antigen expression was seen in 5 (4%) of the 125 B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and 3 (25%) of the 12 T-ALL cases.

To assess the reliability of this procedure, the biopsies were evaluated also by the semiautomatic measurement of nuclear area and form factor, and both methods were compared with respect to the degree of morphologic differences obtained between these two types of chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs). Discriminant analysis revealed correct reclassification of all cases both for elliptic Fourier analysis and for semiautomatic planimetry, whereas discriminant scores were much higher for Fourier analysis. Thus, simple planimetric features such as nuclear area and form factor, in contrast to Fourier analysis, are not able to detect the full degree of morphologic differences between megakaryocyte nuclei in different CMPDs.

Differentiation resulted in an approximately 90% reduction in the transit times of the cells through capillary-sized pores over a range of aspiration pressures. Cell volume, as measured by two methods, decreased by an average of 35%. To account for the contribution of the volume decrease to the decrease in transit time, the liquid drop model, developed to describe neutrophil deformability, was used to calculate an apparent viscosity of the cells during this deformation. The apparent viscosity of both uninduced and induced HL-60 cells was a function of aspiration pressure, and an approximately 80% reduction in viscosity occurred with induction, as determined by regression analysis. The deformation rate-dependent viscosities of the induced cells were between 65 and 240 Pa-sec, values similar to those measured for circulating neutrophils. To assess the role of polymerized actin in these viscosity changes, intracellular F-actin content was measured, and the effect of dihydrocytochalasin B (DHB), an agent that disrupts actin polymerization, was determined. Despite the significant decrease in cellular viscosity, F-actin content per cell volume did not change significantly after induced differentiation. Treatment with 3 and 30 microM DHB lowered cellular F-actin content in a dose-dependent manner in both uninduced and induced cells. Cellular viscosity of both uninduced and induced cells decreased sharply with 3 microM DHB treatment (85% and 76% respectively). 30 microM DHB treatment caused a further significant reduction in the viscosity of uninduced cells, but for induced cells the additional decrease in viscosity was not significant. These data indicate that reductions in both cell volume and intrinsic viscosity contribute to the increased deformability of HL-60 cells with DMSO-induced differentiation. However, changes in the concentration of F-actin cannot account for the decrease in cellular viscosity that occurs.","['Hallows, K R', 'Frank, R S']","['Hallows KR', 'Frank RS']","['Department of Biophysics, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biorheology,Biorheology,0372526,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Cytochalasins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Actins/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochalasins/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Rheology', 'Viscosity']",,1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biorheology. 1992 Mar-Jun;29(2-3):295-309. doi: 10.3233/bir-1992-292-309.,,['HL18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.3233/bir-1992-292-309 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It is likely that once exposed to sunlight, these provitamins are converted to previtamin D. It is unclear why fungi, phytoplankton, zooplankton and plants have the capacity to produce such large quantities of provitamin D. It is likely, however, that provitamin D and possibly vitamin D play an important biologic role in these organisms. Buchala and Schmid found, for example, that vitamin D3 promoted adventitious root development. It may be that provitamin D has a more fundamental function in lower life forms. Provitamin D and its photoproducts have UV absorption spectra that overlap with the ultraviolet absorption spectra from ultraviolet radiation-sensitive macromolecules including DNA, RNA and proteins. Thus, provitamin D and photoisomers could serve as a photon sink, and therefore, act as a natural sunscreen to protect lower life forms from the damaging effects of the high energy ultraviolet radiation that they are exposed to. It is more clear, however, that amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals and humans all require vitamin D and that the vitamin D must be metabolized to 1,25(OH)2D3 before it can carry-out its physiologic functions on calcium and bone metabolism. The intense research activities during the past decade on the antiproliferative and differentiation activities of 1,25(OH)2D3 has opened a new chapter for this vitamin/hormone. 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs are being developed for the treatment of psoriasis, breast cancer, and leukemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Holick, M F']",['Holick MF'],"['Vitamin D, Skin and Bone Research Laboratory, Boston University School of Medicine, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo),Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,0402640,['1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)'],IM,,"['Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'Fishes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Vertebrates/metabolism', 'Vitamin D/*metabolism/*therapeutic use']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo). 1992;Spec No:79-83. doi: 10.3177/jnsv.38.special_79.,,,['10.3177/jnsv.38.special_79 [doi]'],23,,,,,,,,,,,

These transport systems, in addition to providing folates essential for cell replication, are also important because of their role in the internalization of antifolates such as Methotrexate (MTX) that are used extensively in cancer chemotherapy. Information about the components and mechanism of folate transport systems has been derived, in large part, from studies with Lactobacillus casei and L1210 mouse leukemia cells, which serve as convenient models for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. L. casei contain a single folate transport system whose Kt value (i.e., concentration for half-maximum rate of uptake) for the preferred substrate folate is in the nanomolar range. The hydrophobic membrane-associated folate transport protein (18 kDa) has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. Expression of this transporter is repressed in cells grown on high concentrations (microM) of folate. L1210 cells contain two separate transport systems for folate compounds: (1) the low affinity system (Kt values for the preferred substrates 5-methyl- and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and MTX in the microM range); and (2) the high affinity system (Kt for folate in the nM range).

However, most of these represent pulmonary infections or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and leukemic involvement of the lung is seldom diagnosed during life. In this report we describe three patients with non-progressive, responsive CLL who developed biopsy proven pulmonary infiltration with CLL. In one case, pulmonary involvement was the sole manifestation of recurrent disease and a second case had little disease elsewhere with minimal CLL in the blood at the time pulmonary involvement appeared. In all three cases, transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage performed during fibreoptic bronchoscopy provided adequate tissue for diagnosis. We conclude that CLL may involve the lung even in the presence of a low peripheral white blood cell count with responsive disease elsewhere, and can readily be diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage.","['Berkman, N', 'Polliack, A', 'Breuer, R', 'Okon, E', 'Kramer, M']","['Berkman N', 'Polliack A', 'Breuer R', 'Okon E', 'Kramer M']","['Institute of Pulmonology, Hadassah University Hospital, Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Dec;8(6):495-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199209051033.,,,['10.3109/10428199209051033 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

TAM is a monoclonal disorder which resolves spontaneously and the target cell in this disorder is a multipotent stem cell which is capable of differentiating into megakaryocytes. The pathogeneses of TAM/AMKL (acute megakaryoblastic leukemia) appears to be closely associated with abnormal quality and quantity of a gene located on chromosome 21. AMKL developing after the regression of TAM appears to come from the same clone as the TAM, which apparently experiences some kind of genetic alterations. It seems that the gene responsible for TAM will soon be cloned in the near future. However, the mechanism of spontaneous regression of TAM has as yet not been clarified. The expanding clone in the transient physiological immunodeficient state, during the perinatal period, might be eliminated with the maturation of more mature immunosurveillance. Alternatively, the TAM clone might be destined to undergo spontaneous death, which is called ""programmed cell death"" (apoptosis). The mechanism of this phenomenon awaits further elucidation.","['Kurahashi, H', 'Hara, J', 'Yumura-Yagi, K', 'Tawa, A', 'Kawa-Ha, K']","['Kurahashi H', 'Hara J', 'Yumura-Yagi K', 'Tawa A', 'Kawa-Ha K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Down Syndrome/blood/*complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/congenital', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/genetics/pathology']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Dec;8(6):465-75. doi: 10.3109/10428199209051029.,,,['10.3109/10428199209051029 [doi]'],102,,,,,,,,,,,

The mortality rate during induction was 23 per cent. Median duration of CR was 24 weeks. The multivariate prognostic factor analysis on CR obtention showed that data concerning treatment for the first relapse and platelet count higher than the median of the series were favourable. On the contrary, PMD-AL, S-AL and REF-AL were unfavourable situations. A percentage of marrow erythroblasts superior to the median was a favourable prognostic factor for survival. Finally, the duration of CR after MIT-IDAC was directly related to the duration of previous CR. In conclusion, MIT-IDAC was highly effective to attain CR in AML in the first relapse.

Specific binding of [3H]PDBu to intact K562 cells was also down-modulated with UBX concentration- and time-dependently, suggesting loss of PKC enzyme protein on the cell surface. Western blot analysis of the total cell extracts disclosed no appreciable alteration in the amount of PKC protein. APase inhibition with UBX was observable independently of PKC modulation.

These studies show that RRR-alpha-tocopheryl succinate (TS) inhibits HL-60 cell proliferation and induces the HL-60 cells to differentiate toward a functionally deficient macrophage-like cell. TS at (15 micrograms/ml) was found to suppress HL-60 cell proliferation by 63% and 89% at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. This suppression of proliferation, however, is not permanent and requires the presence of TS. HL-60 cells treated for 48 hours with TS (15 micrograms/ml) were found to be blocked in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. HL-60 cells blocked in the G2/M cell cycle phase by TS expressed normal levels of the transferrin receptor. TS-treated HL-60 cells exhibited binucleated morphological appearance; however, the cells did not exhibit chemotaxis, phagocytosis, or changes in the expression of the cell surface markers, CD11a and CD18. However, HL-60 cells treated for 48 hours with TS (15 micrograms/ml) could be stimulated to produce superoxide radicals and exhibited nonspecific esterase activity, two characteristics of macrophages. These results suggest a role for TS as an antitumor proliferative agent and as a modifier of human leukemia cell differentiation.","['Turley, J M', 'Sanders, B G', 'Kline, K']","['Turley JM', 'Sanders BG', 'Kline K']","['Division of Nutritional Sciences, University of Texas, Austin 78712-1097.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/drug effects', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects', 'Tocopherols', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 1992;18(3):201-13. doi: 10.1080/01635589209514221.,,['CA-45422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1080/01635589209514221 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Their clinical pictures showed hyperkeratotic plaques and warty crusts on hands, feet, ears, elbows and buttocks. Direct examination of the KOH preparation revealed many embryonated sarcoptic eggs, postpartum egg-shells, fecal pellets, larvae and male and female adult mites. Histopathologic examination showed several burrows inside the thick horny layer. Many sarcoptic egg-shells, mites and fecal pellets were found in the burrows. Psoriasiform hyperplasia and parakeratosis were noted, too. The size and shape of the sarcoptic eggs and the detailed structure of mites and molt were observed by using a scanning electron microscope. Besides, hook-like structures were noted at the tarsi of both forelegs and hindlegs. We suggest that the larvae crawl out from longitudinal openings in the egg-shell by the use of hook-like structures. The mites also used these hook-like structures to make the burrows. Scanning electron microscopy provides a good method to understand the dynamics of these burrowing parasites. It is helpful in illustrating the behavior of the scabies mites in their burrows in Norwegian scabies patients.","['Yang, S A', 'Lu, C F', 'Kuo, M C', 'Chen, G S', 'Chiou, K S', 'Yu, H S', 'Chen, E R']","['Yang SA', 'Lu CF', 'Kuo MC', 'Chen GS', 'Chiou KS', 'Yu HS', 'Chen ER']","['Department of Dermatology, Chi-Shan Hospital, Kaohsiung County, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China (Republic : 1949- ),Gaoxiong Yi Xue Ke Xue Za Zhi,Gaoxiong yi xue ke xue za zhi = The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,8603880,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarcoptes scabiei/*ultrastructure', 'Scabies/*pathology/therapy']",,1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gaoxiong Yi Xue Ke Xue Za Zhi. 1992 Oct;8(10):569-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preincubation of K562 cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 did not alter the concentration of hemoglobin in cells which did differentiate, but led to a reduction in the accumulation of low molecular weight DNA generated by Ara-C administration. The extent of this reduction was similar to the degree of inhibition of hemoglobin formation in the culture as the whole. Preincubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 had no effect on the increase of hsp 70 gene expression induced by a 48-hr treatment with Ara-C, but prevented the Ara-C-induced down-regulation of the protooncogene c-myc. The protooncogene c-myb was down-regulated after 15 min of treatment with Ara-C, and exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 prior to Ara-C caused a further down-regulation of its expression. The data suggest that the events associated with erythroid differentiation may be separable into at least two groups; one of these may have an influence on the kinetics of the cell cycle traverse, and the other may be related to the expression of the erythroid phenotype.","['Moore, D C', 'Carter, D L', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Moore DC', 'Carter DL', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects/genetics', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1992 Jun;151(3):539-48. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041510313.,,"['CA 44722-03S3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44722-4/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1002/jcp.1041510313 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Its IC50 value was 4.4 micrograms/ml (8.5 microM), which is much lower than those of the well-known anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin, the IC50 values of which are more than 100 micrograms/ml (> 170 microM). Kinetic studies demonstrated that mitoxantrone inhibited PKC in a competitive manner with respect to histone H1, and its Ki value was 6.3 microM (Ki values of daunorubicin and doxorubicin were 0.89 and 0.15 mM, respectively), and in a non-competitive manner with respect to phosphatidylserine and ATP. Inhibition of phosphorylation by mitoxantrone was observed with various substrates including S6 peptide, myelin basic protein and its peptide substrate derived from the amino-terminal region. Their IC50 values were 0.49 microgram/ml (0.95 microM), 1.8 micrograms/ml (3.5 microM), and 0.82 microgram/ml (1.6 microM), respectively. Mitoxantrone did not markedly inhibit the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase I or casein kinase II, at concentrations of less than 10 micrograms/ml. On the other hand, brief exposure (5 min) of HL60 cells to mitoxantrone caused the inhibition of cell growth with an IC50 value of 52 ng/ml (0.1 microM). In HL60 cells, most of the PKC activity (about 90%) was detected in the cytosolic fraction. When HL60 cells exposed to 10 micrograms/ml mitoxantrone for 5 min were observed with fluorescence microscopy, the fluorescence elicited from mitoxantrone was detected in the extranuclear area. These results indicated that mitoxantrone is a potent inhibitor of PKC, and this inhibition may be one of the mechanisms of antitumor activity of mitoxantrone.","['Takeuchi, N', 'Nakamura, T', 'Takeuchi, F', 'Hashimoto, E', 'Yamamura, H']","['Takeuchi N', 'Nakamura T', 'Takeuchi F', 'Hashimoto E', 'Yamamura H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Brain/*enzymology', 'Casein Kinases', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 1992 Dec;112(6):762-7. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123972.,,,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123972 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In acromegaly, in which there is a pathologically sustained high GH level, there is a significantly increased incidence of cancer in general and specifically of colonic neoplasia. To determine whether the use of GH in the treatment of radiation-induced GH deficiency causes tumour recurrence, a comparison was made of tumour recurrence rates between 47 children treated with GH for radiation-induced GH deficiency after treatment for a brain tumour and a control population from the North West Children's Cancer Registry who did not receive GH (n = 160).

Adjusting for variables other than GH which might affect tumour recurrence, the estimated relative risk of tumour recurrence was 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.28-2.37).

Specific inhibition of the synthesis of alpha-globin was observed only in the cells transformed with the plasmids with antisense 68-mers that corresponded to the cap site as well as the site of initiation of translation of alpha-globin mRNA (Oligo-A); Other plasmids with antisense 68-mers that corresponded to the regions of the exon/intron junctions, the individual exons, or the 3' untranslated region were ineffective. This antisense RNA efficiently reduced the production of alpha-globin to 9-18% of the endogenous level after induction with hexylmethylene-bis-acetoamide (HMBA). Moreover, most of the antisense transformants did not show any decrease in the expression of the c-myc gene at the early phases of differentiation of MEL cells.

This new cationic platinum-triamine complex (DPR) displays excellent solubility (> 50 mg/ml) and stability in water. DPR has significant in vitro cytotoxicity against murine P388 leukemic cell line, human K562 erythroleukemic cell line and human Jurkat T cell line. The in vitro cytotoxic effects of DPR on P388 and Jurkat leukemic cells were comparable to those of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (DDP), while its activity on K562 cells was significantly better than that of DDP [IC50 = 1.07 +/- 0.36 (SD) microM vs 2.62 +/- 0.23 (SD) microM, P < 0.01]. The in vitro Pt accumulation rate for P388 cells was twice as rapid after DPR than after DDP exposure, while no difference in cellular platinum efflux was observed. The antitumor activity of DPR was tested in vivo against P388 leukemic cells in BDF1 mice and gave a % ILS value (75%) similar to that of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DDP (8 mg/Kg). A comparative study of plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) levels and kidney morphological analysis in tumor-bearing mice receiving the LD50 dose of both drugs (39.3 mg/Kg and 16.5 mg/Kg for DPR and DDP, respectively), showed DPR to be less nephrotoxic than DDP. These results indicate that this new cationic platinum-triamine complex containing primary amine ligand is surprisingly active both in vitro and in vivo.

This genetic event may either occur in all malignant cells or be acquired by different subclones, which however, cannot be demonstrated adequately by analyzing only DNA derived from patient specimens. The availability of the ras p21 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) Y 13259 makes possible the direct study of the distribution of the ras gene product in human malignant cells. In this report the expression of the ras p21 oncoprotein in the bone marrow smears of 35 children with acute leukemia has been analyzed. The smears were treated with the MoAb Y 13259, biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG, streptavidin, peroxidase and stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB). The intensity of the staining was evaluated by two independent observers as negative or equivocal (-/+), moderate (+) or intense (++), by counting one thousand cells. Patients were also classified according to the percentage of the stained cells into four groups (0, I, II, III). It was found that 22/35 (63%) were (+) or (++) positive as follows: 11/21 (52%) with ALL CALLA (+), 2/2 ALL-B, 3/3 ALL-T and 6/9 AML. In Group 0 (none of the blasts was stained) were 13/35 (37%), as well as in Group I (1 to 25% of the blasts stained 1+ or 2+ positive), while in Group II (26 to 50% positive stained) 3/35 and in Group III (more than 51% stained) 6/35, all of which were AML (6/9).

Effective and curative doses of tested compounds were estimated on the basis of computer-assisted elaboration of the dose-effect curves obtained from experimental data. Two oxazaphosphorine drugs, ifosfamide and its congener cyclophosphamide, were used as referentials. Elementary toxicity studies were conducted in parallel in healthy animals and lethal doses were determined. Selection of the most potent compounds was based on the comparison of their therapeutic indices, calculated from the ratio of lethal to effective doses. In effect four compounds which have been shown therapeutically more effective than both referential drugs, were selected for further evaluation in mice bearing advanced tumours. Stereodifferentiation of evaluated biologic effects favouring S(-) isomers was observed in all three groups of compounds. Preliminary observation was also made indicating significant lethality reduction after per os administration of selected agents, which was not paralleled by diminution of their antitumor effectivity.","['Glazman-Kusnierczyk, H', 'Matuszyk, J', 'Radzikowski, C']","['Glazman-Kusnierczyk H', 'Matuszyk J', 'Radzikowski C']","['Department of Tumor Immunology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['SBV4XY874G (Bromine)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bromine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ifosfamide/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 1992;14(4):883-911. doi: 10.3109/08923979209009240.,,,['10.3109/08923979209009240 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The annulate lamellae could prove to be an important organelle that participates in the regulation of gene expression.

Six months before the blastic transformation of the leukaemia the amount of IgM, which remains stable (above normal values) along the chronic phase, initiates a decrease, reaching normal values in the phase of acute transformation. CML is a very rare second neoplasia in patients receiving anticancer drugs. The correlation between the decrease of IgM and the blastic crisis is very interesting. We do not find an explanation for this finding although similar observations have been described heralding the appearance of second neoplasias in WM, and one might speculate with a possible role of IgM in the control of chronic phase of the myeloid leukaemia or if the overgrowth of blastic cells could overwhelm the development of lymphoplasmacytoid cells.","['Majado, M J', 'Gonzalez Garcia, C', 'Marin-Blazquez, M D', 'Morales Lazaro, A', 'Moreno Moreno, M']","['Majado MJ', 'Gonzalez Garcia C', 'Marin-Blazquez MD', 'Morales Lazaro A', 'Moreno Moreno M']","['Servico de Hematologia, Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,,"['Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*chemically induced/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/drug therapy']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1992 Dec;37(6):465-6.,,,,,Aparicion de una leucemia mieloide cronica en el curso de una macroglobulinemia de Waldenstrom.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty cases of ALL treated at the Jimenez Diaz Foundation between 1968 and 1991 were revised. Treatment had been suppressed after 60 months of maintained CR (1968-1974) or after 28 months (1986-1991), with a median follow-up after suppression of 6 years. All the patients had been treated with several protocols (FJD-68, FJD/BFM, APO, BFM-83, BFM-86 and BFM-90). Maintained CR, relapses and course after therapy cessation were analysed. Actuarial curves of RC duration and survival were drawn according to the Cutler and Ederer life tables. RESULTS: The age at diagnosis ranged from 1.5 to 68 years. Childhood (< 15 years) ALL presented in 49 cases; 25 were young adults (15-30 years), and 6 others were over 30 years of age. Two of the 80 patients (2.5%) died in CR (astrocytoma and demyelinating leukoencephalopathy). Fifty-eight patients (72.5%) are living in maintained CR; 20 others relapsed (25%), 14 of them (70%) attaining a second CR. Allogenic BMT was carried out in 4 such cases. Four patients are out of any treatment after the second CR. The actuarial curves of CR duration after suppression of therapy gave a stable plateau at 73% for children, at 75% for young adults and at 22% for patients over 30 years. The survival after suppression of therapy showed a plateau at 75% for children and at 86% for young adults. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Relapse was seen in 25% of the patients after cessation of therapy. 2) Relapse occurred in the first two years after therapy cessation in 75% of the instances. 3) At this writing, 78.7% of the patients keep up the CR. 4) Adults over 30 years of age comprise the poorest prognosis. 5) The course of young adults in this series after cessation of therapy is as good as that of children.","['Sanchez Fayos, J', 'Bernacer, M', 'Olavarria, E', 'Outeirino, J', 'Prieto, E', 'Roman, A', 'Pacho, E', 'Villalobos, E', 'Perez, A', 'Myric, A']","['Sanchez Fayos J', 'Bernacer M', 'Olavarria E', 'Outeirino J', 'Prieto E', 'Roman A', 'Pacho E', 'Villalobos E', 'Perez A', 'Myric A', 'et al.']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1992 Dec;37(6):439-47.,,,,,Leucemias agudas linfoblasticas con terapeutica suprimida: evolucion postsupresion de 80 casos.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 99 patients diagnosed and treated for HD in the Hospital San Carlos, in Madrid, between January 1976 and december 1987. The clinical records were revised; the diagnosis and staging followed the Rye and Ann Arbor criteria, and the treatment included radiation therapy (RT), chemotherapy (CT), or a combination of both. The diagnosis of the second malignancy was based upon clinical, analytical, radiological and histological records. RESULTS: The median age in the series was 31 years (16-82) and the M/F ratio was 61/38. The stage distribution was: I-9; II-29; III-31, and IV-30. Twenty-six patients received RT alone, 59 were treated with CT, and 14 received RT plus CT. A second neoplasm was found in 6 patients (6%), of whom 4 developed a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 2 a solid tumour. All the patients who had MDS had received MOPP or C-MOPP chemotherapy, associated in two of them with extensive RT. Both patients with solid tumour had been given CT+RT. The median time of presentation of the second malignancy since the diagnosis od HD was 89 months (48-174) for MDS and 120 months for the solid tumours. The four MDS patients have died, 2 for ANLL-M5, one for SRA and the remainder for cerebral haemorrhage, not yet evolved into acute leukaemia. The two patients which solid tumours are alive and seemingly in complete remission at 12 and 10 months, respectively, of the diagnosis of the second malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: 1) All the patients with second neoplasms had been previously treated with CT (MOPP or C-MOPP) or CT+RT. 2) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has not appeared in any of the patients in this series. 3) An endless follow-up of patients with HD seems important in order to achieve an early diagnosis of other malignant complications which, although in case of MDS have poor prognosis, in case of solid tumours may do well with adequate treatment.","['Morales, M D', 'Gonzalez, F A', 'Villegas, A', 'del Potro, E', 'Diaz Mediavilla, J', 'Martinez, R', 'Alvarez, A', 'Colome, J A']","['Morales MD', 'Gonzalez FA', 'Villegas A', 'del Potro E', 'Diaz Mediavilla J', 'Martinez R', 'Alvarez A', 'Colome JA']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, I.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out on 22 CML patients diagnosed in the Haematology Service at the Princesa Hospital in Madrid. The therapeutic regime consisted of two phases: A) Hydroxyurea was given until the white-cell count was reduced to 15-20 x 10(9)/L. B) Roferon*A was then given subcutaneously at a doses of 5 MU/m2 per day. The follow-up was performed weekly, and monthly once the leucocyte count had stabilized. The cytologic and cytogenetic response was assessed by bone marrow aspiration performed after 6, 9, 12 and 18 months. The toxicity was evaluated in accordance with the WHO recommendations. RESULTS: The median follow-up is 263 days (21-930). Thirteen patients (65%) had initial complete haematological response and 3 (15%) had partial response. The mean time to achieve response was 42 days (0-321). In the last evaluation, 69% of the patients were in sustained haematological remission (53% complete and 16% partial) with median follow-up of 232 days (21-930). The cytogenetic response was evaluable in 13 patients (follow up > or = 6 months): three attained complete response (23%) and three others partial response (23%). The commonest untoward effects were hypertriglyceridaemia (100%) and myelosuppression (86%). Grade-III thrombocytopenia was seen in 19% of the patients and grade-III anaemia or leucopenia in 5%. No infectious or haemorrhagic complications have appeared. Therapy was discontinued in 3 patients (14%), two due to severe flu-like syndrome and one for parkinsonism after 809 days of treatment. At the moment of evaluation two patients had died, one in lymphoid blastic crisis on day 217 and the other in the immediate post-BMT period. CONCLUSION: Treatment with interferon-alpha 2A is useful in the chronic phase of CML. An important number of responses can be attained, even in patients in the late chronic phase, and the toxicity seems acceptable.","['Steegmann, J L', 'Lavilla, E', 'Somolinos, N', 'Perez-Sanchez, M', 'Lamana, M', 'Olmeda, F', 'Camara, R', 'Arranz, R', 'Ferro, M T', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Steegmann JL', 'Lavilla E', 'Somolinos N', 'Perez-Sanchez M', 'Lamana M', 'Olmeda F', 'Camara R', 'Arranz R', 'Ferro MT', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1992 Oct;37(5):375-81.,,,,,Tratamiento con interferon alfa-2a de la leucemia mieloide cronica Ph1 positiva en fase cronica.,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The series includes 98 patients who died of CML in Asturias Central Hospital and other nearby hospital between 1970 and 1990. The CML diagnosis had been established according to conventional criteria. The blastic crisis was diagnosed in accordance with morphologic and cytochemical studies, complemented in some cases with the assay of TdT or other markers. The Kaplan-Meier curves and long-rank test were applied to the statistical analysis of survival. The prognostic factors were evaluated by univariate correlation. RESULTS: The series' mean age was 48.57 years (range: 6-90) and the M/F ratio was 56/42. Cytogenetic study had been performed in 35 patients, of whom 33 had the Ph' chromosome. Death occurred in the blastic crisis in 67 cases (72%), in the accelerated phase in 14 cases (15%) and in the chronic phase in 12 cases (13%). The cause of death could be determined in 47 cases; of them, 24 (51%) died of infection, 11 (23.4%) of haemorrhage, and the remaining 12 (25.6%) of different complications. The median survival of the group as a whole was 32 months (range: 4-137). For the blastic crisis this figure was reduced to 2.5 months (range: 1-14), the lymphoid forms doing better, 5 months, than the non-lymphoid ones; 1.5 months (p < 0.03). Out of the data evaluated at diagnosis, only haemoglobin and the percentage of blast cells in peripheral blood showed any correlation with survival (r = +0.28, p < 0.05 for haemoglobin, and r = -0.30, p < 0.01 for blast cells). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Although most patients die from infection or haemorrhage during the blast crisis, CML increases the risk of death in the accelerated and chronic stages as well. (2) Non-lymphoid blastic crisis has poorer prognosis than the lymphoid form. (3) The concentration of blast cells and haemoglobin in peripheral blood at diagnosis acquire prognostic significance in the present study.","['Jonte, F', 'Fernandez-Fuertes, F', 'Cecchini, C', 'Luno, E', 'Ordonez, A', 'Fernandez, C', 'Suarez, P', 'Lausin, A', 'Fernandez, J']","['Jonte F', 'Fernandez-Fuertes F', 'Cecchini C', 'Luno E', 'Ordonez A', 'Fernandez C', 'Suarez P', 'Lausin A', 'Fernandez J']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Central de Asturias, Oviedo.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Blast Crisis/mortality', '*Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/complications/*mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis']",,1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1992 Oct;37(5):351-4.,,,,27,"Causas de muerte, supervivencia y factores pronosticos en una serie de 98 pacientes con leucemia mieloide cronica.",,,,,,,,,,

Study of a series of 134 cases].,345-50,"PURPOSE: To analyse the clinico-biological features of 134 patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) at presentation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The series is comprised of 134 patients from the Asturias Central Hospital and other hospital of the region, diagnosed of CML with conventional criteria between 1970 and 1989. A retrospective study was carried out revising the clinical records and the clinico-biological data at diagnosis. Cytogenetic studies were available in 62 cases. The statistical analysis was based upon descriptive statistics and comparison of means and proportions by the chi square and Student's tests. Univariate study was also performed for several variables. RESULTS: The mean age of the group was 50 years, ranging between 2 and 81. The M/F ratio was 76/58. The commonest symptoms at onset were those secondary to hypermetabolism and splenomegaly, 8% of the patients being asymptomatic. Splenomegaly was present in 73.8% of the patients and hepatomegaly in 37.6%. The median white cell count was 132 x 10(9)/L. Absolute basophilia and eosinophilia were seen in 83% and 78% of the cases, respectively. Anaemia was found in 47.4% of the patients, usually mild, and 39% of them had nucleated red cells in peripheral blood. The median platelet count was 400 x 10(9)/L. Thrombocytosis was found in 48% of the cases, while 11% had thrombocytopenia. The mean number of blast cells in the bone marrow was 1.72%. The histopathologic study of the bone marrow revealed decreased red cells in 94.5% of the patients and decreased megakaryocytes in 29.5%; these last were increased in 50% of the patients. Increased reticulin fibres were found in 38.5% of the bone marrow samples. In addition to the Ph' chromosome, which was present in 51 patients, chromosomal abnormalities were seen in 15.6% of the cases in the chronic phase and in 69.2% in the terminal stages of the disease. Positive correlation could be established between the white cell count and the size of spleen (p < 0.001) and liver (p < 0.05), and there was a negative correlation between white blood cell count and haemoglobin rate and platelet count (p < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: (1) The analysis of this series shows that the CML cases in this region have similar characteristics to those in other western world communities (2). The mean age of this group is somewhat higher than in other series, which should be re-evaluated after discarding the Ph'-negative cases. (3) There seems to be positive correlation between leucocyte count and spleen and liver enlargement, and negative correlation between leucocyte count and haemoglobin and platelet count.","['Jonte, F', 'Barez, A', 'Soto, I', 'Rayon, C', 'Carrera, D', 'Coma, A', 'Perez Llanderal, J', 'Arribas, M']","['Jonte F', 'Barez A', 'Soto I', 'Rayon C', 'Carrera D', 'Coma A', 'Perez Llanderal J', 'Arribas M']","['Servicio de Hematologia del Hospital General, Hospital Central de Asturias, Oviedo.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Blood Proteins)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Proteins/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/epidemiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology']",,1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1992 Oct;37(5):345-50.,,,,30,Caracteristicas de la leucemia mieloide cronica al diagnostico.

The shortage of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the human TcR-V alpha and V beta families reflects the difficulties in their production by conventional methods using whole human T cells or purified soluble receptors as immunogens. As an alternative strategy to circumvent these difficulties, we have generated a transfected mouse T-cell line expressing a human (Jurkat) TcR alpha beta dimer in a complex with mouse CD3. The parental mouse T-cell line, TG40, is a cell surface TcR-negative, cytoplasmic CD3-positive variant of the mouse T-cell hybridoma 2B4. The human-TcR alpha beta expressing mouse transfectant was used to immunize mice with the same genetic background as the parent mouse T-cell line, and a human TcR-specific response was successfully achieved. MAb-producing hybridomas were generated by fusing spleen cells from the immunized mice with the mouse myeloma cell line NSO. Of 124 hybridoma supernatants screens, 72 showed reactivity to the human T-cell line Jurkat. Twenty-four of the hybridomas producing human (Jurkat) TcR-specific antibodies were cloned and screened for reactivity to Jurkat TcR. Several IgG2b and IgM mAbs specific for the Jurkat T cell line were selected on the basis of their ability to modulate surface CD3 expression on Jurkat cells. Most of the antibodies do not stain other TcR-expressing human T cell leukemia cell lines, implying specificity for the variable domains of the Jurkat TcR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Zumla, A', 'McCormack, A', 'George, A', 'Batchelor, R', 'Lechler, R']","['Zumla A', 'McCormack A', 'George A', 'Batchelor R', 'Lechler R']","['Department of Immunology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cross Reactions', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1992 Nov;35(3):141-8. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(92)90098-8.,,,"['0198-8859(92)90098-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(92)90098-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that IL-11 supports the growth of certain types of plasmacytoma and hybridoma cells, enhances antigen-specific antibody responses, synergizes with IL-3 in supporting megakaryocyte colony formation, acts synergistically with IL-3 in shortening the G0 period of early progenitors, induces the synthesis of acute phase proteins, and inhibits lipoprotein lipase activity and adipocyte differentiation. The human IL-11 gene, which is localized at 19q13.3-13.4, consists of five exons and four introns. Initial biochemical characterization has identified a 151 kDa protein as the potential IL-11 binding subunit of the receptor complex. Because of the overlapping biological activities between IL-6 and IL-11, we compared the signal transduction pathways mediated by IL-6 or IL-11 in cell lines responsive to both cytokines. Results from protein tyrosine phosphorylation and immediate response gene expression suggest that there are convergent and divergent points along the signal transduction pathways utilized by IL-6 or IL-11. The IL-6 signal transducer, gp130, appears to be involved in the IL-11 mediated signaling. Other cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M and ciliary neurotrophic factor have also been shown to utilize gp130 as a signal transducer. The significance of growth factor sharing common biological activities and signaling pathways will be discussed.","['Yang, Y C', 'Yin, T']","['Yang YC', 'Yin T']","['Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL11RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*physiology', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', '*Receptors, Interleukin', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biofactors. 1992 Dec;4(1):15-21.,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,

Total alpha-L-fucosidase activity was not significantly different for normal granulocytes and leukemic cells, but enzymic profiles obtained by chromatofocusing are quite different. In granulocyte profile, two main peaks are present (B and more acidic A) which were eluted at pH 5.2 with a shoulder at pH 4.6. In AMLs the B form is present but weakly expressed, whereas the more acidic forms are the major ones. This pattern may be related either to the malignancy character or to the stage at which the differentiation is stopped. Experiments on an HL-60 cell line (promyelocytic cells corresponding to the AML 3 type) showed that differentiation induced by dimethyl sulfoxide leads to the appearance of the B form present in normal mature cells. Thus the repartition of the enzyme forms seems to be related to the stage of differentiation of the myelocytic cells.","['Dosbaa, I', 'Bernard, M', 'Foglietti, M J', 'Percheron, F', 'Emiliani, C']","['Dosbaa I', 'Bernard M', 'Foglietti MJ', 'Percheron F', 'Emiliani C']","['Faculte des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Carbohydr Res,Carbohydrate research,0043535,"['EC 3.2.1.51 (alpha-L-Fucosidase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-L-Fucosidase/*blood']",,1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carbohydr Res. 1992 Dec 15;236:259-65. doi: 10.1016/0008-6215(92)85020-z.,,,"['0008-6215(92)85020-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0008-6215(92)85020-z [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the changes in mRNA expression of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor beta-subunit (GM-CSFR beta-subunit), which was a common subunit of a high-affinity interleukin-3 receptor (IL-3R) and a high-affinity GM-CSFR, and interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) during megakaryocyte development in a human megakaryocytic leukemia cell line (CMK) which could proliferate and/or differentiate in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-6. We found that GM-CSFR beta-subunit mRNA was expressed constitutively in CMK cells and was transiently down-regulated by TPA and IL-6, while the expression of IL-6R mRNA was increased by TPA in association with the differentiation of megakaryocytes. Furthermore, the TPA-induced down-regulation of GM-CSFR beta-subunit mRNA expression and its recovery were blocked by cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting that these modulations required de novo protein synthesis. These findings imply that multi-lineage cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-3 may contribute preferentially to the regulation of the earlier development of megakaryocyte progenitor cells with high densities of multi-lineage cytokine receptors, while IL-6 may be limited in its action to supporting the maturation of more differentiated megakaryocyte progenitor cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Yasunaga, M', 'Ryo, R', 'Yamaguchi, N']","['Yasunaga M', 'Ryo R', 'Yamaguchi N']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Nov;8(4-5):397-403. doi: 10.3109/10428199209051020.,,,['10.3109/10428199209051020 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of the actuarial survival curves showed that, by using the updated Kiel classification, low-grade PTCL had a survival probability higher than high-grade PTCL although the difference was not statistically significant.

Because of the unreliability of conventional diagnostic tests to detect systemic infection early in its course, treatment of established disseminated Candida infection has been generally disappointing with mortality rates of 60-80% in leukemia and bone marrow transplant patients and 30-40% in solid tumor patients. The use of empiric amphotericin B in patients with fever not responding to empiric antibacterial agents has been shown to be successful in reducing morbidity and mortality from fungal infections. However, its toxicity has mitigated the success of this approach. Fluconazole given prophylactically at the institution of chemotherapy has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative. It, however, is not active against all fungal species, especially Aspergillus and some of the less virulent Candida species. Some centers have reported break-through infections by these less susceptible organisms.

Recent studies of a family which includes several members with an autosomal dominant dense granule deficiency condition show an association between the presence of this form of dense granule deficiency and the development of acute myelogenous leukemia. Studies in two additional patients, one with the Monosomy 7 syndrome and the second with a myelodysplastic syndrome, revealed a defect in platelet dense granules. This defect appears to be due to an abnormality in the formation of these granules rather than the presence of empty vesicular structures or decreased contents due to activation associated secretion. The results suggest that the defect in platelet dense granules associated with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes may result from a chromosome alteration in the megakaryocyte cell line leading to decreased formation of dense granules. Studies in the family with an inherited bleeding disorder suggest that a gene coding for a protein important for the formation of dense granules is located adjacent to a gene which, when abnormal, may predispose to the development of leukemia.","['Gerrard, J M', 'McNicol, A']","['Gerrard JM', 'McNicol A']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Membrane Proteins)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Platelets/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Proteins/deficiency', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Platelet Storage Pool Deficiency/*complications/genetics/pathology']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Nov;8(4-5):277-81. doi: 10.3109/10428199209051007.,,,['10.3109/10428199209051007 [doi]'],29,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, investigators are looking at the use of cytokine administration in combination with cytotoxic therapy to overcome this problem. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) have been shown to be beneficial in protecting the hematopoietic system from radiation and chemotherapy. In this report, we give an overview of studies using IL-1 and TNF-alpha as protective agents and discuss possible mechanisms involved in their protective action. Mice pretreated with IL-1 and/or TNF-alpha were shown to be protected from the lethal effects of radiation and it has been suggested that the mechanism for this protection may be through the production of the antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase. Similarly, aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme important in the metabolic pathway of cyclophosphamide compounds, has been implicated as being important in the protection of hematopoietic cells from 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. While IL-1 and TNF-alpha stimulate both of these enzymes, other mechanisms are probably also operative for other forms of chemotherapy, i.e. IL-1 and TNF-alpha were shown to protect hematopoietic progenitors from phenylketophosphamide, a cyclophosphamide derivative that is not metabolized by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. Furthermore, malignant as well as normal cells may possess receptors for these cytokines; therefore, IL-1 and TNF-alpha will have to be selective in their protection. They must be capable of protecting normal hematopoietic cells while rendering malignant cells susceptible to the toxic actions of the chemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Moreb, J', 'Zucali, J R']","['Moreb J', 'Zucali JR']","['Department of Medicine, J.

The extraordinary high remission rate achieved by ATRA in comparison with other chemotherapeutic agents suggested that ATRA differentiation induction therapy seemed superior to conventional chemotherapy for APL patients. However, after the great excitement aroused after the initial successes, we have to take stock and examine in detail several problems which have emerged preventing us from improving the clinical outcome in APL. Maintenance in order to prolong remission and prevention of or retreatment for the relapse are the major subjects of concern at present. Efforts should be made either to keep ATRA effective for APL patients or to resensitize the relapsing patients for repeated ATRA therapy. The administration of ATRA should be carefully adapted in accordance with the individual patient's condition. From both conceptual and practical points of view, ATRA differentiation therapy should be combined with chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation and biomodifier treatment. Thus, a more comprehensive strategy must be planned and developed in the near future. Using molecular biological techniques, the diagnosis of APL can be more precisely made and the course of the disease more closely monitored. The central dogma, still to be revealed, is the relationship between APL pathogenesis, the chromosome translocation present with the relevant molecular alterations and the response to ATRA treatment. Current studies in all these above fields have provided us with a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of APL and the physiological function and curative action of ATRA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Chen, Z X', 'Tao, R F', 'Xia, X M']","['Chen ZX', 'Tao RF', 'Xia XM']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Suzhou Medical College, Peoples Republic, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Edema/chemically induced', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytosis/chemically induced', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction', 'Syndrome', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Nov;8(4-5):247-52. doi: 10.3109/10428199209051003.,,,['10.3109/10428199209051003 [doi]'],30,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no procedure-related mortality. The median time to engraftment (i.e. to reach a polymorphonuclear cell count of 0.5 x 10(9)/l) was 25 days (range 16-45 days). Seven children relapsed, four within five months after ABMT: 18 of 25 children (72%) are in continuous complete remission after a median follow-up period of 50 months (range 5-71 months). The predicted long-term disease-free survival is 65% in the whole group and 61% in those transplanted after relapse. Relapse-free children returned to normal activities within three months after ABMT. The major side effects were development of cataract and gonadal insufficiency. We consider the results promising, but our data do not allow comparison with results reported from treatment with chemotherapy alone, since some of our patients were referred from other centers and represent a selected patient group. Long-term follow-up of well-defined patient populations is necessary to evaluate the effect of ABMT.","['Lonnerholm, G', 'Simonsson, B', 'Arvidson, J', 'Bengtsson, M', 'Carlson, K', 'Hagberg, H', 'Jakobson, A', 'Kreuger, A', 'Smedmyr, B', 'Totterman, T H']","['Lonnerholm G', 'Simonsson B', 'Arvidson J', 'Bengtsson M', 'Carlson K', 'Hagberg H', 'Jakobson A', 'Kreuger A', 'Smedmyr B', 'Totterman TH', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,,IM,,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 1992 Dec;81(12):1017-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1992.tb12166.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1992.tb12166.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The modes of action of antigen and ionomycin for serotonin secretion were shown to be similar. The treatment of cells with antigen resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 105 and 72 KDa proteins, in particular, the tyrosine phosphorylation of 72 KDa protein seemed to correlate with serotonin secretion. Furthermore, we observed that antigen stimulation caused a marked increase in inositol polyphosphates production, which derived from the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma in RBL-2H3 cells. On the other hand, treatment with ionomycin also resulted in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of 72 KDa protein, but did not induce inositol polyphosphates production.

When the patients were healthy and free of serious complications and anemia, arterial blood gas examination, pulmonary function tests and incremental treadmill exercise test were examined repeatedly.

To evaluate cardiac dysfunction, we compared exercise parameters obtained at an exercise level of 75% predicted heart rate max in five age-matched normal subjects to those in six BMT patients who did not demonstrate desaturation during exercise. As a result, the mean values of VO2max/kg and O2-pulse/m2 in BMT patients were significantly lower than those in normal subjects, suggesting that cardiac dysfunction may be due to insufficiency of stroke volume during exercise.

The prognosis of diploid ANLL subjects has been defined as ""good"" by some authors, or, more recently, ""intermediate"" by others. This is a retrospective study on 30 consecutive heavy treated ANLL diploid patients with the aim to make a correlation among age, normal karyotype and response. Chromosomal banding studies were performed at presentation with GTG technique. Diploid patients were divided into two age groups < 60 years (17 cases) and > or = 60 (13 cases). Data were analyzed by NCSS software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: CR rate for the two diploid age groups was 94% and 38% respectively (p = 0.002). Median DFS and overall survival were 14.4 and 23.3 months, 4 and 5 months for the two subgroups respectively: these data were not statistically significative. The probability of achieving CR was not affected by blood counts and Karnofsky performance status on admission, but only by age. Though ANLL patients with the same karyotype have the same course regardless of other prognostic factors, this does not occur in our series of diploid patients. We suggest that a normal karyotype, at least as defined with the GTG technique, does not characterize a homogeneous group of patient. Heterogeneity in this group might be due to submicroscopic or molecular genetic changes; it can enhance the age as prognostic factor.","['Mirto, S', 'Santoro, A', 'Barbata, G', 'Crescimanno, A', 'Buscemi, F', 'Carbone, P', 'Caronia, F']","['Mirto S', 'Santoro A', 'Barbata G', 'Crescimanno A', 'Buscemi F', 'Carbone P', 'Caronia F']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia, Ospedale V.

Extracts of developing and adult sweat glands induce changes in neurotransmitter properties in cultured sympathetic neurons that mimic those observed in vivo. We have characterized further the factors present in the extract and compared their properties to those of known cholinergic factors. When assayed on cultured rat sympathetic neurons, the major activities in footpad extracts from postnatal day 21 rat pups that induce choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and reduce catecholamines and neuropeptide Y (NPY) are associated with a soluble protein of 22-26 x 10(3) M(r) and a pI of 5.0. These properties are similar to those of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Moreover, the purified fraction from footpads has ciliary neurotrophic activity. Antibodies to CNTF that immunoprecipitate all differentiation activity from sciatic nerve extracts, a rich source of CNTF, immunoprecipitate 80% of the cholinergic activity in the footpad extracts, 50% of the VIP and 20% of the NPY activities. Neither CNTF protein nor CNTF mRNA, however, can be detected in immunoblot and northern analysis of footpads even though both CNTF protein and mRNA are evident in sciatic nerve. CNTF-immunoreactivity is associated with a sparse plexus of sensory fibers in the footpad but not with sweat glands or the Schwann cells associated with them. In addition, in situ hybridization studies with oligonucleotide probes failed to reveal CNTF mRNA in sweat glands. Comparison of the sweat gland differentiation activity with the cholinergic differentiation factor from heart cells (CDF; also known as leukemia inhibitory factor or LIF) suggests that most of the cholinergic activity in foot pads is biochemically distinct from CDF/LIF. Further, antibodies that block the activity of CDF/LIF purified from heart-cell-conditioned medium do not block the ChAT-inducing activity present in footpad extracts of postnatal day 8 animals. A differentiation factor isolated from skeletal muscle did not induce cholinergic properties in sympathetic neuron cultures and therefore is unlikely to be the cholinergic differentiation factor produced by sweat glands. Taken together, our data suggest that there are at least two differentiation molecules present in the extracts and that the major cholinergic activity obtained from footpads is related to, but distinct from, CNTF. The second factor remains to be characterized. In addition, CNTF associated with sensory fibers may make a minor contribution to the cholinergic inducing activity present in the extract.","['Rao, M S', 'Patterson, P H', 'Landis, S C']","['Rao MS', 'Patterson PH', 'Landis SC']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholinergic Fibers/physiology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*analysis', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/physiology', 'Neurons/*chemistry', 'Rats', 'Sweat Glands/*chemistry/innervation']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 1992 Nov;116(3):731-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the Pax-3/LacZ fusion gene in neuroectodermal and mesodermal lineages following induction of differentiation by chemical treatments (retinoic acid and dimethylsulfoxide) was characterized using this line and is consistent with the previous localization of Pax-3 expression in the embryo to mitotically active cells of the dorsal neuroectoderm and the adjacent segmented dermomyotome. Pax-3/LacZ marked stem cells were also utilized as target cells in mixing experiments with unmarked P19 cells that had been differentiated by pretreatment with chemical inducers. Induction of beta-galactosidase and neuroectodermal markers in the target cells demonstrates that: (1) some differentiated P19 cell derivatives transiently express endogenous Pax-3- and neuroectoderm-inducing activities, (2) undifferentiated target stem cells respond to these activities even in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor and (3) the endogenous activities can be distinguished from, and are more potent than, retinoic acid treatment in inducing neuroectoderm.

Fc epsilon RII expression was originally described on B cells but subsequent studies showed that CD23 is expressed on a variety of hematopoietic cells and is regulated by several cytokines (i.e., interleukin-4, interferons) in a tissue-specific manner. In some pathological conditions such as B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the CD23 gene is abnormally regulated resulting in CD23 overexpression. CD23 is not only an IgE receptor but also a membrane-bound precursor of soluble molecules that still bind IgE (sCD23 or IgE-binding factors). The functions of membrane CD23 are IgE-dependent and vary according to the cell types on which it is expressed. In contrast, sCD23, in addition to being an IgE regulatory molecule, displays multiple cytokine activities that are IgE-independent.","['Sarfati, M', 'Fournier, S', 'Wu, C Y', 'Delespesse, G']","['Sarfati M', 'Fournier S', 'Wu CY', 'Delespesse G']","['University of Montreal, Notre-Dame Hospital, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/*physiology', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Res. 1992;11(3-4):260-72. doi: 10.1007/BF02919132.,,,['10.1007/BF02919132 [doi]'],101,,,,,,,,,,,

Binding of bacterial superantigens or moAbs to DR molecules on activated T cells was recently reported to induce homotypic aggregation through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and mediated by CD11a/CD54 (LFA-1/CAM-1) adhesion molecules. Here, we report that moAbs directed against framework DR, but neither DR1, 2- and DRw52- nor DQ- and DP-specific moABs induced homotypic aggregation of antigen- and alloantigen-activated T cells, antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell lines, a CD8+ T-cytotoxic cell line, and T-leukemia cells (HUT78). Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor herbimycin A partly blocked class-II-induced aggregation responses. In contrast, phorbol ester (PMA)-induced aggregation was essentially unaffected. A potent inhibitor of PKC, staurosporin, inhibited both moAb- and PMA-induced aggregation responses. The aggregation responses were completely inhibited by low temperatures, cytochalasins B and E, and partly inhibited by EDTA and CD18 moAbs, but unaffected by aphidicolin, mitomycin C, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor (2'5'-dideoxyadenosine), and moAbs against other adhesion molecules (CD2/CD58 [LFA-3], CD28/CD28 ligand B7, CD4, and CD44).

To determine cell type specific sensitivity to this drug, the L-asparaginase-mediated inhibition of blastogenesis of human peripheral T or B lymphocytes was compared. The rate of incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into the DNA of either T lymphocytes due to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or B lymphocytes due to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) was measured by the addition of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase in the medium. The blastogenic response of either T or B lymphocytes was also determined in medium depleted of exogenous asparagine and/or glutamine, both of which are hydrolyzed by this enzyme. The in vitro blastogenesis of either human T lymphocytes due to PHA or B lymphocytes due to SAC was inhibited by the inclusion of asparaginase in the medium. The deprivation of exogenous asparagine did not have any inhibitory effect on the blastogenic response of both T and B lymphocytes to each mitogen. On the other hand, the glutamine concentration in the culture medium provided a critical influence on the proliferative response of T and B lymphocytes. The rate of incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into DNA was increased markedly as the concentration of glutamine was increased from 2(-7)-2 mmol/l. It is concluded that the mechanism of inhibition of PHA- or SAC-stimulated lymphocyte blastogenesis by L-asparaginase is not asparagine deprivation but glutamine deprivation. Glutamine, which is the most abundant amino acid, is thought to have an important role in the immune response of lymphocytes.","['Kitoh, T', 'Asai, S', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Kubota, M', 'Mikawa, H']","['Kitoh T', 'Asai S', 'Akiyama Y', 'Kubota M', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shin-Kohri Hospital, Hirakata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,"['0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,,"['Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Asparagine/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glutamine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1992 Dec;34(6):579-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1992.tb01012.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1992.tb01012.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

All 22 follicular small cleaved cell lymphomas (FSC) were CD43 negative and CD20 positive. In contrast, of 20 small lymphocytic lymphomas (SL), 90% were CD20 positive, 85% were CD43 positive, and 75% were positive for both. Of three lymphomas of intermediate differentiation (IDL), two were CD20 positive and two were CD43 positive. All four monocytoid B-cell lymphomas were positive for CD20 and 50% (two cases) were positive for CD43. Some 86% of 14 chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL) (on cytospins) were positive for CD43; all nine of the CLL studied for CD20 were positive and 89% (8/9) expressed both antibodies CD5 expression (on frozen sections or cytospin preparations) was compared to CD43 in 21 cases of SL and CLL. Some 77% were positive for both CD5 and CD20. All seven of the CD5-positive SL also expressed CD43. The antibody MT2 was also examined with the following results: FSC, 16/20 (80%) positive; SL, 18/19 (94%) positive; MBC, 3/3 positive; and ILL, 2/3 positive. All 56 cases tested were CD45RO (UCHL1) negative. We conclude that CD43 is expressed on most cases of low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders with the exception of FSC. Its pattern of expression seems similar to CD5; however, unlike CD5, CD43 can be studied in formalin-fixed tissue. MT2 is not helpful in distinguishing among these lesions.","['Contos, M J', 'Kornstein, M J', 'Innes, D J', 'Ben-Ezra, J']","['Contos MJ', 'Kornstein MJ', 'Innes DJ', 'Ben-Ezra J']","['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology', 'Leukosialin', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/pathology', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*analysis']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1992 Nov;5(6):631-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microdosimetric analysis has shown that microtumors whose diameters are less than the beta-particle maximum range absorb radiation energy inefficiently from targeted radionuclides. Micrometastases of diameters < 1 mm are likely to be spared if targeted 131I is used as a single modality. Because of this, combined modality therapy incorporating targeted 131I, external beam total-body irradiation (TBI), and bone marrow rescue has been proposed. In this study, the minimum necessary TBI component is shown to depend on the radiosensitivity of the tumor cells. The analysis shows that the TBI component, to achieve radiocurability, increases directly with tumor radioresistance. For the most radiosensitive tumors, a whole-body TBI treatment dose 2 x 2 Gy is calculated to be obligatory, whereas practical arguments exist in favor of higher doses. For more radioresistant tumors, the analysis implies that a TBI treatment delivery of 5 x 2 Gy is obligatory. In all situations, external beam TBI appears to be an essential factor in providing reasonable probability of cure of disseminated malignant disease. Reasonable prospects of tumor cure by combination strategies incorporating 131I exist for the more radiosensitive tumor types (e.g., neuroblastoma, lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma, seminoma), but more resistant tumors are unlikely to be curable at present. Superior targeting agents, and the possible use of panels of different radionuclides, may be necessary to achieve high cure probabilities for less radiosensitive tumor types.","['Amin, A E', 'Wheldon, T E', ""O'Donoghue, J A"", 'Barrett, A']","['Amin AE', 'Wheldon TE', ""O'Donoghue JA"", 'Barrett A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Biophys,Cell biophysics,8002185,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/pathology/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Lymphoma/pathology/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology/*radiotherapy/therapy', '*Radiation Tolerance', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Biophys. 1992 Aug-Dec;21(1-3):139-52. doi: 10.1007/BF02789484.,,,['10.1007/BF02789484 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Permanent antibodies appeared in 8% of patients with acute leukemia, whereas 38% of patients suffering from CL, lymphoma, MDS and myeloma produced antibodies. Some patients (18) received granulocyte transfusions as well. It is striking that 11% of these patients developed permanent and 28% transient HLA antibodies. There exist no data about recent transfusions or previous pregnancies. To lower the rate of sensitization in patients with diseases such as CL, lymphoma, MDS and myeloma, it should be discussed whether leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates should be given to these patients.","['Koepsell, E', 'Zumpe, P', 'Saavedra, C', 'Seidl, S']","['Koepsell E', 'Zumpe P', 'Saavedra C', 'Seidl S']","['Blutspendedienst Hessen des DRK, Institut Frankfurt am Main, BRD.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Beitr Infusionsther,Beitrage zur Infusionstherapie = Contributions to infusion therapy,8812367,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,,"['*Blood Component Transfusion', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/transplantation', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/*blood', 'Leukemia/blood/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*therapy', '*Plateletpheresis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Beitr Infusionsther. 1992;30:416-9.,,,,,Entwicklung von HLA-Antikorpern unter Thrombozytensubstitution mit Zellseparator-Produkten.,,,,,,,,,,

Selection of unrelated bone marrow donors currently relies on serological HLA identity and negative mixed lymphocyte reactions between donor/recipient pairs. As serological HLA-DP typing is not feasible, we used the HLA-DPB1 oligonucleotide typing method to investigate whether the current selection procedure can guarantee complete MHC class II identity. In 40 consecutive patients, one third (62/193) serologically HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR and -DQ identical donors were found to be MLC-negative with a relative response below 5%. HLA-DPB1 oligonucleotide typing of these MLC-negative donors revealed that again only one third (20/62) was also identical for DP with their presumptive recipients. In the majority of pairs a disparity in graft-versus-host direction or in host-versus-graft direction of at least one allele was seen. These data indicate that, in spite of the strict MLC criteria used, the current procedure did not warrant complete MHC class II identity. This implies that oligotyping for DPB1 can improve matching and should be introduced for typing of volunteers.","['Eiermann, T H', 'Ballas, M', 'Fakler, J', 'Muller, C', 'Wolpl, A', 'Goldmann, S F']","['Eiermann TH', 'Ballas M', 'Fakler J', 'Muller C', 'Wolpl A', 'Goldmann SF']","['Department of Transplantation Immunology, Red Cross Blood Bank, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Beitr Infusionsther,Beitrage zur Infusionstherapie = Contributions to infusion therapy,8812367,,IM,,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Genes, MHC Class II/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Tissue Donors']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Beitr Infusionsther. 1992;30:320-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the oxygen transport parameters change markedly during the first weeks after birth. Oxygen consumption and cardiac output in neonates are three times those of adults on a body weight basis. Due to the high oxygen affinity of fetal hemoglobin, the oxygen unloading capacity of hemoglobin in neonates is about 50% less than in adults. From oxygen transport parameters and oxygen consumption we have calculated the optimum and the critical hemoglobin concentrations for preterm and full-term neonates during the first weeks after birth. A hemoglobin concentration of 15 g/dl appears optimal for preterm and full-term infants at birth as well as for adults. The calculated minimum acceptable hemoglobin concentration is 6 g/dl for children and adults, 12 g/dl for preterm infants and 11 g/dl for full-term neonates at birth. Due to the postnatal decrease in oxygen affinity, the minimum acceptable hemoglobin concentration decreases by approximately 1 g/dl/week for the first 5-6 weeks until the minimum value of 6 g/dl for children and adults is reached. The minimum hemoglobin concentration should be 2 g/dl higher in patients who require increased oxygen or suffer from other serious disorders. A minimum hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dl is recommended in children with leukemia or other oncological disease. In infants and children with chronic hypoxemia (cyanotic congenital heart disease) the minimum hemoglobin concentration should be increased by the percentage of arterial oxygen desaturation.","['Linderkamp, O', 'Zilow, E P', 'Zilow, G']","['Linderkamp O', 'Zilow EP', 'Zilow G']","['Abteilung Neonatologie, Kinderklinik, Universitat Heidelberg, BRD.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Beitr Infusionsther,Beitrage zur Infusionstherapie = Contributions to infusion therapy,8812367,['S88TT14065 (Oxygen)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia/blood/etiology', 'Child', 'Child Development/*physiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Hematocrit/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hemoglobinometry/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature/*blood', 'Oxygen/blood', 'Pregnancy', 'Reference Values']",,1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Beitr Infusionsther. 1992;30:235-46; discussion 247-64.,,,,29,"Kritische Hamoglobinwerte bei Neugeborenen, Sauglingen und Kindern.",,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which EPO inhibits programmed death is unknown. In the well-characterized model of glucocorticoid-treated thymocytes, activation of a Ca2+/Mg(2+)-sensitive endonuclease and new protein and RNA syntheses have been found necessary for apoptosis. We examined the effects of EPO on the free intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i), and the roles of Ca2+ and RNA and protein syntheses on DNA cleavage in erythroid progenitor cells. The murine model of erythroid differentiation using Friend leukemia virus-infected proerythroblasts (FVA cells) was used. EPO did not affect the [Ca2+]i in FVA cells. Decreasing [Ca2+]i by extracellular Ca2+ chelation with EGTA facilitated DNA breakdown. Increasing [Ca2+]i with the calcium ionophore 4-bromo-A23187 increased DNA cleavage; however, DNA fragments generated by high [Ca2+]i were much larger than those seen in the absence of EPO or presence of EGTA. Increased [Ca2+]i also inhibited DNA breakdown to small oligonucleosomal fragments characteristic of cells cultured without EPO. However, no concentration of ionophore protected the high molecular weight DNA as did EPO. Cycloheximide inhibited DNA breakdown in a dose dependent manner in cultures lacking EPO, but two other protein synthesis inhibitors, pactamycin and puromycin, did not prevent DNA breakdown. Inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin D did not prevent DNA breakdown. Cells with morphological characteristics similar to those reported in other cells undergoing programmed death accumulated in EPO-derived cultures. These studies demonstrate that although DNA cleavage and morphological changes are common to apoptotic cells, the roles for Ca2+ and protein and RNA syntheses are not universal and suggest that apoptosis can be regulated by different biochemical mechanisms in different cell types.","['Kelley, L L', 'Koury, M J', 'Bondurant, M C']","['Kelley LL', 'Koury MJ', 'Bondurant MC']","['Division of Hematology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Fura-2', 'Mice', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA/biosynthesis']",,1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1992 Jun;151(3):487-96. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041510307.,,"['DK31513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-DK08554/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-DK07186/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1002/jcp.1041510307 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of cystatin C is to regulate the activity of cysteine proteinases and cystatin C seems to be the main cysteine proteinase inhibitor of most investigated human biological fluids. Its normal level in plasma is 0.8-2.5 mg/l, in cerebrospinal fluid 4-14 mg/l and in urine 0.03-0.3 mg/l. The production rate of cystatin C is remarkably constant and its plasma concentration can therefore be used as a reliable measure of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Indeed, the cystatin C plasma concentration is more closely correlated to the GFR than the plasma levels of creatinine and all other investigated low molecular weight proteins, including beta 2-microglobulin and retinol binding protein. Protein HC, alias alpha 1-microglobulin, is produced by the liver as a 27 kDa-glycoprotein.

Twenty-two samples, obtained from 19 patients, were density cut (Ficoll-Hypaque 1.077) and, after incubation with My10 antibody, separated by panning or by immunomagnetic beads. Immunomagnetic beads provided a significantly better separation than panning, either in terms of concentration of CD34+ cells (85.5 +/- 11.6% vs. 55.7 +/- 25.0%, p = 0.003) or in terms of depletion of CD34+ cells (3.9 +/- 8.0% vs. 30.9 +/- 26.3%, p = 0.008). This was consistent with the virtually complete depletion of colony forming cells (CFC) in the CD34 negative fraction and the recovery of virtually all the CFC in the positive fraction in the samples separated by immunomagnetic beads. In conclusion, separation by immunomagnetic beads can allow collection of nearly pure CD34+ and CD34- cell populations from patients with ANLL, thereby facilitating the study of the biological characteristics of these cell populations. Moreover the method is less time consuming than panning and is not toxic to the CFC.","['Silvestri, F', 'Banavali, S', 'Yin, M', 'Gopal, V', 'Baccarani, M', 'Preisler, H D']","['Silvestri F', 'Banavali S', 'Yin M', 'Gopal V', 'Baccarani M', 'Preisler HD']","['University of Cincinnati Medical Center, OH.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Magnetics', 'Male', 'Microspheres', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Nov;8(4-5):389-96. doi: 10.3109/10428199209051019.,,,['10.3109/10428199209051019 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

They frequently secrete polyspecific natural autoantibodies, which probably bind with low affinity to the different antigens they recognize and which express germinal genes. The role of this pre-immune repertoire still remains to be defined but it has been suggested that it participates in the elimination of cell breakdown products, serves as a first barrier of defense or acts as a template upon which antigen driven selection and somatic recombinations could induce the emergence of high affinity induced antibodies. The present study, reviews the evidence favouring the idea that this autoreactive B-cell repertoire, which expresses a restricted set of V genes, frequently undergoes malignant transformation. This evidence arises from the study of the autoantibody activity and V gene usage in three different models of B-cell malignancies namely monoclonal immunoglobulins; chronic lymphocytic leukemia; and follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.","['Dighiero, G']",['Dighiero G'],"['Immunohematologie et Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/blood/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/blood/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Autoantibodies/blood/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cytoskeleton/immunology', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Nov;8(4-5):345-51. doi: 10.3109/10428199209051013.,,,['10.3109/10428199209051013 [doi]'],57,,,,,,,,,,,

To exclude the possibility that these effects were restricted to cell-lines, we have performed similar experiments on fresh cells from a patient with drug-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Similar to our previous findings, we found the CD34 antigen to be hyperphosphorylated in lymphoblasts labeled in the presence of active phorbols. The same peptides which were hyperphosphorylated in phorbol-stimulated cell-lines were also phosphorylated in phorbol-stimulated lymphoblasts.

Up to twenty years' experience was based in two major therapeutic periods: the first included patients observed between 1970 and June 1980 and the second between July 1980 and December 1987. Significant differences between the two periods were the reduction of splenectomies as staging procedure, the reduction of radiation dose and extension and the sequential use of MOPP/ABVD instead of MOPP alone. METHODS: The analysis included all patients observed over the twenty years under study by looking to the differences concerning response to therapy, survival, relapse-free survival and major consequences due to therapy, namely death not directly related to lymphoma. 377 pts entered the first period and 193 the second one with a minimum follow-up of 4 years. RESULTS: Significant differences were recorded on CR rate, 80.9% vs 90.5%, respectively (p = 0.0024) and deaths in CR, 15.1% vs 2.6%, respectively (p = 0.000). The overall survival shows a probability of 60% and 83% at 11 years for the first and the second group, respectively (p = 0.000) being the probability of survival of 50% at 20 years for the first group of pts. The probability of being in remission is similarly of 79% and 78%, for the first and second group, respectively. The risk of death in remission accounting all causes not related to lymphoma shows a 17% probability vs 6% at 11 years (p = 0.006) for the first and second group, respectively, being 38% for the former group at 20 years. The most frequent single cause of death in remission was secondary leukemia which was recorded in 14 pts on the group of pts observed between 1970 and 1980, all splenectomized and treated by MOPP and extensive radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The modifications of therapy of HD have produced improvements concerning the prognosis of pts; these improvements are due mainly to the reduction of late side effects such as acute leukemia and second solid tumor, and to the increase of remission rate and cure rate of the lymphoma.","['Mazza, P', 'Bocchia, M', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Fiacchini, M', 'Gherlinzoni, F', 'Bandini, G', 'Bendandi, M', 'Frezza, G P', 'Neri, S', 'Barbieri, E']","['Mazza P', 'Bocchia M', 'Zinzani PL', 'Fiacchini M', 'Gherlinzoni F', 'Bandini G', 'Bendandi M', 'Frezza GP', 'Neri S', 'Barbieri E', 'et al.']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita di Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/etiology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 Nov-Dec;77(6):487-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggested that proliferated effect of rhG-CSF on leukemic cells may be important for inducing differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells. But this effect might expose the patients to the risk of acute myeloblastic leukemia if G-CSF was used alone. However, RA could not only rule out the latter situation but retain former merit as well.

We have previously described the heterotypic adherence of a human B-lymphoblastic cell line (UTMB-460) to marrow stromal cells (MSC). We have extended these observations to a human T-lymphoblastic cell line (CEM) and characterized the heterotypic adherence of B- and T-lymphoblastic cell lines to human MSC. Electron microscopy demonstrated UTMB-460 cells were in very close apposition to the MSC, but no specific intercellular junctions were noted. Under the conditions employed, these MSC express extracellular fibronectin, collagen types I and IV, intracellular laminin, and vimentin, but no factor VIII-R antigen. In addition, the MSC had receptors for the lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin I. UTMB-460 and CEM cells do not adhere to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins secreted by the MSC, i.e., fibronectin, collagen types I, III, or IV, or laminin. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against CD11a, CD11b, CD18, and CD54 and a polyclonal anti-human fibronectin antibody do not inhibit attachment of either B- or T-lymphoblastic cells to MSC. Peptides GRGES and GRGDS did not inhibit adherence of UTMB-460 and CEM cells to MSC. In contrast, the anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 MoAb (4b9) caused significant inhibition (p < 0.01) of the adherence of both UTMB-460 and CEM cells to normal human MSC monolayers. These data suggest: (1) that MSC to which lymphoblastic cells adhere are specialized mesenchymal cells; (2) that the membrane interactions between T- and B-lymphoblastic cells and MSC involve close apposition of cell membranes of MSC and the lymphoblastic cells; (3) that the heterotypic adherence between B- and T-lymphoblastic cell lines (UTMB-460 and CEM) and MSC does not involve the RGD recognition sequence of the integrin family, the B2 leukocyte integrins, CD44, LAM-1, or the ECM proteins examined; and (4) that VCAM-1 may at least be partially responsible for heterotypic adherence between human MSC and B- and T-lymphoblastic cells.","['Juneja, H S', 'Rajaraman, S', 'Gay, R E', 'Gay, S', 'Schmalsteig, F C']","['Juneja HS', 'Rajaraman S', 'Gay RE', 'Gay S', 'Schmalsteig FC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Vimentin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'CHO Cells', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Dec;20(11):1263-70.,,"['16672/PHS HHS/United States', 'AI23521/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Delineation of cellular mechanisms of drug resistance therefore represents a prerequisite to the development of more effective treatment strategies. The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype represents one such mechanism of resistance with direct clinical relevance. This phenotype occurs normally in certain mammalian tissues, and is detectable in tumor cell lines selected for resistance to naturally occurring antineoplastics. The mdr1 gene or its glycoprotein product, P-glycoprotein, is detected with high frequency in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and poor-risk subsets of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In prospective studies in AML, MDR overexpression is an independent determinant of response to treatment and overall survival with conventional-dose induction regimens. Investigations of mdr1 regulation in normal hematopoietic elements has shown a pattern which corresponds to its regulation in acute leukemia, explaining the linkage of mdr1 to specific cellular phenotypes.

This study suggests that CD34 expression is an adverse prognostic marker, independent of age and pre-existing myelodysplasia.","['Myint, H', 'Lucie, N P']","['Myint H', 'Lucie NP']","['University Department of Haematology, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Aug;7(5-6):425-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199209049798.,,,['10.3109/10428199209049798 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth of leukemic blast progenitors is supported by growth factors and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) have been shown to stimulate this phenomenon in vitro. After repeated subculture of leukemic cells obtained from a patient with AML M4 in the presence of recombinant G-CSF, a cell line dependent on G-CSF was established. This cell line, designated OCI/AML1a, does not respond to GM-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-1 or stem cell factor as well as G-CSF. The stimulatory effect of G-CSF on OCI/AML1a cells is almost completely blocked by monoclonal anti-G-CSF antibody. With G-CSF added in the culture, the OCI/AML1a cell line has been growing exponentially for over 5 years now. Another cell line, with growth dependent on IL-3, has also been established from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the acute phase. This cell line TMD2 does not respond to G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1, or stem cell factor and anti-IL-3-antibody blocks the stimulatory effect of IL-3 on these cells. Receptors for IL-3 have been found on the surface of TMD2 cells. Although the TMD2 cell line is not derived from AML, the novel character of IL-3-dependency provides useful information for the study of the role of growth factor(s) in leukemic cell proliferation. These two CSF-dependent cell lines are expected to be excellent models for the investigation of the precise mechanism by which G-CSF and IL-3 stimulate the growth of leukemic cells.","['Nara, N']",['Nara N'],"['Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Jul;7(4):331-5. doi: 10.3109/10428199209049786.,,,['10.3109/10428199209049786 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to eliminate false negative results, the following steps were optimized: RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and oligonucleotide primer selection. We compared different RNA extraction methods using guanidinium salt/detergent and proteinase K digestion/phenol extraction, and tested virus particle enrichment with polyethylene glycol precipitation and ultracentrifugation. RNA extraction with guanidinium salt/detergent was the most efficient method. Ultracentrifugation of single samples did not improve hepatitis C virus RNA detection. Polyethylene glycol precipitation performed poorly. Recombinant thermostable reverse transcriptase produced cDNA from fewer samples than did Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase. Nested oligonucleotide primers from the 5'-terminal non-coding region of the hepatitis C virus genome amplified cDNA from more samples than did primers from the coding regions. Thirty six anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive samples were tested; nested primers (nucleotides 6 to 327 and 15 to 288) yielded 21 amplificates, whereas primers from the coding region produced 16 amplificates (nucleotides 4684-5276) and 5 amplificates (nucleotides 5166-5270), respectively. The most efficient combination of steps was RNA extraction with guanidinium salt solution, reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase and nested polymerase chain reaction primed with primers from the 5'-terminal non-coding region of the hepatitis C virus genome. Other combinations produced more false negative results. Three different groups of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive individuals had markedly different viraemia patterns: Hepatitis C virus RNA was detected in the sera of only 10% of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive blood donors, but in 90% of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive patients with clinically manifest hepatitis C, and 90% of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive haemophiliacs who had received plasma products in the past which had not been virus-inactivated.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis of a region extending 580 kb 5' to the PDGFRB gene and 120 kb 3' to the CSFIR gene did not reveal aberrant restriction fragments in leukemic cell DNA, confirming that the breakpoint does not occur in the vicinity of these genes. To sublocalize the breakpoint, we performed Southern blot hybridizations using DNA from human x hamster somatic cell hybrids containing the normal 3, the normal 5, the derivative 3, or the derivative 5 human chromosome. Using a series of polymorphic DNA probes from the long arm of chromosome 5, which have been linked by genetic recombination, we bracketed the breakpoint to within a region that spans approximately 13 centimorgans (sex average) and is flanked by the q34-qter markers cKK5.19 and L1200 (D5S62).

This suggests a role for the abnormality in the tumour development in this patient but implies that other mutational events were necessary for overt disease to become manifest.","['Thick, J', 'Sherrington, P D', 'Fisch, P', 'Taylor, A M', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Thick J', 'Sherrington PD', 'Fisch P', 'Taylor AM', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['TCR', 'TCRA', 'TCRJ&agr;']","['Adult', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*complications/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'Precancerous Conditions/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Time Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'X Chromosome/*ultrastructure']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992 Nov;5(4):321-5. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870050407.,,,['10.1002/gcc.2870050407 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Parental-type subclones, which show an extremely immature hemopoietic phenotype, do not carry the aberrations. The frequency of the stable differentiated variants is elevated by 5-azacytidine and bromodeoxyuridine, consistent with chromosome breakage being responsible for the phenotype. The frequency is also raised by dexamethasone. Since variants are 300-3,000-fold more resistant to dexamethasone than parental clones, we interpret this to be largely due to selection. Three of the lesions, on chromosome 2, match those previously described as associated specifically with in vivo-generated murine myeloid tumors, induced by X irradiation and corticosteroid treatment. Several implications follow from these observations. (1) In vitro differentiation in clonal tumor cell lines can be used to select for tumor-associated lesions. This should allow genetic and molecular analysis of the chromosome 2 lesions and of others that may pinpoint genes critical to macrophage differentiation and transformation. (2) Myeloid and lymphoid tumors that occur in response to X irradiation may diverge from a common initiating tumor. (3) The hemopoietic lineage switch phenomenon, previously described by several authors, may be caused by similar or identical chromosome aberrations.","['Alexander, B', 'Berger, R', 'Day, L M', 'Hogarth, P M', 'Feneziani, A', 'Cook, W D']","['Alexander B', 'Berger R', 'Day LM', 'Hogarth PM', 'Feneziani A', 'Cook WD']","['Department of Surgery, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['FC&ggr;RIII', 'FES', 'FMS', 'IG&mgr;', 'IL1&agr;', 'IL1&bgr;', 'MYC', 'TCR&ggr;', 'TNF&agr;', 'V-FMS']","['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Macrophages/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992 Nov;5(4):286-98. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870050404.,,,['10.1002/gcc.2870050404 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, VLA-4 binds to VCAM-1 and ICAM-2, thus mediating intercellular adhesion prerogative for lymphocyte extravasation or ""homing"". Using frozen tissue of normal lymphoid organs and of 100 morphologically and immunologically typed B cell neoplasias, monoclonal antibodies to all six VLA-alpha subunits and to the common beta 1-chain were applied to serial sections. VLAs were found differentially expressed in cytologically and microtopographically defined B cell subsets [follicular mantle zone cells (MZ), follicular center cells (FC), extrafollicular cells (EF), and plasma cells (PC)] of normal spleen, lymph node, and thymic medulla (which contains an EF compartment). Thus, these cell types, which correspond to discrete stages of B cell development, can also be defined by their VLA status. Acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was VLA-1-, 2-, 3 +/-, 4 +/-, 5 +/-, 6-. The VLA-1-, -2 +/-, -3+, -4+, -5+, -6- phenotype of chronic B lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) resembled that of MZ. Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) differed from CLL in its tendency to lack VLA-2, in its consistent lack of VLA-3, and altogether resembled splenic EF in its VLA profile. Mantle zone lymphoma (MZL) consistently expressed VLA-3 and -4 and frequently VLA-5. Nodal follicular center cell lymphomas (FCCL) were VLA-1- and -2- and very rarely expressed VLA-5 and -6. Thus, FCCL although roughly corresponding to FC, tended to aberrantly express VLA-3 and/or VLA-4.

We diagnosed nine out of 88 consecutive AML cases as CD7+ AML based on myeloperoxidase positivity and surface antigen expression. In eight of these nine cases more than 20% of leukaemic blasts were found to coexpress both CD7 and a myeloid-associated antigen, CD33, by a two-colour flow-cytometric assay, while in the remaining case more than 90% of blasts were positive for CD7 and myeloperoxidase. CD7+ AML was most frequently observed in M1 among AML subtypes according to the FAB classification. An early stage-specific antigen, CD34 was also expressed on leukaemic blasts from eight of these nine cases. Neither the T-cell receptor (TcR)-beta nor the TcR-gamma gene was clonally rearranged in any of the cases. We then studied the proliferative responses to stimulation by various growth factors. Among interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), IL-3 showed the strongest stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis and leukaemic blast colony formation in 8/9 and 6/8 CD7+ AML cases examined, respectively. On the other hand, the strongest stimulatory effect exerted by IL-3 on blast colony formation was observed in only six out of the 33 CD7- AML cases examined. Furthermore, CD7+ AML blasts could proliferate in response to stem cell factor (SCF); SCF alone showed stimulatory effects on blast colony formation (7/8 cases), and in 5/7 SCF-responding cases, stimulatory effects of SCF were more potent than those of IL-3. In addition, SCF enhanced blast colony formation synergistically with IL-3 in four of these seven cases. These data suggest that progenitor cells of CD7+ AML may possess the biological properties characteristic of immature haematopoietic stem cells.","['Eto, T', 'Akashi, K', 'Harada, M', 'Shibuya, T', 'Takamatsu, Y', 'Teshima, T', 'Niho, Y']","['Eto T', 'Akashi K', 'Harada M', 'Shibuya T', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Teshima T', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Nov;82(3):508-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06460.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06460.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic blast progenitors can renew themselves. The self-renewal can be detected as secondary colony formation after replating primary blast colonies in fresh methylcellulose media and by the growth of clonogenic cells in suspension culture. D-Factor suppressed primary and secondary colony formation in methylcellulose culture. Furthermore, D-factor suppressed clonogenic cell recovery in suspension culture. The suppression by D-factor of the growth of leukemic blast progenitors was not significantly dependent upon the colony-stimulating factors used as growth-stimulating factors.

METHODS: The methods of economic evaluation used were those of cost analysis and cost-effectivity analysis. The probability of occurence of EFN was estimated by the application of the Delphi method and the costs were calculated. RESULTS: The costs of EFN for the patients with solid tumors is situated between 236,000-377,000 pesetas according to hospitalary centers. For patients with acute leukemia the value was estimated as between 391,000-667,000 pesetas. The results of the cost analysis indicate that the net cost per patient prophylactically treated is between 4,000-64,000 pesetas. The results of the cost-effectivity analysis indicate that the cost per case of no incidence of EFN is between 20,000-320,000 pesetas. CONCLUSIONS: Episodes of febrile neutropenia carry expansive hospital and antibiotic clinical treatment. The prophylactic use of new medication for patients between the first and second cycle of chemotherapy, in agreement with the estimates calculated, does not save health care costs but may improve the quality of life in these patients and permit the continuation of a therapeutic schedule without interruption which may improve the life expectancy of the patient.","['Antonanzas, F', 'Rovira, J', 'Garuz, R', 'Anton, F']","['Antonanzas F', 'Rovira J', 'Garuz R', 'Anton F']",['Universidad de La Rioja.'],['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Fever/complications', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/complications/*prevention & control', 'Recombinant Proteins/economics/therapeutic use']",,1992/11/28 00:00,1992/11/28 00:01,['1992/11/28 00:00'],"['1992/11/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/28 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1992 Nov 28;99(18):685-9.,,,,,Evaluacion economica de la profilaxis con el factor estimulador de la granulopoyesis recombinante.,,,,,,,,,,

MRD was evaluated by dual marker analysis flow-cytometry using CD5 and CD19 markers, and by the study of Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements using the fast polymerase chain reaction (PCR). According to our laboratory conditions patients were considered to be in complete phenotypic remission when total CD19+ cells were < 25% and the ratio of CD5 + CD19 + /CD19 + cells was < 25%. According to these strict criteria only 9 of the 23 patients were in complete phenotypic remission. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the above method, PCR analysis of the configuration of the Ig heavy chain gene region was performed in 12 of these patients. Five of 7 patients in complete phenotypic remission retained a detectable monoclonal rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain gene. For the remaining 5 patients in partial phenotypic remission, only one failed to show a monoclonal band and this is probably explained by the presence of an unusual gene rearrangement. In conclusion, this study suggests that PCR is more sensitive than dual marker flow-cytometry for evaluation of residual disease and that it is indeed possible to achieve complete remission at the molecular level, in B-CLL. Nevertheless, we suggest a word of caution as this was a retrospective study, and samples were not assessed before treatment. Thus the possibility that apparent molecular remission might correspond to unusual gene rearrangements cannot be completely excluded in these cases.","['Vuillier, F', 'Claisse, J F', 'Vandenvelde, C', 'Travade, P', 'Magnac, C', 'Chevret, S', 'Desablens, B', 'Binet, J L', 'Dighiero, G']","['Vuillier F', 'Claisse JF', 'Vandenvelde C', 'Travade P', 'Magnac C', 'Chevret S', 'Desablens B', 'Binet JL', 'Dighiero G']","['Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol', 'COP protocol 2']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Jun;7(3):195-204. doi: 10.3109/10428199209053623.,,,['10.3109/10428199209053623 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the preferential use of similar VH and VL genes with little or no somatic hypermutations in both malignant B-cell CLL and nonmalignant mixed cryoglobulinemia, these proliferations do differ in CD5 membrane expression and in their clinical evolution. One possibility could be that CD5 glycoprotein is lost during maturation of the lymphocyte into a secreting cell as suggested by data on Waldenstrom's disease and the LES-CLL and by in vitro studies. Alternatively, CD5 expression could play an additional direct role in malignant transformation as suggested by recent data on the CD5 receptor ligand.

Involvement of Ca2+ and Na+ in the activation of beta-glucuronidase release and superoxide production.,1025-35,"In human neutrophils, the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) induces increases in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with subsequent activation of beta-glucuronidase release and superoxide (O2-) production. Results from several laboratories suggest that the increase in [Ca2+]i is due to activation of non-selective cation (NSC) channels. We studied the biophysical characteristics, pharmacological modulation and functional role of NSC channels in dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP)-differentiated HL-60 cells. fMLP increased [Ca2+]i by release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space. fMLP also induced Mn2+ influx. Ca2+ and Mn2+ influxes were inhibited by 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SK&F 96365). Under whole-cell voltage-clamp conditions, fMLP and ATP (a purinoceptor agonist) activated inward currents characterized by a linear current-voltage relationship and a reversal potential near 0 mV. NSC channels were substantially more permeable to Na+ than to Ca2+. SK&F 96365 inhibited fMLP- and ATP-stimulated currents with a half-maximal effect at about 3 microM. Pertussis toxin prevented stimulation by fMLP of NSC currents and reduced ATP-stimulated currents by about 80%. Intracellular application of the stable GDP analogue, guanosine 5'-O-[2-thio]diphosphate, completely blocked stimulation by agonists of NSC currents. In excised inside-out patches, single channel openings with an amplitude of 0.24 pA were observed in the presence of fMLP and the GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-O-[3-thio]triphosphate. The bath solution contained neither Ca2+ nor ATP. The current/voltage relationship was linear with a conductance of 4-5 pS and reversed at about 0 mV. fMLP-induced beta-glucuronidase release and O2- production were substantially reduced by replacement of extracellular CaCl2 or NaCl by ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetra-acetic acid and choline chloride respectively. In the absence of Ca2+ and Na+, fMLP was ineffective. SK&F 96365 inhibited fMLP-induced beta-glucuronidase release and O2- production in the presence of both Ca2+ and Na+, and in the presence of Ca2+ or Na+ alone. NaCl (25-50 mM) enhanced the basal and absolute extent of fMLP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis of heterotrimeric regulatory G-proteins in HL-60 membranes.

Sometimes, however, it gives false positive or negative results. A demonstration of the HTLV-I provirus from patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) should, therefore, give the crucial evidence for them being HTLV-I carriers. We established a simple and reliable method using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect one molecule of HTLV-I provirus in 100 x 10(3) PBMC, during which internal control primers for the human beta-globin gene were also employed in the same reaction tube to check the success of the amplification reaction. We can thus easily avoid any false negative judgement and quantitate the HTLV-I provirus in PBMC simply by diluting the sample before PCR. One ml blood was enough for ten or more determinations by PCR. Analysis of seropositive blood from donors demonstrated a wide range for the number of HTLV-I provirus in PBMC. The method could conveniently be used for quantitating HTLV-I proviruses and following up HTLV-I carriers to study the pathophysiology and mode of HTLV-I transmission.","['Matsumura, M', 'Kushida, S', 'Ami, Y', 'Uchida, K', 'Kameyama, T', 'Terano, A', 'Shiraki, H', 'Sato, H', 'Miwa, M']","['Matsumura M', 'Kushida S', 'Ami Y', 'Uchida K', 'Kameyama T', 'Terano A', 'Shiraki H', 'Sato H', 'Miwa M']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Tsukuba.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Beta-Globulins)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Beta-Globulins/genetics', '*Blood Donors', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Carrier State', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Amplification', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viremia/microbiology']",,1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1992 Oct;22(5):335-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To extend our knowledge of the role of reovirus-receptor interactions in reovirus tropism, we determined whether type 1 and type 3 reovirus strains can infect cells derived from erythrocyte precursors. We found that reovirus type 3 Dearing (T3D), but not type 1 Lang, can grow in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. This difference in growth was investigated by using reassortant viruses and we found that the capacity of T3D to infect MEL cells is determined by the viral cell-attachment protein, sigma 1. In experiments using murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to different sigma 1 regions, we show that T3D binding to MEL cells is inhibited by a mAb that identifies a domain important for hemagglutination (HA). We also determined that type 3 strains that can infect murine L cells but do not produce HA do not infect MEL cells. These results suggest that type 3 reovirus binds to and infects erythrocyte precursor cells via a sigma 1 domain important for HA. Moreover, this study suggests that different domains of some viral cell-attachment proteins are used to initiate productive infections of different types of cells.","['Rubin, D H', 'Wetzel, J D', 'Williams, W V', 'Cohen, J A', 'Dworkin, C', 'Dermody, T S']","['Rubin DH', 'Wetzel JD', 'Williams WV', 'Cohen JA', 'Dworkin C', 'Dermody TS']","['Department of Medical Research, Veterans Affairs Hospital, Nashville, Tennessee 37212.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (sigma 1 protein, reovirus)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology/metabolism', '*Capsid Proteins', 'Epitopes', '*Hemagglutination', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mammalian orthoreovirus 3/growth & development/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",PMC443412,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 Dec;90(6):2536-42. doi: 10.1172/JCI116147.,,"['AI-00865/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-28503/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-01284/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1172/JCI116147 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently been shown that besides interleukin-6 (IL-6), related cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostation M and interleukin-11 are also mediators of the hepatic acute-phase response. All these mediators belong to the hematopoietic family of alpha-helical cytokines. Here we show that an additional member of this cytokine family, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), induces the hepatic acute-phase protein genes haptoglobin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin and beta-fibrinogen in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and in primary rat hepatocytes with a time course and dose-response comparable with that of IL-6. Our next aim was to define the receptor components used by CNTF on hepatic cells. Using a cell-free binding assay we exclude that CNTF binds to the 80 kDa IL-6 receptor, a protein with significant homology to the CNTF receptor which has recently been cloned from neuroblastoma cells. In human hepatoma cells (Hep3B) which lack the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, CNTF was not able to induce acute-phase protein synthesis, indicating that this receptor protein may be part of the functional CNTF receptor on hepatic cells.","['Schooltink, H', 'Stoyan, T', 'Roeb, E', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Rose-John, S']","['Schooltink H', 'Stoyan T', 'Roeb E', 'Heinrich PC', 'Rose-John S']","['Institut fur Biochemie der RWTH Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Acute-Phase Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Humans', 'Liver/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/12/21 00:00,1992/12/21 00:01,['1992/12/21 00:00'],"['1992/12/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/21 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1992 Dec 21;314(3):280-4. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(92)81489-9.,,,"['0014-5793(92)81489-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(92)81489-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular characterization of a (7;11)(q35;p13) translocation showed that the translocation breakpoint was 2 kb 5' to the T-ALLbcr locus resulting in the juxtaposition of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta gene to the rhom-2 gene locus. Northern blot analysis did not detect expression of the rhom-2 gene in the leukemic blasts of the (7;11) translocation. However, using a sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay, the (7;11) translocation showed a trace expression of rhom-2 at a level of 0.01% of TCR-beta message. Because rhom-2 is considered a proto-oncogene, the significance of the trace expression of rhom-2 in the (7;11) translocation was investigated by comparing the level of rhom-2 expression in 7 additional T-ALLs, normal thymocytes, and CEM (pre-T) and HPB (mature-T) cell lines using the PCR assay. The CEM cells, normal thymocytes, and one patient, whose blasts had no cytogenetic abnormality of chromosome 11, did not express rhom-2 indicating that rhom-2 is not normally expressed in T cells. The other six T-ALLs fell into three categories: (1) two T-ALLs overexpressed rhom-2 in the presence of a translocation; (2) two T-ALLs had trace expression in the presence of a translocation; and (3) two T-ALLs had trace expression with no observable abnormalities on chromosome 11 at p13. Therefore, the data indicate that not all translocations at the T-ALLbcr locus result in overexpression of rhom-2. To account for the sharp contrast in rhom-2 expression seen in these T-ALLs, a model is proposed with a negative regulatory element in the T-ALLbcr locus that is disrupted in some of the cases leading to overexpression of rhom-2.","['Fitzgerald, T J', 'Neale, G A', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Goorha, R M']","['Fitzgerald TJ', 'Neale GA', 'Raimondi SC', 'Goorha RM']","[""Department of Virology and Molecular Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['bcr', 'rhom-2']","['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 15;80(12):3189-97.,"['GENBANK/L01279', 'GENBANK/M87883', 'GENBANK/M87884', 'GENBANK/S50868', 'GENBANK/S72766', 'GENBANK/S72767', 'GENBANK/S72768', 'GENBANK/S72769', 'GENBANK/S72771', 'GENBANK/X63098']",['CA43237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['S0006-4971(20)85920-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLLs) activated through slgs or CD40 were examined for their capacity to proliferate and differentiate in response to various cytokines. Our results indicate that the outcome of IL-4 stimulation on the in vitro growth of B-CLL depends on the signalling pathway used for their activation. Whereas IL-4 did not display any growth-stimulatory effect on B-CLL activated by Ig cross-linking agents, it could stimulate DNA synthesis and enhance the viable cell recovery when leukemic B cells were cultured in the CD40 system. Most B-CLL samples were induced for IgM synthesis upon Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I stimulation. This Ig response was potentiated by IL-2 and antagonized by IL-4. Anti-CD40 MoAb used alone or in combination with cytokines (IL-1 alpha to IL-6, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor gamma, and transforming growth factor beta) failed to induce Ig secretion from B-CLL cells. No evidence for Ig isotype switching was obtained with the cytokines listed above, regardless of the mode of activation. Taken together, our results suggest that B-CLL cells can be partially released from their apparent maturation block by IL-2 and Ig cross-linking agents. In contrast, combinations of IL-4 and cross-linked anti-CD40 antibodies induced entry of B-CLL cell into cycle, but poorly stimulated their differentiation into Ig secreting cells.","['Fluckiger, A C', 'Rossi, J F', 'Bussel, A', 'Bryon, P', 'Banchereau, J', 'Defrance, T']","['Fluckiger AC', 'Rossi JF', 'Bussel A', 'Bryon P', 'Banchereau J', 'Defrance T']","['Laboratory for Immunological Research, Schering-Plough, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",,1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 15;80(12):3173-81.,,,['S0006-4971(20)85918-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Disrupting c-myb function might, therefore, prove an effective therapeutic strategy for controlling leukemic cell growth. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been utilized for this purpose in vitro, but their in vivo efficacy has not been reported. We therefore established human leukemia-scid mouse chimeras with K562 cells and treated diseased animals with phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. K562 cells express the c-myb protooncogene, which served as the target for the antisense DNA. They also express the tumor-specific bcr-abl oncogene that was utilized to track the human cells in the mouse host. Once circulating leukemic blast cells had been detected, the survival of untreated control mice was 6 +/- 3 days (mean +/- SD). The survival of animals treated for 7 or 14 days with either sense or scrambled-sequence c-myb oligodeoxynucleotides was not statistically different from the control animals. In distinct contrast, animals treated for similar lengths of time with antisense c-myb oligodeoxynucleotides survived at least 3.5 times longer than the various control animals. In addition, animals receiving antisense c-myb DNA had significantly less disease at the two sites most frequently manifesting leukemic cell infiltration, the central nervous system and the ovary.

A diverse identification of key regulatory proteins by their content of phosphotyrosine has been hampered by the very low level of tyrosine phosphorylation. This is presumably caused by the relative preponderance of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity in many cells. We report that treatment of hematopoietic cells with phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a membrane-permeable phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induced a dramatic accumulation of phosphotyrosine in a number of cellular proteins. No changes in serine or threonine phosphorylation were detected. The PAO-induced accumulation of phosphotyrosine occurred well before any signs of toxicity or irreversible damage to the cells were seen. Addition of dithiothreitol reversed the effect of PAO. Our data demonstrate that phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity has a major impact on the level of phosphotyrosine in cellular proteins, even in cells with high protein tyrosine kinase activity. Cells with constitutively elevated tyrosine kinase activity are easily detected following treatment with PAO and substrates with an otherwise too low phosphotyrosine content or too rapid phosphate turnover can be studied. This effect of PAO allows determinations of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent complex formation between proteins.","['Oetken, C', 'von Willebrand, M', 'Autero, M', 'Ruutu, T', 'Andersson, L C', 'Mustelin, T']","['Oetken C', 'von Willebrand M', 'Autero M', 'Ruutu T', 'Andersson LC', 'Mustelin T']","['Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['bcr', 'c-abl', 'lck', 'src']","['Aged', 'Animals', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phosphates/blood', 'Phosphoproteins/blood/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",,1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1992 Oct;49(4):208-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb00048.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb00048.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of CTLA-4 and CD28 mRNA does not correlate with the pattern of lymphokine production.,3795-801,"Ag-presenting cells provide at least two distinct signals for T cell activation. T cell receptor-dependent stimulation is provided by presentation of a specific peptide Ag in association with MHC molecules. In addition, APC also supply costimulatory signals required for T cell activation that are neither Ag- nor MHC restricted. One such costimulatory signal is mediated via the interaction of B7 on APC with the CD28 receptor on T cells. Recently, CTLA-4 has been shown to be a second B7 receptor on T cells. In the present report, we have examined the expression of CD28 and CTLA-4 on a panel of resting and activated normal T cell subsets and T cell clones by RNA blot analysis in an attempt to determine whether their expression defines reciprocal or overlapping subsets. CD28 was detected in resting T cells, whereas CTLA-4 was not. After stimulation with PHA and PMA for 24 h, CTLA-4 mRNA was expressed in both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets as well as in CD28+ T cells. We examined 37 human and six murine T cell clones that had been previously characterized for their cytokine production. After activation, CTLA-4 and CD28 mRNA were coexpressed in 36 of 37 human T cell clones and all six murine T cell clones. These included T cells of CD4+8-, CD4-8+, and CD4-8- phenotypes as well as clones with Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles. In contrast, CD28 but not CTLA-4 mRNA was detected in leukemic T cell lines and myelomas. CTLA-4 and B7 mRNA but not CD28 mRNA was detected in two long term HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines. These data demonstrate that CD28 and CTLA-4 mRNA are coexpressed in most activated T cells and T cell clones, providing evidence that they do not define reciprocal subsets. Moreover, they are consistent with the hypothesis that B7 transmits its signal through a single receptor, CD28, on resting T cells, and multiple receptors, CD28 and CTLA-4, on activated T cells.","['Freeman, G J', 'Lombard, D B', 'Gimmi, C D', 'Brod, S A', 'Lee, K', 'Laning, J C', 'Hafler, D A', 'Dorf, M E', 'Gray, G S', 'Reiser, H']","['Freeman GJ', 'Lombard DB', 'Gimmi CD', 'Brod SA', 'Lee K', 'Laning JC', 'Hafler DA', 'Dorf ME', 'Gray GS', 'Reiser H', 'et al.']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Abatacept', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis', 'B7-1 Antigen', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD28 Antigens', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",,1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Dec 15;149(12):3795-801.,,"['CA-40216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NS24247/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The alpha 4 subunit was initially synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide that underwent the formation of complex endoglycosidase H-resistant oligosaccharide side chains and which could be proteolytically cleaved into two noncovalently associated fragments. The level and rate of alpha 4 subunit cleavage was dependent on the cell studied. The T cell tumor line HPB-ALL expressed both intact and fragmented alpha 4 on the cell surface. The interleukin-2-dependent natural killer line NK 3.3 and long term interleukin-2-dependent activated T lymphocytes cleaved the alpha 4 polypeptide earlier and more efficiently than did HPB-ALL cells and did not have detectable levels of intact alpha 4 on the cell surface. The proteolysis of alpha 4 was blocked by treating cells with either the lysosomotrophic amine NH4Cl or the carboxylic ionophore monensin.

According to French-American-British (FAB) classification, 21 refractory anemia (RA), seven refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), 15 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 12 refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), and 20 RAEB in transformation (RAEBt) were examined. TNF-alpha levels were inversely correlated with lower levels of hemoglobin concentration (r = -0.31, p = 0.005), irrespective of the requirements for transfusion in anemic MDS patients. Significant differences in TNF-alpha levels between CMML (26.2 +/- 5.9 pg/ml) and the FAB subgroups (16.1 +/- 1.6 pg/ml) were detected. There was an overall inverse relationship between the level of erythropoietin and the degree of anemia, but a wide range of Epo response between patients with similar hemoglobin concentrations. Serum levels of IL-1 alpha and GM-CSF were undetected in most of the patients. In 57% of the samples there were detectable levels of G-CSF, without a correlation of the serum levels with blood cell counts, nor with any of the FAB subcategories. Overall, 29% and 25% of the patient sera exhibited elevated IL-3 and IL-6 levels, respectively. There was no correlation of the serum levels with any of the blood counts, other cytokines, nor FAB subcategories. In conclusion, simple negative feedback mechanism between a specific cytokine and the production of blood cells seems not to be the case in MDS, except for red cell production and erythropoietin concentration.

METHODS: The monoclonal antibody WR14, clustered provisionally in the Fourth Leucocyte Typing Workshop as a CD43 reagent, was investigated by epitope blocking studies on formalin fixed reactive lymph node tissue, using the established CD43 antibody MT1, to validate its use as a CD43 reagent. CD43 expression was studied in 131 immunophenotypically defined B cell lymphomas, including lymphocytic lymphoma (Lc, n = 13), centrocytic lymphoma (Cc, n = 14), and a range of follicle centre cell lymphomas (FCC) including centroblastic/centrocytic follicular (CbCcF, n = 48), centroblastic diffuse (CbD, n = 39), centroblastic/centrocytic diffuse (CbCcD, n = 4), centroblastic follicular and diffuse (Cb FD, n = 3) and centroblastic/centrocytic follicular and diffuse (CbCc FD, n = 1). Nine lymphomas of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) were also examined. RESULTS: Epitope blocking studies showed that WR14 is a CD43 reagent that binds to an epitope identical with or close to that recognised by MT1. Eleven of 13 (84%) cases of Lc and 11 of 14 (78%) cases of Cc expressed CD43; 87 of 95 (91%) cases of FCC did not. All eight low grade lymphomas of MALT were negative. One high grade lymphoma, transformed from a low grade MALT lymphoma, was positive for CD43. The expression of CD43 by tumours of B cell lineage was associated with the expression of CD5 (p < 0.001) although either antigen could occasionally be found in the absence of the other. CONCLUSION: CD43 reagents can be used in conjunction with CD5 antibodies for the immunophenotypic discrimination of follicle centre cell lymphomas from non-follicle centre cell lymphomas.","['Treasure, J', 'Lane, A', 'Jones, D B', 'Wright, D H']","['Treasure J', 'Lane A', 'Jones DB', 'Wright DH']","['University Department of Pathology, Southampton General Hospital.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Leukosialin', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*analysis']",PMC495037,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1992 Nov;45(11):1018-22. doi: 10.1136/jcp.45.11.1018.,,,['10.1136/jcp.45.11.1018 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The technique allows one to calculate the average cell cycle duration time. ES cells are found to cycle every 8-10 h, and most B cells are 11-12 h, but there is a small subset of B cells with a cycle time of only 6-7 h. Using this technique, we also study the roles of different T lymphocytes on B cell activation when B cells are stimulated with anti-IgM antibodies (commonly used, anti-mu). Exposure to anti-mu recruits small B cells into the cell cycle, but arrests them in the G1 phase of the second cycle. Interleukin (IL) 4 is a costimulator of anti-mu. In addition, IL-4 is an S-phase progression factor. Contrary to that seen when B cells are stimulated by other mitogens, very few cells are in the G2 compartments after anti-mu plus IL-4 stimulation. This phenomenon is reminiscent of embryonic cells. Our findings provide strong evidence to propose that there are two restriction points for B cell activation: at the transition from G0 to G1 and at the transition from G1 to S phase.","['Chen, U']",['Chen U'],"['Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (anti-IgM)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'LHQ7J5KV9B (Bisbenzimidazole)']",IM,,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*cytology/immunology', 'Bisbenzimidazole', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Ethidium', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Interphase/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/cytology/immunology']",,1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1992 Aug;185(2-4):366-79. doi: 10.1016/S0171-2985(11)80653-4.,,,"['S0171-2985(11)80653-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0171-2985(11)80653-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its expression is abundant in brain and testis and is developmentally regulated. To gain insights regarding its function, we analyzed the expression of p19 mRNA in a variety of cell types during induction of differentiation. Murine erythroleukemia cells showed a moderate increase followed by a marked decrease in the abundance of p19 mRNA during induction of differentiation. In murine C2 myoblasts and primary fetal rat osteoblasts, p19 mRNA was abundant in replicating cells and decreased to undetectable levels during differentiation. In resting human peripheral blood lymphocytes, p19 mRNA was virtually undetectable but was strongly induced during blast transformation of both B and T cells. In rat liver, p19 mRNA was abundant on embryonic day 17 and decreased during early postnatal development. Upon fractionation of adult rat liver cells by centrifugal elutriation, p19 mRNA was not detected in hepatocytes while a low level was observed in a fraction enriched in non-parenchymal epithelial cells. CCl4-induced liver regeneration resulted in induction of p19 mRNA in hepatocytes. Primary cultures of embryonic and neonatal rat brain were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using co-staining with stage-specific markers. p19 expression was restricted to immature neurons and oligodendrocyte precursors. In contrast to the other cell types examined, the neuronal and glial precursors that express p19 were shown, using BrdU labeling, to be postmitotic both in primary culture and in vivo. The data demonstrate widespread, stage-specific expression of p19 and suggest that the protein exerts a general, lineage-independent function during induction of differentiation of mammalian cells. In view of the available evidence on the stimulation of serine phosphorylation of p19 by several growth factors, our working hypothesis is that phosphorylation of p19 may be involved in the mechanism by which growth factors control cell differentiation.","['Schubart, U K', 'Xu, J', 'Fan, W', 'Cheng, G', 'Goldstein, H', 'Alpini, G', 'Shafritz, D A', 'Amat, J A', 'Farooq, M', 'Norton, W T']","['Schubart UK', 'Xu J', 'Fan W', 'Cheng G', 'Goldstein H', 'Alpini G', 'Shafritz DA', 'Amat JA', 'Farooq M', 'Norton WT', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Stmn1 protein, mouse)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytosol/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Liver/cytology/*physiology', 'Liver Regeneration', 'Mice', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neuroglia/*cytology/physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prosencephalon/*cytology/physiology', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stathmin', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1992 Sep;51(1):21-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.1992.tb00676.x.,,"['AI 27741/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 02476/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 26333/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['S0301-4681(11)60023-6 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1992.tb00676.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Dual-color staining techniques and multiparameter flow cytometry confirmed that this alpha CD3 x alpha CD19 heteroconjugate was able to bind to both CD3+ T cells and CD19+ t(4;11) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. T-cell-mediated lysis of freshly isolated primary bone marrow blasts from nine newly diagnosed ALL patients with a t(4;11)(q21;q23) chromosomal translocation were studied with 51Cr-release assays. Picomolar concentrations of alpha CD3 x alpha CD19 MoAb heteroconjugate effectively triggered lysis of CD19+ t(4;11) ALL cells by interleukin-2-activated CD3+ peripheral blood T-cell (PBTC) effectors but did not augment the cytolytic activity of the same effectors against CD19- T-ALL cells. In contrast to the alpha CD3 x alpha CD19 heteroconjugate, neither the alpha CD3 x alpha CD3 homoconjugate control nor the alpha CD19 x alpha CD72 heteroconjugate control facilitated the cytolysis of t(4;11) ALL blasts. Occupation of the target CD19 binding sites on t(4;11) ALL blasts by preincubation with excess unconjugated alpha CD19 MoAb abrogated the potentiating effects of the alpha CD3 x alpha CD19 heteroconjugate on PBTC-mediated cytolysis. Thus, the cell type-specific cytolysis of t(4;11) ALL blasts by PBTC effectors is dependent on both the alpha CD19 and alpha CD3 moieties of the alpha CD3 x alpha CD19 heteroconjugate. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an effective bispecific antibody that facilitates the T-cell-mediated lysis of t(4;11) ALL blasts.","['Anderson, P M', 'Crist, W', 'Hasz, D', 'Carroll, A J', 'Myers, D E', 'Uckun, F M']","['Anderson PM', 'Crist W', 'Hasz D', 'Carroll AJ', 'Myers DE', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 1;80(11):2826-34.,,"['P01 CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-51425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA 53517/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['S0006-4971(20)72199-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the healthy animals, three received rhIL-6 alone (10 micrograms/kg/d, subcutaneously [SC]), one received rhIL-6 in combination with rhIL-3 (10 micrograms/kg/d, SC), one received rhIL-6 in combination with recombinant cynomolgus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rcGM-CSF; 10 micrograms/kg/d, SC), two received rhIL-6 in combination with recombinant human granulocyte-CSF (rhG-CSF; 10 micrograms/kg/d, SC), and one received rhIL-6 in combination with recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (rhLIF; 10 micrograms/kg/d, SC). All animals were treated for at least 2 weeks with rhIL-6 or the above mentioned combinations. rhIL-6 alone significantly increased the peripheral blood platelet counts (2- to 3.5-fold). The platelets reached a plateau between days 10 and 15 of treatment. No synergistic effects on platelet numbers were observed when rhIL-6 was combined with rhIL-3, rcGM-CSF, rhG-CSF, or rhLIF. In addition to rhIL-6, only rhLIF increased the platelet numbers when administered alone. To test whether rhIL-6 might also protect the animal from thrombocytopenia or shorten the time of thrombocytopenia after irradiation, we treated nine animals with total body irradiation (3.8 Gy). Six of the animals were additional treated with rhIL-6 (4 with 10 micrograms/kg/d; and 2 with 100 micrograms/kg/d) from day -1 or +1 to day 28 post irradiation. In these animals, rhIL-6 at the same dose effective in healthy animals (10 micrograms/kg/d) was not capable of protecting the animals from platelet nadir. However, when pegylated rhIL-6 was used at a dosage of 100 micrograms/kg/d post irradiation, the mean of the nadirs was 71,000/microL as compared with 39,000/microL in control animals and the time of thrombocytopenia was shorter (3 v 5 days). In all animals (healthy and irradiated), rhIL-6 did not increase the number of bone marrow megakaryocytes but induced a right shift of DNA ploidy in megakaryocytes.

Analysis of the fidelity of the purified RT using the same template sequence revealed that, of the two mispairs (A.C and T.G) that would lead to reversion of the amber codon during replication, A.C occurs at a rate of 4.0 x 10(-6), and T.G occurs at a rate of 0.7 x 10(-4). While the rate of formation of A.C is very similar to the vector mutation rate, the rate of formation of T.G is more than 30 times higher.

Puromycin (PM) inhibits protein synthesis by causing the premature release of truncated PM-peptide complexes (PMPs), the structure of which predicts an inhibitory effect on tyrosine kinase activity (21). The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of a low dose of PM (0.9 microM) on tyrosine kinase activity in HL-60 leukaemic cells. Experiments were specifically controlled to exclude inhibitory effects consequent on protein synthesis blockade. Soluble enzyme extracts derived from PM-treated cells showed attenuated phosphorylation of two independent synthetic tyrosine kinase-specific substrates, the polymer Poly(Glu:Tyr; 4:1) and the peptide substrate Raytide. In contrast, Protein Kinase C-specific activity was unaffected by PM-exposure. It is possible that inhibition was due to metabolites of PM, perhaps PMPs, rather than to PM itself. Whether the inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity observed with the substrates used in this study is equally applicable to all tyrosine kinases, is not yet clear. Nevertheless, low-dose PM could provide a useful tool for dissecting out the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation and dysregulation of cell growth, and could conceivably prove beneficial in the treatment of tumours in which tyrosine kinase overactivity is linked to oncogenesis.","['Davidoff, A N', 'Mendelow, B V']","['Davidoff AN', 'Mendelow BV']","['Department of Haematology, School of Pathology, South African Institute for Medical Research, Johannesburg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,,"['Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/*metabolism', 'Puromycin/*pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",,1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1992 Sep-Oct;12(5):1761-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, an attempt was made to discriminate this particular cell population from small immature elements of megakaryocytopoiesis, such as promegakaryoblasts and megakaryoblasts. The staining reactions employed included periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) and immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against platelet glycoprotein IIIa (Y2/51-CD61). Comparison of the various staining reactions applied to the different megakaryocytic elements together with morphometric measurements resulted in a clearcut identification of promegakaryoblasts. These were defined as the earliest immature and exclusively CD61-positive precursors. Atypical micromegakaryocytes were characterized by their dysplastic features and strong ANAE reactivity in addition to their positive CD61 staining. When stringent diagnostic criteria (diameter ranging between 10 to 15 microns, mean size about 12 microns) were applied, this abnormal cell population comprised less than 10% of total megakaryocytopoiesis in CML and MDS. It may be assumed that dysmegakaryocytic features in the latter disorders are partially generated by small to medium-sized megakaryocytes (diameter less than 30 microns). In conclusion, the relative frequency of promegakaryoblasts in the normal bone marrow (range 6-8%) is confirmed by evaluation of the immunohistochemical and cytochemical staining methods (CD61 and ANAE). Furthermore, the ANAE reaction facilitates the recognition of atypical micromegakaryocytes as well as small megakaryocytes. Thus cytochemistry provides a better insight into alterations of these cell lineages in various pathological conditions.","['Thiele, J', 'Titius, B R', 'Kopsidis, C', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Titius BR', 'Kopsidis C', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,"Virchows Archiv.

A 59-year-old man suffering from left chest pain was admitted to the hospital because of thrombocytopenia (platelets 1.9 x 10(4)/mm3). The diagnosis of SLE was made from (1) pleuritis (2) autoimmune thrombocytopenia (3) positive anti-DNA antibodies, positive LE cell preparation (4) positive antinuclear antibodies.

From that time monoclonal CD5 + B cells began to increase in peripheral blood (maximum lymphocyte counts 11000/mm3, CD5 + B cells 77.6%) and bone marrow, and the complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was suspected. It is said that patients of CLL often have various autoantibodies, and in about 15% of CLL patients complicate autoimmune hemolytic anemia, but those who develop collagen diseases are rare. And while lymphoid malignancies occur more often in the patients of SLE in comparison with normal subjects, the reports of the patients who complicate the proliferation of monoclonal CD5 + B cells like CLL are very few.

It is a membrane component of cell storage granules, and is a member of the selectin family which includes E-selectin and L-selectin. P-selectin recognizes both lineage-specific carbohydrate ligands on monocytes and neutrophils, including the Lewis x antigen, sialic acid, and a protein component. In inflammation and thrombosis, P-selectin may mediate the interaction of leukocytes with platelets bound in the region of tissue injury and with stimulated endothelium. To evaluate the role of P-selectin in platelet-leukocyte adhesion in vivo, the accumulation of leukocytes within an experimental thrombus was explored in an arteriovenous shunt model in baboons. A Dacron graft implanted within an arteriovenous shunt is thrombogenic, accumulating platelets and fibrin within its lumen. These bound platelets express P-selectin. Here we show that antibody inhibition of leukocyte binding to P-selectin expressed on platelets immobilized on the graft blocks leukocyte accumulation and inhibits the deposition of fibrin within the thrombus. These results indicate that P-selectin is an important adhesion molecule on platelets, mediating platelet-leukocyte binding in vivo, that the presence of leukocytes in thrombi is mediated by P-selectin, and that these leukocytes promote fibrin deposition.","['Palabrica, T', 'Lobb, R', 'Furie, B C', 'Aronovitz, M', 'Benjamin, C', 'Hsu, Y M', 'Sajer, S A', 'Furie, B']","['Palabrica T', 'Lobb R', 'Furie BC', 'Aronovitz M', 'Benjamin C', 'Hsu YM', 'Sajer SA', 'Furie B']","['Center for Hemostasis and Thrombosis Research, New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Polyethylene Terephthalates)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical', 'Blood Platelets/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'Fibrin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'P-Selectin', 'Papio', '*Platelet Adhesiveness', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/immunology/*physiology', 'Polyethylene Terephthalates', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/10/29 00:00,1992/10/29 00:01,['1992/10/29 00:00'],"['1992/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1992 Oct 29;359(6398):848-51. doi: 10.1038/359848a0.,,,['10.1038/359848a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 228 patients with data for TdT, 32 (14%) had > 5% of the leukemia cells positive by an immunofluorescence assay. The median age of the TdT-positive patients was approximately 10 years less than the TdT-negative patients (50 versus 60 years). Patients with TdT-positive AML had similar median survival (12 versus 10.5 months) and complete remission (CR) rates (53 versus 59%), but a greater frequency of long-term complete responders (60 of complete remitters versus 20%, p = 0.08) than TdT-negative patients. Of 126 patients tested, 59% were CD34-negative (< 20% reactivity with leukemia cells). These 74 patients (median age 60 years) had a greater CR rate (71 versus 48%, p = 0.008) than the 52 CD34-positive patients (median age 60 years), and improved survival (p = 0.013 by Wilcoxon) although there was no difference in the duration of CR between the CD34-positive and negative groups. Of CD34-positive patients 12/52 remain in continuous CR, and 16/74 CD34-negative patients remain in continuous CR. None of eight patients strongly positive for CD34 (> 70% reactivity) remain disease-free. Positivity for TdT or CD34 was associated with less differentiated AML. Of CD34-positive patients, 44% had FAB M0/M1 morphology versus 13% of CD34-negative patients (p = 0.0001); similarly, 47% of TdT-positive patients were FAB M0/ML1 versus 25% of TdT-negative patients (p = 0.01). Of seven patients with FAB M4E0, five were CD34-positive. Of the 12 CD34-positive survivors, four had FAB M4E0. Thus CD34 expression predicts for CR rate and overall survival in adults with AML.

The nucleolytic effect is seen 2-4 h after drug addition and is highly selective to cells progressing through S phase. Concomitant with degradation of DNA, which is preferential to the nucleosomal DNA linker sections, extensive proteolysis takes place in these cells. Cellular RNA, however, is initially degraded to a much lesser degree than DNA or protein. Both endonucleolysis and proteolysis triggered by CAM in S-phase HL-60 cells can be prevented by the protease inhibitors N-tosyl-L-phenylalanylchloromethyl ketone (TPCK), N-tosyl-L-lysylchloromethyl ketone (TLCK) or partly by N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME), added simultaneously with CAM, or up to 30 min after exposure to CAM, at their respective concentrations known to inhibit proteases. The protective effect of these protease inhibitors on DNA degradation cannot be due to the suppression of cell progression through S phase because cells still replicate DNA in their presence, albeit at a reduced rate. Furthermore, TPCK and TLCK protect rat thymocytes against endonucleolysis induced by prednisolone. In the latter cell system, (considered a classic model of apoptosis), endonucleolysis, which primarily affects G0/G1 cells, is unrelated to cell progression through S phase. The present data suggest that the endonucleolysis and proteolysis which accompany apoptotic cell death are coupled, and the proteolytic step is needed for DNA degradation to occur.","['Bruno, S', 'Del Bino, G', 'Lassota, P', 'Giaretti, W', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Bruno S', 'Del Bino G', 'Lassota P', 'Giaretti W', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Rats', 'S Phase', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6(11):1113-20.,,"['R01 CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using a truncated p19, the cross-reactive region was located to the C-terminal 17 amino acids of p19. One oligopeptide derived from the C terminus, PQIPPPYVEPT (amino acids 115 to 125), was capable of inhibiting PA, suggesting that this peptide carries the cross-reactive epitope.

Methods based upon the theory of competing risks are applied to the statistics on causes of death in Finland during the years 1966-70. It is estimated that if there were no lung cancer (the commonest type of cancer in both morbidity and mortality statistics in males in Finland) the annual deaths saved would yield 5,900 working years (both sexes combined). Leukaemia and cancer of the stomach would be next in rank order, with figures of respectively 4,000 and 3,900 working years more. Female cancer with the highest incidence, that of the breast, would be characterized by 2,900 additional working years. The significance of types of cancer that affect young people is stressed in these calculations: leukaemia, brain tumours and lymphomas (both sexes combined) are 6th, 12th and 11th respectively in the statistics of cancer causes of death, but 2nd, 4th and 6th respectively in the list of additional working years to be gained by elimination of the disease.

If no risk of cancer existed, the annual deaths saved would produce 36,000 working years, a figure exceeded only by those for cardiovascular diseases (55,000 working years) and accidents (51,000 working years).

Addition of ATP, ADP and AMP to the medium reduces enzyme efflux in a manner similar to that in normal lymphocytes. Iodoacetate, however, causes a marked increase in enzyme leakage from both normal and leukaemic cells. It appears therefore that the membrane permeability of leukaemic lymphocytes is at least partly dependent upon the intracellular energy content. Since the ATP contents of the leukaemic cells were lower than those of normal lymphocytes, however, it is concluded that some additional factor is concerned in reducing permeability to enzymes in chronic lymphatic leukaemia. The possibility that the immunoglobulin associated with the cell membrane of leukaemic cells may play a part in reducing its permeability has been explored, but washed and unwashed cells were found to lose enzymes at similar rates. The lower permeability of the membranes of such cells may partly explain their longer lifespan in chronic lymphatic leukaemia.","['Hallak, G J', 'Wilkinson, J H']","['Hallak GJ', 'Wilkinson JH']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Iodoacetates)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.37 (Malate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', '*Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iodoacetates/pharmacology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*physiology', 'Malate Dehydrogenase/blood']",,1976/06/01 00:00,1976/06/01 00:01,['1976/06/01 00:00'],"['1976/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 1976 Jun 1;69(2):341-9. doi: 10.1016/0009-8981(76)90514-3.,,,"['0009-8981(76)90514-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-8981(76)90514-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This comparison did not reveal any significant differences in the patterns of inhibitory activity predictive of significant advantages in the clinic of any of these compounds over CP or NSC-69945. Attempts to prepare aldophosphamide, the key intermediate in CP metabolism, by oxidation of hydroxyphosphamide under the Sarett reaction conditions lead primarily to 4-ketocyclophosphamide. Under milder conditions the product isolated appears to be the elusive aldophosphamide on the basis of positive alkylating and aldehyde tests, Rf and infrared data, and the formation and characterization of a semicarbazone. The possibility that this product is an equilibrium mixture with the tautomeric 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide has not been as yet defintely ruled out. Sarett oxidation of homohydroxyphosphamide straightforwardly gives the stable analog, homoaldophosphamide. Biologic testing of this putative aldophosphamide in direct comparison with homoaldophosphamide, CP, and NSC-69945 reveals that aldophosphamide is a potent antitumor agent indistinguishable in activity from CP and NSC-69945, whereas homoaldophosphamide is inactive. These results provide confirmatory evidence for the postulated role of aldophosphamide as an intermediate in CP metabolism and suggest, furthermore, that aldophosphamide itself is not active in vivo, requiring transformation to NSC-69945 via beta-elimination of acrolein to exert its antitumor effects.

This cohort of women has now been followed up for a further seven years. 500 (24 per cent) women have now died, 78 (3-8 per cent) have emigrated and 25 (1-2 per cent) could not be traced. The numbers of deaths from different causes have been compared with the numbers expected in a population of similar age and sex exposed to the Scottish national mortality rates over the same period. An excess of deaths from leukaemia (seven observed, 2-3 expected) and of cancers of the heavily irradiated sites (59 observed, 40-1 expected) continues to be observed five or more years after treatment. There is no indication of any change in the excess death rate, due to cancers of sites in the radiation field, with time since treatment up to at least 20 years after the radiation exposure. Over the same period the number of deaths from cancer of the breast was below expectation (ten observed, 22-3 expected) and no increased mortality from coronary disease was seen (102 observed, 100-9 expected). The mean dose of radiation to the bone marrow has been determined for each woman ant it is estimated that the excess rate of leukaemia in the first 20 years after treatment is about 1-1 per million women per year per rad. This figure is in accord with the estimates derived from the survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and among patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with X irradiation. However, the finding of no excess risk of leukemia among women treated with irradiation for cancer of the cervix (Hutchison, 1968) suggests that the simple assumption of a linear dose-response relationship for leukaemia is incorrect, at least when high doses of radiation are delivered to a small volume of marrow.","['Smith, P G', 'Doll, R']","['Smith PG', 'Doll R']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Coronary Disease/mortality', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'England', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Pelvic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Time Factors', 'Uterine Hemorrhage/*radiotherapy', 'X-Ray Therapy/*adverse effects']",,1976/03/01 00:00,1976/03/01 00:01,['1976/03/01 00:00'],"['1976/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Radiol. 1976 Mar;49(579):224-32. doi: 10.1259/0007-1285-49-579-224.,,,['10.1259/0007-1285-49-579-224 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Because genetics was not commonly taught in medical schools before the late 1960's, this review article is intended to acquaint physicians or refresh their knowledge regarding chromosomal, mendelian and multifactorial inheritance and the indications for prenatal diagnosis. Establishing an accurate diagnosis and mode of inheritance is essential in identifying and selecting those families at risk for genetic disease in their offspring. Medical genetics is evolving as a specialty in order to provide consultation and, if needed, management of those families who would benefit by genetic services. Families who would benefit from genetic counseling include, for example, those in whom any of the following conditions is present: known chromosomal disorders, known disorders due to mendelian inheritance, mental retardation of unknown origin, failure of sexual maturation or failure of sexual development, congenital malformations, floppy infant syndrome or leukemia.A list of more than 70 disorders now detectable in a fetus by means of amniocentesis provides a beginning in the prevention of genetic disease. Knowledge regarding these diseases allows a physician to provide families with accurate risk figures so that they may make informed decisions about having children. Also, a compassionate and nonjudgmental approach to counseling is essential. Decisions, in the final analysis, must be made by the family but aided and supported by the physician.","['Dumars, K W', 'Dalrymple, G T', 'Murray, A K']","['Dumars KW', 'Dalrymple GT', 'Murray AK']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,West J Med,The Western journal of medicine,0410504,,IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', '*Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Pedigree', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Diagnosis']",PMC1130073,1976/05/01 00:00,1976/05/01 00:01,['1976/05/01 00:00'],"['1976/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,West J Med. 1976 May;124(5):377-87.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This substance reduces considerably the DNA synthesis intensity in cells, due to that the mitotic activity of cells is markedly reduced. It was demonstrated that diazane during 8 hours blocked the transfer of cells from a presynthetic stage into the DNA synthesis phase. But this substance does not influence the transfer of cells from the premitotic period into mitosis. The substance delayes continuously (during 36 hours) the division of cells being in a phase of the DNA synthesis during its injection.

However, this conclusion is based on a very small number of studies with inherent experimental and analytic limitations. In the present study, a new experimental approach was employed. Plasma bilirubin turnover (BRT), total red blood cell volume (TRCV), and red cell survival were measured in 26 normal volunteers and 35 patients with various hepatic and/or hematologic disorders. The quantity of bilirubin derived from red blood cell degradation (BRRBC) was calculated from TRCV and the mean red cell life-span, and the difference between BRT and BRRBC, designated ""excess bilirubin synthesis (EBS),"" was considered to represent the quantity of bilirubin derived from the processes responsible for ELP. In normal volunteer subjects, EBS averaged 1.0 mg. per kilogram per day, and accounted for 25 per cent of daily bilirubin turnover. Hence, results derived by this approach exceeded the range estimated from analysis of ""early labeled peak"" data. Further analysis of the data in terms of a simple model of bilirubin sources was compatible with the hypothesis that EBS consists of an essentially constant component, averaging 0.8 mg. per kilogram per day, presumably derived principally from the liver, and a second component which varies with the erthropoietic rate. Hence, in normal man the liver may contribute the major fraction of EBS.","['Berk, P D', 'Blaschke, T F', 'Scharschmidt, B F', 'Waggoner, J G', 'Berlin, N I']","['Berk PD', 'Blaschke TF', 'Scharschmidt BF', 'Waggoner JG', 'Berlin NI']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,['RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Bilirubin/*biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Aging', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Gilbert Disease/metabolism', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Liver Cirrhosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Polycythemia Vera/metabolism', 'Spherocytosis, Hereditary/metabolism']",,1976/05/01 00:00,1976/05/01 00:01,['1976/05/01 00:00'],"['1976/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1976 May;87(5):767-80.,,,['0022-2143(76)90453-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These were increased substantially after the first week, reaching a maximum at 2 weeks, after which they decreased in number. Determination of the proportion of these CFU-S which were in DNA synthesis was carried out using the in vitro 3HTdR suicide technique. Within 4 hours of injection of the virus the number of spleen CFU-S which could be inactivated by in vitro 3HTdR exposure increased to 20.9% from a normal mean value of 10.2%. For the next 2 weeks the proportion of CFU-S responding to tritiated thymidine exposure remained at the same value of approximately 20%; the change in number of surviving CFU-S roughly paralleled the change in total colony forming cells. In the third week after virus injection, the proportion of CFU-S which was inactivated by 3HTdR decreased to the point where it could no longer be detected, even though the total number of CFU-S was elevated several fold over the normal. These findings indicate that infection with moderate dose levels of Rauscher virus does result in a measurable early increase in the proportion of cells in DNA synthesis. However, the failure to detect further substantial increases as the disease develops suggests that the virus of itself is not an initiator of all the steps of DNA synthesis. Rather, it would appear that it is to some degree dependent upon other aspects of normal DNA synthesis which remain under control of the cell.","['Okunewick, J P', 'Phillips, E L', 'Brozovich, B']","['Okunewick JP', 'Phillips EL', 'Brozovich B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Organ Size/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Radiation Effects', '*Rauscher Virus', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,1976/05/01 00:00,1976/05/01 00:01,['1976/05/01 00:00'],"['1976/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1976 May;4(3):143-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thymectomy (performed 1 week prior to the virus injection) decreased MuLV infection by all three parameters. However, administration of thymosin (500 mug, given in equal doses 2 days before and at the time of injection of virus) caused a marked increase of plasma titer of virus, as well as an increased number of spleen cells generating MuLV as compared to controls treated either with purified spleen fraction or with diluent (buffered salt solution). More than two doses of thymic extract (up to nine, given every 2 days after infection) had no further effect on plasma virus titer or number of splenic infectious centers. Furthermore, treatment of mice with either thymic or splenic extracts increased the incidence of virus related membrane antigen appearing on the surface of spleen cells, as compared to diluent-treated control animals.

On transplantation, hemopoietic stem cells from leukemic mice (L-CFU-S) will seed in the spleen and grow as discrete colonies, as will hemopoietic stem cells from normal mice (N-CFU-S). As the leukemic cells used in these experiments have 39 chromosomes and normal murine cells have 40, it has been possible to estimate the numbers of N-CFU-S and L-CFU-S in RFM mice at weekly intervals after these mice had been given i.v. injections of 10(6) leukemic spleen cells (spleen cells from preterminal leukemic mice). At each study time, splenic weights, peripheral blood counts, and nucleated cell counts and colony forming units (CFU-S) of marrow, spleen, and blood were assayed. The karyotypes of dividing cells from and the histology of the resultant spleen colonies were also studied. Two weeks after the injection of leukemic spleen cells, the number of CFU-S in the marrow had increased to 3 to 10 times normal, that in the spleen to 100 times normal, and that in the blood was markedly increased. Three weeks after injection, the number of CFU-S in the marrow fell from the peak level at 2 weeks, the number in the spleen rose modestly, and the number in the blood continued to be markedly increased. A normal distribution of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic colonies was obtained from CFU-S assayed 1 week after injection of leukemic spleen cells, but from CFU-S assayed 2 or 3 weeks after injection of leukemic spleen cells, the colonies formed were comprised almost exclusively of myeloid cells. From spleen colonies formed from marrow or spleen cells obtained 1 week after the injection of leukemic spleen cells, all karyotypes contained 40 chromosomes, whereas from spleen colonies formed from marrow or spleen cells obtained 2 or 3 weeks after injection of spleen cells, almost all karyotypes contained 39 chromosomes. In contrast, most of the karyotypes found in spleen colonies formed from the injection of blood cells even 3 weeks after injection of leukemic spleen cells contained 40 chromosomes. All colonies containing cells with 39 chromosomes, leukemic colonies, contained only myeloid cells. We conclude that L-CFU-S differentiate only into the myeloid series. Early in the course of the disease there is an increase in both N-CFU-S and L-CFU-S in the spleen and marrow. As the disease progresses, the numbers of N-CFU-S in both spleen and marrow decline and, during the final week of the illness, the number of L-CFU-S in the marrow declines. The CFU-S in the peripheral blood are predominantly of normal type, even late in the disease when N-CFU-S are rare in the spleen and marrow.","['Husseini, S', 'Fried, W', 'Knospe, W H', 'Trobaugh, F E Jr']","['Husseini S', 'Fried W', 'Knospe WH', 'Trobaugh FE Jr']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/etiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Organ Size', 'Spleen/pathology']",,1976/05/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1976/05/11 19:15'],"['1976/05/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1976/05/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 May;36(5):1784-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although pyran increased the titer of humoral cytotoxic antibody, levels of humoral factors capable of abrogating lymphocytoxicity were not enhanced. Furthermore, splenic lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, although slightly diminished in pyran-treated mice, was not significantly affected. Macrophages harvested from allograft-bearing animals exhibited marked tumoricidal activity, which was augmented by pyran treatment. This macrophage-associated activity was specific for MBL-2 cells and not attributable to cytotoxins elaborated into the culture medium. Pyran slightly activated macrophages from nonsensitized mice to become cytotoxic for MBL-2 cells; activation was not T-cell dependent. However, strikingly fewer macrophages infiltrated the allograft in pyran-treated animals as judged by both histopathology and direct measurement. The defect in the migration or deposit of macrophages at the allograft site may have contributed to tumor enhancement.","['Schultz, R M', 'Woods, W A', 'Mohr, S J', 'Chirigos, M A']","['Schultz RM', 'Woods WA', 'Mohr SJ', 'Chirigos MA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Polymers)', '27100-68-1 (Pyran Copolymer)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Formation', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Complement System Proteins/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Graft Rejection', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polymers/*pharmacology', 'Pyran Copolymer/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1976/05/01 00:00,1976/05/01 00:01,['1976/05/01 00:00'],"['1976/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 May;36(5):1641-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In advanced forms of cancer and chronic leucosis the number of cells is markedly reduced with simultaneous diminishing of their staining by specific histochemical methods. Such kinetics of changes of enterochromaffin cells appears to be related with definite antiblastic properties inherent to them and their products (melatonin and serotonin).","['Raikhlin, N T', 'Kvetnoi, I M']","['Raikhlin NT', 'Kvetnoi IM']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Vopr Onkol,Voprosy onkologii,0413775,"['333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,,"['Chromaffin System/*pathology', 'Enterochromaffin Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Melatonin/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Serotonin/metabolism']",,1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vopr Onkol. 1976;22(1):53-9.,,,,,Dinamika izmenenii enterokhromaffinnykh kletok pri opukholevom roste,,,,,,,,,,

Seven patients were abnormal: four exhibited hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction with suppression of circulating serum gonadotropins (less than 6 mlU per milliliter); three others had evidence of primary ovarian dysfunction - reversible in two - with inappropriately elevated circulating serum gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone greater than 20 mlU per milliliter). Normal sexual development correlated best with pubertal status at onset of leukemia; only one of 17 patients with diagnosis before puberty experienced altered pubertal progression, whereas abnormalities appeared in six of 18 with onset during puberty or after menarche. Thus, most girls with aggressively treated child-hood leukemia have an excellent prognosis for normal hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function; normal development is further enhanced in patients who are prepubertal at onset of leukemia.","['Siris, E S', 'Leventhal, B G', 'Vaitukaitis, J L']","['Siris ES', 'Leventhal BG', 'Vaitukaitis JL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gonadotropins, Pituitary)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Amenorrhea/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gonadotropins, Pituitary/blood', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiopathology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Menarche/drug effects', 'Ovary/physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis', '*Puberty/drug effects', '*Reproduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",,1976/05/20 00:00,1976/05/20 00:01,['1976/05/20 00:00'],"['1976/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1976/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1976 May 20;294(21):1143-6. doi: 10.1056/NEJM197605202942102.,,,['10.1056/NEJM197605202942102 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to prednisone therapy, his insulin requirement decreased, but the total and free insulin concentrations increased as insulin antibody measured as the maximal insulin-binding capacity of plasma remained unchanged. In insulin resistance, persistent hyperglycemia, in spite of high levels of immunoreactive free insulin, presumably reflects peripheral tissue unresponsiveness to insulin. The beneficial effect of prednisone treatment in this patient is discussed, and it is postulated to be the result of either increased availability of free insulin or an increased responsiveness of the tissues to insulin or both.","['Kansal, P C', 'Stroud, R M', 'Boshell, B R']","['Kansal PC', 'Stroud RM', 'Boshell BR']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Insulin Antibodies)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/administration & dosage/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Insulin Antibodies', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding']",,1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 1976 Apr;25(4):445-53. doi: 10.1016/0026-0495(76)90077-9.,,,"['0026-0495(76)90077-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0026-0495(76)90077-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of Ia alloantigens is associated with a loss in immunogenicity of tumor-associated transplantation antigens.,1067-81,"Five different lines of a strain 2 guinea pig leukemia (L2C) which had been carried in different laboratories share certain chromosomal markers and have a common surface immunoglobulin idiotypic determinant indicating that they have a common origin. All these leukemic lines have on their surface of the B alloantigen (equivalent of the murine H-2K and H-2D antigens) and four of these five lines have on their surface the Ia alloantigens normally present on the strain 2 lymphocytes. The result of a study of the growth and rejection patterns of these leukemias in inbred and random-bred guinea pigs of selected histocompatibility type indicates that both the B and Ia antigens can act as transplantation antigens in guinea pigs. Immunization protection tests in syngeneic animals demonstrated that the four Ia-positive leukemias possessed a tumor-associated transplantation antigen (TATA), while the one Ia-positive leukemias possessed a tumor-associated transplantation antigen (TATA), while the one Ia-negative leukemia by this criteria did not appear to have TATA. However, crisscross immunization protection tests demonstrated that preimmunization of syngeneic animals with an Ia-positive L2C line lead to a subsequent protection against challenge with the Ia-negative leukemia. Immunization with the Ia-negative line never protected against a subsequent challenge with any of the leukemic cells of L2C lines. These results strongly suggest that the Ia-negative leukemia possessed a TATA that can be recognized but is not itself immunogenic, and also indicate that Ia antigens on L2C cells are functionally associated with TATA and can act as immunological carries for tumor transplantation determinants.","['Forni, G', 'Shevach, E M', 'Green, I']","['Forni G', 'Shevach EM', 'Green I']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Allotypes)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Complement C3/metabolism', 'Guinea Pigs', '*Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin Allotypes', '*Isoantigens', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Drug']",PMC2190197,1976/05/01 00:00,1976/05/01 00:01,['1976/05/01 00:00'],"['1976/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1976 May 1;143(5):1067-81. doi: 10.1084/jem.143.5.1067.,,,['10.1084/jem.143.5.1067 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The sera have been used to characterize terminal transferase both by studying inhibition of enzyme activity and by developing a competition radioimmunoassay using highly purified 125I-labeled terminal transferase. By either assay, anti-terminal transferase serum did not cross-react significantly with calf DNA polymerases alpha and beta, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, or the reverse transcriptase of Moloney mouse leukemia virus. The calf terminal transferase did, however, share cross-reactive but not identical determinants with human and murine terminal transferase. The radioimmunoassay could detect as little as 2 ng of terminal transferase/mg of soluble protein in a tissue extract. Thymocytes were found to contain 280 ng of terminal transferase/mg of cell protein or about 1 X 10(5) molecules/cell; bone marrow had about 1% of the level of enzyme found in thymus. Extracts of spleen, peripheral white blood cells, lymph nodes, liver, muscle, and kidney all lacked detectable antigenicity of terminal transferase.

In all spleens the pulp cords were diffusely and compactly infiltrated by hairy cells. Numerous hairy cells were also evident in the often distended sinuses. The hairy projections were readily visible in electron micrographs and tended to interdigitate to form syncytium-like aggregates. Compression of hairy cells within the cords flattened the projections against the cell bodies and may account for the surface alterations reported by scanning electron microscopic studies. Controversy over the cytogenesis of hairy cells has not been resolved by ultrastructural studies. Although all seven patients had hypersplenism, the hairy cells showed no evidence of phagocytic activity. However, active phagocytosis by cordal macrophages was observed and there is a probable absolute increase in their number contributing to the splenomegaly. The dense infiltrate of hairy cells causes marked widening of the cords and retards the passage of formed elements of the blood through the red pulp. Prolonged sojourn of these elements in a metabolically unfavorable environment results in cellular damage, increased exposure to cordal macrophages, and premature destruction with the evolution of a hypersplenic syndrome.","['Burke, J S', 'Mackay, B', 'Rappaport, H']","['Burke JS', 'Mackay B', 'Rappaport H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Spleen/*ultrastructure', 'Splenomegaly/pathology']",,1976/05/01 00:00,1976/05/01 00:01,['1976/05/01 00:00'],"['1976/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1976 May;37(5):2267-74. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197605)37:5<2267::aid-cncr2820370517>3.0.co;2-1.,,,['10.1002/1097-0142(197605)37:5<2267::aid-cncr2820370517>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The concepts that human tumors elicit cell-mediated immune responses to tumor antigens are re-examined and modified; for example, cell-mediated immunity may be detectable only at certain stages of tumor growth. Introduction of more sensitive methods for detecting antibodies is providing additional evidence for humoral immune responses to tumor-associated antigens. The present proliminary approaches to immunotherapy, particularly the use of adjuvants such as BCG and Corynebacterium parvum, are assessed, and initial pharmacoimmunologic findings with these agents are reported. The field of tumor immunology is in a dynamic state of development, with input from many areas of immunology and oncology.

Three mechanical devices for preparing blood smears were compared to the traditional coverslip and manual wedge methods. A series of five slides was prepared from each sample of blood. One hundred-cell leukocyte differential counts, red cell morphology, and platelet distribution were compared. Differential counts along the axis and margins of each slide failed to reveal any significant distribution difference by method. On the other hand, there were a significantly fewer neutrophils as well as higher lymphocyte counts on the two spinner preparations. Subsequent analysis suggested that spinner preparations create more smudge cells in smears of normal and granulocytic leukemia patients, and significantly fewer smudge cells in smears of lymphocytic leukemia patients. Both spinner methods produced significant increases in erythrocytic target cells, spherocytes, and cells with shifted pallor; and significantly fewer burr cells and ovalocytes, as compared to the reference methods. The mechanical wedge device was most similar to both reference methods. Of the two reference methods, the cumbersome coverslip preparation apparently offers no practical advantage over wedge methods.","['Wenk, R E']",['Wenk RE'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med Technol,The American journal of medical technology,0370505,,IM,,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Anemia/diagnosis', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/diagnosis', 'Blood Cell Count/*methods', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal', 'Humans', 'Infections/diagnosis', 'Leukemia/diagnosis']",,1976/03/01 00:00,1976/03/01 00:01,['1976/03/01 00:00'],"['1976/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med Technol. 1976 Mar;42(3):71-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remission and survival--a prospective study.,90-100,"This is a prospective multi-center study in which patients with aregenerative anaemia were treated with a standardized high dosage regime of an anabolic steroid (oxymetholone, Anasteron). 53 patients were included and divided into two groups according to bone marrow cellularity. Furthermore the hypocellular group was subdivided in order to make comparison with earlier studies possible. In the hypocellular group, the frequency of remission was 56% and the 2-year-survival from the onset of symptoms was 75%. This is longer than in some earlier studies, perhaps because of possible differences in etiology and/or because of the effect of systematic high dosage, long term androgen therapy. Patient selection was minimized and was not considered to be of major importance. Patients with hypercellular marrows, on the other hand, responded poorly to androgens. In this group 63% died of acute leukaemia, which confirms earlier suggestions that this form of aregenerative anaemia, frequently is of a preleukaemic nature.","['Hast, R', 'Skarberg, K O', 'Engstedt, L', 'Jameson, S', 'Killander, A', 'Lundh, B', 'Reizenstein, P', 'Uden, A M', 'Wadman, B']","['Hast R', 'Skarberg KO', 'Engstedt L', 'Jameson S', 'Killander A', 'Lundh B', 'Reizenstein P', 'Uden AM', 'Wadman B']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,['L76T0ZCA8K (Oxymetholone)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/mortality', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxymetholone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Sweden', 'Time Factors']",,1976/02/01 00:00,1976/02/01 00:01,['1976/02/01 00:00'],"['1976/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1976 Feb;16(2):90-100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antisera from the regressors potentiated the activity of regressor lymphocytes from the same animals. Also, antisera from tumor bearers, 15 days after virus injection, induced cytotoxicity by the animals' autochthonous lymphocytes which, by themselves, were not cytotoxic.

Specificity controls indicated that both antibody and lymphocytes were required for the induction of cytotoxicity against the target cells in vitro. Normal sera placed on the target cells in the same concentrations induced no cytotoxicity by the immune lymphocytes, and immune sera alone placed on the target cells caused no cytotoxicity.

Denaturation of deoxyribonucleic acid.,49-58,"Thermal denaturation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in situ in individual unbroken cells is studied by a cytofluorometric method. This method allows us to investigate DNA denaturation in the presence of divalent cations at concentrations reported to be necessary to maintain native structure of nuclear chromatin. Under these conditions the pattern of DNA denaturation is very different than when studied in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate or citrate. The results suggest that with divalent cations present, the histone basic charges are more uniformly distributed along whole nuclear DNA. Various cell types exhibit great differences in sensitivity to DNA denaturation when assayed in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2. Human lymphocytes, monocytes and certain kinds of human leukemic cells show differences large enough to be used as a parameter for their recognition in mixed samples. Possible applications of the method in basic research on chromatin conformation and as a tool for cell recognition in diagnostic cytology or in the classification of human leukemia are proposed.","['Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Traganos, F', 'Arlin, Z A', 'Sharpless, A T', 'Melamed, M R']","['Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Traganos F', 'Arlin ZA', 'Sharpless AT', 'Melamed MR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Citrates)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Citrates', '*DNA', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/analysis', 'Lymphocytes/analysis', 'Magnesium', 'Monocytes/analysis', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Rats', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods', 'Thymus Gland/analysis']",,1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1976 Jan;24(1):49-58. doi: 10.1177/24.1.1254935.,,,['10.1177/24.1.1254935 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The specificity of the stain for deoxyribonucleic acid is discussed on the basis of data obtained by cell treatment with nucleases. Evidence is presented that in the case of Friend leukemia cells, but not phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes, a significant change in the number of AO-intercalating sites in DNA occurrs during differentiation. These results suggest that changes in nuclear chromatin occurring during cell differentiation may be correlated, in some but not all systems, with changes in accessibility of DNA in situ to intercalating dyes. The role of divalent cations, especially Mg2+, in the conformation of nuclear chromatin and in modulation of the accessibility of nucleic acids to AO is discussed.

Two model systems: Friend virus-transformed cells and Hydra attenuata.,332-47,"The automated high-speed analysis and separation of cells on the basis of spectroscopic parameters has been applied to studies of cellular differentiation in two systems. The temporal changes following induction of differentiation by dimethylsulfoxide in the Friend virus-transformed erythroid cells were quantitated by multiparameter analysis leading to the separation of discrete subpopulations. Thus, following induction, cell size decreased as measured by light scattering, the number of H-2 histocompatibility antigen sites decreased as measured by indirect fluorescent antibody binding, the number of lectin-binding sites per cell increased as measured by fluorescein-labeled concanavalin-A and the microviscosity of the hydrocarbon region of the plasma membrane increased as determined by the fluorescence emission anisotropy of the membrane probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Cells were separated on the basis of several of these parameters and analyzed for their hemogloglobin content by benzidine staining. Examination of cells separated according to the anisotropy parameter showed that high anisotropy values were correlated with (a) small cell size, (b) positive staining with benzidine and (c) pronounced reactivity with fluorescent antibody to the erythrocyte protein spectrin. Disaggregated cells from Hydra attenuata were selectively stained with the dyes rhodanile blue, 7-(p-methoxybenzylamino)-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole and fluorescamine. Distribution analyses and preliminary separations indicated the feasibility of obtaining homogeneous classes of cell types in a viable state. The experiments with emission anisotropy represent the first analyses and separations of single cells on the basis of fluorescence polarization.

Application of grain counters to cell biology is limited, however, primarily due to shortage of methods allowing the interpretation of grain counts on a molecular basis. Two suitable methods of quantitative autoradiography at the cellular level are reviewed, developed for the isotopes 14C and 125 I. They permit evaluation of absolute radioactivity in autoradiographs and, thus, determination of synthesis processes such as deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, and of antigen densities on cell surfaces. In this approach towards quantitative autoradiography, grain densities are compared photometrically over labeled cells and over a standard source on the same autoradiograph. Allowance has to be made for the specific geometric factors of the isotope used. This can be advantageously done with an integrating type of measurement using incident light bright-field. With this type of recording, there is an exponential dependence of the photometric values on the radioactive dose. As an example of application, results are presented of the deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis rate of human myelocytes in aplastic anemia and of the immunoglobulin G density on lymphocyte membranes in the normal state and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Dormer, P', 'Thiel, E']","['Dormer P', 'Thiel E']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography/*methods', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/analysis/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/analysis/cytology', 'Microscopy/methods', 'Photometry/methods', 'Rats']",,1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1976 Jan;24(1):145-51. doi: 10.1177/24.1.1254911.,,,['10.1177/24.1.1254911 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The degree of reactivity of MSV 14 spleen cells was quite variable; stimulation indices ranged from 2.2 to 9.4. Activity in the MLTI appeared to a great extent to be dependent on T-lymphocytes. A relatively broad spectrum of specificity was demonstrated in experiments using additional stimulating cells besides RBL-5. The kinetics of the MLTI correlated well with the kinetics of the primary cytotoxic response in the CRA against RBL-5 cells. However, positive results in the in vivo and in vitro secondary cytotoxicity assays could be detected between 21 and 100 days after MSV injection when the MLTI was negative. Transplantation resistance against challenge with RBL-5 tumor cells also persists for a long time after MSV inoculation.

According to the same plan and on the same days in Little Rock, Ark., and Minneapolis, Minn., nine groups of 20 mice each received four courses of ara-C treatment, with 4-day intervals between them beginning February 7, 1973. In each course, a total dose of 240 mg/kg was divided among eight separate injections administered at 3-hr intervals. One group of mice received equal doses of ara-C every 3 hr (the homeostatic schedule). The eight other groups in each location received the same total dose per course but in gradually increasing and decreasing doses (the sinusoidal schedule). The timing of the highest doses on the latter schedule differed among the eight groups (by integer multiples of 3 hr). As predicted from earlier work, survival times after treatment with ara-C on different sinusoidal schedules differed drastically. However, the timing of the sinusoidal schedules yielding the longest survival was similar in the two locations. The survival times from all sinusoidal treatments from a given location were fitted by a 24-hr cosine curve. The timing of the rhythm in tolerance as a whole as thereby computed as the lag from local midnight of the peak in the cosine curve best fitting all data. The timing of this tolerance rhythm (briefly, circadian chronotolerance), computed separately for data from Arkansas and Minnesota, agreed within 1 hr. There also was close agreement in the results obtained by the 2 laboratories in mean survival time; the percentage of survivors when mice were treated according to certain of the selected sinusoidal schedules was much greater than for mice treated on the homeostatic schedule. This large and reproducible difference in tolerance and the similar timing of the overall fitted function describing chronotolerance in the hands of different investigators underlines the urgency of testing potential benefits from timed clinical treatment.","['Scheving, L E', 'Haus, E', 'Kuhl, J F', 'Pauly, J E', 'Halberg, F', 'Cardoso, S']","['Scheving LE', 'Haus E', 'Kuhl JF', 'Pauly JE', 'Halberg F', 'Cardoso S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,,"['Animals', '*Circadian Rhythm', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",,1976/03/01 00:00,1976/03/01 00:01,['1976/03/01 00:00'],"['1976/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 Mar;36(3):1133-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the latent herpesvirus is generally age and strain dependent as is the development of spontaneous guinea pig leukemia. Following special laboratory manipulation, expression of both virus types was accomplished in vitro. Studies of the role played by these two virus types in the development of neoplastic disease in guinea pigs revealed that, in the presence of the endogenous oncornavirus, a superinfection with herpesvirus led to the development of self-limited lymphoproliferative changes. Together with the studies reported by other investigators, it appears that interaction between the DNA and RNA viruses may play an important role in the natural occurrence of viral oncogenesis.

This might be because the disease has a long and variable latent period, in which case the usual statistical tests for such clustering are inappropriate. A new statistical method is described which allows for such latent periods. For each patient, periods of ""susceptibility"" and ""infectivity"" are defined in which it is assumed he respectively ""caught"" and could ""transmit"" the disease. The measure of clustering is taken as the number of patients who were in the ""right"" place at the ""right"" time to ""catch"" the disease from another patient. This test is applied to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (death before age 6) in Greater London in the period 1952-65. Cases are postulated to be ""susceptible"" at various times before clinical onset of leukaemia, including in utero, and ""infective"" at various times around onset. Their effective ""contacts"" at these times are defined as circles of radius up to 4 km around their places of residence at these times. Slight evidence of clustering was found associated with certain of the defined times and distances, but the degree of clustering was small and could reasonably be attributed to chance. It is suggested, however, that this method of analysis might usefully be applied to other sets of such data. No evidence was found to add to our previously reported finding of space-time clustering of the dates and places of birth of children with leukaemia.","['Smith, P G', 'Pike, M C', 'Till, M M', 'Hardisty, R M']","['Smith PG', 'Pike MC', 'Till MM', 'Hardisty RM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'London', 'Male', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Time Factors']",PMC2024925,1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1976 Jan;33(1):1-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1976.1.,,,['10.1038/bjc.1976.1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In a study group of 19 women and seven men, the majority of whom were in the seventh to eighth decades of life, most frequent symptoms were crampy abdominal pain and abdominal distention associated with bloody diarrhea. Ischemic colitis occurred with increased colonic intraluminal pressure, generalized decreased vascular flow and embolic phenomenon. The predominating predisposing causes were atherosclerosis, shock and congestive heart failure as well as leukemia. The results of barium enema studies showed a pathognomonic condition that included thumbprinting, mucosal ulcerations and sacculations.

As the result of many different series, the development of postpolycythemic myeolid metaplasia might be expected in from 15%-20% of patients with postpolycythemia vera. It appears that an etiologic role for sodium phosphate 32P may exist in this evolutionary pattern. About 70% of patients with PPMM will have symptoms with the onset of the syndrome. The major mechanisms producing symptoms result from (1) anemia, (2) pressure from massive splenomegaly, and (3) bleeding problems. Iron deficiency is a frequent cause of anemia in patients with PPMM. The major mechanism of anemia in these patients, however, relates to ineffective erythropoiesis and shortened red cell survival. Androgen trials for ineffective erythropoiesis seem worthwhile, although data on this point is too limited to draw any firm conclusions. A steroid trial for those patients with major hemolytic episodes is indicated. In those patients in whom adrenal steroid therapy fails to control major hemolysis, a consideration for splenectomy exists. Pressure-related manifestations secondary to massive splenomegaly have been treated with radiation therapy and oral alkylators. Although there is data to document amelioration of painful symptoms with associated shrinking of the spleen, long-term control of this problem has not been forthcoming. Again, patients who are medical failures in control of pressure-related manifestations may be considered for splenectomy. Bleeding problems may arise with PPMM secondary to thrombocytopenia, thrombocythemia, or qualitative platelet dysfunction. Adrenal steroids have met with some success in improving platelet counts in patients with life-threatening thrombocytopenia. Those patients who are medical failures with adrenal steroids in terms of thrombocytopenia might be candidates for splenectomy. Control of thrombocythemia has been observed with oral alkylator therapy and chlorambucil may have a special role in managing this complication. Qualitative platelet defects leading to severe bleeding are best managed with fresh platelet transfusions. Patients with PPMM in contrast to patients with agnogenic myeoloid metaplasia have a more lethal syndrome and shortened survivorship. Causes of death in patients with PPMM include cardiac problems, transition to acute leukemia, hemorrhage, and infection.","['Silverstein, M N']",['Silverstein MN'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,,"['Anemia/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/adverse effects', 'Polycythemia Vera/*therapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Splenomegaly/therapy']",,1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1976 Jan;13(1):79-84.,,,['0037-1963(76)90037-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Apart from the observations of the clinical reactions the chief purpose of the examination was to establish the height of the antibodies achieved, how long they persisted and whether the primary vaccination with split-vaccine had any influence on the level and persistance of antibodies. The results following the combined vaccination were compared with those following with Schwarz-strain alone, whereby no significant differences appeared. The serological follow-up examinations were made after a month, a year, after 3 and finally after 7 years. Whilst in the first year the combined vaccinated children showed an average higher titre, the average antibody titre following single live vaccination were somewhat higher after 7 years and showed a lesser degree of scatter. The values of antibody titres are impart so high that one has to assume a silent booster effect since none of the examined children were taken ill with measles. The single live vaccination by means of Schwarz-vaccine has thus been proved outstanding, is to be regarded as the general method of choice and should be applied as widely as possible since the morbidity risk of measles is considerably high and vaccination is not dangereous. The use of split-vaccine is indicated only with chronically ill children for instance with leukaemia, mucoviscidosis etc. and in infants in the first year of life, if one wants to protect them against measles. If we reach our aim of through-vaccination of the population against measles, infants will no longer be in danger and a prevaccination in the first year of life will not be indicated.","['Huber, E G', 'Rannon, L', 'Galffy, G']","['Huber EG', 'Rannon L', 'Galffy G']",,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Padiatr Padol,Padiatrie und Padologie,0022370,['0 (Measles Vaccine)'],IM,,"['Austria', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystic Fibrosis/complications', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Measles/*prevention & control', 'Measles Vaccine/administration & dosage', 'Pediatrics', 'Time Factors', 'Vaccination/methods']",,1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Padiatr Padol. 1976;11(1):72-6.,,,,,Langzeitstudie nach Masernimpfung,,,,,,,,,,

Untreated cells on the one hand, have a limited capacity for spontaneous differentiation. On the other hand, dimethylsulfoxide(DMSO)-treated cells showed an increase in the activities of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase, ALA dehydratase, uroporphyrinogen-I synthetase, ferrochelatase, and heme concentration by days 1, 1.5, 2, and 4, respectively. The increase of the heme pathway enzymes and heme concentration followed the order of these enzymes or products as they are arranged in the heme biosynthetic pathway. These changes induced by DMSO were effectively inhibited by treatment with actinomycin D, suggesting that continued RNA synthesis is required for the differentiation process. 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (10(-5) M) inhibited the DMSO-induced changes of the heme pathway enzymes. BrdU was most effective when it was present during the first 2 days of cell culture. It gradually lost its inhibitory effect when added after the 3rd day or later. The BrdU-mediated inhibition was completely overcome by the addition of thymidine (7 x 10(-5) M), but not by uridine (7 x 10(-5) M). All these data suggest that a sequential induction of the heme pathway enzyme takes place during erythroid differentiation of Friend leukemia cells, and that the sequential induction of the enzymes may be due to a sequential activation of genes coding for these enzyme activities.","['Sassa, S']",['Sassa S'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)', 'EC 2.5.1.61 (Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase)', 'EC 4.- (Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.1.- (Hydro-Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.1.24 (Porphobilinogen Synthase)', 'EC 4.3.1.- (Ammonia-Lyases)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/*biosynthesis', 'Ammonia-Lyases/*biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Erythrocytes/*enzymology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genes', 'Heme/*biosynthesis', 'Hydro-Lyases/*biosynthesis', 'Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Lyases/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Porphobilinogen Synthase/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",PMC2190112,1976/02/01 00:00,1976/02/01 00:01,['1976/02/01 00:00'],"['1976/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1976 Feb 1;143(2):305-15. doi: 10.1084/jem.143.2.305.,,,['10.1084/jem.143.2.305 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The occurrence of IPE in young immunosuppressed C58 mice was systematically analyzed. When mice less than 2 weeks old were x-irradiated with 600 R, IPE could not be induced. The incidence in 1-month-old mice was approximately 50% and increased progressively with the age except for a drop in incidence at 3 months. An analysis of the dose effects of x-irradiation on the occurrence of IPE in mice of different ages revealed a marked increase in the incidence in 3- and 5-month-old mice beginning at dose levels of 450 R and 300 R, respectively. Considered together, these data indicated that two subpopulations of immunocytes differing in x-ray sensitivity interacted to protect mice from IPE. It appears that under natural conditions an x-ray sensitive cell population, possibly having suppressor function, decreased with age and made mice susceptible ot induction of IPE. Five-month-old mice were immunosuppressed with an LD10 of cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, or methotrexate to determine whether mice immunosuppressed with drugs also were susceptible to the induction of IPE. The incidence was 89%, 13%, and 5%, respectively. The mouse strain specificity of IPE induction also was studied. In 6- to 8-month-old mice suppressed with 600 R, IPE could not be induced in non-H-2k strains: BALB, C57BL/6, NZB. Of the H-2K strains tested (CBA/J, C3H/He, AKR/J, C58), the disease could be induced only in the C58 and AKR/J strains. Histopathologic studies showed that CNS lesions in immunosuppressed C58 and AKR/J mice did not differ significantly from those in old C58 mice with IPE. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that IPE can be used as a model for analyzing age-dependent diseases of suspected immunopathologic etiology.","['Duffey, P S', 'Martinez, D', 'Abrams, G D', 'Murphy, W H']","['Duffey PS', 'Martinez D', 'Abrams GD', 'Murphy WH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Dosage Forms)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,,"['Aging/radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Dosage Forms', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Encephalomyelitis/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Immunization', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Leukemia, Experimental', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Radiation Effects', 'Species Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'X-Rays']",,1976/02/01 00:00,1976/02/01 00:01,['1976/02/01 00:00'],"['1976/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1976 Feb;116(2):475-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyacrylamide gel analysis of the surface IgE receptor from normal rat mast cells and from rat basophilic leukemia cells.,319-26,"Purified rat peritoneal mast cells (RMC) and cultured rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were surface labeled with 125I by using lactoperoxidase, incubated with unlabeled rat monoclonal IgE and subjected to solubilization by treatment with Nonidet P-40 (NP-40). With both cell types significant amounts of radioiodinated material could be specifically precipitated by a ""sandwich"" system consisting of rabbit anti-rat epsilon-chain and goat anti-rabbit Ig. The precipitates were dissociated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and urea and subsequently analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. With RMC three radioactive bands were seen. One corresponded to IgE present on the RMC at the time of isolation. A small band migrating in the region of light chain was seen with both sepcific (anti-IgE) and control precipitates. It showed no demonstrable relationship to IgE. The major radioactive band corresponded to a m.w. of 62,000. This band was dependent upon the presence of IgE and was not found when non-IgE binding control cells were used. With RBL cells, only the IgE-dependent 62,000 dalton peak was present. Saturation of the IgE receptor sites of the RMC or RBL cells before lactoperoxidase labeling almost totally eliminated this radioactive band, indicating that cell-bound IgE rendered this membrane component inaccessible to the radiolabel. These results strongly suggest that this cellular component is identical, at least in part, with the target cell surface receptor for reaginic antibody. The data also further support the hypothesis that the neoplastic RBL cells have a normal surface receptor for IgE.","['Conrad, D H', 'Froese, A']","['Conrad DH', 'Froese A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Basophils', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin E/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Solubility']",,1976/02/01 00:00,1976/02/01 00:01,['1976/02/01 00:00'],"['1976/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1976 Feb;116(2):319-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment of hosts with antilymphocyte serum (ATS) increased the number of tumor colonies. Pretreatment with formalinized FV-infected cells had the opposite effect, and ATS diminished the inhibitory effect of preimmunization. Cell suspensions from 11 individual FV-infected donors were examined. The suspensions differed with respect to their behavior on transplantation into untreated and ATS-pretreated F1 hybrid hosts. With several suspensions, the number of tumor colonies produced was approximately proportional to the number of cells injected; in all of these, ATS increased the slope of the line relating colony number to cell number. With most of the suspensions, tumor colony-forming efficiencies in untreated hosts strikingly decreased with increasing number of cells injected; ATS induced an increase in the number of tumor colonies and rendered the colony-forming response more nearly proportional to cell number. With two suspensions, few or no colonies developed; pretreatment with ATS had no significant effect. When the 11 cell suspensions were considered together, a proportional relation was found between the magnitude of the ATS effect (i.e., colony number in the presence of ATS minus colony number in the absence of ATS) and the colony-forming efficiency in ATS-treated mice. The ATS effect on the average was equivalent to a 2-fold increase in tumor colony-forming efficiency. We interpret these findings to indicate that two factors interact to determine the number of tumor colonies produced by spleen cells from FV-infected C3H donors in untreated F1 hybrid hosts.

The other is a property of the tumor colony-forming units-host interrelationship and includes the vulnerability of tumor colony-forming units to the host immune response elicited by the injected cells; this factor appears to be constant with different cell suspensions.

Here the L1210/DIC and L5178Y/DIC susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of allogeneic and xenogeneic lymphocytes and sera obtained from animals sensitized to DBA/2 histocompatibility antigens were studied. The original and the DIC tumors showed the same sensitivity to anti-DBA/2 cellular and humoral cytotoxicity. The immune response electied in allogeneic mice by the original and DIC sublines was evaluated by in vitro cell-mediated and humoral cytotoxic assay. Beyond the immune response to histocompatibility antigens, a specific, anti-DIC-antigen immunoreaction was not found. Inhibition assay of the cell-mediated cytotoxicity and absorption of the humoral cytotoxicity demonstrated that DIC-induced antigens are not reciprocally related in cell-surface concentration to the natural DBA/2 histocompatibility antigens associated with tumor cells of DIC lines. An experiment was conducted in which specific activity against the DIC-treated L5178Y/DIC cells was observed with anti-L5178Y/DIC rabbit immune serum absorbed with the parental L5178Y lymphoma.

Heterozygotes for the gene for A-T are thought to comprise about 1% of the general population and, therefore, it is important to know whether this gene also predisposes the heterozygous carrier to cancers. Heterozygous carriers of this gene are common among the close relatives of patients with A-T, although individual carriers cannot be identified by any clinical criterion or laboratory test. For this reason, we compared the incidence of death from malignant neoplasms in 2 families of patients with A-T to that expected in a random sample of the general population. There were 59 deaths from malignant neoplasms in relatives dying before age 75, compared to 42.6 expected (p less than 0.02). For A-T heterozygotes younger than age 45, the risk of dying from a malignant neoplasm was estimated to be greater than 5 times the risk for the general population. A-T heterozygotes may comprise more than 5% of all persons dying from a cancer before age 45. The incidence of ovarian, gastric, and biliary system carcinomas and of leukemia and lymphoma was increased in these A-T families. Other neoplasms that may be associated with this gene in heterozygotes include pancreatic, basal cell, colonic, breast, and cervical carcinomas.","['Swift, M', 'Sholman, L', 'Perry, M', 'Chase, C']","['Swift M', 'Sholman L', 'Perry M', 'Chase C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*complications/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/complications/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Risk']",,1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 Jan;36(1):209-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloblasts and monoblasts].,115-30,"The myeloblast is nearly of the same size as the lymphozyte and has the same nucleus cytoplasma ratio of 0.7 but differs from it in its morphology, its high frequency of multiplication, and by its kinetic behaviour. By phase contrast observation the transformation of the myeloblast into the promyelocyte has been seen several times. The myeloblast like the lymphocyte is able to move although at a much slower speed. By locomotion the myeloblast, and likewise the lymphocyte can move between blood and bone marrow. Of the granulocytopoietic series only the promyelocyte and the myelocyte with their nuclear cytoplasm relation of 0.3 are found in the bone marrow. The monoblast but is about twice its size, and moves less often. Apart from its transformation into promonocyte, monocyte and histiocyte, the monoblast may evalue in another way: it grows into a cell of doubled size with the same nucleus cytoplasm ratio 0.7 in whose cytoplasm are seen a lot of big granules. The cell may now be characterized as a tissue macrophage or mastcell. In consequence a frequently multiplying basophilic cell with a coarse nuclear structure and nucleoli, grows from a diameter of 6.5 to one of 13.0 mum without marked morphologic change apart from becoming alpha-NA-Esterase positive and acquiring big lysosomes. When this haemocytoblast is small (K 1/4 to K 1/2), it can be triggered into the granulocytopoietic series, when it is bigger (K 1/2 to K1) into the monocytopoietic series, or in the size K1 to K2 by erythropoietin into the erythropoietic series. If no triggering takes place, the cell degenerates after having granulated. The lymphopoietic system is not connected to this system of stem cells committed to the granulocytopoietic, the monocytopoietic and the erythropoietic series. Therefore we postulate a dual haematopoietic system. In acute leukemias the spread of size of cells and nuclei is wider and kinetically active stem cells are rarer. Only leukemic promyelocytes are in locomotion vividly, in contrast to the normal ones. In leukemic myeloblasts there are fewer mitoses than in normal ones, but in leukemic promyelocytes and monoblasts the mitotic frequency is not reduced.","['Boll, I']",['Boll I'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Mitosis', 'Monocytes/*physiology']",,1976/02/01 00:00,1976/02/01 00:01,['1976/02/01 00:00'],"['1976/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1976 Feb;32(2):115-30. doi: 10.1007/BF00995938.,,,['10.1007/BF00995938 [doi]'],,Morphologische Phasenkontrast-kinematographische Studien zum Verhalten von Knochenmarkzellen in vitro,,,,,,,,,,

Leukostasis precedes formation of the nodule. Both lesions may be found in any part of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, but are most numerous in the diencephalon and rostral brain-stem. Ultrastructural studies demonstrate that parenchymal leukostasis develops chiefly within capillaries, and is associated with endothelial cell degeneration and necrosis. Fibrin deposits are not seen within affected capillaries. The sequence of development, pathologic and hematologic characteristics of leukostasiss and leukemic nodules in human and L2C/NB leukemia are virtually identical.

An abnormal urinary excretion of some metabolites of tryptophan's kynurenine pathway is frequent but not constant in all the neoplasias of the myelolymphopoietic system studied so far. In Hodgkin's disease the correlative test between urinary excretion of tryptophan metabolites and clinical stage, histological type and treatment enabled us to point out that the anatomo-clinical diffusion of the lymphoma interferes only through kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine excretion. The histological type seems to influence the 3-hydroxykynurenine excretion. On the contrary, the metabolic alterations present are not affected by treatment. We believe that the metabolic alteration of tryptophan is secondary to a deficit of pyridoxal phosphate and nicotinamide-dependent enzyme activities.","['Mauri, C', 'Coppini, D', 'Silingardi, V', 'Plessi, M']","['Mauri C', 'Coppini D', 'Silingardi V', 'Plessi M']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Acta Vitaminol Enzymol,Acta vitaminologica et enzymologica,0135063,"['343-65-7 (Kynurenine)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,,"['Hematologic Diseases/*urine', 'Hodgkin Disease/*urine', 'Humans', 'Kynurenine/urine', 'Leukemia/*urine', 'Lymphoma/*urine', 'Tryptophan/*urine']",,1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Vitaminol Enzymol. 1975;29(1-6):132-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall results were excellent or good in 50% of the patients. There was a significant correlation between the efficacy of the different substances and the rate of side effects. Azathioprine was best tolerated, but gave only medium results whereas procarbazine, as a very potent drug, had the highest rate of side effects (especially depression of bone marrow, infections, gastrointestinal manifestations etc.). Serious immediate side effects of the immunosuppressive therapy according to our experience and in literature are infections and leucopenia, whereas the most important late risk is the possibility of an occurrence of malignancy. In our series, which had been followed up to five years, no malignancies have been thus far detected. Also, in the literature, there are only very few patients with malignancies published.

Tumour infiltration of extralymphatic sites such as the liver and bone marrow is identifiable with particular frequency in those cases presenting with lymph node manifestations of disease. Even in the absence of detectable extralymphatic dissemination, the lymphatic involvement is often sufficiently diffuse to mitigate against extensive lymph node irradiation ""a la Hodgkin's disease"" as appropriate or technically feasible form of treatment. Rather, systemic treatment must be recognized as imperative for the majority of newly diagnosed patients and we have investigated ""systemic"" radiotherapy as an alternative to chemotherapy during the past decade. Our experience with 57 consecutive patients with lymphocytic lymphoma has been reviewed. Total body irradiation (TBI) has been found to yield high remission rates despite a lack of serious toxicity or constitutional reactions. Rigorous diagnostic staging was not employed but despite the advanced stage of disease which was clinically obvious in most cases, survival rates have been strikingly high. Actuarially calculated 5-year survival rates for the well differentiated (diffuse and nodular combined), nodular poorly differentiated and diffuse poorly differentiated subtypes are 85%, 69% and 51% respectively. Furthermore, initial management with radio-therapy as described has not negated with effective use of subsequent chemotherapy when selectively required.","['Johnson, R E']",['Johnson RE'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer Suppl,The British journal of cancer.

Nitroanilines].,681-708,"More than 200 nitro compounds, most of them nitroaniline derivatives substituted with one or more radicals having a basic reaction, were prepared and investigated as to their therapeutic activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, viruses and tumors. Several mono-nitrobenzenes with a radical having a basic reaction showed weak in-vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria and against Crocker's sarcoma 180; they also showed systemic activity against nematodes (Aspiculuris tetraptera) and viruses. The majority of therapeutically active compounds with pronounced in-vivo activity against Trichomonas fetus, Entamoeba histolytica, Schistosoma mansoni, cestodes, nematodes (Ancylostoma caninum), viruses (influenza, MHV, SAV and EMC) and various types of carcinoma (Ehrlich's carcinoma, leukemia 1210, Crocker's sarcoma 180) were dinitrobenzene derivatives with one radical having a basic reaction and electropositive groups or unreactive or reactive chlorine atom, and di-nitrobenzene with two equal or two different radicals having a basic reaction. Compound No. 70 revealed a marked in-vitro activity against fungi (Trichophyton; Microsporum, Candida albicans). Other nitro compounds such as bis-mono- and bis-dinitrobenzene derivatives likewise showed a systemic action against E. histolytica, viruses and, in particular, carcinoma (Crocker's sarcoma 180, Ridgway's osteosarcoma). Oxygen and sulfur analogue compounds as well as compounds produced by reduction also possessed a distinct activity against E. histolytica and viruses. On the basis of the present results particularly the dinitrobenzenes substituted with two radicals having a basic reaction include a number which have in common that a structure/activity relationship is recognizable in respect of E. histolytica, Schistosoma mansoni and different types of viruses. The activity against viruses in this class of compounds is probably due to an increased interferon production in the host animal. Whether the mechanism of action is the same against E. histolytica or Schistosoma mansoni has not been determined so far. A tumorigenic effect was observed mainly in those di-nitrobenzenes which are classed as alkylating compounds. Because of the small chemotherapeutic index the trials were not continued with the most effective compounds mentioned.","['Winkelmann, V E', 'Raether, W', 'Dittmar, W', 'Duwel, D', 'Gericke, D', 'Hohorst, W', 'Rolly, H', 'Schrinner, W', 'Wagner, W H']","['Winkelmann VE', 'Raether W', 'Dittmar W', 'Duwel D', 'Gericke D', 'Hohorst W', 'Rolly H', 'Schrinner W', 'Wagner WH']",,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Arzneimittelforschung,Arzneimittel-Forschung,0372660,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Nitro Compounds)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)']",IM,,"['Aniline Compounds/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/drug therapy', 'Helminthiasis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mycoses/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Nitro Compounds/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Nitrobenzenes/chemical synthesis', 'Protozoan Infections/drug therapy', 'Virus Diseases/drug therapy']",,1975/05/01 00:00,1975/05/01 00:01,['1975/05/01 00:00'],"['1975/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arzneimittelforschung. 1975 May;25(5):681-708.,,,,,Cehmotherapeutisch wirksame Nitroverbindungen 1.

The transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, alanine, and N-methylated-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid have been studied in the erythroblastic leukemic cell, the reticulocyte, and the erythrocyte of the Long-Evans rat. The dependence of amino acid transport on extracellular sodium concentration was investigated. Erythrocytes were found to transport these amino acids only by Na-independent systems. The steady state distribution ratio was less than 1. Reticulocytes were found to transport alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and alanine by Na-dependent systems, but only small amounts of N-methylated-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. Small amounts of these amino acids were transported by Na-independent systems. The steady state distribution ratio was greater than one for Na-dependent transport. The erythroblastic leukemia cell, a model immature erythroid cell, showed marked Na-dependence (greater than 90%) for alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and alanine transport, and greater than 80% for the Na-dependent transport of N-methyl-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. The steady state distribution ratio for the Na-dependent transport was greater than 4.

However, interferon is produced in these cells in amounts comparable to that in L-929 cells when interferon induction is initiated with UV-inactivated Newcastle disease virus. Conversely poly(I)-poly(C), a potent interferon inducer in L-929 cells, proved ineffective in this capacity in F4 or B8 cells. When erythropoietic differentiation is induced in these cells by dimethyl sulfoxide, no autogenous interferon production occurs, but with NDV-induction a four- to fivefode increase of interferon production is observed. A similar elevation of interferon production is achieved during 5-bromodeoxyuridine stimulation of differentiation in the thymidine kinase-deficient B8 cells. The refractiveness against poly(I)-poly(C) displayed in unstimulated cells is not overcome at any stage of differentiation, indicating major differences of Newcastle disease virus and poly(I)-poly(C) induction mechanisms.","['Swetly, P']",['Swetly P'],,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*growth & development', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Interferons/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Newcastle disease virus/growth & development', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Spleen', 'Thymidine Kinase/biosynthesis', 'Virus Replication']",PMC515384,1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1975 Jan;17(1):27-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.17.1.27-32.1976.,,,['10.1128/JVI.17.1.27-32.1976 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These effects are analyzed in terms of possible variations in the behavior of cell kinetic parameters (namely, cell cycle times, cell loss rate, and growth fraction) and are implemented in the model specifying proper functional forms for the parameters. The time-course of drug distribution in a tumor-host system is also described by a two-compartment model and the factors affecting drug action are quantitatively formulated as a function of drug concentration. Simulation is carried out to examine the effects of BCNU, cytosine arabinoside, and methotrexate on the cell cycle and proliferation kinetics of L1210 leukemia, and the results of the simulation compare favorably with available experimental data.

Some characteristic differences could be observed in the sedimentation patterns of single-stranded DNA in the lymphocytes of patients with aplastic anemia and those of normal persons. The single-strand breaks in DNA suggested that the repair processes were disturbed in the DNA molecules of circulating lymphocytes from patients with acquired primary and secondary aplastic anemia.","['Hashimoto, Y', 'Takaku, F', 'Kosaka, K']","['Hashimoto Y', 'Takaku F', 'Kosaka K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)']",IM,,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*blood', 'Animals', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Molecular Weight']",,1975/11/01 00:00,1975/11/01 00:01,['1975/11/01 00:00'],"['1975/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1975 Nov;46(5):735-42.,,,['S0006-4971(20)74226-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The lytic activity was directed against syngeneic or allogeneic Moloney leukemia cells to a similar extent, but was primarily expressed when tested against in vitro grown leukemia cells. Two leukemias of non-Moloney origin were resistant and so was the mastocytoma line P815. Although killer activity varied between different strains of mice, the specificity of lysis was the same as indicated by competition experiments using unlabeled Moloney or other tumor cells as inhibitors in the cytotoxic assays. Capacity to compete and sensitivy to lysis by the killer cells were found to be highly positively correlated. Analysis of the kinetics of the cytotoxic assay revealed a rapid induction of lysis within one to four hours, arguing against any conventional in vitro induction of immune response.

Vincristine, procarbazine, imidazole carboxamide dimethyl triazeno (DTIC) and bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea (BCNU) have been used as single agents by various investigators. A response rate of +/- 20% was seen with vincristine (1-3) and BCNU (3, 4), and a response rate of 20-30% has been observed with DTIC (3, 5-8) and procarbazine (3, 9, 10). Newer agents such as triazeno imidazole carboxamide mustard (TIC mustard) (11), chloroethyl cyclohexyl nitrosourea (CCNU) (12), and chloroethyl methylcyclohexyl nitrosourea (methyl-CCNU) (13) have not so far proved superior. During the last years various drug combinations have been tried in an effort to improve the results of treatment in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. In 1959 Moon reported objective response in 9 out of 20 patients who received a minimum of two courses of a combination of BCNU and vincristine (14). In a randomized trial performed by Acute Leukemia Group B (15), only 24% responded to this combination as compared to 32% and 29% for two different DTIC schedules. There were 120 patients who entered onto this protocol. A combination of DTIC plus cyclophosphamide plus vincristine was reported to give a 25% response (16). Workers at the Mayo Clinic reported objective response in 4 out of 18 patients treated with a combination of DTIC plus vincristine as compared to 1 out of 19 using CCNU (12). Costanza and co-workers (Eastern Co-Operative Oncology Group study) reported that 12 out of 61 patients responded to treatment with DTIC plus BCNU as compared to 9 out of 51 on DTIC alone (17); while Cohen (18) and co-workers reported that 10 out of 16 patients treated with the triple combination of vincristine plus BCNU plus DTIC showed significant response and concluded that this combined approach in the treatment of disseminated malignant melanoma warranted further study. Preliminary analysis of an Eastern Co-Operative Oncology Group protocol showed no statistical advantage of DTIC plus methyl-CCNU over each drug on its own (19). The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible advantage of combining DTIC plus vincristine plus BCNU plus procarbazine in courses of treatment. All of these agents are of some value on their own and all four have possible different mechanisms of action.","['Van Dyk, J J', 'Falkson, G']","['Van Dyk JJ', 'Falkson G']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Triazenes)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carmustine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dacarbazine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Triazenes/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1975;1(2):107-11. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950010205.,,,['10.1002/mpo.2950010205 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The amount of neurosecretory material was determined in the neuroendocrine cells of supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, throughout the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial tract and in the neural lobe of the hypophysis. Three methods of response evaluation were employed: the amoount of neurosecretory material was estimated according to an arbitrary scale, by cytophotometry while for the hypothalamic cell-nuclei the karyometric method was used. The existence of a functional interrelation between the presence of leukemic cells and the activity of the hormonogenic sites in the hypothalamus is suggested. A clear response to the tumor inoculation was established both in the amount of stainable substance and in the nuclear volume of the secretory neurones. It is suggested that an accelerated synthesis and release of neurosecretory material in tumor recipient mice reduces renal excretion in order to compensate a dehydration caused by the production of ascitic fluid.","['Jasinski, A', 'Skraba, A']","['Jasinski A', 'Skraba A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Endokrinologie,Endokrinologie,0370675,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia L1210/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neurosecretion', 'Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus/cytology', 'Supraoptic Nucleus/cytology']",,1975/02/01 00:00,1975/02/01 00:01,['1975/02/01 00:00'],"['1975/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endokrinologie. 1975 Feb;64(3):339-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the early phase (3-6 days following M-MSV), observations at the injection site of the thigh muscles consisted of endo- and perimysial edema ""activated"" muscle satellite, cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts, scattered type C virus particles within the muscle fibers, muscle fibers and endomysial cells undergoing necrosis and macrophage and granulocyte infiltration. During the overt tumor phase (6-12 days following M-MSV), observation of neoplastic tissue disclosed proliferation of several cell type (endothelial, periosteal, fibroblasts, etc.), poorly differentiated myoblasts along with atypical rhabdomyoblast-like cells and sarcolytes, type C virus budding from muscle fiber and myoblast plasma membrane, and intense degenerative and regenerative changes in the muscle fibers together with more profuse granulocyte infiltration. The regressive phase (13-21 days following M-MSV) presented reduced cellularity of the neoplastic tissue, a decrease in blast cells, diminishing granulocyte infiltration with contemporaneous appearance of prominent lymphocyte foci and gradual disappearance of virus particles. Although many cell types of mesenchymal origin proliferate following M-MSV infection, the above morphological findings indicate that striated muscle is a preferential site for virus replication and transformation. Furthermore, the peculiar virus cell relationships leading to cell lysis and continuous recruitment of newly infected cells have been widely documented. In the light of these findings it is suggested that, besides the host immune control of virus spread and tumor cell multiplication, the non clonal growth pattern of M-MSV induced tumors is a crucial factor in determining the spontaneous regression which occurs with high frequency in this experimental system.","['Pennelli, N', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'Collavo, D', 'Cecchetto, A']","['Pennelli N', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Collavo D', 'Cecchetto A']",,['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Muscles/microbiology/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*pathology', 'Virus Replication']",,1975/03/01 00:00,1975/03/01 00:01,['1975/03/01 00:00'],"['1975/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tumori. 1975 Mar-Apr;61(2):129-50.,,,,,Studio istopatologico e ultrastrutturale dei tumori indotti da virus del sarcoma murino (MSV),,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, granulocytic G-6PD from patients with polycythemia vera always was normal. On the same way leukemic lymphocyte or lymphoblast G-6PD was identical to that from normal lymphocytes. 2. The ratio of enzymatic activity to immunological reactivity (=molecular specific activity) was markedly decreased in the myeloblasts of two patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and in the erythroblast-rich cellular fraction of a patient with erythroleukemia. In these cells the decrease of molecular specific activity was parallel to the alteration of the electrofocusing pattern of G-6PD. 3. The enzymatic forms with decreased isoelectric point also exhibited an altered affinity for glucose 6 phosphate. These modifications are post translational alterations of the neosynthesized G-6PD, since this enzyme is a single molecule, coded by the same gene in all tissues; they seem to correspond to an accelerated molecular aging due to an increased concentration of ""G-6PD modifying factors"".

However, the F1 hybrids do not present the immunological deficits seen in pre-leukemic AKR/J mice since they respond normally to in vitro PHA stimulation and to in vivo LPS immunization. These observations suggest that there is probably no direct relationship between the presence of MuLV and immunological impairment. Studies have been carried out to ascertain whether the altered immunological reactivity seen in AKR/J mice is related to factors intrinsic to the immunocompetent cells or to environmental inadequacy. Thus, (CBAT6T6 X AKR/J)F1 mice were thymectomized, irradiated, reconstituted with syngeneic bone marrow and simultaneous transplant of CBAT6T6 and AKR/J thymus, and their lymphocyte response to PHA was assayed. In addition, antibody production following LPS immunization was studied by transferring AKR/J splenic cells to irradiated CBA6T6 or (CBAT6T6 X AKR/J)F1 mice, and vice-versa.

On the contrary, immune sera enabled the recipients to survive longer and this prolongation proved to be statistically significant (p less than 0.02). Partial natural immunity against ""L-1210"" leukemia in BDF1 hybrids must be, therefore, postulated.

Immediately after autotransfusion on the average only 41.3% and 47.5% of the infused labeled lymphocytes were recovered in the blood of the normal subjects and of the untreated CLL patients, respectively. During the first hour, in the normal subjects a higher proportion of labeled cells disappeared from the blood that in untreated CLL patients. Thereafter, this initial rapid decrease ceased and levelled off into a plateau with rather constant recovery values. At this time (1-4 hours after autotransfusion), on the average only 6.7% of the normal lymphocytes, but 27.8% of the untreated CLL lymphocytes were recovered in the blood. In the non-leukemic lymphoma of the untreated CLL lymphocytes were recovered in the blood. In the non-leukemic lymphoma patients and treated CLL patients the autotransfused lymphocytes exhibited circulation kinetics similar to those of the normal lymphocytes. The majority of blood lymphocytes from untreated patients with CLL seem to be characterized by a poor exchange rate between intra- and extravascular lymphocyte pools and a prolonged intra-vascular life span. These findings agree with the impaired recirculation kinetics of CLL lymphocytes and their abnormal 0ehaviour in several ""in vitro"" tests dealing with other lymphocyte functions.","['Bremer, K', 'Fliedner, T M']","['Bremer K', 'Fliedner TM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Biomedicine,Biomedicine / [publiee pour l'A.A.I.C.I.G.],0361342,,IM,,"['Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', '*Lymphocytes']",,1975/09/01 00:00,1975/09/01 00:01,['1975/09/01 00:00'],"['1975/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomedicine. 1975 Sep;22(5):404-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spleen colony assay and thin-layer agar technique, both presumably reflecting the number of pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells, showed a 2.6 times increase in colony forming units (CFU-S resp. CFU-A) at 12 days after infection. The Bradley method of culturing colonies in agar, which is stated to reflect the number of myeloid precursor cells, resulted in a slower rise in colony forming units (CFU-C) with a maximum of 2.3 times increase at 19 days after infection. These results were compared to the differentiation patterns of the bone marrow at similar intervals after infection. The course of the CFU-C curve parallelled the rise in the number of the myeloblasts in the bone marrow. The pattern of CFU-A and CFU-S curves preceded the rise in number of CFU-C by 7 days. It was found, that RLV infection apart from causing an erythroblastosis in the spleen and a severe anemia is followed by a disappearance of neutrophil granulocytes from the bone marrow.

Three main mechanisms of neutropenia can be distinguished: a) peripheral hyperdestruction, corpuscular or extra-corpuscular, and false leukopenias (change in the distribution of peripheral granulocytes from the circulating to the marginal granulocyte pool; b) quantitative bone marrow insufficiency without qualitative abnormality; c) qualitative abnormality in bone marrow granulopoiesis with cell death in either the maturation stage or the proliferative stage. There is no exact correlation between clinical and kinetic classifications, but most cases of post-infection chronic neutropenias and idiopathic neutropenias fall into the first two categories, and most cases of benzol intoxication and bone marrow insufficiency due to X-irradiation fall into the last category.

Alterations in serum nucleolytic activity represent an important marker of neoplastic disease and can serve as the basis for a useful clinical screening device.","['Drake, W P', 'Schmukler, M', 'Pendergrast, W J Jr', 'Davis, A S', 'Lichtenfeld, J L', 'Mardiney, M R Jr']","['Drake WP', 'Schmukler M', 'Pendergrast WJ Jr', 'Davis AS', 'Lichtenfeld JL', 'Mardiney MR Jr']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Polynucleotides)', '24936-38-7 (Poly A-U)', '27416-86-0 (Poly U)', '30811-80-4 (Poly C)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,,"['Brain Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Hodgkin Disease/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Lymphoma/enzymology', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Poly A-U', 'Poly C', 'Poly U', 'Polynucleotides', 'Ribonucleases/*blood']",,1975/11/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1975/11/11 19:15'],"['1975/11/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1975/11/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1975 Nov;55(5):1055-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/55.5.1055.,,,['10.1093/jnci/55.5.1055 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Arginine-vasopressin was found to be stable in whole blood for up to 1 h at room temperature and for at least 4 h at 4 degrees C, while in plasma stored at -20 degrees C no loss was seen over 10 days. Dehydration and rehydration in normal subjects produced appropriate changes in AVP concentration but there was considerable variability in the levels attained by individual subjects and no obvious correlation with plasma osmolality. No consistent increase in plasma AVP concentration was seen on change of posture from the recumbent to the upright position. Vigorous exercise produced a marked rise in plasma AVP concentrations in most subjects which could not be attributed simply to an increase in plasma osmolality. In fusion studies with Pitressin in normal subjects showed a mean half-life of 6-4 min with an overall plasma clearance rate of 8-5 ml/min/kg body weight and a mean volume of distribution of 5-33 l.

Radioactivity was widely distributed throughout the tissues between 15 minutes and 12 hours after a single intravenous dose of either cyclocytidine-2-14C or cytosine arabinoside-2-14C. Whole-body radioautograms demonstrated that for most tissues, cytosine arabinoside-derived 14C was uniformly excreted by 48 hours; cyclocytidine-derived 14C, however, was localized in certain tissues as early as 15 minutes after drug administration and was retained in these sites for 48 hours. Depot loci of 14C included salivary and adrenal glands, fat, cardiac muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and L1210 tumor. The distribution and persistence of cyclocytidine-derived radioactivity is consistent with other reports of toxicity induced by the drug in these tissues. Radiochromatography and bioassay data from BDF mice dosed intraperitoneally with cyclocytidine demonstrated that 65%-95% of the 14C-radioactivity in a number of tissues was the parent compound itself. Thus, cyclocytidine contributed in large measur to the generation of the radioautograms. This study demonstrates that the retention of cyclocytidine in body tissues may serve to effect the sustained release of the deaminase-resistant chemotherapeutic drug from these depot sites and thus prolong cytotoxic levels of drug in tumor tissue.","['Liss, R H', 'Neil, G L']","['Liss RH', 'Neil GL']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Chemother Rep,Cancer chemotherapy reports,7607105,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Adrenal Glands/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*metabolism/urine', 'Digestive System/metabolism', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Lymphatic System/metabolism', 'Muscles/metabolism', 'Pancreas/metabolism', 'Respiratory System/metabolism', 'Salivary Glands/metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Urinary Bladder/metabolism']",,1975/05/01 00:00,1975/05/01 00:01,['1975/05/01 00:00'],"['1975/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Rep. 1975 May-Jun;59(3):501-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence and mortality of cancer in males exceeded those in respect of females, whereas the prevalence with females was clearly higher than that with males. According to all 3 indices, the commonest site of cancer was in the lungs in males. In females, cancer of the breast was the commonest malignant neoplasm measured by incidence and prevalence, where as in mortality statistics it was second to cancer of the stomach. Cancers with poor prognosis such as cancer of the lung, stomach, pancreas and esophagus, and leukemia, exhibited relatively low prevalence figures, whereas cancers with good prognosis, such as cancer of the breast, uterus, larynx and lip, showed relatively large numbers of prevalent cases. In females, cancer of the genitals, including the breasts, constituted nearly as may prevalent cases as did the total figure in males.

The histopathologic diagnosis by lymph node biopsy revealed lymphocyte predominance in 22, nodular sclerosis in 67, mixed cellularity in 24, and lymphocyte depletion in 3. Within the subgroup of nodular sclerosis, 47 biopsies had classic well-developed collagenous bands, whereas 20 were in the cellular phase (10 without collagenous bands and 10 with minimal collagen). The clinical extent of disease was determined. There were 33 patients with Stage I disease, 38 with Stage IIA, 12 with Stage IIB, 24 with Stage III, and 9 with Stage IV. Survival correlated with histopathologic type and clinical stage, but not with age or sex. Survival was not dependent on the degree of collagenization in nodular sclerosis.

Banding analysis of abnormal chromosomes in polycythemia vera.,199-202,"The chromosome constitution of bone marrow cells was determined in 13 patients with polycythemia vera (PV). In 5 of these patients definite karyotypic abnormalities were found: 3 with 46,XY,Fq-; 1 with 46,XY,11q-, 13q-; and 1 with missing Y. The latter cytogenetic finding is thought not to be related to the PV. The 4 patients with partial deletions of chromosomes had been treated with 32P, and 3 of them with chemotherapy also. Karyotypes from 2 of these patients, 1 with 46,XY,20q-, and another with 46,XY,11q-,13q- were examined with G and/or Q banding. From the results of the banding analysis, it appears that the abnormal chromosomes were due to simple deletions at specific sites on their arms, particularly in the cases with the F abnormality (20q11). The breaks occurred in the regions C11q and D12q. The portions missing from the original chromosomes could not be found on any chromosome. Most patients with PV do not develop chromosomal abnormalities through the course of their disease; when such abnormalities appear (20q- in particular), they seem to result exclusively from radiation (and possibly chemo-) therapy. Thus, cytogenetic changes do not appear to play a crucial role in the genesis of PV.","['Shiraishi, Y', 'Hayata, I', 'Sakurai, M', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Shiraishi Y', 'Hayata I', 'Sakurai M', 'Sandberg AA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes/analysis', 'Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', 'Chromosomes, Human, 19-20', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics/pathology']",,1975/07/01 00:00,1975/07/01 00:01,['1975/07/01 00:00'],"['1975/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1975 Jul;36(1):199-202. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197507)36:1<199::aid-cncr2820360119>3.0.co;2-k.,,,['10.1002/1097-0142(197507)36:1<199::aid-cncr2820360119>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular content of each TC has been studied in normal and leukaemic bone marrow cells after separation on a discontinuous bovine serum albumin gradient. Myeloblasts contain a TC II-like protein almost exclusively but promyelocytes contain a TC I-like protein which increases as the cells mature whilst 'TC II' decreases. A TC III-like binder parallels 'TC I' but appears later and reaches a maximum in the polymorphonuclear cells. In various types of leukaemia, abnormal TC distributions are related either to marrow replacement by the blast cells or to a disorder of the maturation process in the leukaemic cell line.","['Zittoun, J', 'Marquet, J', 'Zittoun, R']","['Zittoun J', 'Marquet J', 'Zittoun R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Transcobalamins)']",IM,,"['Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/analysis/*metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Transcobalamins/analysis/*biosynthesis']",,1975/11/01 00:00,1975/11/01 00:01,['1975/11/01 00:00'],"['1975/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1975 Nov;31(3):299-310. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1975.tb00861.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1975.tb00861.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Condensation of 9-amino-6-(methylthio)-9H-purine (1) with some carbonyl compounds followed by hydride reduction of the azomethine linkage in the intermediates leads to the 2-pyrrolylmethyl (8), 2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl (10), and the 1,5-dihydroxy-2- and 3-pentyl (11 and 12) compounds. A 4-hydroxybutyl derivative (13) was obtained by alkylation of 18, the 9-acetyl derivative of 1, with 4-chlorobutyl acetate followed by saponification. The cyclization of 13 and 11 with a sulfonyl chloride gave the 9-pyrrolidin-1-yl (27) and the 9-[2-(tosyloxymethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl] (28), respectively. Acylation of 1 with ethyl L-2-pyrrolidine-5-carboxylate and ethyl 1-methyl-5-pyrrolidone-3-carboxylate, respectively, in Me2SO containing NaH gave the corresponding amides 15 and 17. Alkylation of 18 with 1-bromo-2-chloroethane and epichlorohydrin gave the N-(2-chloroethyl) and N-(1,2-epoxy-3-propyl) derivatives 19 and 20. The chloro group of the chlorobutyl derivative of 18 was displaced with KSCN and NaN3, respectively, to give the thiocyanate and azido derivatives 23 and 24. Hydrogenation of the latter gave the amine (25), which was acylated with ethyl chloroformate to give the (ethoxycarbonyl)amino compound 26. None of these compounds showed activity against L1210 leukemia cells implanted ip in mice on a single-dose schedule, suggesting that the activity observed in the simpler 9-aminopurines resulted from cleavage of the hydrazino linkage to give pH-purine-6(1H)-thione.","['Temple, C Jr', 'Kussner, C L', 'Montgomery, J A']","['Temple C Jr', 'Kussner CL', 'Montgomery JA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Purines)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Purine Nucleosides/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', '*Purines/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use']",,1975/12/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1975/12/11 19:15'],"['1975/12/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1975/12/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1975 Dec;18(12):1255-8. doi: 10.1021/jm00246a019.,,,['10.1021/jm00246a019 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

For these reasons we investigated the expression of FV-associated cell surface antigens on cultured, FV-trnasformed cell lines of BALB.B and BALB/c origin. Both cell lines induced transplantation immunity in syngeneic hosts toward further implantations of the same tumor, BALB.B cells being significantly more potent in this respect than BALB/c cells. BALB.B tumor cells, which produce complete, infectious FV, expressed both the cell surface antigen, FMR (corresponding to the cytotoxic antibodies in anti-FV antisera), and virus envelope antigen (VEA, corresponding to the virus-neutralizing antibodies in the anti-FV antisera). BALB/c tumor cells, on the other hand, which are FV-nonproducers, expressed no FMR antigen, but did express VEA on their surfaces for at least 100 passages in culture. These cells could induce FV-neutralizing but not cytotoxic anti-FMR antibodies when used to immunize syngeneic hosts. The absence of FMR antigen may be the basis for the reduced capacity of BALB/c tumor cells, by comparison with BALB.B tumor cells, to induce transplantation immunity. After about the 125th serial transfer in culture, BALB/c tumor cells spontaneously ceased to express VEA and simultaneously became very weak inducers of transplantation immunity in BALB/c hosts. This loss of VEA did not stem from the loss of either the spleen focus-forming virus or the helper virus genomes from these cells, since both viruses could still be recovered from the cell line.","['Freedman, H A', 'Lilly, F', 'Steeves, R A']","['Freedman HA', 'Lilly F', 'Steeves RA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Antigens', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Spleen/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC2190061,1975/12/01 00:00,1975/12/01 00:01,['1975/12/01 00:00'],"['1975/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1975 Dec 1;142(6):1365-76. doi: 10.1084/jem.142.6.1365.,,,['10.1084/jem.142.6.1365 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the lack of religious designation on death certificates, case reports, and census returns, a number of indirect methods for measuring the problem have been devised, which produce fairly consistent findings. In general, for American Jews, these show deficits in cancer mortality, among males, for the buccal cavity and pharynx and prostate and, among females, for the breast, uterine cervix and corpus, and bladder. Excesses in mortality, noted for both sexes, are esophagus, stomach, colon, pancreas, lymphomas, and leukemia and, in females, the lung and the ovary. The standardized mortality ratios for cancer of selected sites for Russian-born residents of upstate New York, 1969 through 1971, are presented as an indirect measure of the problem in the United States Jews. Statistically significant excesses were found in males for stomach and colon, with a striking deficit in cancer of the buccal cavity and pharynx. Among females, excesses were noted for stomach, pancreas, and lung with a sharp deficit in the uterine cervix. On the basis of the religious affiliation of the cemetery of burial, estimates of the Jewish and non-Jewish components of the 800 deaths in Russian-born residents were determined. Expected deaths in these two subgroups by sex, for each cancer site, were then calculated by use of the site-specific proportionate mortality of upstate New York for these years. This revealed a significant excess among Jewish males for colon cancer, with a deficit in lung cancer, while among the non-Jewish male components stomach cancer mortality was the only site significantly in excess. Among Jewish females, stomach and lung cancers were in excess, with a deficit in cancers of the breast and cervix uteri. In non-Jewish Russian-born females, the only site significantly in excess was stomach, with breast cancer showing a deficit.","['Greenwald, P', 'Korns, R F', 'Nasca, P C', 'Wolfgang, P E']","['Greenwald P', 'Korns RF', 'Nasca PC', 'Wolfgang PE']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Jews', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'New York', 'USSR/ethnology', 'United States']",,1975/11/01 00:00,1975/11/01 00:01,['1975/11/01 00:00'],"['1975/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1975 Nov;35(11 Pt. 2):3507-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TL antigens consist mainly of molecules of a size similar to immunoglobulin G when gel chromatography analyses were performed under physiological conditions. A single component of TLa was apparent on sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of solubilized thymocyte membrane macromolecules as monitored by indirect immunoprecipitation. The sedimentation constant for the TL antigens (5.8 S) was considerably less than that for immunoglobulin G. The gel chromatography and ultracentrifugation data suggest an apparent molecular weight for TLa of about 120000. TLa isolated by indirect immunoprecipitation is composed of two types of polypeptide chains. The smaller subunit was identified as beta2-microglobulin. The larger polypeptide chain carried the alloantigenic determinants and displayed a molecular weight of about 50000 after reduction and alkylation. TLa subjected to molecular weight determination under denaturing conditions was composed of two components. The smaller component was beta2-microglobulin which evidently is linked to the larger polypeptide chain by noncovalent interactions only. The larger component had a size greater than reduced and alkylated immunoglobulin G heavy chains. Upon reduction and alkylation of the latter component its size was reduced and it appeared to have a molecular weight of about 50000. Consequently, TLa is composed of two disulfide linked heavy polypeptide chains and two beta2-microglobulin molecules. TLa solubilized by papain digestion comprises two polypeptide chains, one of which is beta2-microglobulin. The larger 37000-dalton subunit is a fragment of the heavy polypeptide chain. This was demonstrated by digesting solubilized 120000-dalton TLa with papain. The proteolytic fragments obtained were indistinguishable from those directly released from the cell surface by proteolysis. The papain-derived TLa fragment exhibited most if not all the alloantigenic determinants.","['Anundi, H', 'Rask, L', 'Ostberg, L', 'Peterson, P A']","['Anundi H', 'Rask L', 'Ostberg L', 'Peterson PA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens/isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptides', 'Solubility', 'Thymus Gland/analysis/*immunology']",,1975/11/18 00:00,1975/11/18 00:01,['1975/11/18 00:00'],"['1975/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1975/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1975 Nov 18;14(23):5046-54. doi: 10.1021/bi00694a003.,,,['10.1021/bi00694a003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review of 225 patients with leukemia or lymphoma, six possibly preventable deaths resulted because progressive pulmonary infiltrates were treated without tissue diagnosis. Four other patients died of undiagnosed second primary lung tumors. When pulmonary infiltrates were diagnosed by open lung biopsy examination, appropriate therapy in nine patients resulted in seven survivals from potentially lethal infections. Of six patient with either primary lung tumor, leukemic infiltrate, or lymphomatous nodule, bronchoscopy and brush biopsy examination revealed bronchogenic tumors, leading to appropriate surgical therapy and survival in three. In three others, bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy suggested exacerbation of the primary disease, which was treated satisfactorily by radiotherapy.

Two procedures in particular led to enhanced growth of the tumour allograft: (a) a single injection of antigen seven days before graft, and (b) a two-pulse immunisation spaced over 42 days. Mice given the seven-day course showed impaired cell-mediated cytotoxicity and blocking antibody at the time of challenge which was succeeded by blocking antigen in the circulation after challenge. Mice immunised by the two-pulse course developed heightened cell-mediated cytoxicity, but showed a persisting level of blocking antibody in the serum. Thus, although both immunisation regimes enhanced tumour growth, they did so by different mechanisms.","['Zola, H']",['Zola H'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Ann Immunol (Paris),Annales d'immunologie,0353045,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Antibody Formation/drug effects', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Immunol (Paris). 1975 Jan;126(1):51-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of leukaemia among first degree relatives was established to be 2.8-3.0 times, among more distant relatives about 2.3 times, and overall about 2.5 times that expected. This excess is of the order of that observed in relatives of patients with certain solid tumors. Genetic factors may have accounted for much of the excess incidence in chronic lymphocytic and acute leukaemia, but there was little evidence for a genetic background in chronic granulocytic leukaemia. With the possible exception of one family with multiple cases, a simple Mendelian mechanism did not appear to be involved in the leukaemia families investigated. It appeared more likely that a polygenic mechanism led to a heightened susceptibility to the disease in these families.","['Gunz, F W', 'Gunz, J P', 'Veale, A M', 'Chapman, C J', 'Houston, I B']","['Gunz FW', 'Gunz JP', 'Veale AM', 'Chapman CJ', 'Houston IB']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Australia', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree']",,1975/09/01 00:00,1975/09/01 00:01,['1975/09/01 00:00'],"['1975/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1975 Sep;15(2):117-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1975.tb01063.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1975.tb01063.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice were starved 1-3 days before or after immunization. The capacity of starved animals to survive immunization was used to quantify immunosuppression. When starvation bracketed immunization by -1 to +1 days, only 2 of 23 mice survived primary immunization, compared with 100% survival for nonstarved controls. A 2-day period of starvation +1 to +7 days after primary immunization reduced survival about 30%. For a test of the effect of starvation on the secondary immune response, mice were immunized, starved 2 days, and then challenged with viable lb cells. When mice were starved from -3 to +1 days before or after challenge, there was a 25-45% decrease in survival. Starvation caused a disproportionate depletion of lymphoid tissue elements. The proportional loss in the weight of the spleen and thymus was essentially twice as great as the loss in total body weight. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was reduced by about 20% when mice were starved 1 day and by approximately 50% when they were starved 2 days. When mice were starved 1-2 days, the differential leukocyte count did not shift and there was no significant change in the number of blood erythrocytes or in the hematocrit. Starvation for 2 days caused a 65-70% reduction in the number of viable mononuclear spleen cells. Starvation for 3 days caused about 90% reduction.

Indirect IF with human SMA-positive serum might be used in the classification of cell lines derived from human hematopoietic tissue.","['Fagraeus, A', 'Nilsson, K', 'Lidman, K', 'Norberg, R']","['Fagraeus A', 'Nilsson K', 'Lidman K', 'Norberg R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Antibodies)'],IM,,"['*Antibodies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Movement', 'Hematopoietic System/*cytology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/pathology', 'Muscle, Smooth/*immunology']",,1975/10/01 00:00,1975/10/01 00:01,['1975/10/01 00:00'],"['1975/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1975 Oct;55(4):783-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/55.4.783.,,,['10.1093/jnci/55.4.783 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 98 leukemia metaphases, 16.3% were hypodiploid, 4.1% hyperdiploid, and 79.5% diploid. The distribution of G bands in diploid metaphases indicated that almost half of them were pseudodiploid, with chromosome abnormalities such as trisomies, monosomies, nullisomies, unidentified chromosomes, translocations, deletions, or duplications. Since all mouse chromosomes are acrocentric and can be identified only tentatively most of the anomalies detected with G-banding procedures would have passed unnoticed with conventional cytogenetic techniques. The C-banding pattern of leukemia cells did not differ from that of normal controls. However, a considerable number of leukemia cell metaphases had bridges connecting the centromeric C bands of two or more chromosomes. This phenomenon probably indicates an increased stickiness of the heterochromatin, which may produce mitotic nondisjunction and the appearance of monosomies and trisomies.","['Bianchi, M S', 'Merani, S', 'Bianchi, N O']","['Bianchi MS', 'Merani S', 'Bianchi NO']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ploidies', 'Trisomy']",,1975/10/01 00:00,1975/10/01 00:01,['1975/10/01 00:00'],"['1975/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1975 Oct;55(4):1017-21. doi: 10.1093/jnci/55.4.1017.,,,['10.1093/jnci/55.4.1017 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This contrasts with a survival rate of 9% computed from the literature for children with local and regional non-Hodgkin lymphoma in various parts of the body. Major factors influencing survival appeared to be: (1) stage of lymphoma (12 of 17 Stage I survived); (2) histology (7 of 7 patients whose lesions were classified as nodular survived as compared to 5 of 17 with lesions classified as diffuse); and (3) anatomic location. Leukemia developed in seven patients with lesions of the diffuse histologic type.
