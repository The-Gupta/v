METHODS: We evaluated the methylation status of 13 genes (MINT1, MINT2, MINT31, MLH1, p16, p14, TIMP3, CDH1, CDH13, THBS1, MGMT, HPP1 and ERalpha) by bisulfite-pyrosequencing in 79 CRCs comprising 36 CRCs without liver metastasis and 43 CRCs with liver metastasis, including 16 paired primary CRCs and liver metastasis. We also performed methylated CpG island amplification microarrays (MCAM) in three paired primary and metastatic cancers. RESULTS: Methylation of p14, TIMP3 and HPP1 in primary CRCs progressively decreased from absence to presence of liver metastasis (13.1% vs. 4.3%; 14.8% vs. 3.7%; 43.9% vs. 35.8%, respectively) (P<.05). When paired primary and metastatic tumors were compared, only MGMT methylation was significantly higher in metastatic cancers (27.4% vs. 13.4%, P = .013), and this difference was due to an increase in methylation density rather than frequency in the majority of cases. MCAM showed an average 7.4% increase in DNA methylated genes in the metastatic samples. The numbers of differentially hypermethylated genes in the liver metastases increased with increasing time between resection of the primary and resection of the liver metastasis. Bisulfite-pyrosequencing validation in 12 paired samples showed that most of these increases were not conserved, and could be explained by differences in methylation density rather than frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Most DNA methylation differences between primary CRCs and matched liver metastasis are due to random variation and an increase in DNA methylation density rather than de-novo inactivation and silencing. Thus, DNA methylation changes occur for the most part before progression to liver metastasis.","['Konishi, Kazuo', 'Watanabe, Yoshiyuki', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Guo, Yi', 'Castoro, Ryan J', 'Kondo, Kimie', 'Chung, Woonbok', 'Ahmed, Saira', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Boumber, Yanis A', 'Estecio, Marcos R', 'Maegawa, Shinji', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Itoh, Fumio', 'Imawari, Michio', 'Hamilton, Stanley R', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Konishi K', 'Watanabe Y', 'Shen L', 'Guo Y', 'Castoro RJ', 'Kondo K', 'Chung W', 'Ahmed S', 'Jelinek J', 'Boumber YA', 'Estecio MR', 'Maegawa S', 'Kondo Y', 'Itoh F', 'Imawari M', 'Hamilton SR', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas M.

However, multiple retrospective analyses of patient data have yielded conflicting conclusions regarding a putative role of NK cells and the essential NK cell recognition events mediating a protective effect against leukemia. Further, a NK cell mediated protective effect against primary leukemia in vivo has not been shown directly. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we addressed whether NK cells have the potential to control chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) arising based on the transplantation of BCR-ABL1 oncogene expressing primary bone marrow precursor cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. These analyses identified missing-self recognition as the only NK cell-mediated recognition strategy, which is able to significantly protect from the development of CML disease in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a proof of principle that NK cells can control primary leukemic cells in vivo. Since the presence of NK cells reduced the abundance of leukemia propagating cancer stem cells, the data raise the possibility that NK cell recognition has the potential to cure CML, which may be difficult using small molecule BCR-ABL1 inhibitors. Finally, our findings validate approaches to treat leukemia using antibody-based blockade of self-specific inhibitory MHC class I receptors.","['Kijima, Mika', 'Gardiol, Noemie', 'Held, Werner']","['Kijima M', 'Gardiol N', 'Held W']","['Ludwig Center for Cancer Research of the University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/*prevention & control', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Immunological', 'Myeloid Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Self Tolerance/*immunology']",PMC3223190,2011/12/02 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027639 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13347 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27639. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027639.

Despite its potent antitumor activity, clinical use of etoposide is limited because of its adverse effects, including myelosuppression and the development of secondary leukemia. Here, we comprehensively compared the mechanistic differences between daurinol and etoposide because they have similar chemical structures. Etoposide, a topoisomerase II poison, is known to attenuate cancer cell proliferation through the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Etoposide treatment induces G(2)/M arrest, severe DNA damage, and the formation of giant nuclei in HCT116 cells. We hypothesized that the induction of DNA damage and nuclear enlargement due to abnormal chromosomal conditions could give rise to genomic instability in both tumor cells and in actively dividing normal cells, resulting in the toxic adverse effects of etoposide. We found that daurinol is a catalytic inhibitor of human topoisomerase IIa, and it induces S-phase arrest through the enhanced expression of cyclins E and A and by activation of the ATM/Chk/Cdc25A pathway in HCT116 cells. However, daurinol treatment did not cause DNA damage or nuclear enlargement in vitro. Finally, we confirmed the in vivo antitumor effects and adverse effects of daurinol and etoposide in nude mice xenograft models. Daurinol displayed potent antitumor effects without any significant loss of body weight or changes in hematological parameters, whereas etoposide treatment led to decreased body weight and white blood cell, red blood cell, and hemoglobin concentration.","['Kang, Kyungsu', 'Oh, Seung Hyun', 'Yun, Ji Ho', 'Jho, Eun Hye', 'Kang, Ju-Hee', 'Batsuren, Dulamjav', 'Tunsag, Jigjidsuren', 'Park, Kwang Hwa', 'Kim, Minkyun', 'Nho, Chu Won']","['Kang K', 'Oh SH', 'Yun JH', 'Jho EH', 'Kang JH', 'Batsuren D', 'Tunsag J', 'Park KH', 'Kim M', 'Nho CW']","['Functional Food Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Gangneung, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzodioxoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Drugs, Investigational/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Biological', 'Naphthalenes/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3223608,2011/12/02 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2001/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.11972 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2011 Nov;13(11):1043-57. doi: 10.1593/neo.11972.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzodioxoles)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '0 (daurinol)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic C-CBL mutations were recently described in MDS. Our study aimed to determine the role of C-CBL mutations in the progression of MDS to sAML and sought to correlate with clinicohematological features and outcome. Bone marrow samples from 51 patients with high-risk MDS (13 with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 19 with refractory anemia with excess blast 1, and 19 with refractory anemia with excess blast 2) were analyzed for C-CBL mutations at both diagnosis and sAML in the same individuals. Mutational analysis was performed for exons 7 to 9 of C-CBL gene. Of the 51 paired samples, C-CBL mutations were identified in 6 patients at the sAML phase. One patient retained the identical C-CBL mutation (G415S) at sAML evolution and exhibited clonal expansion. The other five patients acquired C-CBL mutations (Y371S, F418S, L370_Y371 ins L, L399V, and C416W) during sAML evolution. Three of the six patients harboring C-CBL mutations at sAML had additional gene mutations including JAK2(V617F), PTPN11, or N-RAS. There was no significant difference in clinicohematological features and overall survival with respect to C-CBL mutation status. Our results show that C-CBL mutation is very rare (0.6%) in MDS, but acquisition and/or expansion of C-CBL mutant clones occur in 11.8% of patients during sAML transformation.

Combined therapies protocols have been emerging to improve treatment strategies to circumvent responseless BL patients. We evaluate the cell death effect of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) combined with etoposide (VP-16) and cisplatin (CDDP) on BL cell lines. METHODS: 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay was performed to assess drug toxicity. To establish the concentrations and time of incubation for the combined treatment, a kinetic analysis was performed for each drug on BL41 and Raji BL cell lines for 24, 48 and 72 h. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) and cleaved caspase 3 labeling assays. Caspase 9 activation and levels of Bcl-2 family proteins were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: The doses of NaB (1.0 mM), CDDP (1.0 and 2.5 muM), and VP-16 (0.1 and 0.3 muM) after 24 h of incubation were chosen for the evaluation of combined therapy. The apoptotic effects on BL cell lines of NaB/VP-16 and NaB/CDDP were followed by upregulation of Bim protein (P < 0.05), activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, followed by Mcl-1 downregulation (P < 0.05). However, Bim overexpression was not correlated with Bcl-2 inhibition (P > 0.05) and was accompanied by increase in Bax expression (P < 0.05). The combination effects of NaB/VP-16 and NaB/CDDP were found to be synergistic and additive, respectively, in both the cell lines.

However, the clinical success of allo-HSCT is limited by the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) activity of donor T cells. We have reported previously that donor bone marrow precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pre-pDCs) can activate donor T cells toward T-helper 1 immune polarization in murine allogeneic HSCT. To optimize the GVL activity of these activated donor T cells and limit their graft versus host activity, we engineered the cellular constituents of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell graft with highly purified hematopoietic stem cells, T cells, and pre-pDCs and studied their GVL and GVHD activities in a murine model of allogeneic HSCT. Transplanted donor pre-pDCs expanded in vivo for 2 weeks after transplant, and they markedly augmented the activation and GVL activity of donor T cells while attenuating their GVHD activity, leading to an improved therapeutic index. Bidirectional signaling between donor T cells and donor pDCs with IFN-gamma synthesis by donor T cells inducing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase synthesis by donor pDCs limited GVHD by altering the balance between donor T-reg and inflammatory T cells.

Here, we demonstrate that the expression of essential HH pathway components like GLI1, PTCH1, and the HH ligands is highly diverse in CLL. A subset of 36.7% of 60 tested CLL samples responded to all 3 SMOOTHENED (SMO) inhibitors, whereas 40% were completely resistant. Responsiveness correlated with elevated GLI1 and PTCH1 transcript levels and the presence of trisomy 12, whereas no other karyotype correlated with responsiveness. All trisomy 12 CLLs displayed constitutive HH pathway activation driven by autocrine DESERT HH (DHH) ligand secretion, which could be blocked by the HH-blocking Ab 5E1. Cocultures with DHH-expressing BM stromal cells reduced sensitivity of CLLs to SMO-inhibitor treatment by activation of noncanonical ERK phosphorylation directly downstream of the PTCH1 receptor without involvement of SMO and could be overcome by the HH-blocking Ab 5E1 or a combination of SMO and ERK inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that the HH-signaling pathway is an interesting therapeutic target for a subset of patients with CLL, characterized by high GLI1 and PTCH1 transcript levels, and all patients with trisomy 12 and indicate HH-blocking Abs to be favorable over SMO inhibitors in overcoming stroma-mediated protective effects.","['Decker, Sarah', 'Zirlik, Katja', 'Djebatchie, Lauritte', 'Hartmann, David', 'Ihorst, Gabriele', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette', 'Herchenbach, Dieter', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Warmuth, Markus', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Dierks, Christine']","['Decker S', 'Zirlik K', 'Djebatchie L', 'Hartmann D', 'Ihorst G', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Herchenbach D', 'Jumaa H', 'Warmuth M', 'Veelken H', 'Dierks C']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111130,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Patched Receptors', 'Patched-1 Receptor', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Smoothened Receptor', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trisomy/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",,2011/12/02 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40204-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-359075 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 26;119(4):997-1007. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-359075.

They present an incidence rate of roughly 10 cases per 1 million inhabitants per year. During childhood (<15 years), the percentage of malignant bone tumors amounts to 6% of all infantile malignancies. Only leukemia and lymphoma show a higher incidence in adolescence. Of all primary malignant bone tumors, 60% affect patients younger than 45 years and the peak incidence of all bone tumors occurs between 15 and 19 years. The most common primary malignant bone tumors are osteosarcoma (35%), chondrosarcoma (25%), and Ewing's sarcoma (16%). Less frequently (</= 5%) occurring tumors are chordoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone, and fibrosarcoma of bone. Vascular primary malignant tumors of bone and adamantinoma are very rare. Staging of the lesion is essential for systemic therapeutic decision-making and includes complete imaging and histo-pathological confirmation of the suspected entity. In most cases, this is established by open- or image-guided biopsy. Based on this information, an interdisciplinary tumor board will determine the individual therapeutic approach.

Reduced DOK2 expression was recently reported in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting that this protein acts as a tumor suppressor in solid tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of DOK2 in gastric cancer. METHODS: The study subjects were 118 patients who underwent curative surgery for gastric cancer, as well as 7 gastric cancer cell lines. The tissues and cell lines were analyzed for DOK2 gene and protein expressions by histopathology and immunohistochemistry, and also using a microsatellite marker for loss of heterozygosity. Correlation of survival with clinicopathological parameters was investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: DOK2 expression was confirmed in the normal gastric mucosa. Considerable differences in the gene expression were noted among the gastric cell lines. Positive DOK2 expression was noted in the noncancerous regions of all pathological specimens, whereas 59 (50.0%) specimens of 118 patients were negatively stained in the tumor. Loss of heterozygosity was observed in 54.5% of DOK2(-) cases. DOK2(-) patients were more likely to develop recurrence than DOK2(+) and showed poorer 5-year overall survival (59.1%) than DOK2(+) (76.4%, P = .0403). Multivariate analysis identified pT (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.748, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.061-8.927, P = .0361), pN (HR = 2.486, 95% CI = 1.264-4.932, P = .0086), and DOK2(-) (HR = 2.343, 95% CI = 1.211-4.727, P = .0112) as significant and independent determinants of poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest the potential usefulness of DOK2 as a marker of poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer after curative resection.","['Miyagaki, Hiromichi', 'Yamasaki, Makoto', 'Takahashi, Tsuyoshi', 'Kurokawa, Yukinori', 'Miyata, Hiroshi', 'Nakajima, Kiyokazu', 'Takiguchi, Shuji', 'Fujiwara, Yoshiyuki', 'Mori, Masaki', 'Doki, Yuichiro']","['Miyagaki H', 'Yamasaki M', 'Takahashi T', 'Kurokawa Y', 'Miyata H', 'Nakajima K', 'Takiguchi S', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Mori M', 'Doki Y']","['Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20111201,United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*analysis/genetics', 'Adenocarcinoma/*chemistry/diagnosis/pathology/secondary/*surgery', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Neoplasms/secondary', 'Brain Neoplasms/secondary', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastric Mucosa/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*chemistry/diagnosis/pathology/*surgery', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/12/02 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1245/s10434-011-2157-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 2012 May;19(5):1560-7. doi: 10.1245/s10434-011-2157-6.

TMEV largely persists in macrophages (Ms) in the CNS, and infected Ms in vitro undergo apoptosis, whereas the infection of other rodent cells produces necrosis. We have found that necrosis is the dominant form of cell death in BeAn virus-infected BHK-21 cells but that ~20% of cells undergo apoptosis. Mcl-1 was highly expressed in BHK-21 cells, and protein levels decreased upon infection, consistent with onset of apoptosis. In infected BHK-21 cells in which Mcl-1 expression was knocked down using silencing RNAs there was a 3-fold increase in apoptotic cell death compared to parental cells. The apoptotic program switched on by BeAn virus is similar to that in mouse Ms, with hallmarks of activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a tumor suppressor protein p53-dependent manner. Infection of stable Mcl-1-knockdown cells led to restricted virus titers and increased physical to infectious particle (PFU) ratios, with additional data suggesting that a late step in the viral life cycle after viral RNA replication, protein synthesis, and polyprotein processing is affected by apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that Mcl-1 acts as a critical prosurvival factor that protects against apoptosis and allows high yields of infectious virus in BHK-21 cells.","['Arslan, Sevim Yildiz', 'Son, Kyung-No', 'Lipton, Howard L']","['Arslan SY', 'Son KN', 'Lipton HL']","['Department of Microbiology-Immunology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS065945/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS065945/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111130,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cardiovirus Infections/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology/*veterinary', 'Cell Death', 'Cricetinae', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Necrosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rodent Diseases/genetics/*metabolism/*physiopathology/virology', 'Theilovirus/genetics/*physiology']",PMC3302388,2011/12/02 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06516-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06516-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Feb;86(4):1922-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06516-11.

Thus, RXRa is an essential cofactor of the fusion protein for the transformation. Actually, RXRa contributes to several aspects of in vivo -transformation: RARa fusion:RXRa hetero-oligomeric complexes bind DNA with a much greater affinity than RARa fusion homodimers. Besides, PML-RARa:RXRa recognizes an enlarged repertoire of DNA binding sites. Thus the association between fusion proteins and RXRa regulates more genes than the homodimer alone. Titration of RXRa by the fusion protein may also play a role in the transformation process, as well as post-translational modifications of RXRa in the complex.

Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained further interest after demonstration of immunomodulatory effects on complicated interactions between T cells and even DCs. However, the mechanisms underlying these immunoregulatory effects of MSCs induced DCs are poorly understood. In addition, it is unclear whether the immunoregulatory functions of MSCs are altered in disease states. In this study, we showed that chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients bone marrow derived MSCs (CML-MSC) could differentiate mature DCs (mDCs) into a distinct regulatory DC population, they had lower expression of CD40, CD80, CD83 and CD86. Similar to immature DCs (imDCs), CML-MSC induced DCs (CML-MSC-DCs) displayed powerful phagocytic capacity. Moreover, CML-MSC-DCs had the capacity to induce T cell anergy, another capacity of regulatory DCs. CML-MSC-DCs could inhibit the proliferation of T cells not only through TGF-beta1, but also by inducing the production of Treg cells or T-cell anergy. At last, CML-MSC-DCs could efficiently induce more CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs from naive CD4+CD25-Foxp3-T cells than that of normal-MSC-DCs in vitro. CML-MSC-DCs derived TGF-beta1 was largely responsible for the increase in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs based on knockdown studies. The immunoregulatory effects of DCs induced by CML-MSCs enhance the potential use of autologous MSCs in cell therapy.","['Zhao, Zhi-Gang', 'Xu, Wen', 'Sun, Li', 'Li, Wei-Ming', 'Li, Qiu-Bai', 'Zou, Ping']","['Zhao ZG', 'Xu W', 'Sun L', 'Li WM', 'Li QB', 'Zou P']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, The Oncology Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, PR China. zhaodor001@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111128,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunomodulation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/12/02 06:00,2012/10/09 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00876-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2012 Aug;48(12):1884-95. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.11.003.

METHODS: Human COMT expression was measured by RT-PCR in a panel of selected human cancer cell lines and human hepatocytes. An ex vivo human hepatocyte model was employed to evaluate the metabolism of 17-beta-oestradiol to CEs in the presence of a catechol (B(0)C) versus a non-catechol echinocandin (B(0)) compound. COMT inhibition assays were conducted to evaluate the metabolism of CEs in the presence of B(0)C or B(0). Oestrogen receptor expression in human hepatic carcinoma cells was evaluated by RT-PCR and western blotting. Cell proliferation assays were used to evaluate the impact of B(0) or B(0)C on cancer cell growth. RESULTS: MCF-7 and Hep-G2 cells and human hepatocytes expressed variant Met/Met COMT. At clinically relevant concentrations, only B(0)C significantly increased CE levels in the COMT inhibition assays, to 90.0 muM compared with 79.8 muM in the untreated controls (P = 0.032). A high concentration (500 mug/mL) of B(0)C decreased COMT expression to 79%, 94% and 90% of untreated, baseline control levels in the three cell lines, respectively. B(0)C and B(0) did not increase cell growth in the cancer cell lines evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: At clinically achievable concentrations only B(0)C significantly inhibited COMT activity and increased CE concentrations. Short-term exposure did not alter the rate of cancer cell growth. Confirmation is needed to determine the clinical impact of long-term exposure to and the use of echinocandins with catechol functional groups.","['Julius, Justin M', 'Gaikwad, Anjali', 'Lowry, Amy', 'Lewis, Russell E', 'Lozano, Richard D', 'Dalrymple, John L', 'Coleman, Robert L', 'Smith, Judith A']","['Julius JM', 'Gaikwad A', 'Lowry A', 'Lewis RE', 'Lozano RD', 'Dalrymple JL', 'Coleman RL', 'Smith JA']","['Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111130,England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Carcinogens/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*chemically induced/*secondary', 'Catechol O-Methyltransferase/metabolism', '*Catechol O-Methyltransferase Inhibitors', 'Catechols/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Echinocandins/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Estradiol/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2011/12/02 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/12/02 06:00'],"['2011/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['dkr494 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkr494 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2012 Feb;67(2):422-9. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkr494.

DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. ANIMALS: 31 adult Holstein dairy cows. PROCEDURES: Cows were randomly assigned to a control (immediate slaughter) group or a 28-day or 56-day feeding group. Cows in the feeding groups received a high-energy feed and were weighed every 7 days. Carcasses were evaluated by USDA employees. Fecal and blood samples were collected at the start and end of the feeding periods. RESULTS: Body condition score and adjusted preliminary yield grade were significantly increased in both feeding groups, compared with values for the control group; body weight, hot carcass weight, dressing percentage, and ribeye area were significantly increased after 56 days, but not after 28 days, compared with values for the control group. Average daily gain and marbling score were significantly lower after feeding for 28 days versus after 56 days. Prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 shedding in feces decreased from 14% to 5.6%, but this difference was not significant. Cows seropositive for antibodies against bovine leukemia virus that had signs of lymphoma and lame cows had a low average daily gain. Net loss was $71.32/cow and $112.80/cow for the 28-day and 56-day feeding groups, respectively.

We determined the reliability of restricted panel of cell markers to identify EPT-ALL using a previously classified cohort. Then, we applied the cell marker profile that best discriminated ETP-ALL to a cohort of 91 patients with T-ALL enrolled in the Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group L99-15 study, which included allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for patients with poor prednisone response. Five of the 91 patients (5.5%) met the ETP-ALL criteria. There were no significant differences in presenting clinical features between these and the remaining 86 patients. Response to early remission induction therapy was inferior in ETP-ALL as compared with T-ALL.

Therefore we performed a retrospective, descriptive and transversal study to investigate the drugs used in patients with AML who were admitted at the Hospital del Nino DIF from 2007 to 2008. Data were collected from hospital. The data included demographic, clinical data and drug usage. A total of 13 patients (12 male and 1 female) were included (prevalence of 16.5% among all cancers in the hospital). The mean age of patients was 6.2 +/- 4.6 years. The mortality rate was 30.8%. Twelve different drugs were given to the patients (10 antineoplastic agents, ondansetron and folinic acid). The median number of drugs/inpatient was 5.4 (range 3-9). Four-hundred thirty-one doses of antineoplastic drugs were administered in 409 sessions. The most used were cytarabine (55.9 %), followed by doxorubicin (7.2 %) and vincristine (6.7 %). Three-hundred twenty-four doses of ondansetron were administered in 409 sessions. We conclude that AML is common in our hospital with a high mortality rate.

A retrospective study was conducted from January 2005 to December 2007, and therapeutic management determined in 415 cases reviewed by the attending physicians of the oncology service. In the government-based hospital, 60 different types of cancer were found among 273 patients diagnosed. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had the greatest incidence (30%), followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma (9%), retinoblastoma (7%), neuroblastoma (6%), and osteosarcoma (6%). The entire number of chemotherapy sessions was 7575. Drugs most frequently employed included etoposide (577), followed by methotrexate (575), vincristine (483), cyclophosphamide (312), and cytarabine (277). The economic status among these patients was mainly of limited resources and represented 80% of the total number of patients. The types of cancer found in the private hospital were similar, however the drugs used were predominantly cyclophosphamide (416), doxorubicin (382), 5-fluorouracil (368), paclitaxel (237) and cisplatin (128). The types of cancer were similar in both hospitals and reflected the incidence among the entire population in Mexico, since acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and retinoblastoma, were the types most represented. However, the treatment schemes differed; the chemotherapeutic agents used in the private hospital were rather more specific but significantly more expensive than those employed in the government hospital.","['Calderon Guzman, David', 'Juarez Olguin, Hugo', 'Guevara Zempoalteca, Angeles', 'Juarez Jacobo, Arturo', 'Segura Abarca, Lourdes', 'Barragan Mejia, Gerardo', 'Hernandez Garcia, Ernestina']","['Calderon Guzman D', 'Juarez Olguin H', 'Guevara Zempoalteca A', 'Juarez Jacobo A', 'Segura Abarca L', 'Barragan Mejia G', 'Hernandez Garcia E']","['Laboratorio Neuroquimica, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico D.F., Mexico. solodavid2001@yahoo.com.mx']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Proc West Pharmacol Soc,Proceedings of the Western Pharmacology Society,7505899,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2009/01/01 00:00,2011/12/16 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Proc West Pharmacol Soc. 2009;52:26-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BH3 mimetic ABT-737 antagonizes the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 but not Mcl-1 or Bfl-1. Previously, it was shown that CD40-stimulated CLL cells were resistant to ABT-737. We aimed to define which antiapoptotic proteins determine resistance to ABT-737 in CLL and whether combination of known antileukemia drugs and ABT-737 was able to induce apoptosis of CD40-stimulated CLL cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To mimic the LN microenvironment, PB lymphocytes of CLL patients were cultured on feeder cells expressing CD40L and treated with ABT-737 with or without various drugs. In addition, we carried out overexpression or knockdown of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins in immortalized primary B cells. RESULTS: Upon CD40 stimulation patient-specific variations in ABT-737 sensitivity correlated with differences in levels of Mcl-1 and its antagonist Noxa. Knockdown of Noxa, as well as Mcl-1 overexpression, corroborated the importance of the Noxa/Mcl-1 ratio in determining the response to ABT-737. Inhibition of NF-kappaB resulted in increased Noxa levels and enhanced sensitivity to ABT-737. Interestingly, increasing the Noxa/Mcl-1 ratio, by decreasing Mcl-1 (dasatinib and roscovitine) or increasing Noxa levels (fludarabine and bortezomib), resulted in synergy with ABT-737. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the Noxa/Mcl-1 balance determines sensitivity to ABT-737 in CD40-stimulated CLL cells. These data provide a rationale to investigate the combination of drugs which enhance the Noxa/Mcl-1 balance with ABT-737 to eradicate CLL in chemoresistant niches.","['Tromp, Jacqueline M', 'Geest, Christian R', 'Breij, Esther C W', 'Elias, Judith A', 'van Laar, Jacoline', 'Luijks, Dieuwertje M', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Beaumont, Tim', 'van Oers, Marinus H J', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Tromp JM', 'Geest CR', 'Breij EC', 'Elias JA', 'van Laar J', 'Luijks DM', 'Kater AP', 'Beaumont T', 'van Oers MH', 'Eldering E']","['Departments of Hematology and Experimental Immunology, and Cell Biology and Histology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.m.tromp@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111129,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism/physiology', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,2011/12/01 06:00,2012/08/02 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-1440 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1440 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jan 15;18(2):487-98. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1440.

In MM, it has been demonstrated that proteasome inhibition can trigger the accumulation of Mcl-1, which has been shown to confer MM cell resistance to bortezomib-induced lethality. However, the mechanisms involved in this unwanted Mcl-1 accumulation are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the unwanted Mcl-1 accumulation could be induced by the unfolded protein response (UPR) and to elucidate the role of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in regulating Mcl-1 expression. Using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, we found that the translation of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4), an important effector of the UPR, was also greatly enhanced by proteasome inhibition. ChIP analysis further revealed that bortezomib stimulated binding of ATF4 to a regulatory site (at position -332 to -324) at the promoter of the Mcl-1 gene. Knocking down ATF4 was paralleled by down-regulation of Mcl-1 induction by bortezomib and significantly increased bortezomib-induced apoptosis. These data identify the UPR and, more specifically, its ATF4 branch as an important mechanism mediating up-regulation of Mcl-1 by proteasome inhibition.","['Hu, Jinsong', 'Dang, Nana', 'Menu, Eline', 'De Bruyne, Elke', 'Xu, Dehui', 'Van Camp, Ben', 'Van Valckenborgh, Els', 'Vanderkerken, Karin']","['Hu J', 'Dang N', 'Menu E', 'De Bruyne E', 'Xu D', 'Van Camp B', 'Van Valckenborgh E', 'Vanderkerken K']","[""Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111129,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects/*physiology']",,2011/12/01 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40942-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-366492 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 19;119(3):826-37. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-366492.

In normal B-lymphopoiesis, Pax-5 accomplishes a dual function by activating B-cell commitment genes while concomitantly repressing non-B-lineage genes. Given the pivotal importance of Pax-5-mediated processes in B-cell development, an aberrant regulation of Pax5 expression has consistently been associated with B-cell cancers, namely, lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemias. More recently, Pax-5 gene expression has been proposed to influence carcinogenic events in tissues of nonlymphoid origin by promoting cell growth and survival. However, in other cases, Pax-5 products have opposing effects on proliferative activity, thus redefining its generally accepted role as an oncogene in cancer. In this review, we attempt to summarize recent findings about the function and regulation of Pax-5 gene products in B-cell development and related cancers.

F14512 was identified as a selective anticancer agent with a broad spectrum of antitumor activities and is currently undergoing phase I clinical trial in onco-hematology. However, the mechanism by which F14512 exerts its selective effects on neoplastic cells remains poorly understood. In this study, using mainly P388 leukemia cells, we showed that activation of the DNA damage response by F14512 did not induce immediate apoptosis but resulted in an early growth arrest. F14512-induced G2 arrest was accompanied by the appearance of a senescence-like phenotype (characterized by an increased beta-galactosidase staining) with up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16, and cyclin D1. The early senescence-based cell cycle block was characterized by a marked increase of the level of the IAP protein survivin, but not cIAP2, in P388 cells as well as in three other leukemia and melanoma cell types. The Thr(34)-phosphorylated form of survivin was observed within 4 h after F14512 exposure. Inhibition of survivin by siRNA resulted in a switch from senescence-like growth arrest to apoptosis.

Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of the adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), a severe malignancy that has a poor prognosis and exhibits resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Although the mechanisms involved in cell transformation by HTLV-1 have not been completely clarified, it is generally thought that Tax plays a pivotal role in the process. We have previously proposed that a functionally active Ras protein is needed for efficient anti-apoptotic activity of Tax. In this study we report data indicating that the apoptotic resistance of cells expressing Tax, constitutively or transiently, is linked to the intracellular levels of Ras-GTP. Indeed, we found that Tax-positive cells have a high content of active Ras, and that inhibition of Ras signaling, using the antagonist farnesyl thyosalicylic acid (FTS), increases their sensitivity to apoptosis. FTS treatment was also accompanied by a decrease in ERK, but not Akt, phosphorylation. Thus, all together our data suggest that the interaction between Tax and Ras could be important to ATLL pathogenesis, and indicate Ras as a possible target for therapeutic intervention in ATLL patients.","['Stoppa, Giovanna', 'Rumiato, Enrica', 'Saggioro, Daniela']","['Stoppa G', 'Rumiato E', 'Saggioro D']","['Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, via Gattamelata 64 35128, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism/physiology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",PMC3279637,2011/12/01 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0676-z [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2012 Mar;17(3):219-28. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0676-z.,,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to select recipients without donor-specific antibodies the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC-) crossmatch as the standard procedure was established. As a functional assay it strongly depends on the availability of isolated donor lymphocytes and in particular on their vitality. However, due to several diseases or pharmacological treatment of a given recipient unexpected ""false-positive"" results of the CDC-crossmatch may arise. We here present three groups of patients which demonstrate the limits of the conventional crossmatch. 1) Kidney recipients before living donations exhibited positive CDC-reactions due to their conditioning using the therapeutical anti-CD20 mAb Rituximab (n=7), routinely used to deplete B-cells, or the anti-CD25 mAb basiliximab (n=2) to inhibit the proliferation of activated T-cells. 2) Recipients suffering from various leukaemias (n=5) exhibited ""positive"" CDC-crossmatches using PBL of the donors, although formerly these patients had never shown anti-HLA antibodies. Instead of donor-specific allo-antibodies, cytostatic agents such as 6-mercaptopurine led to an unspecific cell death. 3) Patients projected for post mortem or living kidney donations (n=44) exhibited ""positive"" CDC-crossmatch results which were not in accordance with their former antibody status and, partially, with high degrees of HLA-matching. These implausible results were due to underlying auto-immune diseases, mainly of the systemic immune complex type III such as lupus erythematosus, mainly leading to false-positive B-cell crossmatches by immune complexes binding to Fcgamma-receptors. In all these 58 cases the alternatively performed ELISA-based ""Antibody Monitoring System"" (AMS-) crossmatch assay was not artifically affected, suggesting that this assay may be comprehensively established at least for the cases described.","['Schlaf, G', 'Mauz-Korholz, C', 'Ott, U', 'Leike, S', 'Altermann, W']","['Schlaf G', 'Mauz-Korholz C', 'Ott U', 'Leike S', 'Altermann W']","['Tissue Typing Laboratory, University Hospital Halle, Germany. gerald.schlaf@medizin.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Germany', 'Graft Rejection/immunology/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', '*Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/*blood', '*Kidney Transplantation/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/12/01 06:00,2012/04/28 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14670/HH-27.31 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2012 Jan;27(1):31-8. doi: 10.14670/HH-27.31.,,,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most older patients receive only supportive care, the principal prognostic factor among the presumably healthier treated patients is cytogenetics, with a monosomal karyotype conferring a particularly poor prognosis. However other factors are also informative and several systems incorporating multiple factors have been devised to help guide the fundamental decision as to whether a patient should receive standard therapy or, much more frequently, investigational therapy. Although physicians may be reluctant to await results of cytogenetic analysis and molecular markers (NPM, FLT3), data suggest no harm is done by waiting for these results to become available; certainly the risk of delaying therapy is less than the risk of giving a patient 3 + 7 when the risk of treatment-related mortality (TRM) is greater than the chance of a beneficial response. Nonetheless, in general the risk of TRM is less than that of resistance to therapy, even in patients aged >/=75 years. Perhaps, however, focusing on the former, there is an increasing tendency to administer azacitidine or decitabine to older patients. However there is little to suggest that on average these drugs by themselves convey what many patients would consider medically meaningful improvements in survival. Hence these drugs should not reduce the imperative of putting older patients on trials involving new drugs. Finally, confirming everyday observation, age alone is a very inadequate predictor of outcome and is likely a surrogate for other covariates. Accordingly, the common practice of assigning patients to treatment protocols based solely on age leaves much to be desired.","['Estey, Elihu']",['Estey E'],"['Division of Hematology, University of Washington Medical Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. eestey@uw.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111103,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

These reactive molecules contain an oxygen and include H(2;)O(2;) (hydrogen peroxide), NO (nitric oxide), O(2;)(-) (oxide anion), peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), hydrochlorous acid (HOCl), and hydroxyl radical (OH(-)). Oxidative species are produced not only under pathological situations (cancers, ischemic/reperfusion, neurologic and cardiovascular pathologies, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases , etc...) but also during physiological (non-pathological) situations such as cellular metabolism. Indeed, ROS play important roles in many cellular signaling pathways (proliferation, cell activation, migration etc..). ROS can be detrimental (it is then referred to as ""oxidative and nitrosative stress"") when produced in high amounts in the intracellular compartments and cells generally respond to ROS by upregulating antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione (GSH) that protects them by converting dangerous free radicals to harmless molecules (i.e. water). Vitamins C and E have also been described as ROS scavengers (antioxidants). Free radicals are beneficial in low amounts. Macrophage and neutrophils-mediated immune responses involve the production and release of NO, which inhibits viruses, pathogens and tumor proliferation. NO also reacts with other ROS and thus, also has a role as a detoxifier (ROS scavenger). Finally NO acts on vessels to regulate blood flow which is important for the adaptation of muscle to prolonged exercise. Several publications have also demonstrated that ROS are involved in insulin sensitivity. Numerous methods to evaluate ROS production are available. In this article we propose several simple, fast, and affordable assays; these assays have been validated by many publications and are routinely used to detect ROS or its effects in mammalian cells. While some of these assays detect multiple ROS, others detect only a single ROS.","['Wu, Danli', 'Yotnda, Patricia']","['Wu D', 'Yotnda P']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA142664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA142664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Video-Audio Media']",20111121,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fluoresceins/chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*analysis/*metabolism']",PMC3308605,2011/12/01 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['3357 [pii]', '10.3791/3357 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2011 Nov 21;(57). pii: 3357. doi: 10.3791/3357.,,,"[""0 (2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate)"", '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells with exponential growth in routine culture were exposed to 50, 200, 400, 800 micromol/L CoCl(2) to mimic hypoxic conditions. At 24, 48, and 72 h, the cells were collected for morphological observation, MTT assay, and real-time quantitative PCR for HIF-1alpha mRNA expression. RESULTS: Compared with the cells without CoCl(2) treatment, the cells with CoCl(2) exposure exhibited obvious morphological changes and a significant growth inhibition which increased with CoCl(2)concentration and exposure time. At low concentrations (50-200 micromol/L), CoCl(2) treatment caused a dose- and time-dependent enhancement of HIF-1alpha expression in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia mimicked by CoCl(2) exposure significantly inhibits the proliferation of HL-60 cells, and at the non-toxic doses, CoCl(2) dose- and time-dependently increases the expression of HIF-1alpha. The mimicked hypoxic conditions do not cause differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Zhang, Ya-li', 'Xu, Lin', 'Qiu, Jian', 'Li, Zhi-liang', 'Wang, Jian-qing', 'Li, Rui', 'Liu, Hui', 'Zhu, Hong-min']","['Zhang YL', 'Xu L', 'Qiu J', 'Li ZL', 'Wang JQ', 'Li R', 'Liu H', 'Zhu HM']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang 550004, China. zhangyl20011002@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,IM,"['Cell Hypoxia', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cobalt/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",,2011/12/01 06:00,2013/05/07 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2011 Nov;31(11):1890-4.,,,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', 'EVS87XF13W (cobaltous chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: SH2-DED fusion gene and its mutant SH2mt-DED were amplified by splicing PCR and cloned into pAdTrack-CMV plasmid separately to construct the shuttle plasmids pAdT-SD-EGFP and pAdT-SmD-EGFP, respectively. After Pme I digestion, the shuttle plasmids were transformed into ultra-competent pAd5F35-BJ5183 cells to generate defective adenovirus vectors pAd5F35-SD-EGFP and pAd5F35- SmD-EGFP by homologous recombination. The vectors, linearized by Pac I digestion, were further transfected into AD293 cells for packaging and amplified by infecting AD293 cells repeatedly. K562 cells were then infected by the recombinant adenoviruses and the expression of SD was detected by Western blotting. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to investigate the effect of Ad5F35-SD-EGFP and Ad5F35-SmD-EGFP on the proliferation of K562 cells. RESULTS: The recombinant adenovirus vectors pAd5F35-SD-EGFP and pAd5F35-SmD-EGFP were constructed correctly, with a titer reaching 1.5x10(12) pfu/ml after amplification. Western blotting demonstrated that the target proteins were effectively expressed in transfected K562 cells.

We, therefore, undertook a comprehensive analysis of reports of adverse drug interactions (ADIs) with the combination of vincristine and azole antifungal agents, established a new classification, and provided a detailed summary of these toxicities. In patients who had sufficient data for analysis, 47 individuals were identified who had an ADI with the combination of vincristine and antifungal azoles. Median age was 8 years (1.3-68 years) with 33(70%) having a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Median time to ADI with vincristine was 9.5 days with itraconazole, 13.5 days posaconazole and 30 days voriconazole. The median number of vincristine doses preceding the ADI was 2 doses with itraconazole, 3 doses posaconazole and 2 doses voriconazole. The most common severe ADIs included gastrointestinal toxicity, peripheral neuropathy, hyponatremia/SIADH, autonomic neuropathy and seizures. Recovery from these ADIs occurred in 80.6% of patients. We recommend using alternative antifungal agents if possible in patients receiving vincristine to avoid this serious and potentially life-threatening drug interaction.","['Moriyama, Brad', 'Henning, Stacey A', 'Leung, Janice', 'Falade-Nwulia, Oluwaseun', 'Jarosinski, Paul', 'Penzak, Scott R', 'Walsh, Thomas J']","['Moriyama B', 'Henning SA', 'Leung J', 'Falade-Nwulia O', 'Jarosinski P', 'Penzak SR', 'Walsh TJ']","['NIH Clinical Center Pharmacy Department, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Z99 CL999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20111129,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azoles/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC3345292,2011/12/01 06:00,2012/10/20 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1439-0507.2011.02158.x [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2012 Jul;55(4):290-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2011.02158.x.

EoL-1-conditioned medium was found to promote the growth of HUVEC in a time-dependent manner. The growth stimulating activity was due to the production of VEGF by the EoL-1 cells. The production of VEGF was correlated with the enhanced expression of the phosphorylated form of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p-ERKs) and the upregulated expression of VEGF mRNA. Furthermore, BaP-induced expression of VEGF mRNA was reduced by the ERK inhibitor PD98059.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin affects the cell adhesion, migration, and gene transcription in many types of human cancer cells, including acute myeloid leukemia cells with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD-AML). Here, we investigated the relationship between three tyrosine residues (Y86, Y142, and Y654) in beta-catenin and oncogenic FLT3/ITD kinase. In the experiments using COS-7 cells expressing FLT3/ITD and Wt or mutant beta-catenin, FLT3/ITD phosphorylated Y654, and this residue was essential for beta-catenin's nuclear localization by FLT3/ITD. Promoter-reporter assays demonstrated that Y654 phosphorylation of beta-catenin was closely related to TCF transcriptional activity. In vitro kinase assays, using recombinant FLT3 and biotinylated beta-catenin peptide including Y654 showed that FLT3 directly phosphorylated Y654 of beta-catenin. These results explain how FLT3/ITD affects the tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity of beta-catenin. Targeting Y654 phosphorylation may lead to the development of novel approaches to therapy for FLT3/ITD-AML.","['Kajiguchi, Tomohiro', 'Katsumi, Akira', 'Tanizaki, Ryohei', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Kajiguchi T', 'Katsumi A', 'Tanizaki R', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Japan.tomokaji@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120104,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tyrosine/*chemistry', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/12/01 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01738.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Apr;88(4):314-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01738.x.

Mutations in fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene including internal tandem duplication (ITD) and point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) as well as in nucleoplasmin (NPM1) gene are associated with pathogenesis of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Several reports have demonstrated high incidences of the FLT3 and NPM1 mutations in adult AML patients. Since the pathogenesis of pediatric AML is different from that of adult and the FLT3 and NPM1 mutations have not been well characterized in childhood AML. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the frequencies of FLT3 and NPM1 mutations in 64 newly diagnosed childhood AML patients. All blood and bone marrow samples were previously diagnosed with AML by using flow cytometry and/or cytochemistry. FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD were detected by PCR and PCR-RFLP methods, respectively. The NPM1 mutation was analyzed by PCR and direct DNA sequencing. The FLT3 mutations were detected in 7 of 64 (11.1%), including FLT3-ITD in 4 of 64 (6.3%) and FLT-TKD in 3 of 62 (4.8%). The NPM1 mutation was not detected in this cohort. By multivariate analysis, white blood cell counts, peripheral blood and bone marrow blast cell counts at diagnosis were significantly higher in children with FLT3-ITD (P<0.05). In addition, the median percentage of CD117 was significantly higher in leukemic blast cells with FLT3-ITD than those with wild type (P=0.01). We did not find any FLT3 mutations in children aged less than 5 years. The AML M3 cell type was most frequently associated with FLT3 gene mutations (50%). In conclusion, the FLT3 mutations was found in 11.1% but none of NPM1 mutation was detected in Thai children with AML. These data support the hypothesis of different biology and pathogenesis between adult and childhood AML.","['Mukda, Ekchol', 'Pintaraks, Katsarin', 'Sawangpanich, Rachchadol', 'Wiangnon, Surapon', 'Pakakasama, Samart']","['Mukda E', 'Pintaraks K', 'Sawangpanich R', 'Wiangnon S', 'Pakakasama S']","['Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Thammasat University, Pathum Thani, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2011/12/01 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2011;12(7):1827-31.,,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from the population-based national cancer registry were consolidated for the said nine-year period and analyzed. A breakdown of the incidence by year and gender have been given. Age-standardized incidence of common cancers in Oman and their age-specific rates have been tabulated. Further, a graphical comparison between common cancers in Omani men and women have been made with those of other Gulf countries and some developed countries. RESULTS: There were a total of 8,005 (4,224 males and 3,781 females) cases reported and registered in the registry from January 1998 till December 2006 with a male female ratio of 1.1:1. The crude incidence rate was 49.4 per 100,000 males and 45.7 per 100,000 females. The corresponding age-standardized rates were 91.4 and 80.4 per 100,000 in males and females respectively.

Most single-nucleotide resolution RNA structure determination technologies cannot be used to analyze RNA from scarce biological samples, like viral genomes.

For analysis of fluorescently labeled cDNAs generated in high-sensitivity SHAPE experiments, we developed a two-color capillary electrophoresis approach with zeptomole molecular detection limits and subfemtomole sensitivity for complete SHAPE experiments involving hundreds of individual RNA structure measurements. High-sensitivity SHAPE data correlated closely (R = 0.89) with data obtained by conventional capillary electrophoresis. Using high-sensitivity SHAPE, we determined the dimeric structure of the XMRV packaging domain, examined dynamic interactions between the packaging domain RNA and viral nucleocapsid protein inside virion particles, and identified the packaging signal for this virus. Despite extensive sequence differences between XMRV and the intensively studied Moloney murine leukemia virus, architectures of the regulatory domains are similar and reveal common principles of gammaretrovirus RNA genome packaging.","['Grohman, Jacob K', 'Kottegoda, Sumith', 'Gorelick, Robert J', 'Allbritton, Nancy L', 'Weeks, Kevin M']","['Grohman JK', 'Kottegoda S', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Allbritton NL', 'Weeks KM']","['Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-3290, USA.']",['eng'],"['HHSN2612008-00001E/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA139599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM064803-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM064803/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM064803/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM064803-08/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM064803-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111129,United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Base Sequence', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', '*Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*genetics']",PMC3241870,2011/12/01 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja2070945 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Dec 21;133(50):20326-34. doi: 10.1021/ja2070945.

PBX1 is a TALE homeodomain protein involved in the development of different types of cancers. The estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is central to the development of two-thirds of all breast cancers. Here we demonstrate that PBX1 acts as a pioneer factor and is essential for the ERalpha-mediated transcriptional response driving aggressive tumors in breast cancer. Indeed, PBX1 expression correlates with ERalpha in primary breast tumors, and breast cancer cells depleted of PBX1 no longer proliferate following estrogen stimulation. Profiling PBX1 recruitment and chromatin accessibility across the genome of breast cancer cells through ChIP-seq and FAIRE-seq reveals that PBX1 is loaded and promotes chromatin openness at specific genomic locations through its capacity to read specific epigenetic signatures. Accordingly, PBX1 guides ERalpha recruitment to a specific subset of sites. Expression profiling studies demonstrate that PBX1 controls over 70% of the estrogen response. More importantly, the PBX1-dependent transcriptional program is associated with poor-outcome in breast cancer patients. Correspondingly, PBX1 expression alone can discriminate a priori the outcome in ERalpha-positive breast cancer patients. These features are markedly different from the previously characterized ERalpha-associated pioneer factor FoxA1. Indeed, PBX1 is the only pioneer factor identified to date that discriminates outcome such as metastasis in ERalpha-positive breast cancer patients. Together our results reveal that PBX1 is a novel pioneer factor defining aggressive ERalpha-positive breast tumors, as it guides ERalpha genomic activity to unique genomic regions promoting a transcriptional program favorable to breast cancer progression.","['Magnani, Luca', 'Ballantyne, Elizabeth B', 'Zhang, Xiaoyang', 'Lupien, Mathieu']","['Magnani L', 'Ballantyne EB', 'Zhang X', 'Lupien M']","['Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2P30CA023108-32/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111117,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3219601,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/03/13 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1002368 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-11-00689 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2011 Nov;7(11):e1002368. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002368.

Apoptosis of inflammatory neutrophils and their clearance are critical control points for termination of the inflammatory response. Evasion of neutrophil apoptosis aggravates local injury and leads to persistent tissue damage. The short-lived prosurvival Bcl-2 family protein, Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1), is instrumental in controlling apoptosis and consequently neutrophil lifespan in response to rapidly changing environmental cues during inflammation.

In many inflammatory fibrotic diseases, such as Systemic Scleroderma (SSc) and cGVHD with fibrotic features, an abnormal activation of transforming growth factor (TGFbeta) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) pathways have been observed. Tyrosin Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs), which are currently used for treatment of patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), share potent antifibrotic and antiinflammatory properties, being powerful dual inhibitors of both PDGF-R and TGFbeta pathways. Moreover accumulating in vitro data confirm that TKIs, interacting with the TCR and other signalling molecules, carry potent immunomodulatory effects, being involved in both T-cell and B-cell response. Translation to the clinical setting revealed that treatment with Imatinib can achieve encouraging responses in patients with autoimmune diseases and steroid-refractory cGVHD, showing a favourable toxicity profile. While the exact mechanisms leading to such efficacy are still under investigation, use of TKIs in the context of clinical trials should be promoted, aiming to evaluate the biological changes induced in vivo by TKIs and to assess the long term outcome of these patients. Second-generation TKIs, with more favourable toxicity profile are under evaluation in the same setting.","['Olivieri, Jacopo', 'Coluzzi, Sabrina', 'Attolico, Imma', 'Olivieri, Attilio']","['Olivieri J', 'Coluzzi S', 'Attolico I', 'Olivieri A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, 60121 Ancona, Italy. a.olivieri@univpm.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111025,United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC3217614,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1100/2011/924954 [doi]'],ppublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2011;11:1908-31. doi: 10.1100/2011/924954.

We used the approach to produce mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) in a rice suspension cell system. The promoter for the alphaAmy3 amylase gene, which is induced strongly by sugar depletion, drove the expression of mGM-CSF. The resulting recombinant protein was fused with the alphaAmy3 signal peptide and was secreted into the culture medium. The production of rice-derived mGM-CSF (rmGM-CSF) was scaled up successfully in a 2-L bioreactor, in which the highest yield of rmGM-CSF was 24.6 mg/L. Due to post-translational glycosylation, the molecular weight of rmGM-CSF was larger than that of recombinant mGM-CSF produced in Escherichia coli.

The schistosome genome encodes ~13,000 protein encoding genes for which the function of only a minority is understood. There is a valuable role for transgenesis in functional genomic investigations of these new schistosome gene sequences. In gain-of-function approaches, transgenesis can lead to integration of transgenes into the schistosome genome which can facilitate insertional mutagenesis screens. By contrast, transgene driven, vector-based RNA interference (RNAi) offers powerful loss-of-function manipulations. Our laboratory has focused on development of tools to facilitate schistosome transgenesis. We have investigated the utility of retroviruses and transposons to transduce schistosomes. Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV) can transduce developmental stages of S. mansoni including eggs. We have also observed that the piggyBac transposon is transpositionally active in schistosomes. Approaches with both VSVG-MLV and piggyBac have resulted in somatic transgenesis and have lead to integration of active reporter transgenes into schistosome chromosomes. These findings provided the first reports of integration of reporter transgenes into schistosome chromosomes. Experience with these systems is reviewed herewith, along with findings with transgene mediated RNAi and germ line transgenesis, in addition to pioneering and earlier reports of gene manipulation for schistosomes.","['Alrefaei, Yousef Noori', 'Okatcha, Tunika Ida', 'Skinner, Danielle Elaine', 'Brindley, Paul James']","['Alrefaei YN', 'Okatcha TI', 'Skinner DE', 'Brindley PJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI072773/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072773/S1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Brazil,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,7502619,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Chromosomes/genetics/virology', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA, Helminth/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Helminth/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'RNA Interference', 'Schistosoma japonicum/*genetics/virology', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*genetics/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification']",PMC3739710,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/06/27 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0074-02762011000700002 [pii]', '10.1590/s0074-02762011000700002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2011 Nov;106(7):785-93. doi: 10.1590/s0074-02762011000700002.,,,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Helminth)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,['NIHMS493774'],,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen newly diagnosed patients were included with either multiple myeloma or acute leukemia. Patients were repeatedly sampled from nares, throat, axillae, and perineum, and the CoNS isolates obtained were phenotypically characterized together with blood isolates of CoNS using the PhenePlate system (PhP). During the treatment a gradual reduction in the heterogeneity of colonizing CoNS was observed as well as an inter-patient accumulation of phenotypically related and multi-drug-resistant CoNS. These clusters of CoNS persisted for 2-3 months after the end of therapy. Ten positive blood cultures of CoNS were obtained and in the majority of these cases CoNS of the same PhP type were found in superficial cultures collected prior to the blood culture sampling. In conclusion, the study shows that therapy for hematological malignancy is associated with a homogenization of colonizing CoNS isolates and that this acquired flora of CoNS is persistent several months after the end of therapy. Furthermore, the results suggest that the source of bloodstream infections of CoNS in hematological patients is colonizing CoNS of the skin and mucosa.","['Ahlstrand, E', 'Persson, L', 'Tidefelt, U', 'Soderquist, B']","['Ahlstrand E', 'Persson L', 'Tidefelt U', 'Soderquist B']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Orebro University Hospital, School of Health and Medical Sciences, Orebro University, 701 85, Orebro, Sweden. erik.ahlstrand@orebroll.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111129,Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Axilla/microbiology', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Carrier State/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Coagulase/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Nose/microbiology', 'Perineum/microbiology', 'Pharynx/microbiology', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Staphylococcal Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Staphylococcus/classification/enzymology/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10096-011-1493-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2012 Jul;31(7):1679-87. doi: 10.1007/s10096-011-1493-6.

To clarify the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects of ARBs with different peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma)-activating potencies, we focused our study on telmisartan, an ARB with the highest PPARgamma-stimulating activity. METHODS: Human circulating monocytes and monocytic THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) cells were exposed to 50 ng/ml LPS with or without pre-incubation with telmisartan. AT1 mRNA and protein expressions were determined by real-time PCR and membrane receptor binding assay, respectively. The expression of pro-inflammatory factors was determined by real-time PCR, western blot analysis and ELISA. PPARgamma activation was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and its role was determined by pharmacological inhibition and PPARgamma gene silencing. RESULTS: In human monocytes, telmisartan significantly attenuated the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory factors, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin E2, nuclear factor-kappaB activation and reactive oxygen species formation. In THP-1 cells, telmisartan significantly reduced LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inhibitor of kappaB-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 gene expression and MCP-1-directed migration. Telmisartan also stimulated the expression of the PPARgamma target genes cluster of differentiation 36 and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 in monocytes. The anti-inflammatory effects of telmisartan were prevented by both PPARgamma antagonism and PPARgamma gene silencing. Anti-inflammatory effects of ARBs correlated with their PPARgamma agonist potency. CONCLUSION: Our observations demonstrate that in human monocytes, ARBs inhibit the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response to a major extent through the PPARgamma activation pathway and may be beneficial for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in which inflammation plays a major role.","['Pang, Tao', 'Benicky, Julius', 'Wang, Juan', 'Orecna, Martina', 'Sanchez-Lemus, Enrique', 'Saavedra, Juan M']","['Pang T', 'Benicky J', 'Wang J', 'Orecna M', 'Sanchez-Lemus E', 'Saavedra JM']","['Section on Pharmacology, Division of Intramural Research Programs, Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. pangt@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Z99 MH999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,England,J Hypertens,Journal of hypertension,8306882,IM,"['Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Probes', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*drug effects', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'PPAR gamma/*agonists', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telmisartan']",PMC3237779,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/HJH.0b013e32834dde5f [doi]'],ppublish,J Hypertens. 2012 Jan;30(1):87-96. doi: 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32834dde5f.,,,"['0 (Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', 'U5SYW473RQ (Telmisartan)']",,,,,['NIHMS341615'],,,,,,,,,,

In humans, increased concentrations of soluble BAFF are found in different pathological conditions, which may be as diverse as autoimmune diseases, B cell malignancies, and primary Ab deficiencies (PAD). Because the mechanisms that regulate BAFF levels are not well understood, we newly developed a set of mAbs against human BAFF to study the parameters that determine the concentrations of soluble BAFF in circulation. Patients with PAD, including severe functional B cell defects such as BTK, BAFF-R, or TACI deficiency, were found to have higher BAFF levels than asplenic individuals, patients after anti-CD20 B cell depletion, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, or healthy donors. In a comparable manner, mice constitutively expressing human BAFF were found to have higher concentrations of BAFF in the absence than in the presence of B cells. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that BAFF steady-state concentrations mainly depend on the number of B cells as well as on the expression of BAFF-binding receptors. Because most patients with PAD have high levels of circulating BAFF, the increase in BAFF concentrations cannot compensate defects in B cell development and function.","['Kreuzaler, Matthias', 'Rauch, Melanie', 'Salzer, Ulrich', 'Birmelin, Jennifer', 'Rizzi, Marta', 'Grimbacher, Bodo', 'Plebani, Alessandro', 'Lougaris, Vassilios', 'Quinti, Isabella', 'Thon, Vojtech', 'Litzman, Jiri', 'Schlesier, Michael', 'Warnatz, Klaus', 'Thiel, Jens', 'Rolink, Antonius G', 'Eibel, Hermann']","['Kreuzaler M', 'Rauch M', 'Salzer U', 'Birmelin J', 'Rizzi M', 'Grimbacher B', 'Plebani A', 'Lougaris V', 'Quinti I', 'Thon V', 'Litzman J', 'Schlesier M', 'Warnatz K', 'Thiel J', 'Rolink AG', 'Eibel H']","['Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, 4058 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111128,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/blood/*immunology', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor/*immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/blood/*immunology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew']",,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1102321 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1102321 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Jan 1;188(1):497-503. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1102321.

Cell mediated immunity is impaired, yet the mechanism of this impairment has remained elusive. The HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) gene is encoded in the minus strand of the viral DNA and is constitutively expressed in infected cells and ATL cells. To test the hypothesis that HBZ contributes to HTLV-1-associated immunodeficiency, we challenged transgenic mice that express the HBZ gene in CD4 T cells (HBZ-Tg mice) with herpes simplex virus type 2 or Listeria monocytogenes, and evaluated cellular immunity to these pathogens. HBZ-Tg mice were more vulnerable to both infections than non-Tg mice. The acquired immune response phase was specifically suppressed, indicating that cellular immunity was impaired in HBZ-Tg mice. In particular, production of IFN-gamma by CD4 T cells was suppressed in HBZ-Tg mice. HBZ suppressed transcription from the IFN-gamma gene promoter in a CD4 T cell-intrinsic manner by inhibiting nuclear factor of activated T cells and the activator protein 1 signaling pathway. This study shows that HBZ inhibits CD4 T-cell responses by directly interfering with the host cell-signaling pathway, resulting in impaired cell-mediated immunity in vivo.","['Sugata, Kenji', 'Satou, Yorifumi', 'Yasunaga, Jun-ichirou', 'Hara, Hideki', 'Ohshima, Kouichi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Mitsuyama, Masao', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Sugata K', 'Satou Y', 'Yasunaga J', 'Hara H', 'Ohshima K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Mitsuyama M', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111128,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Herpes Simplex/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Herpesvirus 2, Human/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/*immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Listeria monocytogenes/pathogenicity', 'Listeriosis/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology']",PMC3257009,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38629-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-05-357459 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 12;119(2):434-44. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-05-357459.

Osteoblasts have been reported to be a critical cell type making up the HSC niche in vivo. Rac1 GTPase has been implicated in adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of osteoblast cell lines and is critical for HSC engraftment and retention. Recent data suggest a differential role of GTPases in endosteal/osteoblastic versus perivascular niche function. However, whether Rac signaling pathways are also necessary in the cell-extrinsic control of HSC function within the HM has not been examined. In the present study, genetic and inducible models of Rac deletion were used to demonstrate that Rac depletion causes impaired proliferation and induction of apoptosis in the OP9 cell line and in primary BM stromal cells.

The lineage of neutrophilic granulocytes in the bone marrow of patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia was very convenient for such study because the increased number of granulocytes in all developmental stages was satisfactory for heterochromatin density measurements. The morphology of leukaemic and non-leukaemic neutrophilic granulocytes is similar and each differentiation or maturation stage is easily identified. A markedly increasing heterochromatin density--condensation--in the peripheral nuclear region at the nuclear envelope accompanied both the differentiation and maturation of these cells. Thus, peripheral chromosomal territories at the nuclear envelope are important for both the differentiation and maturation process. In contrast, the heterochromatin density of nuclear central regions was already high in early differentiation stages and exhibited a less distinct increase during the differentiation, but was more apparent in late maturation stages representing the terminal differentiation. A limited number of maturing cells with persisting large heterochromatin density in central nuclear regions without markedly increased heterochromatin condensation at the nuclear periphery might represent a further maturation abnormality--asynchrony--during the granulocytic development. From the methodological point of view, both, the cytochemical method for the DNA demonstration and the panoptic May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining, are convenient for computer-assisted chromatin densitometry at the single-cell level.","['Smetana, K', 'Mikulenkova, D', 'Klamova, H']","['Smetana K', 'Mikulenkova D', 'Klamova H']","['Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. karel.smetana@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Heterochromatin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism']",,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/06/06 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['FB2011A0031 [pii]'],ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 2011;57(5):216-21.,,,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examined a series of 137 consecutive patients with mastocytosis (63 females and 74 males) referred to our center between 1988 and 2010. Almost all patients received prophylactic histamine receptor (HR1 and HR2) antagonists. RESULTS: Forty-two patients suffered from one or more mediator-related symptoms (hypotension, headache, flush, abdominal cramping, diarrhea) requiring therapy (SM(SY)). Severe life-threatening events (grade IV) occurred in 17 patients (12%). In 4 of these 17 patients, a deteriorating clinical course was recorded. One patient died of an apallic syndrome 1.5 years after an hymenoptera sting and cerebral hypoxia. One patient was disabled for months after an insect sting and cerebral hypoxia. Two patients with smoldering SM (SSM) suffered from severe recurrent hypotension requiring hospitalization and repeated resuscitation. Symptoms in these SSM patients did not respond to any of the antimediator-type drugs applied. However, after therapy with cladribine (2CdA), a major durable response was obtained in both cases. In patients with aggressive SM and mast cell leukemia (n = 6), life-threatening mediator-related events (grade IV) were not recorded. CONCLUSIONS: SM may be accompanied by life-threatening mediator-related symptoms. Most of these patients have indolent SM or SSM. In patients with SSM(SY) with uncontrolled symptoms (grade IV), therapy with 2CdA should be considered.","['Wimazal, Friedrich', 'Geissler, Philipp', 'Shnawa, Patrik', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter']","['Wimazal F', 'Geissler P', 'Shnawa P', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111125,Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anaphylaxis/*mortality', 'Antimetabolites/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/drug therapy/*mortality/*physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['000329218 [pii]', '10.1159/000329218 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2012;157(4):399-405. doi: 10.1159/000329218.

The majority of conditions presenting with early loss of teeth are serious and in some cases fatal. CASE REPORT: This is a case of premature exfoliation of primary teeth in a 4-yr-old female. On presentation her teeth were mobile and there was a history of gingival bleeding when biting into food. Hair loss and fatigue were also reported. Her medical history revealed she had dry skin but was otherwise fit and healthy. Extra-oral examination was unremarkable. Dental examination revealed she had a full complement of primary teeth with unusual spacing, generalised tooth mobility, halitosis and an orange extrinsic dicolouration. Her gingivae were inflamed in the 84 region. Radiographic examination revealed severe generalised bone loss. TREATMENT: She received periodontal care including regular scaling, a short course of metronidazole, preventative advice and continued monitoring. She was also sequentially referred to the departments of Dermatology, Paediatric Haematology, Immunology, Oral Microbiology and Oral Pathology for further investigation. Underlying disorders known to cause premature tooth loss were ruled out. FOLLOW-UP: Two years on, there has been early exfoliation of her 54, 51, 61, 62, 64, 71, 84 and 81 with no new progressive mobility of her remaining primary teeth. CONCLUSION: The commonest causes of premature tooth loss have been eliminated including Papillion-Lefevre syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, hypophosphatasia, Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, neutropenia and leukemia. Therefore, this fit and healthy 4-yr-old has an aggressive early onset periodontal condition with associated fatigue and hair loss. Diagnosis of associated systemic conditions is not straightforward in these cases and requires multi-disciplinary input.","['Sharma, G', 'Whatling, R']","['Sharma G', 'Whatling R']","['Department Paediatric Dentistry, Barts and the London NHS Trust, London, UK. geetanjali.sharma@bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Eur Arch Paediatr Dent,European archives of paediatric dentistry : official journal of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry,101277157,IM,"['Aggressive Periodontitis/complications/*diagnosis/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Alveolar Bone Loss/etiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dental Scaling', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Tooth Exfoliation', 'Tooth Mobility/etiology', 'Tooth, Deciduous/*physiopathology']",,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['11.31 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03262830 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Arch Paediatr Dent. 2011 Dec;12(6):312-7. doi: 10.1007/BF03262830.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms of resistance can be associated with altered expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters on cell membrane transporters, the most common cause of multi-drug resistance (MDR), but can also include alterations of DNA repair pathways, resistance to apoptosis and target modifications. Anti-cancer treatments may be divided into different categories based on their purpose and action: chemotherapeutic agents damage and kill dividing cells; hormonal treatments prevent cancer cells from receiving signals essential for their growth; targeted drugs are a relatively new cancer treatment that targets specific proteins and pathways that are limited primarily to cancer cells or that are much more prevalent in cancer cells; and antibodies function by either depriving the cancer cells of necessary signals or by causing their direct death. In any case, resistance to anticancer therapies leads to poor prognosis of patients. Thus, identification of novel molecular targets is critical in development of new, efficient and specific cancer drugs. The aim of this review is to describe the impact of genomics in studying some of the most critical pathways involved in cancer drug resistance and in improving drug development.

In children, AMKL was associated with trisomy 21 (somatic in non-DS-AMKL), while numerical aberrations of chromosome 21 were only rarely associated with adult AMKL. DS-AMKL was also associated with recurrent somatic gains of 1q (4/11 DS-AMKL patients). In contrast to trisomy 21 and gains of 1q, other additional chromosomal lesions were evenly distributed between children and adults with AMKL. A mutational screen found GATA1 mutations in 11/12 DS-AMKL, but mutations were rare in paediatric non-DS-AMKL (1/12) and adult AMKL (0/4). JAK3 (1/11), JAK2 (1/11), and TP53 mutations (1/11) were found only in patients with DS-AMKL. ASXL1, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, RUNX1 and CBL mutations were not found in any of the patient group studied, while NRAS mutation was identified in two patients with paediatric non-DS-AMKL.","['Hama, Asahito', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Sugimoto, Yuka', 'Szpurka, Hadrian', 'Jasek, Monika', ""O'Keefe, Christine"", 'Takahashi, Yoshiyuki', 'Sakaguchi, Hirotoshi', 'Doisaki, Sayoko', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Watanabe, Nobuhiro', 'Kato, Koji', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Hama A', 'Muramatsu H', 'Makishima H', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Szpurka H', 'Jasek M', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Takahashi Y', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Doisaki S', 'Shimada A', 'Watanabe N', 'Kato K', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T', 'Kojima S', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Paediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['K24 HL-077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL-082983/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111128,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aneuploidy', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Down Syndrome/complications/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/classification/complications/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,2011/11/30 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08948.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Feb;156(3):316-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08948.x.

PROCEDURE: The activity was assayed using the fluorogenic peptide substrate in the presence of an artificial activator sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the plasma of healthy donors (n=25), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL (n=95) and AML (n=17) patients. RESULTS: As compared to healthy subjects, the plasma proteasome ChT-L activity was significantly increased (p=0.001) in ALL patients prior to treatment, especially in those with T-ALL immunophenotype and with high LDH activity. Similarly, in AML patients the plasma proteasome ChT-L activity was elevated (p=0.001). Following remission-inducing chemotherapy, the activity of the ChT-L proteasome was significantly reduced both in ALL and AML patients.

Relevant studies were identified by entering the following search terms into Pubmed: aerobic training; resistance training; stretching; pediatric; children; AND cancer. Reference lists in retrieved manuscripts were also reviewed to identify additional trials. We include fifteen intervention trials published between 1993 and 2011 that included children younger than age 21 years with cancer diagnoses. Nine included children with an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosis, and six children with mixed cancer diagnoses. Generally, interventions tested were either in-hospital supervised exercise training or home based programs designed to promote physical activity. Early evidence from small studies indicates that the effects of exercise include increased cardiopulmonary fitness, improved muscle strength and flexibility, reduced fatigue and improved physical function. Generalizations to the entire childhood cancer and childhood cancer survivor populations are difficult as most of the work has been done in children during treatment for and among survivors of ALL. Additional randomized studies are needed to confirm these benefits in larger populations of children with ALL, and in populations with cancer diagnoses other than ALL.","['Huang, Tseng-Tien', 'Ness, Kirsten K']","['Huang TT', 'Ness KK']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111027,Egypt,Int J Pediatr,International journal of pediatrics,101517077,,,PMC3205744,2011/11/29 06:00,2011/11/29 06:01,['2011/11/29 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/461512 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Pediatr. 2011;2011:461512. doi: 10.1155/2011/461512.

Pol is expressed exclusively as a Gag-Pol fusion either by ribosomal frameshifting or by read-through of the gag stop codon. Both of these mechanisms occur infrequently and only affect 5-10% of translating ribosomes, allowing the virus to maintain the critical Gag to Gag-Pol ratio. Although it is understood that the frequency of the recoding event is regulated by cis RNA motifs, no mechanistic explanation is currently available for how the critical protein ratio is maintained. Here we present the NMR structure of the murine leukaemia virus recoding signal and show that a protonation-dependent switch occurs to induce the active conformation. The equilibrium is such that at physiological pH the active, read-through permissive conformation is populated at approximately 6%: a level that correlates with in vivo protein quantities. The RNA functions by a highly sensitive, chemo-mechanical coupling tuned to ensure an optimal read-through frequency. Similar observations for a frameshifting signal indicate that this novel equilibrium-based mechanism may have a general role in translational recoding.","['Houck-Loomis, Brian', 'Durney, Michael A', 'Salguero, Carolina', 'Shankar, Neelaabh', 'Nagle, Julia M', 'Goff, Stephen P', ""D'Souza, Victoria M""]","['Houck-Loomis B', 'Durney MA', 'Salguero C', 'Shankar N', 'Nagle JM', 'Goff SP', ""D'Souza VM""]","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['R37 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111127,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Switch', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism']",PMC3582340,2011/11/29 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/29 06:00'],"['2011/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['nature10657 [pii]', '10.1038/nature10657 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2011 Nov 27;480(7378):561-4. doi: 10.1038/nature10657.,,,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,['NIHMS427927'],,,['PDB/2LC8'],,,,,,,

In most cases MYC is found juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene locus. Translocations to the immunoglobulin kappa (IGK) gene locus on 2p11 are observed in around 5-10% of cases. Little data exist on the molecular mechanisms leading to this aberration. The chromosomal breakpoints on chromosome 8 have been found dispersed over a large area 3' of MYC. In order to obtain a better understanding of this chromosomal translocation we developed a long-distance inverse (LDI) PCR method for the identification of chromosomal translocations affecting the IGK locus. We investigated a number of cytogenetically mostly uncharacterized high-grade lymphoma samples and identified a MYC-IGK juxtaposition in seven patients and three t(2;8)-positive cell lines. The chromosomal breakpoints were molecularly characterized and analyzed. The linear distance of the breakpoints on chromosome 8 to MYC ranged from some 100 bp to more than 0.5 MB. The reciprocal translocated allele could be characterized in the majority of cases. This study represents the largest series of t(2;8)-positive cases analyzed so far.

We identify here a specific novel property of Notch3 that is acetylated and deacetylated at lysines 1692 and 1731 by p300 and HDAC1, respectively, a balance impaired by HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) that favor hyperacetylation. By using HDACi and a non-acetylatable Notch3 mutant carrying K/R(1692-1731) mutations in the intracellular domain, we show that Notch3 acetylation primes ubiquitination and proteasomal-mediated degradation of the protein. As a consequence, Notch3 protein expression and its transcriptional activity are decreased both in vitro and in vivo in Notch3 transgenic (tg) mice, thus impairing downstream signaling upon target genes. Consistently, Notch3-induced T-cell proliferation is inhibited by HDACi, whereas it is enhanced by the non-acetylatable Notch3-K/R(1692-1731) mutant. Finally, HDACi-induced Notch3 hyperacetylation prevents in vivo growth of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in Notch3 tg mice. Together, our findings suggest a novel level of Notch signaling control in which Notch3 acetylation/deacetylation process represents a key regulatory switch, thus representing a suitable druggable target for Notch3-sustained T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy.","['Palermo, R', 'Checquolo, S', 'Giovenco, A', 'Grazioli, P', 'Kumar, V', 'Campese, A F', 'Giorgi, A', 'Napolitano, M', 'Canettieri, G', 'Ferrara, G', 'Schinina, M E', 'Maroder, M', 'Frati, L', 'Gulino, A', 'Vacca, A', 'Screpanti, I']","['Palermo R', 'Checquolo S', 'Giovenco A', 'Grazioli P', 'Kumar V', 'Campese AF', 'Giorgi A', 'Napolitano M', 'Canettieri G', 'Ferrara G', 'Schinina ME', 'Maroder M', 'Frati L', 'Gulino A', 'Vacca A', 'Screpanti I']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111128,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/physiology', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Notch/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Ubiquitination']",,2011/11/29 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2011/11/29 06:00'],"['2011/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011533 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.533 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Aug 16;31(33):3807-17. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.533.

Therefore, AML mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from 12 patients before and after 7 days of high-dose (7.5-15 mg/kg/day) simvastatin treatment. Parallel mouse studies were performed to have, in addition to AML cells, access to liver tissue, a major target of statins. Serum cholesterol levels were lowered by simvastatin in all patients, however, only limited changes in the messenger RNA expression of cholesterol metabolism genes were seen in patient and mouse MNCs compared to murine liver cells. Still, two out of seven patients displayed an increased in vitro chemosensitivity of their AML cells upon simvastatin treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis on microarray data of AML patient cells and Western blot analysis for the isoprenylated proteins DnaJ and Rap1 on murine and AML patient MNCs demonstrated that in vivo simvastatin treatment resulted in inhibition of geranylgeranylation in murine MNCs and in a subset of patient AML MNCs.

The nucleotide ATP represents an important extracellular signalling molecule that regulates the survival of differentiated cells, however, its role is largely undefined in embryonic stem cells. Here we report a role for ATP-gated P2X7 receptors in ES cell survival. The functional expression of P2X7 receptors in undifferentiated mouse ES cells is demonstrated using a selective P2X7 antagonist and small interfering RNA knockdown of these receptors. Our data illustrate a key role for the P2X7 receptor as an essential pro-survival signal required for optimal ES cell colony growth in the presence of leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF). However, chronic exposure to exogenous ATP leads to rapid P2X7-dependent cell death via necrosis. Together, these data demonstrate a novel role for P2X7 receptors in regulation of ES cell behaviour where they can mediate either a pro-survival or pro-death signal depending on the mode of activation.","['Thompson, Belinda A N', 'Storm, Michael P', 'Hewinson, James', 'Hogg, Sarah', 'Welham, Melanie J', 'MacKenzie, Amanda B']","['Thompson BA', 'Storm MP', 'Hewinson J', 'Hogg S', 'Welham MJ', 'MacKenzie AB']","['Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Bath, UK.']",['eng'],"['084562/Z/07/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '08780/Z/08/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0801108/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111118,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Purinergic P2X Receptor Antagonists/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC3271386,2011/11/29 06:00,2012/05/11 06:00,['2011/11/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(11)00358-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.11.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2012 Mar;24(3):770-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.11.012.

Among the factors involved in these pathways, we focused on the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and on its substrate Che-1 by evaluating their basal expression and functional changes upon irradiation (IR). Microarray experiments were performed on 98 untreated CLL cases. Next, freshly isolated primary cells from 21 untreated patients were analyzed for in vitro response to irradiation through Western blot, PARP activity assay, Annexin-V analysis, and PARP1 basal expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Microarray analysis showed that PARP1 and CHE1 were constitutively expressed in CLL and had a high degree of correlation with each other and with TP53. PARP1 and TP53 downmodulation was associated with worse clinical outcomes, especially in TP53-mutated cases. Next, CLL samples from 21 untreated patients were classified as responders and nonresponders based on IR-induced PARP1 cleavage. Notably, while responder samples were characterized by Che-1 and p53 induction at 8 hours and reduction at 24 hours post-IR, nonresponders included both samples with p53 dysfunctions and cases with a normal IR-induced Che-1 and/or p53 response. Finally, we observed that PARP1 was downregulated in nonresponder vs responder samples and that its basal expression was positively correlated with PARP1 cleavage after IR. In conclusion, we showed that reduced expression of PARP1 is associated with an impairment of CLL responsiveness to cell death.","['Bacalini, Maria Giulia', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Marinelli, Marilisa', 'Santangelo, Simona', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Di Maio, Valeria', 'Ricciardi, Maria Rosaria', 'Caiafa, Paola', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Foa, Robin', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Reale, Anna']","['Bacalini MG', 'Tavolaro S', 'Peragine N', 'Marinelli M', 'Santangelo S', 'Del Giudice I', 'Mauro FR', 'Di Maio V', 'Ricciardi MR', 'Caiafa P', 'Chiaretti S', 'Foa R', 'Guarini A', 'Reale A']","['Section of Clinical Biochemistry, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*radiation effects', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",,2011/11/29 06:00,2012/04/12 06:00,['2011/11/29 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00578-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Mar;40(3):197-206.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.11.005.

However, a subset of patients will be intolerant to first-line imatinib. Patients who experience unresponsive grade 3 or any grade 4 nonhematologic side effects to imatinib may require discontinuation and switching to second-line therapies, such as dasatinib or nilotinib, after identification of intolerance. The most common side effects associated with dasatinib and nilotinib are hematologic and generally are reversible with dose adjustment. Pleural effusions are more common with dasatinib use and may be managed by dose interruption and reduction.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After staging pelvic lymph node dissection, patients with high-risk prostate cancer randomly received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (3 years)+DE (4 cycles of docetaxel 70 mg/m(2)/3 weeks+estramustine 10mg/kg/dd1-5) or ADT alone. Local therapy was administered at 3 months. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirteen patients were accrued: T3-T4 (67%), Gleason score ~8 (42%), PSA >20 ng/mL (59%), pN+ (29%). In the chemotherapy arm, 94% of patients received the planned four cycles of docetaxel. Local treatment consisted of radiotherapy in 358 patients (87%) (median dose 74 Gy in both arms). ADT was given for 36 months in both arms. A PSA response (PSA ~0.2 ng/mL after 3 months of treatment) was obtained in 34% and 15% in the ADT+DE arm and in the ADT arm, respectively (p<0.0001). Febrile neutropenia occurred in only 2%. Moderate to severe hot flashes occurred less often in the ADT+DE arm (2% versus 22%; p<0.001). There was no toxicity-related death, no secondary leukaemia, and no excess second cancers. Chemotherapy had a negative impact on quality of life (global health status, p = 0.01; fatigue, p = 0.003; role functioning, p = 0.003; social functioning, p = 0.006) at 3 months but this effect disappeared at 1 year. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel-estramustine can be combined safely with standard therapy in high-risk prostate cancer, with a promising PSA response rate and no negative impact on quality of life after 1 year.

Coupled with a median age of onset of 65 years, many patients will be elderly at diagnosis or can expect to attain elderly status during their course of treatment. Unfortunately, few clinical studies have focused on treating elderly patients, which leads to fewer data on the efficacy and safety of TKI therapy in older patients than in younger patients. Perhaps as a consequence, there is evidence that elderly patients do not receive lifesaving TKI treatment as uniformly as do those who are younger. This review examines the available data on TKI therapy in elderly patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and addresses special considerations in treating this patient population. Overall, analysis of the data suggests that TKI therapy is equally effective regardless of patient age and that safety findings with TKI therapy in elderly patients are similar to those observed in younger individuals.","['Seiter, Karen']",['Seiter K'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, New York Medical College, 19 Bradhurst Avenue, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA. karen_seiter@nymc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111125,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Health Services for the Aged/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/29 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/11/29 06:00'],"['2011/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00551-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Feb;12(1):12-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.10.001.

The aim of the study was to possibly identifying new hereditary patterns predisposing for cancer in the different histopathologic subtypes of breast cancer, with focus on patients with lobular breast cancer and cancer in their first degree relatives. METHODS: In 1676 consecutive breast cancer patients detailed family history of cancer was related to histopathologic subtype of breast cancer. RESULTS: Patients with lobular breast cancer were found to be significantly positively associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, OR 2.17 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-3.46). The finding persisted after excluding breast cancer in the family. Ductal breast cancer was associated with having a mother diagnosed with cancer. There was a significant association between lobular breast cancer and having a father with prostate cancer, OR 2.4 (CI 1.1-5.3). The occurrence of having a father with prostate cancer for lobular breast cancer patients was higher in the younger patient group, OR 2.9 (CI 1.1-7.8), and was still high but lost statistical significance in the older patient group, OR 1.9 (CI 0.5-7.4). The association between lobular breast cancer and a father remained significant after excluding fathers with prostate cancer, OR 1.94 (CI 1.20-3.14). Other commonly occurring tumor types in the father included sarcoma and leukemia. CONCLUSION: We propose that lobular breast cancer is associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, most commonly prostate carcinoma. Since the association remained after excluding family history of breast cancer, the association seems independent of classical breast cancer heredity. The association with a father diagnosed with cancer also remained after removing prostate cancer, indicating an independence from prostate cancer as well. The reason for this association is genetically unclear, but could involve sex-specific imprinting.","['Ellberg, Carolina', 'Olsson, Hakan']","['Ellberg C', 'Olsson H']","['Department of Oncology, Clinical Sciences, Lund, Lund University 221 85, Lund, Sweden. carolina.ellberg@med.lu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111128,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Lobular/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', '*Fathers', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3241222,2011/11/29 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/11/29 06:00'],"['2010/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-497 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-497 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Nov 28;11:497. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-497.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their effect is mediated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a well-known transcription factor. Besides their therapeutic impact, GCs may cause a number of side effects leading to various metabolic complications. The goal of immediate interest is testing glucocorticoid analogs capable of induction/enhancement of GR transrepression, but preventing GR dimerization and transactivation leading to side effects. In this work we have investigated effects of a promising new selective GR agonist, 2-(4-acetoxyphenyl)-2-chloro-N-methylethylammonium chloride (CpdA), on CEM and K562 leukemia cells. Both cell lines express functional GR. CpdA compared with the glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetonide (FA) exerted more prominent cytostatic and apoptotic effects on the cells. Both cell lines exhibited sensitivity to CpdA, demonstrating a good correlation with the effects of FA on cell growth and viability. In contrast to FA, CpdA did not induce GR transactivation evaluated by no obvious increase in expression of GR target (and dependent) gene FKBP51. At the same time, luciferase assay showed that CpdA efficiently activated transrepression of NF-kappaB and AP-1 factors. We also evaluated the effect of combined action of CpdA and the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib. The latter induced a caspase-dependent apoptosis in both T-cell leukemia cell lines. By treatment of CEM cells with different CpdA/GC and Bortezomib doses, we have designed a protocol where CpdA shows potentiating effect on Bortezomib cytotoxic activity. Generally, the present work characterizes a novel non-steroid GR ligand, CpdA, as a promising compound for possible application in leukemia chemotherapy.","['Lesovaya, E A', 'Yemelyanov, A Yu', 'Kirsanov, K I', 'Yakubovskaya, M G', 'Budunova, I V']","['Lesovaya EA', 'Yemelyanov AY', 'Kirsanov KI', 'Yakubovskaya MG', 'Budunova IV']","['Institute of Carcinogenesis, Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia. lesovenok@yandex.ru']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochemistry (Mosc),Biochemistry.

Although the specific function of individual MAGE-A proteins is being currently explored, compelling evidence suggest their involvement in the regulation of different pathways during tumor progression. We have previously reported that MageA2 binds histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 and represses p53-dependent apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) tumor suppressor is a regulator of p53 acetylation and function in cellular senescence. Here, we demonstrate that MageA2 interferes with p53 acetylation at PML-nuclear bodies (NBs) and with PMLIV-dependent activation of p53. Moreover, a fraction of MageA2 colocalizes with PML-NBs through direct association with PML, and decreases PMLIV sumoylation through an HDAC-dependent mechanism. This reduction in PML post-translational modification promotes defects in PML-NBs formation. Remarkably, we show that in human fibroblasts expressing RasV12 oncogene, MageA2 expression decreases cellular senescence and increases proliferation. These results correlate with a reduction in NBs number and an impaired p53 response. All these data suggest that MageA2, in addition to its anti-apoptotic effect, could have a novel role in the early progression to malignancy by interfering with PML/p53 function, thereby blocking the senescence program, a critical barrier against cell transformation.","['Peche, L Y', 'Scolz, M', 'Ladelfa, M F', 'Monte, M', 'Schneider, C']","['Peche LY', 'Scolz M', 'Ladelfa MF', 'Monte M', 'Schneider C']","['Laboratorio Nazionale del Consorzio Interuniversitario per le Biotecnologie, Area Science Park, Padriciano 99, Trieste 34149, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111125,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Melanoma-Specific Antigens/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",PMC3354046,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2011173 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2011.173 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2012 Jun;19(6):926-36. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2011.173.

However, because Fbxw7 targets Notch1 for degradation, genetic alterations in these genes are expected to be mutually exclusive events in lymphomagenesis. Previously, by using a radiation-induced Tp53-deficient mouse model for T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, we reported that loss of heterozygosity at the Fbxw7 locus occurs frequently in a Tp53-dependent manner. In the current study, we show that these thymic lymphomas also commonly exhibit activating Notch1 mutations in the proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine (PEST) domain. Moreover, concurrent activating Notch1 PEST domain mutations and single-copy deletions at the Fbxw7 locus occur with high frequency in the same individual tumors, indicating that these changes are not mutually exclusive events. We further demonstrate that although Notch1 PEST domain mutations are independent of Tp53 status, they are completely abolished in mice with germline Fbxw7 haploinsufficiency. Therefore, Notch1 PEST domain mutations only occur when Fbxw7 expression levels are intact. These data suggest a temporal sequence of mutational events involving these important cancer-related genes, with Notch1 PEST domain mutations occurring first, followed by Fbxw7 deletion, and eventually by complete loss of Tp53.","['Jen, Kuang-Yu', 'Song, Ihn Young', 'Banta, Karl Luke', 'Wu, Di', 'Mao, Jian-Hua', 'Balmain, Allan']","['Jen KY', 'Song IY', 'Banta KL', 'Wu D', 'Mao JH', 'Balmain A']","['Department of Pathology, University of California-San Francisco, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA116481/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA108462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA141455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32 CA108462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/pathology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",PMC3265203,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40939-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-327619 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 19;119(3):805-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-327619.

The impact of plasma clearance of dexamethasone and anti-asparaginase antibody levels on risk of relapse was assessed in 410 children who were treated on a front-line clinical trial for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and were evaluable for all pharmacologic measures, using multivariate analyses, adjusting for standard clinical and biologic prognostic factors. Dexamethasone clearance (mean +/- SD) was higher (P = 3 x 10(-8)) in patients whose sera was positive (17.7 +/- 18.6 L/h per m(2)) versus nega-tive (10.6 +/- 5.99 L/h per m(2)) for anti-asparaginase antibodies. In multivariate analyses, higher dexamethasone clearance was associated with a higher risk of any relapse (P = .01) and of central nervous system relapse (P = .014). Central nervous system relapse was also more common in patients with anti-asparaginase antibodies (P = .019). In conclusion, systemic clearance of dexamethasone is higher in patients with anti-asparaginase antibodies.

The end result is seen in the increased incidence of sister chromatid exchanges, micronuclei, chromosomal aberrations and the eventual development of nitrosourea-induced leukemias. From a mechanistic perspective, niacin deficiency delays excision repair and causes double strand break accumulation, which in turn favor chromosome breaks and translocations. Niacin deficiency also impairs cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage, which combine to encourage the survival of cells with leukemogenic potential. Niacin deficiency also enhances the level of oxidant damage found in cellular proteins and DNA, but not through depression of GSH levels. Pharmacological supplementation of niacin decreases the development of nitrosourea-induced leukemias, while short term effects of high niacin intake include a large increase in cellular NAD+ and poly(ADP-ribose) content and enhanced apoptosis. These results are important to cancer patients, which tend to be niacin deficient, are exposed to large doses of genotoxic drugs, and suffer short-term bone marrow suppression and long-term development of secondary leukemias. The data from our rat model suggest that niacin supplementation of cancer patients may decrease the severity of short and long-term side effects, and may also improve tumor cell killing through activation of poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent apoptosis pathways.","['Kirkland, James B']",['Kirkland JB'],"['Department of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada, N1G 2W1, jkirklan@uoguelph.ca.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Subcell Biochem,Sub-cellular biochemistry,0316571,IM,"['Animals', 'Avitaminosis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genomic Instability/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Niacin/administration & dosage/*deficiency', '*Nutritional Status', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction']",,2011/11/26 06:00,2014/09/27 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-94-007-2199-9_2 [doi]'],ppublish,Subcell Biochem. 2012;56:21-36. doi: 10.1007/978-94-007-2199-9_2.,,,['2679MF687A (Niacin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given AML's natural history and the uncertain results inherent in investigational therapy, most patients intuitively prefer standard therapy, by which is usually meant 3+7 or low-dose cytarabine. However, this preference assumes results with standard therapy are 'satisfactory'. Results with standard therapy of AML are, however, so variable that it is difficult to speak of a single result. Therefore, I review prognostic factors with standard therapy to permit physicians to better inform patients of the likely outcome with such therapy, realizing that the same data might prompt one patient/physician to prefer standard therapy and another investigational therapy under the assumption that although plausibly worse than standard the latter cannot be that much worse. Because even in patients aged >75 years, the principal cause of therapeutic failure is resistance to therapy not treatment-related mortality, I emphasize factors associated with resistance, principally a 'monosomal karyotype' and various molecular markers and extend the European Leukemia Net prognostic system. I also stress the value of waiting for cytogenetic and molecular results before beginning induction therapy and review various investigational options.","['Estey, E H']",['Estey EH'],"['University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. eestey@uw.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011317 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.317 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):861-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.317.

Multivariate analysis identified TBI and a short interval between diagnosis and HSCT as factors associated with favorable RFS. Three-year non relapse mortality and relapse incidence were each 41% with the majority of relapses occurring within the first year.

A common secondary genomic alteration detected in MCL is chromosome 13q31-q32 gain/amplification, which targets a microRNA (miRNA) cluster, miR-17 approximately 92. On the basis of gene expression profiling, we found that high level expression of C13orf25, the primary transcript from which these miRNAs are processed, was associated with poorer survival in patients with MCL (P=0.021). We demonstrated that the protein phosphatase PHLPP2, an important negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, was a direct target of miR-17 approximately 92 miRNAs, in addition to PTEN and BIM. These proteins were down-modulated in MCL cells with overexpression of the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster. Overexpression of miR-17 approximately 92 activated the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibited chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in MCL cell lines. Conversely, inhibition of miR-17 approximately 92 expression suppressed the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft MCL mouse model. Targeting the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster may therefore provide a novel therapeutic approach for patients with MCL.","['Rao, E', 'Jiang, C', 'Ji, M', 'Huang, X', 'Iqbal, J', 'Lenz, G', 'Wright, G', 'Staudt, L M', 'Zhao, Y', 'McKeithan, T W', 'Chan, W C', 'Fu, K']","['Rao E', 'Jiang C', 'Ji M', 'Huang X', 'Iqbal J', 'Lenz G', 'Wright G', 'Staudt LM', 'Zhao Y', 'McKeithan TW', 'Chan WC', 'Fu K']","['Department of Pathology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-3135, USA.']",['eng'],['U01 CA114778/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011305 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.305 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):1064-72. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.305.

Previous studies have indicated the possible involvement of RasGRP1 and RasGRP4 in leukemogenesis. Here, the predominant role of RasGRP1 in T-cell leukemogenesis is clarified. Notably, increased expression of RasGRP1, but not RasGRP4, was frequently observed in human T-cell malignancies. In a mouse bone marrow transplantation model, RasGRP1 exclusively induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) after a shorter latency when compared with RasGRP4. Accordingly, Ba/F3 cells transduced with RasGRP1 survived longer under growth factor withdrawal or phorbol ester stimulation than those transduced with RasGRP4, presumably due to the efficient activation of Ras. Intriguingly, NOTCH1 mutations resulting in a gain of function were found in 77% of the RasGRP1-mediated mouse T-ALL samples. In addition, gain-of-function NOTCH1 mutation was found in human T-cell malignancy with elevated expression of RasGRP1. Importantly, RasGRP1 and NOTCH1 signaling cooperated in the progression of T-ALL in the murine model. The leukemogenic advantage of RasGRP1 over RasGRP4 was attenuated by the disruption of a protein kinase C phosphorylation site (RasGRP1(Thr184)) not present on RasGRP4. In conclusion, cooperation between aberrant expression of RasGRP1, a strong activator of Ras, and secondary gain-of-function mutations of NOTCH1 have an important role in T-cell leukemogenesis.","['Oki, T', 'Kitaura, J', 'Watanabe-Okochi, N', 'Nishimura, K', 'Maehara, A', 'Uchida, T', 'Komeno, Y', 'Nakahara, F', 'Harada, Y', 'Sonoki, T', 'Harada, H', 'Kitamura, T']","['Oki T', 'Kitaura J', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Nishimura K', 'Maehara A', 'Uchida T', 'Komeno Y', 'Nakahara F', 'Harada Y', 'Sonoki T', 'Harada H', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111125,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011328 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.328 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):1038-45. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.328.

Previously, the altered expression of Fat1 cadherin has been implicated in a number of solid tumors. In this report, in vitro analysis shows that Fat1 protein is expressed by a range of leukemia cell lines, but not by normal peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells from healthy donors. In silico analysis of expression of array data from clinical leukemias found significant levels of Fat1 transcript in 11% of acute myeloid leukemia, 29% and 63% of ALL of B and T lineages, respectively, and little or no transcript present in normal PB or BM. Furthermore, in two independent studies of matched diagnosis-relapse of precursor B-cell (preB) ALL pediatric samples (n=32 and n=27), the level of Fat1 mRNA expression was prognostic at the time of diagnosis. High Fat1 mRNA expression was predictive of shorter relapse-free and overall survival, independent of other traditional prognostic markers, including white blood cell count, sex and age.

ABC cell lines have constitutive activation of STAT3; however, the mechanisms regulating STAT3 signaling in lymphoma are unknown. In studies of class-I histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression, we found overexpression of HDAC3 in phospho STAT3-positive DLBCL and the HDAC3 was found to be complexed with STAT3. Inhibition of HDAC activity by panobinostat (LBH589) increased p300-mediated STAT3(Lys685) acetylation with increased nuclear export of STAT3 to the cytoplasm. HDAC inhibition abolished STAT3(Tyr705) phosphorylation with minimal effect on STAT3(Ser727) and JAK2 tyrosine activity. pSTAT3(Tyr705)-positive DLBCLs were more sensitive to HDAC inhibition with LBH589 compared with pSTAT3(Tyr705)-negative DLBCLs. This cytotoxicity was associated with downregulation of the direct STAT3 target Mcl-1. HDAC3 knockdown upregulated STAT3(Lys685) acetylation but prevented STAT3(Tyr705) phosphorylation and inhibited survival of pSTAT3-positive DLBCL cells. These studies provide the rationale for targeting STAT3-positive DLBCL tumors with HDAC inhibitors.","['Gupta, M', 'Han, J J', 'Stenson, M', 'Wellik, L', 'Witzig, T E']","['Gupta M', 'Han JJ', 'Stenson M', 'Wellik L', 'Witzig TE']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

Higher incidence rates are observed for many lymphoma subtypes in men compared with women suggesting an underlying association. Our goal was to investigate the association between reproductive factors and lymphomas. METHODS: The Epilymph study is a multicenter case-control study carried out in six European countries from 1998 to 2004. Female cases of mature T-cell neoplasms (n = 52), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 147), and mature B-cell neoplasms (n = 795), including its common subtypes, and their respective controls (n = 1,141) frequency matched by age, gender, and center were considered. RESULTS: An odds reduction of 29% (95% CI -46 to -6%) was observed for mature T-cell neoplasms for each child increase among parous women and of 13% (95% CI -19 to -7%) for mature B-cell neoplasms; while no association was observed for Hodgkin lymphoma. By B-cell neoplasm subtypes, these associations were found for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (-21%, 95% CI -31 to -9%) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; -14%; 95% CI -23 to -3%). Overall, no associations were observed with age at first and last pregnancy, and ever use of hormonal contraceptives and lymphoma. Higher odds ratios for a short-term use of hormonal contraceptives (<5 years), but not for a long-term use, were observed for mature B-cell neoplasms, DLBCL, and follicular lymphoma compared with never use. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that increased parity confers a protective effect against lymphoma. Less clearly, our results also indicate that hormonal contraceptives could play a role.","['Costas, Laura', 'Casabonne, Delphine', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Foretova, Lenka', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Staines, Anthony', 'Kane, Eleanor', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'de Sanjose, Silvia']","['Costas L', 'Casabonne D', 'Benavente Y', 'Becker N', 'Boffetta P', 'Brennan P', 'Cocco P', 'Foretova L', 'Maynadie M', 'Staines A', 'Kane E', 'Nieters A', 'de Sanjose S']","[""Unit of Infections and Cancer, Cancer Epidemiology Research Programme, Institut Catala d' Oncologia, IDIBELL, Av Gran Via de l'Hospitalet 199-203, 08908, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain. lcostas@iconcologia.net""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111125,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/blood/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', '*Reproductive History', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-011-9869-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2012 Jan;23(1):195-206. doi: 10.1007/s10552-011-9869-6.

However, the role of Aurora A in chemoresistance of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is not well understood. Using the KCL-22 cell culture model we have recently developed for studying mechanisms of CML acquired resistance, we found that Aurora A expression was partially reduced in these cells upon treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, which accompanied the acquisition of BCR-ABL mutation for imatinib resistance. Gene knockdown of BCR-ABL also reduced Aurora A expression, and conversely, Aurora A expression increased in hematopoietic progenitor cells after BCR-ABL expression. Inhibition of Aurora A induced apoptosis of CML cells with or without T315I BCR-ABL mutation and suppressed CML cell growth. Inhibition of Aurora A by gene knockdown or a highly specific small molecule inhibitor sensitized CML cells to imatinib treatment and effectively blocked acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and KCL-22 cell relapse on imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib. Our results show that Aurora A plays an important role for facilitating acquisition of BCR-ABL mutation and acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the culture model and suggest that inhibition of Aurora A may provide an alternative strategy to improve CML treatment to overcome resistance.","['Yuan, Hongfeng', 'Wang, Zhiqiang', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Roth, Mendel', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Chen, Wen Yong']","['Yuan H', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang H', 'Roth M', 'Bhatia R', 'Chen WY']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143421-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143421-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111124,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",PMC3271265,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['bgr278 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgr278 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2012 Feb;33(2):285-93. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgr278.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cell damage plays a critical role in the initiation of carcinogenesis as well as in malignant transformation. The goal of this study was to perform an analysis of the oxidative stress statuses of patients affected by MBL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We examined peripheral blood and urine specimens from 29 patients with MBL, 55 with CLL and 31 healthy subjects. There was a significant increase in the occurrence of the mutagenic base 8-oxo-2'-deoxiguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in the lymphocytes and urine of MBL and CLL patients compared with controls. Significant differences were also observed in the levels of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) and in the oxidised/reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH) ratio, although an increase in 8-isoprostane was not detected. Interestingly, the antioxidant catalase activity of circulating lymphocytes decreased in the patient groups. In conclusion, early oxidative stress exists in patients with MBL and CLL, causing damage to DNA and lipid structures. The higher levels of 8-oxo-dG in lymphocytes than in urine may be related to a decrease in the capacity of DNA repair systems. There were no differences in the oxidative statuses of the MBL and CLL patients, suggesting that oxidative injuries appear during a pre-leukaemic state of the disease.","['Collado, Rosa', 'Oliver, Isabel', 'Tormos, Carmen', 'Egea, Mercedes', 'Miguel, Amparo', 'Cerda, Concha', 'Ivars, David', 'Borrego, Silvia', 'Carbonell, Felix', 'Saez, Guillermo T']","['Collado R', 'Oliver I', 'Tormos C', 'Egea M', 'Miguel A', 'Cerda C', 'Ivars D', 'Borrego S', 'Carbonell F', 'Saez GT']","['Service of Hematology, CDB-University General Hospital of Valencia, Spain. collado_ros@gva.es']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111122,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism/urine', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*DNA Damage', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/urine', 'Dinoprost/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/urine', 'Female', 'Glutathione/metabolism/urine', 'Glutathione Disulfide/metabolism/urine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/urine', 'Lymphocytosis/genetics/*metabolism/urine', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism/urine', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/04/18 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(11)00719-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2011.11.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2012 Apr 28;317(2):144-9. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2011.11.018.

Notably, there was no correlation between MCM2 and Ki67-labeling indices (LIs) in MDS, while MCM2 LIs were significantly correlated with cleaved caspase 3 LIs in MDS. In vitro analysis revealed that MCM2 overexpression induced apoptosis in HL60 cells. Furthermore, MDS bone marrow exhibited higher ratio of MCM2 and cleaved caspase 3 double-positive cells and the ratio was correlated with the degree of leukocytopenia. These results suggest that the up-regulated expression of MCM2 is associated with frequent apoptosis in MDS and may have an important role in the pathogenesis of MDS.","['Suzuki, Shiho', 'Kurata, Morito', 'Abe, Shinya', 'Miyazawa, Ryo', 'Murayama, Toshihiko', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Yamamoto, Kouhei', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu']","['Suzuki S', 'Kurata M', 'Abe S', 'Miyazawa R', 'Murayama T', 'Hidaka M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. ssuzpth2@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111115,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukopenia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(11)00183-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2011.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2012 Feb;92(1):160-6. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2011.11.003.

The aim of this study was to examine the role of structural factors of antitumour anthracycline drugs in the ability to undergo bioreductive activation by NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and determine the impact of this activation on increasing the activity especially in regard to MDR tumour cells. It was evidenced that at high NADPH concentration (500 muM) anthracyclines having non-modified quinone structure: doxorubicin (DOX), daunorubicin (DR) and idarubicin (IDA) were susceptible upon CPR catalysis to undergo a multi-stage chemical transformation concerning their chromophore part. Additionally, it was evidenced that the modification of the sugar moiety of DOX did not disturb the susceptibility of the obtained derivative (4'-O-tetrahydropyranyl-doxorubicin, pirarubicin, PIRA) to undergo CPR reductive activation. It was also evidenced that the derivatives having modified quinone groupment (5-iminodaunorubicin, 5-Im-DR) were not able to undergo reductive activation by CPR. The high impact of CPR-dependent reductive activation of anthracycline drugs on increasing the activity in regard to sensitive leukaemia HL60 cell line and its MDR sublines overexpressing P-glycoprotein (HL60/VINC) and MRP1 (HL60/DOX) was evidenced. Furthermore, significant changes in binding manner of activated compounds to naked DNA and cellular nucleus in comparison to their non-activated forms were also observed. It could prevent the export of formed adducts out of the cell by MDR proteins and may explain significant increases in intracellular accumulation of these compounds in HL60/VINC and HL60/DOX cells.","['Kostrzewa-Nowak, Dorota', 'Bieg, Bohdan', 'Paine, Mark J I', 'Wolf, C Roland', 'Tarasiuk, Jolanta']","['Kostrzewa-Nowak D', 'Bieg B', 'Paine MJ', 'Wolf CR', 'Tarasiuk J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Szczecin, 3c Felczaka St, 71-412 Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],['10822/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111115,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,IM,"['Anthracyclines/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(11)01437-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.10.047 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2012 Jan 15;674(2-3):112-25. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.10.047.

CD spectra indicate that 7 causes a massive distortion of the CT DNA B double helix toward the A form. Whereas the neutral complexes 1, 2 and 5 exhibit only modest antiproliferative activity toward MCF-7 and HT-29 cells, the monocationic complexes are significantly more active, in particular the DNA-distorting complex 7 with its IC(50) values of 0.73 and 0.42 muM, respectively. As established by online monitoring with a cell-based sensor chip, this potent 5,6-Me(2)phen complex invokes dose-dependent decreases in MCF-7 cellular respiration and extracellular acidification rates and causes a time-delayed decrease in the impedance of the cell layers, that can be ascribed to cell death. Treatment of Jurkat cells with 7 leads to high concentrations of reactive oxygen species and the induction of apoptosis.

We therefore performed SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry analyses to a depth of 10,975 distinct phosphorylation sites to characterize the phosphoproteome of KG1 AML cells and its regulation upon erlotinib and gefitinib treatment. Less than 50 site-specific phosphorylations changed significantly, indicating rather specific interference with AML cell signaling. Many drug-induced changes occurred within a network of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins that included Src family kinases (SFKs) and the tyrosine kinases Btk and Syk. We further performed quantitative chemical proteomics in KG1 cell extracts and identified SFKs and Btk as direct cellular targets of both erlotinib and gefitinib. Taken together, our data suggest that cellular perturbation of SFKs and/or Btk translates into rather specific signal transduction inhibition, which in turn contributes to the antileukemic activity of erlotinib and gefitinib in AML.","['Weber, Christoph', 'Schreiber, Thiemo B', 'Daub, Henrik']","['Weber C', 'Schreiber TB', 'Daub H']","['Project Group Cell Signaling, Department of Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Am Klopferspitz 18, 82152 Martinsried, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111115,Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Gefitinib', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Phosphoproteins/*chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",,2011/11/26 06:00,2012/06/23 06:00,['2011/11/26 06:00'],"['2011/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-3919(11)00555-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2011.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2012 Feb 2;75(4):1343-56. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2011.11.004.

After the DNR and Br were co-loaded onto a pluronic-stabilized and oleic acid-modified magnetic nanosystem, the physical characteristic and drug-loading capacity were evaluated. The cell toxicity of the self-prepared DNR/BrTet-MNPs formulation was then determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay; the cellular uptake of drug was demonstrated by fluorescent microscope. Lastly, the transcription of mdr1 and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were detected by the reverse transcription reaction and western blotting assay, respectively. The results showed that the self-prepared DNR/BrTet-MNPs formulation possessed a sustained release of drug and displayed a dose-dependent antiproliferative activity on MDR leukemia K562/A02 cells. It also enhanced the accumulation of intracellular DNR in K562/A02 cells and downregulated the transcription of the mdr1 gene and the expression of P-gp. These findings suggest that the remarkable effect of the novel DNR/BrTet-MNPs formulation, acting as a drug depot system for the sustained release of the loaded DNR and BrTet, on multidrug resistance leukemia K562/A02 cells would be a promising strategy for overcoming MDR.","['Cheng, Jian', 'Wang, Jun', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Xia, Guohua', 'Cai, Xiaohui', 'Liu, Ran', 'Ren, Yanyan', 'Bao, Wen', 'Wang, Xuemei']","['Cheng J', 'Wang J', 'Chen B', 'Xia G', 'Cai X', 'Liu R', 'Ren Y', 'Bao W', 'Wang X']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110927,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Benzylisoquinolines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence']",PMC3215153,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S24309 [doi]', 'ijn-6-2123 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2011;6:2123-31. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S24309.

The ability of TRIM5alpha(rh) to block HIV-1 infection has been correlated with a decrease of pelletable HIV-1 capsid during infection. To genetically dissect the ability of TRIM5alpha to block reverse transcription, we studied a set of TRIM5alpha(rh) RING domain mutants that potently restrict HIV-1 but allow the occurrence of reverse transcription. These TRIM5alpha(rh) RING variants blocked HIV-1 infection after reverse transcription but prior to integration, as suggested by the routing of nuclear viral DNA to circularization in the form of 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circles. The folding of RING domain variants was similar to that of the wild type, as evaluated by nuclear magnetic resonance. RING domain changes that allowed the occurrence of reverse transcription were impaired in their ability to decrease the amount of pelletable capsid compared with wild-type TRIM5alpha. Similar effects of this particular group of mutations were observed with human TRIM5alpha inhibition of N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV). Interestingly, TRIM5alpha(rh) RING domain variants also prevented the degradation of TRIM5alpha(rh) that occurs following cell entry of HIV-1. These data correlated the block of reverse transcription with the ability of TRIM5alpha to accelerate uncoating. Collectively, these results suggest that TRIM5alpha(rh) blocks HIV-1 reverse transcription by inducing premature viral uncoating in target cells.","['Roa, Amanda', 'Hayashi, Fumiaki', 'Yang, Yang', 'Lienlaf, Maritza', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Shi, Jiong', 'Watanabe, Satoru', 'Kigawa, Takanori', 'Yokoyama, Shigeyuki', 'Aiken, Christopher', 'Diaz-Griffero, Felipe']","['Roa A', 'Hayashi F', 'Yang Y', 'Lienlaf M', 'Zhou J', 'Shi J', 'Watanabe S', 'Kigawa T', 'Yokoyama S', 'Aiken C', 'Diaz-Griffero F']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine Bronx, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['R00 MH086162/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI076121/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI087390/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '4R00MH086162-02/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Probes', 'Dogs', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Thymocytes/virology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Virus Uncoating']",PMC3264337,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05811-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05811-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Feb;86(3):1717-27. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05811-11.

Our results build on detection of specific chromosomal losses in a mouse model of gamma-radiation-induced T-LBLs and provide interesting clues for new putative susceptibility genes in a region orthologous to human 6q15-6q16.3. Among these, Epha7 emerges as a bona fide candidate tumor suppressor gene because it is inactivated in practically all the T-LBLs analyzed (100% in mouse and 95.23% in human). We provide evidence showing that Epha7 downregulation may occur, at least in part, by loss of heterozygosity (19.35% in mouse and 12.5% in human) or promoter hypermethylation (51.61% in mouse and 43.75% in human) or a combination of both mechanisms (12.90% in mouse and 6.25% in human). These results indicate that EPHA7 might be considered a new tumor suppressor gene for 6q deletions in T-LBLs. Notably, this gene is located in 6q16.1 proximal to GRIK2 and CASP8AP2, other candidate genes identified in this region. Thus, del6q seems to be a complex region where inactivation of multiple genes may cooperatively contribute to the onset of T-cell lymphomas.","['Lopez-Nieva, Pilar', 'Vaquero, Concepcion', 'Fernandez-Navarro, Pablo', 'Gonzalez-Sanchez, Laura', 'Villa-Morales, Maria', 'Santos, Javier', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Fernandez-Piqueras, Jose']","['Lopez-Nieva P', 'Vaquero C', 'Fernandez-Navarro P', 'Gonzalez-Sanchez L', 'Villa-Morales M', 'Santos J', 'Esteller M', 'Fernandez-Piqueras J']","['Departmento Biologia Celular e Inmunologia, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Nicolas Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111122,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, EphA7/*genetics', 'Receptors, Kainic Acid/genetics', '*Sequence Deletion']",,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['bgr271 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgr271 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2012 Feb;33(2):452-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgr271.

METHODS: Cross-sectional, self-report data from 3083 adult siblings (mean age 29 years, range 18-56 years) of 5 + year survivors of childhood cancer were analyzed to assess psychological outcomes as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18). Sociodemographic and health data, reported by both the siblings and their matched cancer survivors, were explored as risk factors for adverse sibling psychological outcomes through multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Self-reported symptoms of psychological distress, as measured by the global severity index of the BSI-18, were reported by 3.8% of the sibling sample. Less than 1.5% of siblings reported elevated scores on two or more of the subscales of the BSI-18. Risk factors for sibling depression included having a survivor brother (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.42-3.55), and having a survivor with impaired general health (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.18-3.78). Siblings who were younger than the survivor reported increased global psychological distress (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.05-3.12), as did siblings of survivors reporting global psychological distress (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.08-4.59). Siblings of sarcoma survivors reported more somatization than did siblings of leukemia survivors (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.05-3.98). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that siblings of long-term childhood cancer survivors are psychologically healthy in general. There are, however, small subgroups of siblings at risk for long-term psychological impairment who may benefit from preventive risk-reduction strategies during childhood while their sibling with cancer is undergoing treatment.","['Buchbinder, David', 'Casillas, Jacqueline', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Goodman, Pam', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Recklitis, Christopher', 'Alderfer, Melissa A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Kunin-Batson, Alicia', 'Stuber, Margaret', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie K']","['Buchbinder D', 'Casillas J', 'Krull KR', 'Goodman P', 'Leisenring W', 'Recklitis C', 'Alderfer MA', 'Robison LL', 'Armstrong GT', 'Kunin-Batson A', 'Stuber M', 'Zeltzer LK']","[""Department of Pediatrics and Division of Hematology, CHOC Children's Hospital, Orange, CA 92868, USA. dbuchbinder@choc.org""]",['eng'],"['U24 CA055727-12A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-11S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-11S2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-06A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101022,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma/psychology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Siblings/*psychology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3223600,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.1848 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2011 Dec;20(12):1259-68. doi: 10.1002/pon.1848.

Some dietary elements promote the growth of cancer but others, such as plant-derived compounds, may reverse this process. PURPOSE: We tried to investigate yet another approach of cancer prevention through cancer cell differentiation, using a common non-mutagenic flavonoid apigenin 7-glucoside. METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated with or without apigenin 7-glucoside. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay, and the cell cycle distribution was estimated by propidium iodide staining of DNA. To determine cellular differentiation, cell surface differentiation markers CD11b and CD14 were used. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was then performed to identify proteins that may be important in HL-60 cell differentiation following apigenin 7-glucoside treatment. RESULTS: Apigenin 7-glucoside inhibited HL-60 cell growth, dose- and time-dependently, but did not cause apoptosis. The distribution of cells at different stages in the cell cycle indicated an accumulation of treated cells in G(2)/M phase. Moreover, apigenin 7-glucoside induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Ten proteins that might play essential role in granulocytic differentiation were identified by proteomics. CONCLUSIONS: A complete understanding of the preventive effects of plant-based diet on cancer depends on the mechanisms of action of different plant components on processes. We hope these findings may contribute to the understandings of the different approaches for chemoprevention of cancer.","['Nakazaki, Eri', 'Tsolmon, Soninkhishig', 'Han, Junkyu', 'Isoda, Hiroko']","['Nakazaki E', 'Tsolmon S', 'Han J', 'Isoda H']","['Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8572, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111124,Germany,Eur J Nutr,European journal of nutrition,100888704,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Apigenin/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,2011/11/25 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00394-011-0282-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nutr. 2013 Feb;52(1):25-35. doi: 10.1007/s00394-011-0282-4.

The oncolytic properties of the new fusogenic adenovirus, ICOVIR16, were analyzed both in vitro and in vivo, and compared with that of its non-fusogenic counterpart, ICOVIR15. Our results indicate that GALV expression by ICOVIR16 induced extensive syncytia formation and enhanced tumor cell killing in a variety of tumor cell types. When injected intratumorally or intravenously into mice with large pre-established melanoma or pancreatic tumors, ICOVIR16 rapidly reduced tumor burden, and in some cases, resulted in complete eradication of the tumors. Importantly, GALV expression induced tumor cell fusion in vivo and enhanced the spreading of the virus throughout the tumor. Taken together, these results indicate that GALV expression can improve the antitumoral potency of an oncolytic adenovirus and suggest that ICOVIR16 is a promising candidate for clinical evaluation in patients with cancer.","['Guedan, S', 'Grases, D', 'Rojas, J J', 'Gros, A', 'Vilardell, F', 'Vile, R', 'Mercade, E', 'Cascallo, M', 'Alemany, R']","['Guedan S', 'Grases D', 'Rojas JJ', 'Gros A', 'Vilardell F', 'Vile R', 'Mercade E', 'Cascallo M', 'Alemany R']","[""Translational Research Laboratory, IDIBELL-Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111124,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Order', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism', '*Giant Cells/virology', 'Humans', 'Injections', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/therapy', '*Oncolytic Viruses', 'Tumor Burden', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2011/11/25 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gt2011184 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2011.184 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2012 Nov;19(11):1048-57. doi: 10.1038/gt.2011.184.

Related to this, we have adopted such an approach for reconstituting active tetrameric complexes of monocytic leukemia zinc (MOZ, finger protein, recently renamed MYST3 or KAT6A) and MOZ-related factor (MORF, also known as MYST4 or KAT6B), two KATs directly linked to development of leukemia and self-renewal of stem cells. Herein, we use these complexes as examples to describe the related procedures. Similar methods have been used for reconstituting active complexes of histone deacetylases, lysine demethylases, and ubiquitin ligases, so this simple approach can be adapted for molecular dissection of various multisubunit complexes.","['Yan, Kezhi', 'Wu, Chao-Jung', 'Pelletier, Nadine', 'Yang, Xiang-Jiao']","['Yan K', 'Wu CJ', 'Pelletier N', 'Yang XJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, The Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Research Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits', 'Spodoptera']",,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-61779-376-9_29 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2012;809:445-64. doi: 10.1007/978-1-61779-376-9_29.,,,"['0 (Protein Subunits)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since transcription of NFkappaB-dependent genes is increased in numerous inflammatory disorders as well as in many types of cancer and leukemia, inhibition of NFkappaB-dependent transcription thus represents an important therapeutic target. We have previously shown that in human leukocytes, transcription of NFkappaB-dependent genes is inhibited by the nuclear translocation and accumulation of IkappaBalpha, which can be induced by an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export, leptomycin B (LMB). In this chapter, we describe a protocol that uses chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to analyze the regulation of NFkappaB recruitment to NFkappaB-dependent promoters by nuclear IkappaBalpha induced by LMB. We show that in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human U-937 macrophages, recruitment of NFkappaB p65 and p50 proteins to NFkappaB-dependent promoters of IkappaBalpha and cIAP2 genes is suppressed by the LMB-induced nuclear IkappaBalpha. Even though in this study we use U-937 macrophages, this protocol should be readily adaptable to analyze the regulation of NFkappaB recruitment by nuclear IkappaBalpha also in other cell types.","['Ramaswami, Sitharam', 'Manna, Subrata', 'Juvekar, Ashish', 'Kennedy, Steven', 'Vancura, Ales', 'Vancurova, Ivana']","['Ramaswami S', 'Manna S', 'Juvekar A', 'Kennedy S', 'Vancura A', 'Vancurova I']","[""Department of Biological Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, USA.""]",['eng'],"['AI085497/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM079581/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/*methods', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/metabolism']",,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-61779-376-9_8 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2012;809:121-34. doi: 10.1007/978-1-61779-376-9_8.,,,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We established new assay systems to detect the infectivity of cell-free HTLVs and examined the stability of cell-free HTLVs at different temperatures. HTLVs lost infectivity more rapidly than did bovine leukemia virus (BLV), which is genetically related to HTLVs. The half-lives of three HTLV-I strains (two cosmopolitan strains and one Melanesian strain) at 37 degrees C were approximately 0.6 h, whereas the half-life of a BLV strain was 8.5 h. HTLV-I rapidly lost infectivity unexpectedly at 0 and 4 degrees C. We examined the stability of vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes with HTLV-I, HTLV-II or BLV Env proteins, and the Env proteins of HTLVs were found to be more unstable at 4 and 25 degrees C than the Env proteins of the BLV. Over the course of the viral life cycle, heat treatment inhibited HTLV-I infection at the phase of attachment to the host cells, and inhibition was more marked upon entry into the cells. The HTLV-I Env surface (SU) protein (gp46) was easily released from virions during incubation at 37 degrees C. However, this release was inhibited by pre-treatment of the virions with N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting that the inter-subunit bond between gp46 SU and gp21 transmembrane (TM) proteins is rearranged by disulfide bond isomerization. HTLVs are highly unstable over a wide range of temperatures because the disulfide bonds between the SU and TM proteins are labile.","['Shinagawa, Masahiko', 'Jinno-Oue, Atsushi', 'Shimizu, Nobuaki', 'Roy, Bibhuti Bhusan', 'Shimizu, Akira', 'Hoque, Sk Ariful', 'Hoshino, Hiroo']","['Shinagawa M', 'Jinno-Oue A', 'Shimizu N', 'Roy BB', 'Shimizu A', 'Hoque SA', 'Hoshino H']","['21st Century COE Program, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', '21st Century COE Program, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Disulfides/chemistry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity/*radiation effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/pathogenicity/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/pathogenicity/radiation effects', 'Microbial Viability/*radiation effects', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Subunits/chemistry', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry']",,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.037622-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2012 Mar;93(Pt 3):608-617. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.037622-0.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of pretreatment characteristics, referral and treatment patterns, and outcomes in 548 AML patients evaluated at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, a tertiary care referral center in Baltimore, MD, from 2000 through 2009. Cases were analyzed for time from diagnosis to referral, age, race, gender, socioeconomic status, antecedent hematologic disorder, cytotoxic or radiation therapy for prior malignancy, karyotype, fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3) mutations, intensive chemotherapy, clinical trial participation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Black patients (n=105) were younger than white patients (n=396) (54 vs. 61 years, p<0.001), were more commonly female (55% vs. 45%, p<0.001), and had a lower estimated median household income ($42,677 vs. $53,534 per year, p<0.001). Black patients more frequently had complex karyotypes (26% vs. 12%, p=0.002) and less frequently normal karyotypes (27% vs. 42%, p=0.02). FLT3 mutation frequency was similar. Time to referral and proportion of patients receiving intensive chemotherapy did not differ, but both clinical trial participation (43% vs. 54%, p=0.04) and HSCT (17% vs. 35% for patients </=70 years old, p=0.001) were less frequent in blacks than whites. Nevertheless, OS was similar in all black and white patients (median 15 vs. 14 months, p=0.23), and when stratified by age, gender and karyotype risk classification. CONCLUSION: AML presentation and treatment differed in black and white patients, but OS was similar. Black patients appear to have barriers to clinical trial participation and HSCT, and there may be barriers to tertiary care referral for black males.","['Bierenbaum, Jason', 'Davidoff, Amy J', 'Ning, Yi', 'Tidwell, Michael L', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Baer, Maria R']","['Bierenbaum J', 'Davidoff AJ', 'Ning Y', 'Tidwell ML', 'Gojo I', 'Baer MR']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA051008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA134274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 CA145831/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20111121,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Baltimore', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*ethnology/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Mutation Rate', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Prognosis', '*Referral and Consultation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC6460287,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00515-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.10.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Feb;36(2):140-5. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.10.018.

The role of BCL-2 family members was investigated using the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. RESULTS: Chondrosarcoma cells showed highest resistance to cisplatin. 3D cell pellets, morphologically strongly resembling chondrosarcoma in vivo, confirmed nuclear incorporation of doxorubicin. MDR pump activity was heterogeneous among cultures. Chondrosarcoma cells responded to ABT-737 and combination with doxorubicin led to complete loss of cell viability and apoptosis with cytochrome C release. CONCLUSIONS: Despite MDR pump activity and abundance of hyaline cartilaginous matrix, doxorubicin is able to accumulate in the cell nuclei. By repairing the apoptotic machinery, we were able to sensitize chondrosarcoma cells to doxorubicin and cisplatin, indicating an important role for BCL-2 family members in chemoresistance and a promising new treatment strategy for inoperable chondrosarcoma.","['van Oosterwijk, J G', 'Herpers, B', 'Meijer, D', 'Briaire-de Bruijn, I H', 'Cleton-Jansen, A M', 'Gelderblom, H', 'van de Water, B', 'Bovee, J V M G']","['van Oosterwijk JG', 'Herpers B', 'Meijer D', 'Briaire-de Bruijn IH', 'Cleton-Jansen AM', 'Gelderblom H', 'van de Water B', 'Bovee JV']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chondrosarcoma', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)38724-1 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdr512 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2012 Jun;23(6):1617-26. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdr512.

Although the literature suggests that toxicity of ZnO-NPs may be related to their dissolution, the mechanism for ZnO-NP perturbation of cytosolic zinc concentration ([Zn(2+)](c)) homeostasis remains obscure. Using FluoZin-3 and RhodZin-3, this study investigated changes in both [Zn(2+)](c) and mitochondrial free Zn(2+) concentration ([Zn(2+)](m)) under conditions of ZnO-NP treatment in vivo and in vitro. In human leukemia Jurkat cells and human lung carcinoma H1355 cells, ZnO-NP treatment resulted in an elevation of both [Zn(2+)](c) and [Zn(2+)](m). In H1355 cells, ZnO-NP treatment induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as caspase-3 activation and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release. In our in vivo experiments, when rats were exposed to ZnO-NPs, higher [Zn(2+)](c) and [Zn(2+)](m) were recorded in both broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells and white blood cells isolated from ZnO-NP-exposed rats, compared with high efficiency particulate air-filter-protected controls LDH levels were also elevated in the BAL of ZnO-NP-exposed rats compared with controls. A mechanical toxicological pathway for ZnO-NP toxicity is suggested by these results: an elevation in [Zn(2+)](c) resulting from ZnO-NP dissolution in the intracellular endosome; cytosolic Zn(2+) sequestration by mitochondria; and elevated [Zn(2+)](m) leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, and cell apoptosis. We conclude that exposure to ZnO-NPs interferes with the homeostasis of [Zn(2+)](c,) and that elevated [Zn(2+)](c) results in cell apoptosis.","['Kao, Yi-Yun', 'Chen, Yi-Chun', 'Cheng, Tsun-Jen', 'Chiung, Yin-Mei', 'Liu, Pei-Shan']","['Kao YY', 'Chen YC', 'Cheng TJ', 'Chiung YM', 'Liu PS']","['Department of Microbiology, Soochow University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Jurkat Cells', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', '*Nanoparticles', 'Particle Size', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Time Factors', 'Zinc Oxide/metabolism/*toxicity']",,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['kfr319 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfr319 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2012 Feb;125(2):462-72. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfr319.

Various environmental and infectious factors that play a causative role in hematopoietic malignancies are described. In particular, several causative viruses, i.e. HTLV1, HHV8 and EBV, are discussed in depth. Numerous genetic abnormalities have been identified in leukemia and lymphoma, including chromosomal translocations, gene deletions, amplifications, and point mutations. Synopses are included for the most frequently encountered aberrations, and their relation to normal and malignant hematopoiesis, disease classification and prognosis. Major molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathways involved in the leukemogenesis are depicted; these include blockage of differentiation, self-sustainable proliferation, abnormal cell cycle progression and impaired apoptosis. Also included are the recently discovered microRNAs, and their potential role in the pathogenesis of leukemia and lymphoma.

However, conflicting results describing the role of Treg cells in haematological tumours warrant further investigations to clarify the interactions between Treg cells and the tumour. B-cell malignancy derives from different stages of B-cell development and differentiation in which T cells play a profound role. The transformed B cell may still be in need of T-cell help to thrive but simultaneously they may be recognized and destroyed by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Recent reports demonstrate that Treg cells can suppress and even kill B cells as part of their normal function to rescue the body from autoimmunity. An emerging body of evidence points out that Treg cells not only inhibit tumour-specific T cells but may also have a role in suppressing the progression of the B-cell tumour.

The PI3K pathway seems to play a seminal role in the development of lymphoid malignancies. CAL-101 is a highly selective PI3K p110delta inhibitor currently undergoing clinical development. AREAS COVERED: The aims of this review are to summarize our understanding of the PI3K pathway, its role in lymphoid malignancies, the preclinical and clinical experience accumulated with CAL-101, a PI3Kdelta inhibitor, and potential areas of future development. EXPERT OPINION: CAL-101 is a novel drug that has shown preclinical activity against CLL, NHL, HL and PCM cells. There is early evidence of clinical efficacy in CLL and indolent NHL. Studies using CAL-101 alone or in combination are also ongoing in PCM, HL and aggressive NHL. However, additional studies are needed to prove CAL-101 is effective and safe as the goals of therapy for patients with lymphoid neoplasms are not only directed towards improving response and cure rates but also prolonging survival without affecting quality of life.","['Castillo, Jorge J', 'Furman, Michael', 'Winer, Eric S']","['Castillo JJ', 'Furman M', 'Winer ES']","['The Miriam Hospital, Division of Hematology and Oncology, 164 Summit Ave, Providence, RI 02906, USA. jcastillo@lifespan.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111124,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/pathology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Purines/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/adverse effects/*pharmacology']",,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.640318 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Jan;21(1):15-22. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.640318.

METHODS: Adult patients with hematological malignancies at National Taiwan University Hospital between 1996 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with positive serology for HIV were excluded. TB disease is diagnosed by positive culture(s) in the presence of compatible symptoms and signs. The demographics, laboratory and, microbiological features, were analyzed in the context of clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-three of 2984 patients (1.78%) were diagnosed with TB disease. The estimated incidence was 120 per 100,000 adult patients with hematological malignancies. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia had a significantly higher incidence of TB disease than other subtypes of hematological malignancies (2.87% vs. 1.21%, p = 0.002, odds ratio, 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-4.41). Thirty-eight patients (72%) with non-disseminated pulmonary TB disease presented typically with mediastinal lymphadenopathy (53%), pleural effusion (47%) and fibrocalcific lesions (43%) on chest imaging. The 15 (28%) patients with extra-pulmonary disease had lower rates of defervescence within 72 h of empirical antimicrobial therapy (13% vs 45%, p = 0.03) and a higher 30-day in-hospital mortality (20% vs. 0%, p = 0.004) compared to those with disease confined to the lungs. CONCLUSIONS: TB disease is not uncommon among patients with hematological malignancies in Taiwan. Patients who received a diagnosis of extra-pulmonary TB suffered higher mortality than those with pulmonary TB alone. Clinicians should consider TB in the differential diagnoses of prolonged fever in patients with hematological malignancies, particularly in regions of high endemicity.","['Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Sheng, Wang-Huei', 'Cheng, Aristine', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Chen, Yee-Chun', 'Wang, Jaun-Yuan', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Chang, Shan-Chwen']","['Chen CY', 'Sheng WH', 'Cheng A', 'Tsay W', 'Huang SY', 'Tang JL', 'Chen YC', 'Wang JY', 'Tien HF', 'Chang SC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, National TaiwanUniversity Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antitubercular Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*isolation & purification', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Taiwan', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tuberculosis/*drug therapy/microbiology/mortality/*pathology']",PMC3241214,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/03/29 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-11-324 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-11-324 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2011 Nov 23;11:324. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-11-324.,,,['0 (Antitubercular Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax1 and Tax2 transactivate multiple host genes involved in cellular immune responses within the cellular microenvironment, including induction of genes encoding expression of CC-chemokines. It is speculated that HTLV Tax proteins may act as immune modulators. In this study, recombinant Tax1 and Tax2 proteins were tested for their effects on the viability of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and their ability to induce expression of CC-chemokines and to downregulate the level of CCR5 expression in PBMCs. PBMCs obtained from uninfected donors were cultured in a range of Tax1 and Tax2 concentrations (10-100 pM), and supernatant fluids were harvested at multiple time points for quantitative determinations of MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, and RANTES/CCL5. Treatment of PBMCs with Tax1 and Tax2 proteins (100 pM) resulted in a significant increase in viability over a 7-d period compared to controls (p<0.01). Both Tax1 and Tax2 induced high levels of all three CC-chemokines over the dosing range compared to mock-treated controls (p<0.05). The gated population of lymphocytes treated with Tax2, as well as lymphocytes from HTLV-2-infected donors, showed a significantly lower percentage of CCR5-positive cells compared to those of uninfected donors and from mock-treated lymphocytes, respectively (p<0.05). These results suggest that Tax1 and Tax2 could promote innate immunity in the extracellular environment during HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections via CC-chemokine ligands and receptors.","['Barrios, Christy S', 'Abuerreish, Muna', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Castillo, Laura', 'Giam, Chou-Zen', 'Beilke, Mark A']","['Barrios CS', 'Abuerreish M', 'Lairmore MD', 'Castillo L', 'Giam CZ', 'Beilke MA']","['Infectious Diseases Division, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 A149744/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokines, CC/*immunology', 'Culture Media/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/virology', 'HTLV-II Infections/immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR5/immunology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",PMC3234705,2011/11/25 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/11/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/vim.2011.0037 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 2011 Dec;24(6):429-39. doi: 10.1089/vim.2011.0037.

Clinically, DS is characterized by weight gain, fever not attributable to infection, respiratory distress, cardiac involvement, hypotension, and/or acute renal failure. At the histological point of view, there is an extensive interstitial and intra-alveolar pulmonary infiltration by maturing myeloid cells, endothelial cell damage, intra-alveolar edema, inter-alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrinous exsudates. DS pathogenesis is not completely understood, but it is believed that an excessive inflammatory response is the main phenomenon involved, which results in increased production of chemokines and expression of adhesion molecules on APL cells. Due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with DS, its recognition and the prompt initiation of the treatment is of utmost importance.

This article gives an overview of recent reports on the incidence and the treatment of t-MDS/t-AML after HL therapy and describes the efforts currently made to reduce the risk to develop this severe late effect.","['Eichenauer, D A', 'Engert, A']","['Eichenauer DA', 'Engert A']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111024,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,PMC3219648,2011/11/24 06:00,2011/11/24 06:01,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2011.046 [doi]', 'mjhid-3-1-e2011046 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2011;3(1):e2011046. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2011.046.

The most frequent is the t(15;17)(q22;q21), which fuses the PML and RARA genes, giving rise to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). An increasing proportion of APL cases are therapy-related (t-APL), which develop following exposure to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapeutic agents that target DNA topoisomerase II (topoII), particularly mitoxantrone and epirubicin. To gain insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the t(15;17) we mapped the translocation breakpoints in a series of t-APLs, which revealed significant clustering according to the nature of the drug exposure. Remarkably, in approximately half of t-APL cases arising following mitoxantrone treatment for breast cancer or multiple sclerosis, the chromosome 15 breakpoint fell within an 8-bp ""hotspot"" region in PML intron 6, which was confirmed to be a preferential site of topoII-mediated DNA cleavage induced by mitoxantrone. Chromosome 15 breakpoints falling outside the ""hotspot"", and the corresponding RARA breakpoints were also shown to be functional topoII cleavage sites. The observation that particular regions of the PML and RARA loci are susceptible to topoII-mediated DNA damage induced by epirubicin and mitoxantrone may underlie the propensity of these agents to cause APL.","['Joannides, M', 'Mays, A N', 'Mistry, A R', 'Hasan, S K', 'Reiter, A', 'Wiemels, J L', 'Felix, C A', 'Coco, F Lo', 'Osheroff, N', 'Solomon, E', 'Grimwade, D']","['Joannides M', 'Mays AN', 'Mistry AR', 'Hasan SK', 'Reiter A', 'Wiemels JL', 'Felix CA', 'Coco FL', 'Osheroff N', 'Solomon E', 'Grimwade D']","[""Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, UK.""]",['eng'],['R01 GM033944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20111024,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,PMC3219647,2011/11/24 06:00,2011/11/24 06:01,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2011.045 [doi]', 'mjhid-3-1-e2011045 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2011;3(1):e2011045. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2011.045.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that SAG is an anti-apoptotic protein and an attractive anti-cancer target. We also found recently that Sag knockout sensitized mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) to radiation and blocked mES cells to undergo endothelial differentiation. Here, we reported that compared to wild-type mES cells, the Sag(-/-) mES cells were much more sensitive to all-trans retinoic acid (RA)-induced suppression of cell proliferation and survival. While wild-type mES cells underwent differentiation upon exposure to RA, Sag(-/-) mES cells were induced to death via apoptosis instead. The cell fate change, reflected by cellular stiffness, can be detected as early as 12 hrs post RA exposure by AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy). We then extended this novel finding to RA differentiation therapy of leukemia, in which the resistance often develops, by testing our hypothesis that SAG inhibition would sensitize leukemia to RA. Indeed, we found a direct correlation between SAG overexpression and RA resistance in multiple leukemia lines. By using MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-Activating Enzyme (NAE), that inactivates SAG-SCF E3 ligase by blocking cullin neddylation, we were able to sensitize two otherwise resistant leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1 to RA. Mechanistically, RA sensitization by MLN4924 was mediated via enhanced apoptosis, likely through accumulation of pro-apoptotic proteins NOXA and c-JUN, two well-known substrates of SAG-SCF E3 ligase. Taken together, our study provides the proof-of-concept evidence for effective treatment of leukemia patients by RA-MLN4924 combination.","['Tan, Mingjia', 'Li, Yun', 'Yang, Ruiguo', 'Xi, Ning', 'Sun, Yi']","['Tan M', 'Li Y', 'Yang R', 'Xi N', 'Sun Y']","['Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R43 GM084520/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA118762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA156744/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA156744/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA111554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111115,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3217012,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027726 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-12703 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27726. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027726.

Immature alphabeta T cells developing in the thymus are particularly sensitive to stress, with infections and/or exposure to lipopolysaccharide or glucocorticoids eliciting a rapid apoptotic program. MicroRNAs are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that regulate global gene expression by targeting diverse mRNAs for degradation. We hypothesized that a subset of thymically encoded microRNAs would be stress responsive and modulate thymopoiesis. We performed microRNA profiling of thymic microRNAs isolated from control or stressed thymic tissue obtained from mice. We identified 18 microRNAs that are dysregulated >1.5-fold in response to lipopolysaccharide or the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone. These included the miR-17-90 cluster, which have anti-apoptotic functions, and the miR-181 family, which contribute to T cell tolerance. The stress-induced changes in the thymic microRNAs are dynamically and distinctly regulated in the CD4(-)CD8(-), CD4(+)CD8(+), CD4(+)CD8(-), and CD4(-)CD8(+) thymocyte subsets. Several of the differentially regulated murine thymic miRs are also stress responsive in the heart, kidney, liver, brain, and/or spleen. The most dramatic thymic microRNA down modulated is miR-181d, exhibiting a 15-fold reduction following stress. This miR has both similar and distinct gene targets as miR-181a, another member of miR-181 family. Many of the differentially regulated microRNAs have known functions in thymopoiesis, indicating that their dysregulation will alter T cell repertoire selection and the formation of naive T cells. This data has implications for clinical treatments involving anti-inflammatory steroids, ablation therapies, and provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of infections.","['Belkaya, Serkan', 'Silge, Robert L', 'Hoover, Ashley R', 'Medeiros, Jennifer J', 'Eitson, Jennifer L', 'Becker, Amy M', 'de la Morena, M Teresa', 'Bassel-Duby, Rhonda S', 'van Oers, Nicolai S C']","['Belkaya S', 'Silge RL', 'Hoover AR', 'Medeiros JJ', 'Eitson JL', 'Becker AM', 'de la Morena MT', 'Bassel-Duby RS', 'van Oers NS']","['The Department of Immunology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI042953/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI31839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI42953/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111116,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Stress, Physiological/drug effects/*genetics', 'Thymocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/drug effects']",PMC3217971,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027580 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-14934 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27580. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027580.

It is not fully established whether leukemogenesis and therapeutic responses in DS AMkL patients are due to loss of the wild-type GATA1 or due to a unique function of GATA1s. METHODOLOGY: Stable clones of CMK cells with decreased GATA1s or Bcl-2 levels were generated by using GATA1- or BCL-2-specific lentivirus shRNAs. In vitro ara-C, daunorubicin, and VP-16 cytotoxicities of the shRNA stable clones were determined by using the Cell Titer-blue reagent. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were determined by flow cytometry analysis. Changes in gene transcript levels were determined by gene expression microarray and/or real-time RT-PCR. Changes in protein levels were measured by Western blotting. In vivo binding of GATA1s to IL1A promoter was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: Lentivirus shRNA knockdown of the GATA1 gene in the DS AMkL cell line, CMK (harbors a mutated GATA1 gene and only expresses GATA1s), resulting in lower GATA1s protein levels, promoted cell differentiation towards the megakaryocytic lineage and repressed cell proliferation. Increased basal apoptosis and sensitivities to ara-C, daunorubicin, and VP-16 accompanied by down-regulated Bcl-2 were also detected in the CMK GATA1 shRNA knockdown clones. Essentially the same results were obtained when Bcl-2 was knocked down with lentivirus shRNA in CMK cells. Besides Bcl-2, down-regulation of GATA1s also resulted in altered expression of genes (e.g., IL1A, PF4, and TUBB1) related to cell death, proliferation, and differentiation. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that GATA1s may facilitate leukemogenesis and potentially impact therapeutic responses in DS AMkL by promoting proliferation and survival, and by repressing megakaryocytic lineage differentiation, potentially by regulating expression of Bcl-2 protein and other relevant genes.","['Xavier, Ana C', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Dombkowski, Alan A', 'Balci, Tugce B', 'Berman, Jason N', 'Dellaire, Graham', 'Xie, Chengzhi', 'Buck, Steven A', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Taub, Jeffrey W']","['Xavier AC', 'Edwards H', 'Dombkowski AA', 'Balci TB', 'Berman JN', 'Dellaire G', 'Xie C', 'Buck SA', 'Matherly LH', 'Ge Y', 'Taub JW']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['P30 ES006639/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120772/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA120772/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES06639/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111116,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1alpha/genetics', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",PMC3217966,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027486 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-19117 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27486. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027486.

VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are the major proangiogenic cytokines that have been studied, and evaluation of their prognostic impact in childhood ALL has been reported in several studies, though with controversial results.

In Philadelphia-positive ALL, deletions of the IKZF1 gene were identified as prognostically adverse factors. These improved insights in the molecular background and the clinical heterogeneity of distinct cytogenetic subgroups may allow most differentiated therapeutic decisions, for example, with respect to the indication to allogeneic HSCT within genetically defined ALL subtypes. Quantitative real-time PCR allows highly sensitive monitoring of the minimal residual disease (MRD) load, either based on reciprocal gene fusions or immune gene rearrangements. Molecular diagnostics provided the basis for targeted therapy concepts, for example, combining the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib with chemotherapy in patients with Philadelphia-positive ALL. Screening for BCR-ABL1 mutations in Philadelphia-positive ALL allows to identify patients who may benefit from second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors or from novel compounds targeting the T315I mutation. Considering the central role of the molecular techniques for the management of patients with ALL, efforts should be made to facilitate and harmonize immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular mutation screening. Furthermore, the potential of high-throughput sequencing should be evaluated for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with B-lineage ALL.","['Oyekunle, Anthony', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Klyuchnikov, Evgeny', 'Zander, Axel Rolf', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Bacher, Ulrike']","['Oyekunle A', 'Haferlach T', 'Kroger N', 'Klyuchnikov E', 'Zander AR', 'Schnittger S', 'Bacher U']","['Department for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH), 20246 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111110,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,PMC3216286,2011/11/24 06:00,2011/11/24 06:01,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/154745 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2011;2011:154745. doi: 10.1155/2011/154745.

In this study, we explored potential regulatory relationships between TIP60 and the c-Myb oncoprotein in hematopoietic cells. We first showed that TIP60 is a c-Myb interacting protein and that the interaction is dependent on the TIP60 acetyltransferase domain and c-Myb transactivation domain. We then found that coexpressing TIP60 decreases the transcriptional activation ability of c-Myb in functional reporter assays. A ChIP assay also revealed that TIP60 binds to the c-Myb target gene c-Myc promoter in a c-Myb-dependent manner. Consistently, knockdown of Tip60 expression by siRNA increased endogenous c-Myc expression. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation of Jurkat cell lysates revealed that c-Myb is associated with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, known to interact with TIP60 and repress transcription. Finally, we compared Tip60 expression in six primary AML samples with three normal CD34(+) cell samples using quantitative RT-PCR. Tip60 expression was significantly ( approximately 60%) lower in the AML samples. In summary, these studies demonstrate that TIP60 negatively modulates c-Myb transcriptional activity by recruiting histone deacetylases in human hematopoietic cells, leading us to hypothesize that TIP60 is a normal regulator of c-Myb function and that dysregulated or mutated TIP60 may contribute to c-Myb-driven leukemogenesis.","['Zhao, Huiwu', 'Jin, Shenghao', 'Gewirtz, Alan M']","['Zhao H', 'Jin S', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. huiwuz@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['T32 DK007780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5T32DK007780/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111121,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lysine Acetyltransferase 5', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3256894,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)53332-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.279950 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jan 6;287(2):925-34. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.279950.

This likely relates to the different shape of the immature spine. INTRODUCTION: We hypothesized that the anatomical distribution of vertebral fractures (VF) would be different in children compared to adults. METHODS: We compared the distribution of VF defined using the Genant semi-quantitative method (GSQ method) in adults (N = 221; 545 fractures) and in children early in the course of glucocorticoid therapy (N = 44; 94 fractures). RESULTS: The average age in the adult cohort was 62.9 years (standard deviation (SD), 13.4 years), 26% was male, the mean lumbar spine Z-score was -1.0 (SD, 1.5), and the corresponding T-score was -2.4 (SD, 1.4). The pediatric cohort median age was 7.7 years (range, 2.1-16.6 years), the mean lumbar spine Z-score was -1.7 (SD, 1.5), 52% was male, and disease categories were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (66%), rheumatological conditions (21%), and nephrotic syndrome (14%). The VF distribution was biphasic in both populations, but the peaks differed in location. In adults, the peaks were at T7/T8 and at T12/L1. In children, the focus was higher in the thoracic spine, at T6/T7, and lower in the lumbar spine, at L1/L2. When children were assessed in two age-defined sub-groups, a biphasic VF distribution was seen in both, but the upward shift of the thoracic focus to T6 was observed only in the older group, with the highest rates of fracture present between ages 7 and 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the anatomical distribution of VF differs between children and adults, perhaps relating to the different shape of the immature spine, notably the changing ratio of kyphosis to lordosis.","['Siminoski, K', 'Lee, K-C', 'Jen, H', 'Warshawski, R', 'Matzinger, M A', 'Shenouda, N', 'Charron, M', 'Coblentz, C', 'Dubois, J', 'Kloiber, R', 'Nadel, H', ""O'Brien, K"", 'Reed, M', 'Sparrow, K', 'Webber, C', 'Lentle, B', 'Ward, L M']","['Siminoski K', 'Lee KC', 'Jen H', 'Warshawski R', 'Matzinger MA', 'Shenouda N', 'Charron M', 'Coblentz C', 'Dubois J', 'Kloiber R', 'Nadel H', ""O'Brien K"", 'Reed M', 'Sparrow K', 'Webber C', 'Lentle B', 'Ward LM']","['Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, University of Alberta, 6628-123 Street, Edmonton, AB, Canada, T6H 3T6. kerrygs@telusplanet.net']",['eng'],['64285-1/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111123,England,Osteoporos Int,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,9100105,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Kyphosis/complications', 'Lordosis/complications', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/injuries', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoporosis/chemically induced/etiology', 'Osteoporotic Fractures/chemically induced/etiology/pathology', 'Spinal Fractures/etiology/*pathology', 'Thoracic Vertebrae/injuries', 'Trauma Severity Indices']",PMC4067402,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/09/15 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00198-011-1837-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Osteoporos Int. 2012 Jul;23(7):1999-2008. doi: 10.1007/s00198-011-1837-1.

Pneumonia, but also endocarditis, urinary tract infections or keratitis can be caused by this bacteria in case of immunosuppression. Taking corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum into consideration as causitive agent provides for a fast onset of targeted antibiotic therapy. HISTORY AND FINDINGS: A 69-year-old man with immunoglobulin deficiency due to a chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with typical clinical, laboratory and imaging evidence of pneumonia. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum was detected as causative agent. After a prolongated course targeted antibiotic therapy and immunoglobulin substitution resulted in full recovery of the patient. CONCLUSION: In immunocompromised patients Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum should be taken into consideration as causative bacterium of pneumonia. Especially, immunoglobuline deficiency seems to be associated with pneumonia caused by Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum. Therefore, immunoglobulin substitution as well as a targeted antibiotic therapy should be considered.","['Gompelmann, D', 'Kappes, J', 'Heussel, C P', 'Schnabel, P A', 'Herth, F J F']","['Gompelmann D', 'Kappes J', 'Heussel CP', 'Schnabel PA', 'Herth FJ']","['Pneumologie und Beatmungsmedizin, Thoraxklinik Heidelberg. daniela.gompelmann@thoraxklinik-heidelberg.de']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20111122,Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteriological Techniques', 'Corynebacterium Infections/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/chemically induced/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab']",,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/01/19 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0031-1297277 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2011 Dec;136(48):2503-6. doi: 10.1055/s-0031-1297277.

Several cancer cells, including renal, lung, liver, prostate, bladder, and mammary cancer cells as well as leukemia cells, can be targets of bee venom peptides such as melittin and phospholipase A2. The cell cytotoxic effects through the activation of PLA2 by melittin have been suggested to be the critical mechanism for the anti-cancer activity of BV. The induction of apoptotic cell death through several cancer cell death mechanisms, including the activation of caspase and matrix metalloproteinases, is important for the melittin-induced anti-cancer effects. The conjugation of cell lytic peptide (melittin) with hormone receptors and gene therapy carrying melittin can be useful as a novel targeted therapy for some types of cancer, such as prostate and breast cancer. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding potential of bee venom and its compounds such as melittin to induce cytotoxic, antitumor, immunomodulatory, and apoptotic effects in different tumor cells in vivo or in vitro. The recent applications of melittin in various cancers and a molecular explanation for the antiproliferative properties of bee venom are discussed.","['Orsolic, Nada']",['Orsolic N'],"['Department of Animal Physiology, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia. norsolic@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bee Venoms/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/09/15 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10555-011-9339-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2012 Jun;31(1-2):173-94. doi: 10.1007/s10555-011-9339-3.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bee Venoms)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, there has been little work on strategies to reposition experimental cancer agents for testing in alternate settings that could shorten their clinical development time. Progress in each area has lagged, in part, because of the lack of systematic methods to define drug off-target effects (OTE) that might affect important cancer cell signaling pathways. In this study, we addressed this critical gap by developing an OTE-based method to repurpose drugs for cancer therapeutics, based on transcriptional responses made in cells before and after drug treatment. Specifically, we defined a new network component called cancer-signaling bridges (CSB) and integrated it with a Bayesian factor regression model (BFRM) to form a new hybrid method termed CSB-BFRM. Proof-of-concept studies were conducted in breast and prostate cancer cells and in promyelocytic leukemia cells. In each system, CSB-BFRM analysis could accurately predict clinical responses to more than 90% of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and more than 75% of experimental clinical drugs that were tested. Mechanistic investigation of OTEs for several high-ranking drug-dose pairs suggested repositioning opportunities for cancer therapy, based on the ability to enforce retinoblastoma-dependent repression of important E2F-dependent cell-cycle genes. Together, our findings establish new methods to identify opportunities for drug repositioning or to elucidate the mechanisms of action of repositioned drugs.","['Jin, Guangxu', 'Fu, Changhe', 'Zhao, Hong', 'Cui, Kemi', 'Chang, Jenny', 'Wong, Stephen T C']","['Jin G', 'Fu C', 'Zhao H', 'Cui K', 'Chang J', 'Wong ST']","['Department of Systems Medicine and Bioengineering, The Methodist Hospital Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medical College, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['U54 CA149196-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA149196-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA149196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA149196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA149196-01S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111122,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3251651,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-2333 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2333 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Jan 1;72(1):33-44. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2333.

Plasma concentrations of voriconazole and methadone were high, 12.4 mg/l (therapeutic range: 1-4 mg/l) and 1.6 mg/l (therapeutic range: 0.2-0.4 mg/l), respectively. In the absence of esomeprazole, no more episode of cardiac arrhythmia occurred and 7 days after, methadone plasma concentration fell at 0.57 ml/l while voriconazole concentration was at 5.5 mg/l. We speculate that a pharmacokinetic interaction between methadone and voriconazole was amplified by the addition of esomeprazole. This led to the large increase of the plasma concentration of methadone and was potentially responsible for its cardiac toxicity. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the potential interaction between voriconazole, esomeprazole and methadone leading to arrhythmia. The inhibitory potential of voriconazole is possibly increased by esomeprazole.","['Scholler, Julie', 'Nivoix, Yasmine', 'Herbrecht, Raoul', 'Kemmel, Veronique', 'Leveque, Dominique']","['Scholler J', 'Nivoix Y', 'Herbrecht R', 'Kemmel V', 'Leveque D']","['Pharmacy, Hopital Hautepierre, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Avenue Moliere, 67000, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111123,Netherlands,Int J Clin Pharm,International journal of clinical pharmacy,101554912,IM,"['Adult', 'Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Esomeprazole/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Methadone/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Ventricular Dysfunction/chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Voriconazole']",,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11096-011-9581-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharm. 2011 Dec;33(6):905-8. doi: 10.1007/s11096-011-9581-3.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are still poorly understood. The current study determines the role of Fas/FasL in THP-1 cell apoptosis induced by 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from H. diffusa. METHODS: THP-1 cells were treated with 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from H. diffusa. The effect on the cell viability of THP-1 cells was evaluated using the trypan blue assay, and cell apoptosis was measured by Giemsa staining and flow cytometry. Protein expression was assayed using the Western blot method. RESULTS: Our results showed that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from H. diffusa induced THP-1 cell apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis was associated with a more prominent induction expression of Fas/FasL, DR4 and TRAIL in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, treatment of THP-1 cells with 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from H. diffusa resulted in activation of caspase-8. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study suggests that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from H. diffusa is able to enhance apoptosis of THP-1 cells, at least in part, through activation of Fas/FasL, DR4 and TRAIL. Moreover, triggering of caspase-8 activation mediated apoptotic induction.","['Wang, Jia-He', 'Shu, Lin-Hua', 'Yang, Li-Li', 'Zhang, Meng', 'He, Ping']","['Wang JH', 'Shu LH', 'Yang LL', 'Zhang M', 'He P']","['Department of Geriatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University Shenyang, PR China. wangjh1@sj-hospital.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111119,United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,IM,"['Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hedyotis/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0188-4409(11)00250-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcmed.2011.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 2011 Oct;42(7):577-83. doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2011.11.003.

Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted mainly of cyclosporine A, short-course methotrexate, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin. After a median follow-up of 118 months (68-174), the 10-year event-free survival rate after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) was 54.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.7%-69.8%), and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), it was 27.9% (14.5%-41.3%; P < .004).

Non relapse mortality was less after PBSCT than BMT (14.3% vs 30.2%), respectively. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, PBSCT showed a better overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.79; P = .007) compared to BMT; unfavorable/unknown prognostic impact cytogenetic abnormalities were an adverse factor for all patients (HR, 2.202; 95% CI, 1.19-4.06; P = .011).

PTX-loaded cSLN (PcSLN) were characterized by zeta potential and gel retardation of complexes with small interfering RNA (siRNA). The sizes of PcSLN did not significantly differ from those of empty cSLN without PTX (EcSLN). The use of cSLN increased the cellular uptake of fluorescent dsRNA in human epithelial carcinoma KB cells, with PcSLN complexed to fluorescence-labeled dsRNA promoting the greatest uptake. For co-delivery of therapeutic siRNA, human MCL1-specific siRNA (siMCL1) was complexed with PcSLN; luciferase-specific siRNA (siGL2) complexed to EcSLN or PcSLN was used as a control. MCL1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in KB cells treated with siMCL1 complexed to PcSLN, but not in groups treated with siMCL alone or siGL2 complexed to PcSLN. siMCL1 complexed to PcSLN exerted the greatest in vitro anticancer effects in KB cells, followed by siMCL1 complexed to EcSLN, siGL2 complexed to PcSLN, PTX alone, and siMCL1 alone. In KB cell-xenografted mice, intratumoral injection of PcSLN complexed to siMCL1 significantly reduced the growth of tumors. Taken together, our results demonstrate the potential of cSLN for the development of co-delivery systems of various lipophilic anticancer drugs and therapeutic siRNAs.","['Yu, Yong Hee', 'Kim, Eunjoong', 'Park, Dai Eui', 'Shim, Gayong', 'Lee, Sangbin', 'Kim, Young Bong', 'Kim, Chan-Wha', 'Oh, Yu-Kyoung']","['Yu YH', 'Kim E', 'Park DE', 'Shim G', 'Lee S', 'Kim YB', 'Kim CW', 'Oh YK']","['College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111113,Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Biopharm,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,9109778,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cations', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/pathology/therapy', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0939-6411(11)00319-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejpb.2011.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Biopharm. 2012 Feb;80(2):268-73. doi: 10.1016/j.ejpb.2011.11.002.

Analysing the spatial distribution of the incidence of AL and its lymphoblastic and myeloblastic subtypes may contribute to the identification of risk factors. This national registry-based study aimed to evaluate global spatial heterogeneity in the incidence rates of AL and to detect clusters in France over the period 1990-2006 on the 'living-zone' scale. Between 1990 and 2006, 7675 cases of AL were registered in the National Registry of Childhood Haematopoietic malignancies. Their spatial distribution in the 1895 'living zone' was first evaluated with two tests for global spatial heterogeneity (Potthoff-Witthinghill and Rogerson's tests) and then with the SaTScan and FleXScan methods, which aim to locate spatial and space-time clusters. Over 1990-2006, no spatial heterogeneity of AL or its subtypes was evidenced. In addition, none of the most likely clusters identified with SaTScan and FleXScan over the whole period was significant, and the systematic search for space-time clusters yielded nonsignificant results. However, when three subperiods were considered, five statistically significant nonoverlapping spatial clusters were identified. This study did not find evidence of any global spatial heterogeneity of AL incidence rates in France over the period 1990-2006. Although no significant spatial cluster was detected over the whole period, the study identified a few significant spatial clusters in specific periods. Even though the significance levels of those clusters do not strongly support the existence of local risk factors, the clusters may still reflect a slight impact of shared risk factors, including background environmental exposures, which require further investigation.","['Demoury, Claire', 'Goujon-Bellec, Stephanie', 'Guyot-Goubin, Aurelie', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Demoury C', 'Goujon-Bellec S', 'Guyot-Goubin A', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['INSERM, CESP Environmental Epidemiology of Cancer, University of Paris-Sud 11, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Demography', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Residence Characteristics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors']",,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32834e31d8 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2012 Jul;21(4):367-74. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32834e31d8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Piceatannol (3, 3', 4, 5'-trans-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally occurring hydroxylated analogue of resveratrol, is less studied than resveratrol but displays a wide spectrum of biological activity. Piceatannol has been found in various plants, including grapes, passion fruit, white tea, and Japanese knotweed. Besides antioxidative effects, piceatannol exhibits potential anticancer properties as suggested by its ability to suppress proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells, including leukemia, lymphoma; cancers of the breast, prostate, colon and melanoma. The growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of piceatannol are mediated through cell-cycle arrest; upregulation of Bid, Bax. Bik, Bok, Fas: P21(WAF1) down-regulation of Bcl-xL; BCL-2, clAP, activation of caspases (-3, -7,- 8, -9), loss of mitochondrial potential, and release of cytochrome c. Piceatannol has been shown to suppress the activation of some transcription factors, including NF-kappaB, which plays a central role as a transcriptional regulator in response to cellular stress caused by free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, cytokines, or microbial antigens. Piceatannol also inhibits JAK-1, which is a key member of the STAT pathway that is crucial in controlling cellular activities in response to extracellular cytokines and is a COX-2-inducible enzyme involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Although piceatannol has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, there are examples of its anti-apoptotic pro-proliferative activity. Piceatannol inhibits Syk kinase, which plays a crucial role in the coordination of immune recognition receptors and orchestrates multiple downstream signaling pathways in various hematopoietic cells. Piceatannol also binds estrogen receptors and stimulates growth of estrogen-dependent cancer cells. Piceatannol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and is converted mainly to a glucuronide conjugate; however, sulfation is also possible, based on in vitro studies. The pharmacological properties of piceatannol, especially its antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, suggests that piceatannol might be a potentially useful nutritional and pharmacological biomolecule; however, more data are needed on its bioavailability and toxicity in humans.","['Piotrowska, Hanna', 'Kucinska, Malgorzata', 'Murias, Marek']","['Piotrowska H', 'Kucinska M', 'Murias M']","['Department of Toxicology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, ul.

However, the detailed molecular mechanism(s) responsible remains largely undefined. We show in this study that HMGB1 released into the extracellular space protects gastric cancer cells from apoptosis induced by the microtubule-targeting drug vincristine through transcriptional upregulation of Mcl-1. Extracellular HMGB1 appeared essential for autophagy-mediated inhibition of apoptosis, in that siRNA knockdown of HMGB1 or inhibition of its release abolished the protective effect of autophagy. Strikingly, vincristine upregulated the Mcl-1 mRNA expression through a transcriptional increase, but did not alter the expression levels of the Mcl-1 protein. Inhibition of HMGB1 release blocked the increase in the Mcl-1 transcript and caused reduction in Mcl-1 at the protein level, indicating that HMGB1-mediated signaling was necessary for transcriptional upregulation of Mcl-1. This seemed critical for maintaining sufficient Mcl-1 protein expression required for survival of gastric cancer cells exposed to vincristine. The effect of extracellular HMGB1 on transcriptional regulation of Mcl-1 was confirmed in gastric cancer cells treated with recombinant HMGB1. Taken together, these results identify HMGB1-mediated upregulation of Mcl-1 transcription as an important mechanism by which autophagy protects gastric cancer cells from apoptosis induced by vincristine.","['Zhan, ZhenZhen', 'Li, Qun', 'Wu, Ping', 'Ye, Yan', 'Tseng, Hsin-Yi', 'Zhang, Linjie', 'Zhang, Xu Dong']","['Zhan Z', 'Li Q', 'Wu P', 'Ye Y', 'Tseng HY', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang XD']","['Department of Immunology; Anhui Medical University; Hefei, Anhui China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120101,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HMGB1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['18319 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.8.1.18319 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2012 Jan;8(1):109-21. doi: 10.4161/auto.8.1.18319.

STUDY DESIGN: One of the limitations in human embryo implantation research is lack of an available in vitro model that faithfully replicates human embryo-uterine interactions. In the present study, we examined the attachment and invasiveness of blastocysts from mice in Ishikawa cell (IK), a human endometrial cell, to clarify whether this new model is suitable to study implantation of embryos. We used IK and placed it in contact with blastocysts to initiate coculture experiments using a specifically designed medium. The culture medium was composed of Ham F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (1:1), 30% fetal calf serum, 63.5 nmol/L progesterone, 7.14 nmol/L estradiol-17beta, 100 mg/ml of insulin, and 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor.

The purpose of this study was to identify DNA copy number variations in karyotypically normal AML patients and their correlation with immunophenotypes. Conventional comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and immunophenotyping were performed in 46 untreated AML patients aged 7-68 years. Among the 86 Indian patients who had AML, 40 (46.5%) showed an abnormal karyotype and 46 (53.4%) showed no chromosome aberrations. The karyotypically abnormal AML patients were excluded from the study. Out of the 46 patients without chromosomal aberrations, 24 (52.2%) showed DNA copy number variations including losses and gains. The DNA copy number variations involved chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 16, 17 (gains) and 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 21 (losses). The aberrant immunophenotype was noticed in 13 of these 24 (54%) cases. The hidden chromosome rearrangements in karyotypically normal AML, which could not be detected by conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization, were detected by CGH. These genetic changes have an important role in the prognosis of the disease. The DNA copy number changes might also be involved in the aberrant immunophenotypes in our study.","['Kawankar, Nikesh', 'Korgaonkar, Seema', 'Kerketta, Lily', 'Madkaikar, Manisha', 'Jijina, Farah', 'Ghosh, Kanjaksha', 'Vundinti, Babu Rao']","['Kawankar N', 'Korgaonkar S', 'Kerketta L', 'Madkaikar M', 'Jijina F', 'Ghosh K', 'Vundinti BR']","['Department of Cytogenetics, National Institute of Immunohaematology (NIIH), Parel, Mumbai, India. vbaburao@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111122,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/*methods', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'India', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/08/21 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2011.0174 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2012 Apr;16(4):265-70. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2011.0174.

However, the functional involvement of Hmga1 in hematopoietic development and leukemic cells remains to be elucidated. Using Hmga1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in mice that endogenously express an Hmga1-GFP fusion protein, we examined Hmga1 expression in undifferentiated and differentiated populations of hematopoietic cells. During early T cell development in the thymus, Hmga1 is highly expressed in CD4/CD8-double negative (DN) cells and is transiently downregulated in CD4/CD8-double positive (DP) cells. Consistently, Hmga1 directly binds to cis-regulatory elements in the CD4/CD8 loci and the heterochromatin foci in DN-stage cells, but not in DP cells. Interestingly, CD4/CD8 expression in DN-stage leukemic cells is induced by inhibition of Hmga1 binding to nuclear DNA or RNA interference-mediated Hmga1 knockdown. In addition, Hmga1-depleted leukemic T cells markedly diminish proliferation, with transcriptional activation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes as a direct target of Hmga1. The data in the present study reveal a role of Hmga1 in transcriptional silencing in T cell lineages and leukemic cells.","['Xi, Yang', 'Watanabe, Sugiko', 'Hino, Yuko', 'Sakamoto, Chiyomi', 'Nakatsu, Yuko', 'Okada, Seiji', 'Nakao, Mitsuyoshi']","['Xi Y', 'Watanabe S', 'Hino Y', 'Sakamoto C', 'Nakatsu Y', 'Okada S', 'Nakao M']","['Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, and Global Center of Excellence Cell Fate Regulation Research and Education Unit, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111228,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD4 Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'CD8 Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'HMGA1a Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",PMC7713622,2011/11/24 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/11/24 06:00'],"['2011/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02159.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Mar;103(3):439-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02159.x.

The Bloom's syndrome helicase (BLM), mutations of which lead to BS, localizes to promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies and to the nucleolus of the cell, the site of RNA polymerase I-mediated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription. rRNA transcription is fundamental for ribosome biogenesis and therefore protein synthesis, cellular growth and proliferation; its inhibition limits cellular growth and proliferation as well as bodily growth. We report that nucleolar BLM facilitates RNA polymerase I-mediated rRNA transcription. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate the dependance of BLM nucleolar localization upon ongoing RNA polymerase I-mediated rRNA transcription. In vivo protein co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates that BLM interacts with RPA194, a subunit of RNA polymerase I. (3)H-uridine pulse-chase assays demonstrate that BLM expression is required for efficient rRNA transcription. In vitro helicase assays demonstrate that BLM unwinds GC-rich rDNA-like substrates that form in the nucleolus and normally inhibit progression of the RNA polymerase I transcription complex. These studies suggest that nucleolar BLM modulates rDNA structures in association with RNA polymerase I to facilitate RNA polymerase I-mediated rRNA transcription. Given the intricate relationship between rDNA metabolism and growth, our data may help in understanding the etiology of proportional dwarfism in BS.","['Grierson, Patrick M', 'Lillard, Kate', 'Behbehani, Gregory K', 'Combs, Kelly A', 'Bhattacharyya, Saumitri', 'Acharya, Samir', 'Groden, Joanna']","['Grierson PM', 'Lillard K', 'Behbehani GK', 'Combs KA', 'Bhattacharyya S', 'Acharya S', 'Groden J']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH 43210-2207, USA.']",['eng'],['CA117898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111121,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA, Ribosomal/chemistry/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase I/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'RecQ Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3277314,2011/11/23 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ddr545 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddr545 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2012 Mar 1;21(5):1172-83. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddr545.

To date, the regulatory function of RNF4 appears to be ubiquitin-mediated degradation of sumoylated cellular proteins. In the present study, we show that the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax is a substrate for RNF4 both in vivo and in vitro. We mapped the RNF4-binding site to a region adjacent to the Tax ubiquitin/SUMO modification sites K280/K284. Interestingly, RNF4 modification of Tax protein results in relocalization of the oncoprotein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of RNF4, but not the RNF4 RING mutant, resulted in cytoplasmic enrichment of Tax. The RNF4-induced nucleus-to-cytoplasm relocalization was associated with increased NF-kappaB-mediated and decreased cAMP Response Element-Binding (CREB)-mediated Tax activity. Finally, depletion of RNF4 by RNAi prevented the DNA damage-induced nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation of Tax. These results provide important new insight into STUbL-mediated pathways that regulate the subcellular localization and functional dynamics of viral oncogenes.","['Fryrear, Kimberly A', 'Guo, Xin', 'Kerscher, Oliver', 'Semmes, O John']","['Fryrear KA', 'Guo X', 'Kerscher O', 'Semmes OJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, The Leroy T.

Data on Ikaros function, including its role as a tumor suppressor and a regulator of cell cycle progression, come almost exclusively from murine studies; little is known of the mechanisms that regulate human Ikaros function. Our studies are the first to examine the function and regulation of human Ikaros isoforms during the cell cycle in human ALL. PROCEDURES: Electromobility shift assay (EMSA), confocal microscopy, and phosphopeptide mapping were used to study Ikaros function during different stages of the cell cycle. RESULTS: The DNA-binding activity of human Ikaros complexes undergoes dynamic changes as the cell cycle progresses. In S phase, Ikaros DNA-binding affinity for regulatory regions of its target genes decreases, while its binding to pericentromeric heterochromatin is preserved and correlates with Ikaros pericentromeric localization. These S phase-specific changes in Ikaros function are controlled by phosphorylation via the CK2 kinase pathway. During cell cycle progression, the subcellular pericentromeric localization of the largest human Ikaros isoforms is different from that in mouse cells, suggesting unique functions for human Ikaros. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the function of Ikaros is cell cycle-specific and controlled by CK2-mediated phosphorylation during S phase of the cell cycle in human T-cell and B-cell ALL. The differences we observe in murine and human Ikaros function highlight the importance of using human cells in studies of ALL. These data identify the CK2 pathway as a target for therapies in ALL.","['Li, Zhanjun', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Ouyang, Hongsheng', 'Lai, Liangxue', 'Payne, Kimberly J', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Li Z', 'Song C', 'Ouyang H', 'Lai L', 'Payne KJ', 'Dovat S']","['Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL095120/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL095120-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111121,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Casein Kinase II/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', '*S Phase']",PMC3292658,2011/11/23 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23406 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jul 15;59(1):69-76. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23406.

Patients with HCV infection frequently show co-infections with GB virus C (GBV-C, formerly known as hepatitis G virus), and some studies have suggested a higher incidence of GBV-C infection in patients with B cell-NHLs. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the association between HCV and/or GBV-C infection and B cell-NHLs in different geographic areas. One hundred thirty-seven lymphoma cases and 125 non-lymphoma matched controls were enrolled in an international case-control study conducted in Switzerland (Bellinzona), Spain (Barcelona) and England (Southampton) on samples collected from 2001 to 2002. In Bellinzona (41 cases and 81 controls), the overall prevalence of HCV was 3.3% (4.9% in NHLs), and the overall prevalence of GBV-C was 24% (22% in NHLs). In Barcelona (46 cases and 44 controls), the prevalence of HCV was 10% (8.7% in NHLs) and the prevalence of GBV-C 20% (13% in NHLs). There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of both infections between patients with NHL and controls. In Southampton, 50 NHL cases were analysed, none of them was found to be HCV-positive; therefore, no control group was analysed and GBV-C analysis was not performed, too. Both in Bellinzona and in Barcelona, the seropositivity rate was significantly lower for HCV than for GBV-C, suggesting that their transmission can be independent. The incidence of HCV was significantly higher in Barcelona than that in Bellinzona. This study confirmed the existence of marked geographic differences in the prevalence of HCV in NHL but cannot provide any significant evidence for an association between HCV and/or GBV-C and B-cell NHLs.","['Nicolosi Guidicelli, Sabrina', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Falcone, Umberto', 'Conconi, Annarita', 'Christinat, Alexandre', 'Rodriguez-Abreu, Delvys', 'Grisanti, Salvatore', 'Lobetti-Bodoni, Chiara', 'Piffaretti, Jean Claude', 'Johnson, Peter W', 'Mombelli, Giorgio', 'Cerny, Andreas', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Cavalli, Franco', 'Zucca, Emanuele']","['Nicolosi Guidicelli S', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Falcone U', 'Conconi A', 'Christinat A', 'Rodriguez-Abreu D', 'Grisanti S', 'Lobetti-Bodoni C', 'Piffaretti JC', 'Johnson PW', 'Mombelli G', 'Cerny A', 'Montserrat E', 'Cavalli F', 'Zucca E']","['Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111121,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Flaviviridae Infections/*epidemiology/virology', 'GB virus C/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis C/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Human/*epidemiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Switzerland/epidemiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/23 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.1015 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2012 Sep;30(3):137-42. doi: 10.1002/hon.1015.

PU.1, a member of the E-twenty-six family of transcription factors, is indispensable for normal hematopoiesis. Inactivation of PU.1 induces acute leukemia in mice. Recent data suggest that the leukemia-associated fusion protein pro-myelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARalpha) inhibits PU.1, but the mechanism mediating this inhibition is unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which the fusion proteins PML/RARalpha and pro-myelocytic leukemia zinc finger/RARalpha (PLZF/RARalpha) (X-RARalpha) interfere with the function of PU.1. We found that X-RARalpha proteins functionally inactivate PU.1 by reducing its promoter-binding capacity, resulting in a reduction in PU.1-dependent transcriptional transactivation. In fact, X-RARalpha proteins directly interact with PU.1, leading to both the sequestration of PU.1 from its target promoters and a reduction in its serine phosphorylation, which is crucial for its promoter binding and transcriptional activity. We found that the functional inactivation of PU.1 could be overcome by the forced overexpression of PU.1 in PML/RARalpha- or PLZF/RARalpha-positive murine hematopoietic progenitor cells; evidently, this overexpression rescued the leukemic differentiation block induced by X-RARalpha proteins. Our data thus provide strong evidence that X-RARalpha proteins functionally inhibit PU.1, shedding light on the mechanism by which X-RARalpha proteins induce leukemogenesis.","['Seshire, A', 'Rossiger, T', 'Frech, M', 'Beez, S', 'Hagemeyer, H', 'Puccetti, E']","['Seshire A', 'Rossiger T', 'Frech M', 'Beez S', 'Hagemeyer H', 'Puccetti E']","['Department of Hematology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111122,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serine/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/11/23 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011331 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.331 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jun;26(6):1338-47. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.331.

METHODS: The Ankara Pediatric Pathology Working Group collected databases of pediatric solid tumors from six pediatric reference centers in order to analyze the incidence, distribution and some epidemiologic characteristics of the tumors and to establish a multicenter database for further studies. A five-year retrospective archive search was carried out. Excluding epithelial tumors of the skin, leukemia, lymphoreticular system neoplasias, metastatic tumors, and hamartomas, 1362 solid tumors in 1358 patients were classified according to age, sex, localization, histopathology and clinical behavior. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 0.9; 14.8% (201) of the patients belonged to 0-1 year age group, 20.7% (281) to 2-4 years, 25.9% (352) to 5-10 years, 22.2% (301) to 11-14 years, and 16.4% (223) to 15-18 years. Among all tumors, 708 (52.0%) were malignant, 645 (47.4%) benign tumors, 2 (0.1%) borderline tumors, and 2 (0.1%) unknown behavioral tumors. Malignant tumors were found in 50.2% (357) of female patients and in 54.0% (349) of male patients. A balanced distribution between benign and malignant entities among children under 18 years was observed. Comparison between the age groups revealed malignant cases outnumbered benign cases under 4 years of age while benign tumor numbers increased after 10 years of age. The most common entities in the malignant group were of sympathetic nervous system origin, while soft tissue tumors far outnumbered the others in the benign group. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the cancer patterns of children in the Ankara region mostly resemble with those of the western population. This study provides useful information on the diagnosis of solid tumors in children and highlights variations in cancer incidence in different age groups.","['Kacar, Ayper', 'Paker, Irem', 'Akcoren, Zuhal', 'Gucer, Safak', 'Kale, Gulsev', 'Orhan, Diclehan', 'Talim, Beril', 'Poyraz, Aylar', 'Uluoglu, Omer', 'Heper, Aylin Okcu', 'Apaydin, Sema', 'Arda, Nilufer', 'Boduroglu, Esin', 'Albayrak, Aynur', 'Alper, Murat', 'Arikok, Ata Turker']","['Kacar A', 'Paker I', 'Akcoren Z', 'Gucer S', 'Kale G', 'Orhan D', 'Talim B', 'Poyraz A', 'Uluoglu O', 'Heper AO', 'Apaydin S', 'Arda N', 'Boduroglu E', 'Albayrak A', 'Alper M', 'Arikok AT']","['Pathology Department, Ankara Child Diseases Hematology Oncology Research and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. ayperkacar@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111121,Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey']",,2011/11/23 06:00,2013/08/06 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12519-011-0323-3 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Pediatr. 2013 Feb;9(1):25-31. doi: 10.1007/s12519-011-0323-3.

Government pays an estimated $35 billion annually because of crashes, an estimated 12.6% of the economic cost of crashes (Federal 7.1%, State/local 5.5%). Government bears a higher percentage of the monetary costs of injury crashes than fatal crashes or crashes involving property damage only. Government is increasingly recovering the medical cost of crashes from auto insurers. Nevertheless, medical costs and income and sales tax losses account for 75% of government's crash costs. For State/local government to break even on a 100%-State funded investment in road safety, the intervention would need to have an unrealistically high benefit-cost ratio of 34. Government invests in medical treatment of illness to save lives and improve quality of life. Curing a child's leukemia, for example, is not less costly than leaving that leukemia untreated. Safety should not be held to a different standard.","['Miller, Ted R', 'Bhattacharya, Soma', 'Zaloshnja, Eduard', 'Taylor, Dexter', 'Bahar, Geni', 'David, Iuliana']","['Miller TR', 'Bhattacharya S', 'Zaloshnja E', 'Taylor D', 'Bahar G', 'David I']",['Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation Navigats Consulting.'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Adv Automot Med,Annals of advances in automotive medicine.

To address this need at the preclinical level, we implemented a high content imaging-based screen for the identification of small agents that induce AML cell death in vitro. Among a panel of 1040 Food and Drug Administration-approved agents, we identified pyrithione zinc (PZ) and ouabain (OUA) as potential antileukemic compounds. Both PZ and OUA efficiently induced cell death associated with apoptotic chromatin condensation and inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB survival signaling, leading to reduced expression of antiapoptotic proteins, in several AML cell lines. PZ- and OUA-induced cell death was associated with the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and led to the release of cytochrome c followed by caspase activation. Both PZ and OUA exerted significant anticancer effects in vivo, on human AML cells xenografts as well as ex vivo, on CD34(+) (but not CD34(-)) malignant myeloblasts from AML patients. Altogether, our results suggest that PZ and OUA may exhibit antileukemic effects by inducing the apoptotic demise of AML cells.","['Tailler, M', 'Senovilla, L', 'Lainey, E', 'Thepot, S', 'Metivier, D', 'Sebert, M', 'Baud, V', 'Billot, K', 'Fenaux, P', 'Galluzzi, L', 'Boehrer, S', 'Kroemer, G', 'Kepp, O']","['Tailler M', 'Senovilla L', 'Lainey E', 'Thepot S', 'Metivier D', 'Sebert M', 'Baud V', 'Billot K', 'Fenaux P', 'Galluzzi L', 'Boehrer S', 'Kroemer G', 'Kepp O']","['INSERM, U848, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111121,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Organometallic Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Ouabain/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2011/11/23 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011521 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.521 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Jul 26;31(30):3536-46. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.521.

Recently, we and others reported that ectopic expression of Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) protein strongly inhibits retrovirus replication. MOV10, a putative RNA helicase, can be packaged into HIV-1 virions by binding to the nucleocapsid (NC) region of Gag and inhibit viral replication at a postentry step. Here, we report critical determinants for MOV10 virion packaging and antiviral activity. MOV10 has 1,003 amino acids and seven helicase motifs. We found that MOV10 packaging requires the NC basic linker, and Gag binds to the N-terminal amino acids 261-305 region of MOV10. Our predicted MOV10 three-dimensional structure model indicates that the Gag binding region is located in a structurally exposed domain, which spans amino acids 93-305 and is Cys-His-rich. Simultaneous mutation of residues Cys-188, Cys-195, His-199, His-201, and His-202 in this domain significantly compromised MOV10 anti-HIV-1 activity. Notably, although MOV10-Gag interaction is required, it is not sufficient for MOV10 packaging, which also requires its C-terminal all but one of seven helicase motifs. Moreover, we have mapped the minimal MOV10 antiviral region to amino acids 99-949, indicating that nearly all MOV10 residues are required for its antiviral activity. Mutations of residues Cys-947, Pro-948, and Phe-949 at the C terminus of this region completely disrupted MOV10 anti-HIV-1 activity. Taken together, we have identified two critical MOV10 packaging determinants and eight other critical residues for anti-HIV-1 activity. These results provide a molecular basis for further understanding the MOV10 antiretroviral mechanism.","['Abudu, Aierken', 'Wang, Xiaojun', 'Dang, Ying', 'Zhou, Tao', 'Xiang, Shi-Hua', 'Zheng, Yong-Hui']","['Abudu A', 'Wang X', 'Dang Y', 'Zhou T', 'Xiang SH', 'Zheng YH']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824-4320, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI063944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI063944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI080225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 AI080225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111121,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Cell Line', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Models, Molecular', 'Nucleocapsid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Assembly/*physiology', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3256871,2011/11/23 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)53358-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.309831 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jan 6;287(2):1220-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.309831.

Many support its use in treatment for cancer, yet scientific evidence for the effect of TCM needs to be established. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review case reports on cancer patients treated by TCM therapies are included. Search runs were conducted in 4 main Chinese databases till December 2009. RESULTS: A total of 716 reports involving 1,198 cancer patients were identified and summarized. Top 5 of the reported cancers treated with TCM were lung cancer (14.44%; 173 patients), leukemia (14.11%; 169 patients), stomach cancer (10.85%; 130 patients), liver cancer (10.18%; 122 patients) and esophageal cancer (7.35%; 88 patients). In the majority of cases (66.44%; 772) combined treatments of Chinese and conventional medicine were applied. The use of herbal medicine was highly prevalent (98.50%; 1,168 patients), and the typical administration was an individually tailored treatment according to the pattern differentiation of symptoms (74.21%; 889 patients); the use of acupuncture was relatively rare (1.8%; 22 patients). Symptom improvement was the most frequently reported outcome (84.72%; 1,015 patients). Only 15 studies (2.1%) were structurally reported. Detailed information on patients' demography, pathologically confirmed diagnosis and safety was given in 275 (22.95%), 692 (57.76%) and 10 (0.83%) reports, respectively. CONCLUSION: The amount of information from case reports of TCM therapies in cancer is rich and can be valuable for the preliminary evaluation of TCM and for the planning of further clinical trials in cancer treatment. However, the quality of the reports was generally poor and we recommend that case reports should be published in a structured manner.","['Liu, Jianping', 'Li, Xun', 'Liu, Jingyuan', 'Ma, Lixin', 'Li, Xinxue', 'Fonnebo, Vinjar']","['Liu J', 'Li X', 'Liu J', 'Ma L', 'Li X', 'Fonnebo V']","['National Research Center in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NAFKAM), University of Tromso, Norway. jianping.liu@uit.no']",['eng'],['R24 AT001293/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20111004,Switzerland,Forsch Komplementmed,Forschende Komplementarmedizin (2006),101269884,IM,"['China', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Periodicals as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/23 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['000333065 [pii]', '10.1159/000333065 [doi]']",ppublish,Forsch Komplementmed. 2011;18(5):257-63. doi: 10.1159/000333065.

METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective review of patients undergoing robotic lobectomy for NSCLC was performed. Robotic lobectomy was performed in a manner consistent with the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) consensus video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy technique using a robotic surgical system. Perioperative outcomes and long-term follow-up were recorded prospectively, and survival was calculated from the date of surgery to last follow-up. RESULTS: From November 2002 through May 2010, a total of 325 consecutive patients underwent robotic lobectomy for early-stage NSCLC at 3 institutions. The median age of patients was 66 years (range, 30-87 years), and 37% (120) were female. The majority were in clinical stage I (IA, 247; IB, 63). Conversion rate to thoracotomy was 8% (27/325). Overall morbidity rate was 25.2% (82/325), and major complication rate was 3.7% (12/325). There was 1 in-hospital death (0.3%), and the median length of stay was 5 days (range, 2-28 days). Pathologic stage distribution was 54% (176) IA, 22% (72) IB, 13% (41) IIA, 5% (15) IIB, and 6% (21) IIIA. With a median follow-up of 27 months, overall 5-year survival was 80% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 73-88), and by pathologic stage, 91% (CI = 83-99) for stage IA, 88% (CI = 77-98) for stage IB, and 49% (CI = 24-74) for all patients with stage II disease. Overall 3-year survival for patients with stage IIIA disease was 43% (CI = 16-69). CONCLUSIONS: Robotic lobectomy for early-stage NSCLC can be performed with low morbidity and mortality. Long-term stage-specific survival is acceptable and consistent with prior results for VATS and thoracotomy.","['Park, Bernard J', 'Melfi, Franca', 'Mussi, Alfredo', 'Maisonneuve, Patrick', 'Spaggiari, Lorenzo', 'Da Silva, Ruy Kuenzer Caetano', 'Veronesi, Giulia']","['Park BJ', 'Melfi F', 'Mussi A', 'Maisonneuve P', 'Spaggiari L', 'Da Silva RK', 'Veronesi G']","['Division of Thoracic Surgery, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ 07601, USA. bpark@humed.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111120,United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pneumonectomy/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Robotics', '*Surgery, Computer-Assisted/adverse effects/mortality', 'Survival Rate', '*Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted/adverse effects/mortality', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/23 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5223(11)01217-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.10.055 [doi]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2012 Feb;143(2):383-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.10.055.

Analysis of a randomized phase III trial of the cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB 80303).,205-17,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2011.09.001 [doi],"CONTEXT: Gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is palliative and the prognosis is poor, making health-related quality of life (HRQOL) particularly important. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated HRQOL with the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in patients with APC participating in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing overall survival (OS) between two treatment arms: gemcitabine with bevacizumab or gemcitabine with placebo. METHODS: A consecutive subsample of patients was invited to complete the EQ-5D surveys. Because neither clinical nor HRQOL outcomes differed based on the study arm, analyses were pooled. Changes in mean scores from baseline to eight weeks and the prognostic value of the EQ-5D were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean index scores remained stable (0.78 at baseline [n=267], 0.79 at eight weeks [n=186], P=0.34, Wilcoxon signed rank test), attributable to a modest deterioration of physical function domain scores coincident with small improvements in pain and anxiety/depression scores. A small decline in visual analogue scale scores was observed (70.7 vs. 68.2, P=0.026). HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease. Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029). Baseline scores from both EQ-5D scales were significant predictors of OS in Cox proportional hazard models.

Small improvements in pain and mood are observed despite progressive functional decline.

IM is generally self-limiting and is characterized mostly by transient fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. However, very rarely primary EBV infection results in severe or fatal conditions such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis together with fulminant hepatitis designated as severe or fatal IM or EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis alone. In addition, chronic EBV-associated diseases include Burkitt's lymphoma, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD)/lymphoma, natural killer-cell LPD including leukemia or lymphoma, gastric carcinoma, pyothorax-associated lymphoma and senile B-cell LPD as well as chronic active EBV infection and LPD/lymphoma in patients with immunodeficiency.

The translocation results in a fusion gene between NUP98 at 11p15 and PSIP1 encoding two transcriptional coactivators, p52 and p75, at 9p22. Here, we describe the first case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with t(9;11)(p22;p15). PATIENT: A 64-yr-old woman presented pancytopenia, trilineage dysplasia, and 9.2% blasts in the bone marrow, indicating the diagnosis of MDS. RESULTS: G-banding and spectral karyotyping showed 46,XX,t(9;11)(p22;p15)[20]. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nucleotide sequencing detected four types of NUP98/PSIP1-p52 and two types of NUP98/PSIP1-p75 fusion transcripts. Essentially, the NUP98 exon 12 or exon 11 by alternative splicing was fused in-frame with the PSIP1 exon 8. Real-time quantitative (RQ) PCR for NUP98/PSIP1/GAPDH demonstrated a 4-log decrease after cord blood transplantation and a 2-log increase at relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The fusion genes combining NUP98 exon 11/12 with PSIP1 exon 8, which have never been detected in other AML/CML cases, may be implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS. Furthermore, RQ-PCR for NUP98/PSIP1 could be useful to monitor minimal residual disease.","['Yamamoto, Katsuya', 'Nakamachi, Yuji', 'Yakushijin, Kimikazu', 'Funakoshi, Yohei', 'Okamura, Atsuo', 'Kawano, Seiji', 'Matsuoka, Hiroshi', 'Minami, Hironobu']","['Yamamoto K', 'Nakamachi Y', 'Yakushijin K', 'Funakoshi Y', 'Okamura A', 'Kawano S', 'Matsuoka H', 'Minami H']","['Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan. kyamamo@med.kobe-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120116,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Order', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2011/11/23 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01736.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Mar;88(3):244-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01736.x.

Therefore, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) were prepared and coated with polysorbate 80 to overcome the blood brain barrier for achieving effective treatment of meningeal leukemia. NLC were prepared by melt emulsification followed by ultrasonication, producing particles of 90.7 +/- 4.28 nm size with appreciable amount of drug entrapment (49.5 +/- 2.24%), considering the hydrophilic nature of the drug. The polysorbate 80 coated cytarabine loaded NLC (Cyt-NLC) thus produced were non-aggregated and had almost spherical, smooth and uniform shape. Results of DSC and XRD studies indicated that Cyt was entrapped inside the lipid as molecular dispersion. In-vitro release pattern showed initial fast release (15.87 +/- 1.524% in 1 h) followed by sustained release upto 72 h (89.90 +/- 1.11%). In-vitro cell line studies demonstrated that blank NLC showed no significant cytotoxic effects on leukemic EL-4 cells whereas Cyt-NLC exhibited concentration dependent cytotoxicity. At 48 and 72 h, cytotoxicity of Cyt-NLC was found to be significantly more than that of Cyt solution and the percentage cell viability decreased with increasing concentration of Cyt-NLC. The lyophilized Cyt-NLC formulation was found to be stable with respect to size and total drug content at refrigerated condition (2-8 degrees C) for 3 months. These results suggest that polysorbate 80 coated Cyt-NLC can be explored for treatment of meningeal leukemia owing to their ability of sustained drug release and improved cytotoxic effect in leukemic EL-4 cell line.","['Sharma, Praveen', 'Dube, Brahmanand', 'Sawant, Krutika']","['Sharma P', 'Dube B', 'Sawant K']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Technology and Engineering, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara 390001, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Nanosci Nanotechnol,Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,101088195,IM,"['Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', '*Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lipids/*administration & dosage', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', '*Nanostructures', 'Particle Size', 'Powder Diffraction']",,2011/11/23 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/11/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jnn.2011.4235 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nanosci Nanotechnol. 2011 Aug;11(8):6676-82. doi: 10.1166/jnn.2011.4235.,,,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lipids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, in the presence of Na+ the compound caused dramatic conformational perturbation of the telomeric G-quadruplex, namely, almost complete disordering of G-quartets. Disorganization of a portion of G-quartets in the presence of K+ was also detected. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to illustrate how the binding of one molecule of the ligand might disrupt the G-quartet adjacent to the diagonal loop of telomeric G-quadruplex.

As no curative therapy is yet known for this disease, identification of potential therapeutic targets is of immense importance. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive dynamical and structural analysis of a network model of this disease. By employing a network reduction technique, we identify the stationary states (fixed points) of the system, representing normal and diseased (T-LGL) behavior, and analyze their precursor states (basins of attraction) using an asynchronous Boolean dynamic framework. This analysis identifies the T-LGL states of 54 components of the network, out of which 36 (67%) are corroborated by previous experimental evidence and the rest are novel predictions. We further test and validate one of these newly identified states experimentally. Specifically, we verify the prediction that the node SMAD is over-active in leukemic T-LGL by demonstrating the predominant phosphorylation of the SMAD family members Smad2 and Smad3. Our systematic perturbation analysis using dynamical and structural methods leads to the identification of 19 potential therapeutic targets, 68% of which are corroborated by experimental evidence. The novel therapeutic targets provide valuable guidance for wet-bench experiments. In addition, we successfully identify two new candidates for engineering long-lived T cells necessary for the delivery of virus and cancer vaccines. Overall, this study provides a bird's-eye-view of the avenues available for identification of therapeutic targets for similar diseases through perturbation of the underlying signal transduction network.","['Saadatpour, Assieh', 'Wang, Rui-Sheng', 'Liao, Aijun', 'Liu, Xin', 'Loughran, Thomas P', 'Albert, Istvan', 'Albert, Reka']","['Saadatpour A', 'Wang RS', 'Liao A', 'Liu X', 'Loughran TP', 'Albert I', 'Albert R']","['Department of Mathematics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA098472/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98472/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA133525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111110,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,IM,"['Cell Survival/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad2 Protein/metabolism', 'Smad3 Protein/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*metabolism']",PMC3213185,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/06/01 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002267 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-11-00704 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2011 Nov;7(11):e1002267. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002267.

In an effort to identify the role of fascin in PKC-mediated cellular signaling, its expression was suppressed by stable transfection of specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in mouse monocytic leukemia RAW264.7 cells. Suppression of fascin expression resulted in impaired cellular migration and invasion through extracellular matrix proteins. Unexpectedly, the specific shRNA transfectants exhibited a marked reduction in LPS-induced expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by blocking the translation of their mRNAs. Transient transfection assay using a luciferase expression construct containing the 3' untranslated region of TNF-alpha or IL-6 mRNA revealed a significant reduction in both LPS- and PMA- (the direct activator of PKC) induced reporter activity in cells transfected with fascin-specific shRNA, indicating that fascin-mediated translational regulation targeted 3' untranslated region. Furthermore, LPS-induced translational activation of reporter expression was blocked by a pharmacological inhibitor of PKC, and the dominant-negative form of PKCalpha attenuated LPS-induced translational activation. The same type of regulation was also observed in the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and in mouse peritoneal macrophages. These data demonstrate the involvement of fascin in the PKC-mediated translational regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression during the LPS response.","['Kim, Jae-Kwan', 'Lee, Sang-Min', 'Suk, Kyoungho', 'Lee, Won-Ha']","['Kim JK', 'Lee SM', 'Suk K', 'Lee WH']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111118,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Migration Inhibition/genetics/immunology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Microfilament Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1100612 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1100612 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Dec 15;187(12):6327-34. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1100612.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were collected during different phases of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 59909 study for minimal residual disease analysis. Minimal residual disease status was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of IgH and/or BCL-1/JH gene rearrangement. Correlation of minimal residual disease status with time to progression and overall survival was determined. In multivariable analysis, minimal residual disease, and other risk factors were correlated with time to progression. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients had evaluable, sequential peripheral blood and bone marrow samples for minimal residual disease analysis. Using peripheral blood monitoring, 18 of 39 (46%) achieved molecular remission following induction therapy. The molecular remission rate increased from 46 to 74% after one course of intensification therapy. Twelve of 21 minimal residual disease positive patients (57%) progressed within three years of follow up compared to 4 of 18 (22%) molecular remission patients (P=0.049). Detection of minimal residual disease following induction therapy predicted disease progression with a hazard ratio of 3.7 (P=0.016). The 3-year probability of time to progression among those who were in molecular remission after induction chemotherapy was 82% compared to 48% in patients with detectable minimal residual disease. The prediction of time to progression by post-induction minimal residual disease was independent of other prognostic factors in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of minimal residual disease following induction immunochemotherapy was an independent predictor of time to progression following immunochemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for mantle cell lymphoma.","['Liu, Hongtao', 'Johnson, Jeffrey L', 'Koval, Greg', 'Malnassy, Greg', 'Sher, Dorie', 'Damon, Lloyd E', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Bucci, Donna Marie', 'Linker, Charles A', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Stock, Wendy']","['Liu H', 'Johnson JL', 'Koval G', 'Malnassy G', 'Sher D', 'Damon LE', 'Hsi ED', 'Bucci DM', 'Linker CA', 'Cheson BD', 'Stock W']","['University of Chicago Medical Center 5841, S.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a reduction in %V617F in polycythemia vera is a prerequisite to achieving hematologic remission in response to cytoreductive therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the clinical and hematologic responses to change in %V617F (molecular response) in 73 patients with polycythemia vera treated with either interferon (rIFNalpha-2b: 28, Peg-rIFNalpha-2a: 18) or non-interferon drugs (n=27), which included hydroxyurea (n=8), imatinib (n=12), dasatinib (n=5), busulfan (n=1), and radioactive phosphorus (n=1). Hematologic response evaluation employed Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria, and molecular response evaluation, European Leukemia Net criteria. RESULTS: Of the 46 treated with interferon, 41 (89.1%) had a hematologic response, whereas only 7 (15.2%) had a partial molecular response. Of the 27 who received non-interferon treatments, 16 (59.3%) had a hematologic response, but only 2 (7.4%) had a molecular response. Median duration of follow up was 2.8 years. Statistical agreement between hematologic response and molecular response was poor in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, hematologic response was not accompanied by molecular response.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The impact of primary antifungal prophylaxis administered during front-line chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia was evaluated by comparing 58 patients who received oral amphotericin B (control group) to 99 patients who received oral posaconazole (posaconazole group). The primary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable invasive fungal diseases. Secondary endpoints included incidence of invasive aspergillosis, survival at 4 and 12 months after the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia and costs. RESULTS: Proven/probable invasive fungal diseases were documented in 51.7% of patients in the control group and in 23.2% in the posaconazole group (P=0.0002). Invasive aspergillosis was documented in 43% of patients in the control group and in 15% in the posaconazole group (P=0.002). No survival difference was observed in patients aged over 60 years. In patients aged 60 years or less, a statistically significant survival advantage was observed at 4 months, but no longer at 12 months, in the posaconazole group (P=0.03). It was calculated that in the posaconazole group there was a mean 50% cost reduction for the antifungal drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Primary antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole during front-line chemotherapy was effective in preventing invasive fungal diseases in a ""real-life"" scenario of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, resulted in an early but transitory survival advantage in younger patients and was economically advantageous.","['Girmenia, Corrado', 'Frustaci, Anna Maria', 'Gentile, Giuseppe', 'Minotti, Clara', 'Cartoni, Claudio', 'Capria, Saveria', 'Trisolini, Silvia Maria', 'Matturro, Angela', 'Loglisci, Giuseppina', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Foa, Robin', 'Micozzi, Alessandra']","['Girmenia C', 'Frustaci AM', 'Gentile G', 'Minotti C', 'Cartoni C', 'Capria S', 'Trisolini SM', 'Matturro A', 'Loglisci G', 'Latagliata R', 'Breccia M', 'Meloni G', 'Alimena G', 'Foa R', 'Micozzi A']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia, Oncologia, Anatomia Patologica e Medicina Rigenerative, Azienda Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy. girmenia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111118,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/economics/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC3347676,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.053058 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.053058 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Apr;97(4):560-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.053058.

Here we investigated whether ALC retained independent prognostic significance with respect to minimal residual disease (MRD) status in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: We reviewed 171 cases of pediatric ALL treated on the Children's Oncology Group P9900 series of treatment trials. Variables analyzed included ALC at several time points during Induction, age at diagnosis, cytogenetics, initial white blood cell count, and MRD status at Day 29 of Induction (MRD-29). RESULTS: We found high ALC at Induction Day 29 (ALC-29) to be an independent, clinically significant predictor of improved relapse-free and overall survival (OS). Patients with ALC-29 >1,500 cells/microl had a superior 6-year relapse-free survival (80 +/- 4% vs. 62 +/- 8%, P = 0.018) and overall survival (96 +/- 2% vs. 74 +/- 8%, P = 0.001). Moreover, ALC-29 identified distinct prognostic subgroups within cases stratified by MRD-29. In subjects with >0.01% MRD, ALC-29 > or <1,500 cells/microl had a significant 51% difference in 6-year OS (92 +/- 7% vs. 41 +/- 16%, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: ALC, a readily obtainable test, constitutes a significant and independent prognostic factor in childhood ALL that may refine current MRD-based risk stratification algorithms and provide key prognostic information in settings where MRD determination is not feasible.","['Rabin, Karen R', 'Gramatges, M Monica', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Palla, Shana L', 'Shi, Xiaodong', 'Margolin, Judith F', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A']","['Rabin KR', 'Gramatges MM', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Palla SL', 'Shi X', 'Margolin JF', 'Zweidler-McKay PA']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.""]",['eng'],"['K12 CA090433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA090433-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA090433-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111118,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3290726,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23395 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Sep;59(3):468-74. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23395.

Expression of the polycomb protein Bmi1 is up-regulated in patients with advanced stages of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We report that Bmi1 transforms and reprograms CML B-lymphoid progenitors into stem cell leukemia (Scl) promoter-driven, self-renewing, leukemia-initiating cells to result in B-lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL) in vivo. In vitro, highly proliferating and serially replatable myeloid and lymphoid colony-forming cultures could be established from BCR-ABL and Bmi1 coexpressing progenitors. However, unlike in vivo expanded CML B-lymphoid progenitors, hematopoietic stem cells, or multipotent progenitors, coexpressing BCR-ABL and Bmi1 did not initiate or propagate leukemia in a limiting dilution assay. Inducible genetic attenuation of BCR-ABL reversed Bmi1-driven B-ALL development, which was accompanied by induction of apoptosis of leukemic B-lymphoid progenitors and by long-term animal survival, suggesting that BCR-ABL is required to maintain B-ALL and that BCR-ABL and Bmi1 cooperate toward blast transformation in vivo. Our data indicate that BCR-ABL targeting itself is required to eradicate Ph(+)/Bmi1(+) B-ALL-initiating cells and confirm their addiction to BCR-ABL signaling.","['Sengupta, Amitava', 'Ficker, Ashley M', 'Dunn, Susan K', 'Madhu, Malav', 'Cancelas, Jose A']","['Sengupta A', 'Ficker AM', 'Dunn SK', 'Madhu M', 'Cancelas JA']","[""Stem Cell Program, Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01 HL087159/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK090971/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL087159/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1P30DK090971-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL087159S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111118,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3257014,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38636-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-359232 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 12;119(2):494-502. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-359232.

However, BCR-ABL expression levels of persisting precursors and the impact of long-term IM therapy on the clearance of CML from primitive and mature bone marrow compartments are unclear. Here, we have shown that the number of BCR-ABL-positive precursors decreases significantly in all bone marrow compartments during major molecular remission (MMR). More importantly, we were able to demonstrate substantially lower BCR-ABL expression levels in persisting MMR colony-forming units (CFUs) compared with CML CFUs from diagnosis. Critically, lower BCR-ABL levels may indeed cause IM insensitivity, because primary murine bone marrow cells engineered to express low amounts of BCR-ABL were substantially less sensitive to IM than BCR-ABL-overexpressing cells. BCR-ABL overexpression in turn catalyzed the de novo development of point mutations to a greater extent than chemical mutagenesis. Thus, MMR is characterized by the persistence of CML clones with low BCR-ABL expression that may explain their insensitivity to IM and their low propensity to develop IM resistance through kinase point mutations. These findings may have implications for future treatment strategies of residual disease in CML.","['Kumari, Ashu', 'Brendel, Cornelia', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Burchert, Andreas']","['Kumari A', 'Brendel C', 'Hochhaus A', 'Neubauer A', 'Burchert A']","['Philipps Universitat Marburg, Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg, Standort Marburg, Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111118,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Mismatch Repair/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38640-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-303495 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 12;119(2):530-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-303495.

We investigated the effect of VPA (200 mg/kg, every 12 h) in sleep deprivation (SD) rats (72 h), the manic-like animal model, focusing on the N-methyl-D: -aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor and signaling mediators of synaptic plasticity such as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). SD reduced the expression of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor in the frontal cortex and hippocampus but did not affect the expression of NR1 and NR2A subunits. In comparison, VPA inhibited the SD-induced reduction of NR2B expression in both brain regions. In addition, SD attenuated ERK phosphorylation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, whereas VPA prevented the attenuation. VPA also protected the SD-induced decrease of CREB phosphorylation, BCL2 expression, and BDNF expression in the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus. These results indicate that VPA could regulate NMDA receptor-ERK signaling in SD rats, preventing the SD-induced decrease of the expression of NR2B subunit and the activation of ERK signaling mediators such as ERK, CREB, BCL2, and BDNF.","['Park, Hae Jeong', 'Kang, Won Sub', 'Paik, Jong Woo', 'Kim, Jong Woo']","['Park HJ', 'Kang WS', 'Paik JW', 'Kim JW']","['Kohwang Medical Research Institute, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111119,United States,J Mol Neurosci,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimanic Agents/pharmacology', 'Frontal Lobe/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Hippocampus/*drug effects/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*metabolism', 'Sleep Deprivation/*physiopathology', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12031-011-9673-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Neurosci. 2012 Jul;47(3):554-8. doi: 10.1007/s12031-011-9673-5.

We present a rare case of multiple compartment syndrome in the buttock and thigh of an 11-year-old male patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome was delayed, causing irreversible tissue damage. Physicians are generally unfamiliar with leukemia-induced complications and may not initially suspect leukemic compartment syndrome because of its rarity.

Single-particle tracking demonstrated that individual IR on these cells exhibited reduced lateral diffusion and increased confinement within 100 nm-scale membrane compartments after treatment with either 200 nM insulin or 10 muM Cr(pic)(3). These treatments also increased the association of native IR, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 and phosphorylated AKT with detergent-resistant membrane microdomains of characteristically high buoyancy. Confocal fluorescence microscopic imaging of Di-4-ANEPPDHQ labeled RBL-2H3 cells also showed that plasma membrane lipid order decreased following treatment with Cr(pic)(3) but was not altered by insulin treatment. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy demonstrated that Cr(pic)(3) did not affect IR cell-surface density or compete with insulin for available binding sites. Finally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that Cr(pic)(3) likely associates with the lipid interface in reverse-micelle model membranes. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of IR signaling in a cellular model system by both insulin and Cr(pic)(3) involves retention of IR in specialized nanometer-scale membrane microdomains but that the insulin-like effects of Cr(pic)(3) are due to changes in membrane lipid order rather than to direct interactions with IR.","['Al-Qatati, Abeer', 'Winter, Peter W', 'Wolf-Ringwall, Amber L', 'Chatterjee, Pabitra B', 'Van Orden, Alan K', 'Crans, Debbie C', 'Roess, Deborah A', 'Barisas, B George']","['Al-Qatati A', 'Winter PW', 'Wolf-Ringwall AL', 'Chatterjee PB', 'Van Orden AK', 'Crans DC', 'Roess DA', 'Barisas BG']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Detergents/chemistry', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology', 'Insulin/*pharmacology', 'Iron Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Picolinic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyridinium Compounds/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Insulin/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/07/11 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12013-011-9326-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2012 Apr;62(3):441-50. doi: 10.1007/s12013-011-9326-x.,,,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Picolinic Acids)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '0 (di-4-ANEPPDHQ)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'QZV2W997JQ (picolinic acid)']",,"['(c) Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Raman spectra of the PE cells of the periphery of EBs, formed upon the withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), were compared with those of the undifferentiated ES cells of the core of cell aggregates, formed in the presence of LIF.

Furthermore FOXP3(+) cells can be identified among CD4(+)CD25(-) as well as CD8(+)CD4(-) populations in increased proportions in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared with healthy donors. Significantly different frequencies of naive and effector T(regs) populations are found in healthy donor controls compared with donors with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A population of CCR7(+)CD39(+) T(regs) was significantly associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This population demonstrated slightly reduced suppressive activity compared with total T(regs) or T(regs) of healthy donors. These data suggest that FOXP3-expressing cells, particularly in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are much more complex for T(reg) sub-populations and transitions than previously reported.

Here we studied the effects of Bacillus intermedius RNase (binase) on murine myeloid progenitor cells FDC-P1; transduced FDC-P1 cells ectopically expressing mutated human KIT N822K oncogene and/or human AML1-ETO oncogene; and human leukemia Kasumi-1 cells expressing both of these oncogenes. Expression of both KIT and AML1-ETO oncogenes makes FDC-P1 cells sensitive to the toxic effects of binase. Kasumi-1 cells were the most responsive to the toxic actions of binase among the cell lines used in this work with an IC50 value of 0.56 microM. Either blocking the functional activity of the KIT protein with imatinib or knocking-down oncogene expression using lentiviral vectors producing shRNA against AML1-ETO or KIT eliminated the sensitivity of Kasumi-1 cells to binase toxic action and promoted their survival, even in the absence of KIT-dependent proliferation and antiapoptotic pathways. Here we provide evidence that the cooperative effect of the expression of mutated KIT and AML1-ETO oncogenes is crucial for selective toxic action of binase on malignant cells. These findings can facilitate clinical applications of binase providing a useful screen based on the presence of the corresponding target oncogenes in malignant cells.","['Mitkevich, Vladimir A', 'Petrushanko, Irina Y', 'Spirin, Pavel V', 'Fedorova, Tatiana V', 'Kretova, Olga V', 'Tchurikov, Nickolai A', 'Prassolov, Vladimir S', 'Ilinskaya, Olga N', 'Makarov, Alexander A']","['Mitkevich VA', 'Petrushanko IY', 'Spirin PV', 'Fedorova TV', 'Kretova OV', 'Tchurikov NA', 'Prassolov VS', 'Ilinskaya ON', 'Makarov AA']","['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111201,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bacillus/enzymology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Endoribonucleases/*toxicity', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lentivirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Time Factors']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['18210 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.23.18210 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Dec 1;10(23):4090-7. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.23.18210.

Foretinib is a multikinase inhibitor whose mechanism of action is incompletely understood. We investigated here the effect of Foretinib on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines either sensitive (IM-S) or resistant (IM-R) to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib. Foretinib decreased viability and clonogenic potential of IM-S and IM-R CML cells as well. Foretinib-treated cells exhibited increased size, spindle assembly checkpoint anomalies and enhanced ploidy that collectively evoked mitotic catastrophe (MC). Accordingly, Foretinib-stimulated CML cells displayed decreased expression of Cdk1, Cyclin B1 and Plk1. In addition, Foretinib triggered caspase-2 activation that precedes mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Accordingly, z-VAD-fmk and a caspase-2 siRNA abolished Foretinib-mediated cell death but failed to affect MC, indicating that Foretinib-mediated apoptosis and MC are two independent events. Anisomycin, a JNK activator, impaired Foretinib-induced MC and inhibition or knockdown of JNK phenotyped its effect on MC. Moreover, we found that Foretinib acted as a potent inhibitor of JNK. Importantly, Foretinib exhibited no or very little effect on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes or melanocytes cells but efficiently inhibited the clonogenic potential of CD34+ cell from CML patients. Collectively, our data show that the multikinase inhibitor Foretinib induces MC in CML cells and other cell lines via JNK-dependent inhibition of Plk1 expression and triggered apoptosis by a caspase 2-mediated mechanism. This unusual mechanism of action may have important implications for the treatment of cancer.","['Dufies, Maeva', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Robert, Guillaume', 'Cluzeau, Thomas', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Fenouille, Nina', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Raynaud, Sophie', 'Cassuto, Jill-Patrice', 'Luciano, Frederic', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Dufies M', 'Jacquel A', 'Robert G', 'Cluzeau T', 'Puissant A', 'Fenouille N', 'Legros L', 'Raynaud S', 'Cassuto JP', 'Luciano F', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM U895, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, Nice, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111201,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Anilides/*pharmacology', 'Anisomycin/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Death', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin B1/genetics/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Assays', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Melanocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Ploidies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['18323 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.23.18323 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Dec 1;10(23):4138-48. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.23.18323.

However, layer flocks in China have experienced outbreaks of this virus since 2008. To understand the genetic diversity of ALV-J in Chinese layers, we compared and analyzed the GP85 gene sequences of 106 ALV-J isolates that were isolated between 1999 and 2010 in Mainland China. The GP85 gene sequences of 41 layer isolates collected from 9 provinces of China between 2008 and 2010 belonged to two separate, highly diverse subgroups and were differentiated from meat-type chicken isolates. When compared to all meat-type isolates from China, Subgroup 1 exclusively contained current layer isolates and seemed to be dominant; all the isolates in this subgroup exhibited gene diversity, and many unique amino acid mutations were present. In contrast, the viruses in Subgroup 2 were perfectly conserved and shared high identity with the prototype meat-type chicken ALV-J strain HPRS-103. The two subgroups contained only two concurrent mutations at the same position. Moreover, most of the isolates in Subgroup 1 had two additional glycosylation sites (at positions 101 and 191) when compared with those in Subgroup 2. Our study provides evidence for the coexistence of two extremely different ALV-J subgroups in Chinese layers from 2008 to 2010, supporting the need for vaccine development and purification measures to prevent ALV-J infection in layers in China.","['Pan, Wei', 'Gao, Yulong', 'Qin, Litin', 'Ni, Wei', 'Liu, Zaisi', 'Yun, Binglin', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Gao, Honglei', 'Wang, Xiaomei']","['Pan W', 'Gao Y', 'Qin L', 'Ni W', 'Liu Z', 'Yun B', 'Wang Y', 'Qi X', 'Gao H', 'Wang X']","['Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, National Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, PR China. panwei525@126.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111020,Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/epidemiology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Chickens', 'China', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Meat/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/epidemiology/*virology', 'Sequence Alignment']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/08/03 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1135(11)00562-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.10.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2012 Apr 23;156(1-2):205-12. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.10.019.

Para-NO-aspirin (para-NO-ASA) is a novel drug with demonstrated efficacy against a number of solid tumors and most recently chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In this study, we used ALL cell lines to assess the effects on cell viability by flow cytometry and investigated the mechanism of cell death using chemical inhibitors of key molecules and assessed the effects by flow cytometry, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Para-NO-ASA induced cell death in the pre-B ALL cell lines in association with increased reactive oxygen species, and suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity. Chemical inhibitors of NF-kappaB similarly induced apoptosis in ALL cells, suggesting a role for suppression of NF-kappaB in para-NO-ASA-induced cell death. Modulation of NF-kappaB was not via regulation of IkappaB but potentially through suppression of ROCK1 and loss of reduced glutathione.

Previous studies have implicated the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) as a regulatory protein receiving stimulatory inputs from activated Galpha(12/13) and Galpha(q). However, the molecular mechanisms of the Galpha(q)-mediated LARG activation are not fully understood and the structural elements of LARG involved in this process have remained unclear. In the present work, the specific coupling of the histamine H1 receptor (HRH1) exogenously expressed in COS-7 cells to G(q), but not to G(12/13), was used to conduct a detailed analysis of receptor- and Galpha(q)-mediated LARG activation and to define its structural requirements. The results show that HRH1-mediated activation of the strictly Rho-dependent transcriptional activity of serum response factor requires the PDZ domain of LARG and can be mimicked by activated Galpha(q)(Q209L). The functional interaction between activated Galpha(q) and LARG requires no more than the catalytic DH-PH tandem of LARG, and is independent of PLCbeta activation and distinct from the mechanisms of Galpha(q)-mediated p63RhoGEF and PLCbeta(3) activation. Activated Galpha(q) physically interacts with the relevant portions of LARG in COS-7 cells and histamine causes activation of LARG in native HeLa cells endogenously expressing HRH1, G(q), and LARG. This work is the first positive demonstration of a stimulatory effect of LARG on the ability of a strictly G(q)-coupled receptor to cause activation of a Rho-GTPase-dependent signaling pathway.","['Pfreimer, Mariana', 'Vatter, Petra', 'Langer, Torben', 'Wieland, Thomas', 'Gierschik, Peter', 'Moepps, Barbara']","['Pfreimer M', 'Vatter P', 'Langer T', 'Wieland T', 'Gierschik P', 'Moepps B']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Ulm Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111110,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'PDZ Domains', 'Phospholipase C beta/metabolism', 'Receptors, Histamine H1/*metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Serum Response Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/05/11 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(11)00345-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2012 Mar;24(3):652-63. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.10.014.

Therefore, it is imperative to find effective treatment for AML patients. Safingol is a bioactive sphingolipid which has demonstrated promising in vitro anti-leukemic properties; however, translation into clinical use is hampered by its low water solubility and dose-limiting hemolysis. The present study is the first to describe a rationally designed liposome formulation of safingol and demonstrate the anti-leukemic potential using a panel of human AML cell lines and patient samples as well as a human xenograft model in SCID mice. Encapsulation efficiency of safingol into liposomes was approximately 100%, and the release of drug followed square-root-of-time release model. The presence of a transmembrane pH gradient completely abolished the biological activity of liposomal safingol. A positive zeta potential, which influenced cellular accumulation of liposomal safingol, was crucial to the anti-leukemic activity. Liposomal safingol was effective against a wide range of AML subtypes with minimal hemolytic toxicity, and was able to extend the median survival time of the U937-inoculated mice to 31 days as compared to 23 days by free drug. The increase in therapeutic efficacy could be related to the increase in systemic drug exposure as a result of liposome encapsulation.","['Tan, Kuan-Boone', 'Ling, Leong-Uung', 'Bunte, Ralph M', 'Chng, Wee-Joo', 'Chiu, Gigi N C']","['Tan KB', 'Ling LU', 'Bunte RM', 'Chng WJ', 'Chiu GN']","['Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111110,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Compounding', 'Female', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Solubility', 'Sphingosine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/blood/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(11)01032-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2012 Jun 10;160(2):290-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.11.002.

The blastocyst will implant only when this molecular cross-talk is established. Here we show that the muscle segment homeobox gene (Msh) family members Msx1 and Msx2, which are two highly conserved genes critical for epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development, also play crucial roles in embryo implantation. Loss of Msx1/Msx2 expression correlates with altered uterine luminal epithelial cell polarity and affects E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex formation through the control of Wnt5a expression. Application of Wnt5a in vitro compromised blastocyst invasion and trophoblast outgrowth on cultured uterine epithelial cells. The finding that Msx1/Msx2 genes are critical for conferring uterine receptivity and readiness to implantation could have clinical significance, because compromised uterine receptivity is a major cause of pregnancy failure in IVF programs.","['Daikoku, Takiko', 'Cha, Jeeyeon', 'Sun, Xiaofei', 'Tranguch, Susanne', 'Xie, Huirong', 'Fujita, Tomoko', 'Hirota, Yasushi', 'Lydon, John', 'DeMayo, Francesco', 'Maxson, Robert', 'Dey, Sudhansu K']","['Daikoku T', 'Cha J', 'Sun X', 'Tranguch S', 'Xie H', 'Fujita T', 'Hirota Y', 'Lydon J', 'DeMayo F', 'Maxson R', 'Dey SK']","[""Division of Reproductive Sciences, Perinatal Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01 DE019650/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HD012304/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD07463/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD12304/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'F30AG040858/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA006668/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DA006668/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HD012304-30/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DA006668-18/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'HD068524/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 AG040858/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE016320/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111117,United States,Dev Cell,Developmental cell,101120028,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Polarity/genetics/physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertility/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/deficiency/genetics', 'MSX1 Transcription Factor/deficiency/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Uterus/cytology/*metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Wnt-5a Protein', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",PMC3241866,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1534-5807(11)00408-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.devcel.2011.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Cell. 2011 Dec 13;21(6):1014-25. doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.09.010.

This work was designed to study the prevalence and nature of NPM1 gene mutations in a group of Egyptian patients with AML to get an idea about the profile of NPM1 gene mutations in our society. In 45 previously untreated patients with de novo AML, peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples from all patients were subjected to microscopic morphologic examination, cytochemical analysis, immunophenotyping and karyotyping. Patients with normal cytogenetic results were selected for molecular analysis of NPM1 exon 12 by PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing of the amplified product. Twenty-one patients (46.7%) had abnormal karyotype: six cases with t(15;17), five cases with t(8;21), five cases had trisomy 8, two cases carrying inv(3) and three cases had monosomy 7. The remaining 24 patients (53.3%) had normal karyotype. These patients were then subjected to molecular analysis. Out of these 24 patients with normal karyotype, mutant NPM-1 was detected in 11 patients (45.8%) by DNA sequencing; 2 cases showed type A mutation, 2 cases were harboring [ins 1015-1019 (CACG)], with point mutation [1006C>G], while the remaining 7 cases showed heterozygous deletion of nt A [del 1178 (A)]. CONCLUSION: Two novel NPM1 gene mutations were detected among our study population of AML patients identified as: the insertion CACG associated with point mutation, deletion of one base, or associated with point mutation. NPM1 gene mutations may become a new tool for monitoring minimal residual disease in AML with normal karyotype. Whether these previously unreported NPM-1 mutations will confer the same better outcome as previously reported mutations is currently unknown and warrants a larger study.

Fibromodulin has been characterized as one of the tumor associated antigens (TAA) in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with the potential to elicit specific antitumor response and it is considered as good candidate for immunotherapy. AIM OF WORK: to study the expression of fibromodulin at the gene level of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, in comparison to normal controls and to asses its role in the pathophysiology of CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fibromodulin gene expression was tested by one step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 30 patients with B-CLL as well as in 20 age and sex matched healthy volunteers. RESULTS: In this study, fibromodulin gene was expressed in 46.7% of patients with B-CLL which was significantly different from the control age and sex matched healthy volunteers in which none of them showed peripheral blood mononuclear cells positivity for fibromodulin gene expression (0%) (p-value =0.006). We also found significant associations between higher fibomodulin gene expression and some risk factors in the studied CLL cases such as hepatomegaly, lower haemoglobin level, lower RBCs count, lower platelet count and borderline significant associations with other risk factors as lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that fibromodulin can be used as a target for therapeutic intervention and it may play a role in the pathophysiology of CLL.","['Hassan, Doha Abd El-hamid', 'Samy, Rania Mohamed', 'Abd-Elrahim, Osama Taha', 'Salib, Caroline Sabry']","['Hassan DA', 'Samy RM', 'Abd-Elrahim OT', 'Salib CS']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110908,England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibromodulin', '*Gene Expression', 'Hepatomegaly/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphatic Diseases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteoglycans/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenomegaly/metabolism']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2013/09/06 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1110-0362(11)00003-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jnci.2011.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2011 Mar;23(1):11-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jnci.2011.07.002.

METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 116 children with newly-diagnosed AML were obtained. Gene mutations of FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD were detected by RT-PCR. The relationship of FLT3 gene mutations with the clinical characteristics and the therapeutic efficacy was observed. RESULTS: FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD mutations were detected in 9 cases (7.8%) and 13 cases (11.2%) respectively out of the 116 children. FLT3/ITD mutations were observed in 3 cases of AML-M3 (3/9; 33.3%) and in 3 cases of AML-M5 (3/9; 33.3%). FLT3/TKD mutations were the most common in AML-M3 patients (10/13; 76.9%). The patients with FLT3/ITD mutations had a significantly higher peripheral WBC count and marrow blast percentage compared with the patients without FLT3/ITD mutations at diagnosis (P<0.01). The 3-year overall survival rate in patients with FLT3/ITD mutations was significantly lower than that in patients without FLT3/ITD mutations (38.9% vs 64.3%; P<0.05).

However, development of multidrug resistance(MDR) limits the use of imatinib. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms of cellular resistance to imatinib in CML. Therefore, we established an imatinib-resistant human CML cell line(K562-imatinib) through a stepwise selection process. While characterizing the phenotype of these cells, we found that K562-imatinib cells were 124.6-fold more resistant to imatinib than parental K562 cells. In addition, these cells were cross-resistant to second- and third-generation BCR-ABL TKIs. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) demonstrated that P-glycoprotein(P-gp) and MDR1 mRNA levels were increased in K562-imatinib cells. In addition, accumulation of [14C]6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) was decreased, whereas the ATP-dependent efflux of [14C]6-MP and [3H]methotrexate transport were increased in K562-imatinib cells.

The authors examined the in vitro and clinical activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VA) combined with cytosine arabinoside (AraC) in elderly patients with AML unsuited to intensive therapy. For the in vitro studies, primary AML cells from 11 patients were treated with AraC and VA and analyzed for apoptosis, cytostatic effects, differentiation and acetyl histone H3 induction. VA (alone and with AraC) enhanced apoptosis and induced acetyl histone H3. VA inhibited cell proliferation.

Thus, the prevalence of the virus among blood donors and, if present, its transmissibility by transfusion need to be defined. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two populations of routine blood donor samples (1435 and 13,399) were obtained for prevalence evaluations; samples from a linked donor-recipient repository were also evaluated. Samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to XMRV-related recombinant antigens and/or for XMRV RNA, using validated, high-throughput systems. RESULTS: The presence of antibodies to XMRV could not be confirmed among a total of 17,249 blood donors or recipients (0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-0.017%); 1763 tested samples were nonreactive for XMRV RNA (0%; 95% CI, 0%-0.17%). Evidence of infection was absent from 109 recipients and 830 evaluable blood samples tested after transfusion of a total of 3741 blood components. CONCLUSIONS: XMRV and related murine leukemia virus (MLV) markers are not present among a large population of blood donors and evidence of transfusion transmission could not be detected. Thus, these viruses do not currently pose a threat to blood recipient safety and further actions relating to XMRV and MLV are not justified.","['Dodd, Roger Y', 'Hackett, John Jr', 'Linnen, Jeffrey M', 'Dorsey, Kerri', 'Wu, Yanyun', 'Zou, Shimian', 'Qiu, Xiaoxing', 'Swanson, Priscilla', 'Schochetman, Gerald', 'Gao, Kui', 'Carrick, James M', 'Krysztof, David E', 'Stramer, Susan L']","['Dodd RY', 'Hackett J Jr', 'Linnen JM', 'Dorsey K', 'Wu Y', 'Zou S', 'Qiu X', 'Swanson P', 'Schochetman G', 'Gao K', 'Carrick JM', 'Krysztof DE', 'Stramer SL']","['American Red Cross Holland Laboratory, Rockville, Maryland 20855, USA. dodd@usa.redcross.org']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111121,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Donors/statistics & numerical data', '*Blood Safety/methods', 'Blood Specimen Collection/methods/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/blood/epidemiology/etiology/virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Viral/blood/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/*blood/epidemiology/*transmission/virology', 'Risk Factors', 'Serologic Tests', 'Transplantation/physiology/statistics & numerical data', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03450.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2012 Feb;52(2):298-306. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03450.x.

In CLL patients, immunosuppression is a consequence of the disease, which plays a key role in effecting the quality of life and overall survival. Treatment modalities should ideally not only reduce tumor burden, but also augment immune function in CLL patients. AREAS COVERED: The current review summarizes biological and clinical data on thalidomide and lenalidomide in CLL. EXPERT OPINION: Immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide and lenalidomide show both antitumor activity and immunostimulation. Three main mechanisms of action seem to play a role in cancer, including i) anti-angiogenic, ii) immunomodulatory and iii) tumoricidal effects. The exact contributions of these effects seem to be unique for different diseases. The two representatives of this family of drugs studied in CLL include thalidomide and its analog lenalidomide. These drugs proved to be effective as single agents and in the combination setting in CLL. Toxicities have been identified but largely controlled by a low starting dose, with gradual dose escalation.","['Giannopoulos, Krzysztof', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Giannopoulos K', 'Mertens D', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Medical University of Lublin, Experimental Hematooncology Department, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/22 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/11/22 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2011.635644 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2011 Dec;12(18):2857-64. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2011.635644.,,,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the apoptotic effects of S. litwinowii on 2 myeloid cell lines, apoptosis-proficient HL60 cells and apoptosis-resistant K562 cells, were analyzed. An increase in the activity of caspases-3, -8, and -9, poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, detection of phosphatidylserine on the outer layer of cell membrane and sub-G1 peak in the flow cytometry histogram of treated cells, suggested the induction of apoptosis. S. litwinowii also increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

We investigated the potential effect of PJE on induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cellular proliferation in 8 leukemia cell lines (4 lymphoid and 4 myeloid) and nontumor hematopoietic stem cells (control cells). Apoptosis was assessed by 2 methods: Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining with flow cytometric analysis and 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) morphological assessment. Cell cycle stage was investigated using propidum iodide staining of DNA content and flow cytometric analysis. Live cell counts were also performed using a trypan exclusion assay. PJE significantly induced apoptosis in all cell lines, including nontumor control cells, although lymphoid cells and 2 of the myeloid cell lines were more sensitive. Furthermore, PJE induced cell cycle arrest. These results were confirmed by DAPI analysis and viable cell counts using trypan blue exclusion assay.

It is thought that loss of cell regulation by miRNAs supports cancer development. Based on whole genome sequencing of a melanoma tumor, we predict, using three different computational algorithms, that the melanoma somatic mutations globally reduce binding of miRNAs to the mutated 3'UTRs. This phenomenon reflects the nature of the characteristic UV-induced mutation, C-to-T. Furthermore, we show that seed regions are enriched with Guanine, thus rendering miRNAs prone to reduced binding to UV-mutated 3'UTRs. Accordingly, mutation patterns in non UV-induced malignancies e.g. lung cancer and leukemia do not yield similar predictions. It is suggested that UV-induced disruption of miRNA-mediated gene regulation plays a carcinogenic role. Remarkably, dark-skinned populations have significantly higher GC content in 3'UTR SNPs than light-skinned populations, which implies on evolutionary pressure to preserve regulation by trans-acting oligonucleotides under conditions with excess UV radiation.","['Greenberg, Eyal', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Solomon, Oz', 'Schachter, Jacob', 'Markel, Gal', 'Eyal, Eran']","['Greenberg E', 'Rechavi G', 'Amariglio N', 'Solomon O', 'Schachter J', 'Markel G', 'Eyal E']","['Ella Institute of Melanoma, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111109,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Algorithms', 'Base Composition/genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics/radiation effects', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Ultraviolet Rays/adverse effects']",PMC3212558,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/04/11 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027400 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-17131 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27400. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027400.

However, literature about the influence of NK-DLI on recipient's immune system is scarce. Here we present concomitant results of a noninvasive in vivo monitoring approach of recipient's peripheral blood (PB) cells after transfer of either unstimulated (NK-DLI(unstim)) or IL-2 (1000 U/ml, 9-14 days) activated NK cells (NK-DLI(IL-2 stim)) along with their ex vivo secreted cytokine/chemokines. We performed phenotypical and functional characterizations of the NK-DLIs, detailed flow cytometric analyses of various PB cells and comprehensive cytokine/chemokine arrays before and after NK-DLI. Patients of both groups were comparable with regard to remission status, immune reconstitution, donor chimerism, KIR mismatching, stem cell and NK-DLI dose. Only after NK-DLI(IL-2 stim) was a rapid, almost complete loss of CD56(bright)CD16(dim/-) immune regulatory and CD56(dim)CD16(+) cytotoxic NK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells and eosinophils from PB circulation seen 10 min after infusion, while neutrophils significantly increased. The reduction of NK cells was due to both, a decrease in patients' own CD69(-) NCR(low)CD62L(+) NK cells as well as to a diminishing of the transferred cells from the NK-DLI(IL-2 stim) with the CD56(bright)CD16(+/-)CD69(+)NCR(high)CD62L(-) phenotype. All cell counts recovered within the next 24 h. Transfer of NK-DLI(IL-2 stim) translated into significantly increased levels of various cytokines/chemokines (i.e. IFN-gamma, IL-6, MIP-1beta) in patients' PB. Those remained stable for at least 1 h, presumably leading to endothelial activation, leukocyte adhesion and/or extravasation. In contrast, NK-DLI(unstim) did not cause any of the observed effects. In conclusion, we assume that the adoptive transfer of NK-DLI(IL-2 stim) under the influence of ex vivo and in vivo secreted cytokines/chemokines may promote NK cell trafficking and therefore might enhance efficacy of immunotherapy.","['Brehm, Claudia', 'Huenecke, Sabine', 'Quaiser, Andrea', 'Esser, Ruth', 'Bremm, Melanie', 'Kloess, Stephan', 'Soerensen, Jan', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'Seidl, Christian', 'Becker, Petra S A', 'Muhl, Heiko', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Bader, Peter', 'Passweg, Jakob R', 'Schwabe, Dirk', 'Koehl, Ulrike']","['Brehm C', 'Huenecke S', 'Quaiser A', 'Esser R', 'Bremm M', 'Kloess S', 'Soerensen J', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Seidl C', 'Becker PS', 'Muhl H', 'Klingebiel T', 'Bader P', 'Passweg JR', 'Schwabe D', 'Koehl U']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Laboratory for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.

Recently, we showed that two human pathogens expressed a derivative of PSA containing de-N-acetyl sialic acid residues (NeuPSA). Here we show that an epitope identified by the anti-NeuPSA monoclonal antibody, SEAM 3 (SEAM 3-reactive antigen or S3RA), is expressed in human melanomas, and also intracellularly in a human melanoma cell line (SK-MEL-28), a human T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat), and two neuroblastoma cell lines (CHP-134 and SH-SY5Y). SEAM 3 binding induced apoptosis in the four cell lines tested. The unusual intracellular distribution of S3RA was similar to that described for the PSA polysialyltransferases, STX and PST, which are also expressed in the four cell lines used here. Interestingly, suppression of PST mRNA expression by transfection of SK-MEL-28 cells with PST-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in decreased SEAM 3 binding. The results suggest further studies of the utility of antibodies such as SEAM 3 as therapeutic agents for certain malignancies.","['Steirer, Lindsay M', 'Moe, Gregory R']","['Steirer LM', 'Moe GR']","[""Centers for Cancer, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, California, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['CO6 RR-16226/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10RR025472/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AI064314/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI064314/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK078514/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI064314/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5T32DK078514-09/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'C06 RR016226/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR025472/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111109,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Neuroblastoma/immunology', 'Sialic Acids/*immunology']",PMC3212545,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/04/11 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027249 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-16319 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27249. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027249.

Deletions in chromosome 13 [del(13q14)] partially account for the loss of expression of miR-15a and miR-16, but the mechanisms by which miR-29b becomes silenced is unknown. In the present study, we show that the histone deacetylases (HDACs) are overexpressed in CLL and mediate the epigenetic silencing of miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b. HDAC inhibition triggered the accumulation of the transcriptionally activating chromatin modification H3K4me2 and restored the expression of miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b in approximately 35% of samples. Ectopic expression of miR-15a and miR-16 and HDAC inhibition-induced expression of miR-15a, miR-16, or miR-29b in primary CLL cells was associated with declines in the levels of Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2, mitochondrial dysfunction, and induction of cell death. Therefore, our results show that HDACs aberrantly silence the expression of the critical tumor suppressors miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b in CLL. Deacetylase inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy that restores the expression of these miRs to antagonize Mcl-1, an important survival protein in these cells. Consequently, CLL patients who exhibit such epigenetic silencing may benefit from HDAC inhibitor-based therapy.","['Sampath, Deepa', 'Liu, Chaomei', 'Vasan, Karthik', 'Sulda, Melanie', 'Puduvalli, Vinay K', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Sampath D', 'Liu C', 'Vasan K', 'Sulda M', 'Puduvalli VK', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ']","['Departments of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

In this study, we analyzed the development of NK cells after intrabone umbilical cord blood (CB) transplantation in 18 adult patients with hematologic malignancies. Our data indicate that, also in this transplantation setting, NK cells are the first lymphoid population detectable in peripheral blood. However, different patterns of NK-cell development could be identified. Indeed, in a group of patients, a relevant fraction of NK cells expressed a mature phenotype characterized by the KIR(+)NKG2A(-) signature 3-6 months after transplantation. In other patients, most NK cells maintained an immature phenotype even after 12 months. A possible role for cytomegalovirus in the promotion of NK-cell development was suggested by the observation that a more rapid NK-cell maturation together with expansion of NKG2C(+) NK cells was confined to patients experiencing cytomegalovirus reactivation.

Its expression is epigenetically suppressed in several tumors. A mechanistic basis for epigenetic/transcriptional repression of DAPK1 was investigated in certain forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with poor prognosis, which lacked ER stress-induced apoptosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Heterogeneous primary AMLs were screened to identify a subgroup with Flt3ITD in which repression of DAPK1, among NF-kappaB-and c-Jun-responsive genes, was studied. RNA interference knockdown studies were carried out in an Flt3ITD(+) cell line, MV-4-11, to establish genetic epistasis in the pathway Flt3ITD-TAK1-DAPK1 repression, and chromatin immunoprecipitations were carried out to identify proximate effector proteins, including TAK1-activated p52NF-kappaB, at the DAPK1 locus. RESULTS: AMLs characterized by normal karyotype with Flt3ITD were found to have 10- to 100-fold lower DAPK1 transcripts normalized to the expression of c-Jun, a transcriptional activator of DAPK1, as compared with a heterogeneous cytogenetic category. In addition, Meis1, a c-Jun-responsive adverse AML prognostic gene signature was measured as control. These Flt3ITD(+) AMLs overexpress relB, a transcriptional repressor, which forms active heterodimers with p52NF-kappaB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified p52NF-kappaB binding to the DAPK1 promoter together with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and HDAC6 in the Flt3ITD(+) human AML cell line MV-4-11. Knockdown of p52NF-kappaB or its upstream regulator, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), de-repressed DAPK1. DAPK1-repressed primary Flt3ITD(+) AMLs had selective nuclear activation of p52NF-kappaB. CONCLUSIONS: Flt3ITD promotes a noncanonical pathway via TAK1 and p52NF-kappaB to suppress DAPK1 in association with HDACs, which explains DAPK1 repression in Flt3ITD(+) AML.","['Shanmugam, Rajasubramaniam', 'Gade, Padmaja', 'Wilson-Weekes, Annique', 'Sayar, Hamid', 'Suvannasankha, Attaya', 'Goswami, Chirayu', 'Li, Lang', 'Gupta, Sushil', 'Cardoso, Angelo A', 'Baghdadi, Tareq Al', 'Sargent, Katie J', 'Cripe, Larry D', 'Kalvakolanu, Dhananjaya V', 'Boswell, H Scott']","['Shanmugam R', 'Gade P', 'Wilson-Weekes A', 'Sayar H', 'Suvannasankha A', 'Goswami C', 'Li L', 'Gupta S', 'Cardoso AA', 'Baghdadi TA', 'Sargent KJ', 'Cripe LD', 'Kalvakolanu DV', 'Boswell HS']","['Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology Division), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology Division), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology Division), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology Division), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology Division), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology Division), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology Division), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Indiana University Health Systems, Indianapolis, IN.', 'Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology Division), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology Division), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202.', 'Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN 46202.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA078282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111117,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3918433,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/08/02 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3022 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jan 15;18(2):360-369. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3022.

Limited data exist about their long-term morbidity and social outcomes. The aim of the study was to compare the self-reported use of health care services, health experience, social outcomes, and lifestyle behavior of AML survivors with that of their sibling controls. METHODS: This population-based study included 138 children treated for AML according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO)-AML-84, -88, and -93 trials, and alive by June 30, 2007. Patients treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or relapse were not included. Altogether, 102 (74%) survivors and 91% of their siblings completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 11 (range 4-25) years after diagnosis. AML survivors had no increased rate of hospitalization compared with sibling controls, but were more often receiving prescription drugs, especially for asthma (23% vs. 9%, P = 0.03). Self-reported health experience was excellent or very good in 77% and comparable with that of siblings. Educational achievement, employment, and marital status were comparable in the two groups. Among surviving AML patients, 23% were current smokers and 24% of their siblings were current smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The self-reported health of children treated on NOPHO-AML protocols without HSCT was good, and their use of health care services was limited. Reported health and social outcomes were comparable to those of their siblings. Many survivors were smoking which may increase the risk of late effects.","['Molgaard-Hansen, Lene', 'Glosli, Heidi', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Jarfelt, Marianne', 'Jonmundsson, Guethmundur K', 'Malmros-Svennilson, Johan', 'Nysom, Karsten', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Molgaard-Hansen L', 'Glosli H', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Jarfelt M', 'Jonmundsson GK', 'Malmros-Svennilson J', 'Nysom K', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark. lene.molgaard@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101222,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22931 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Dec 15;57(7):1222-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22931.

In order to assess these differences statistically, we have to apply adjustments for multiple comparisons to prevent an increased number of false-positive findings. The most prominent procedure of this type is the Bonferroni correction, which maintains the error level but leads to conservative results. On the basis of a general statistical framework for simultaneous inference, we propose a new statistical procedure for many-to-one comparisons of treatments with adjustment for covariates for clustered survival data modeled by a frailty Cox model. In contrast to the Bonferroni method, dependencies between estimated effects are taken into account. The resulting simultaneous confidence intervals for the hazard ratios of the experimental treatments compared with a control can be interpreted in terms of both statistical significance and clinical importance. The quality of the new procedure is judged by the coverage probability for the simultaneous confidence intervals. Simulation results show an acceptable performance in balanced and various unbalanced designs. The practical merits are demonstrated by a reanalysis of a chronic myelogeneous leukemia clinical trial. The procedure presented here works well for multiple comparisons with a control with adjustment for covariates for survival data from multicenter clinical trials.","['Herberich, Esther', 'Hothorn, Torsten']","['Herberich E', 'Hothorn T']","['Institut fur Statistik, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, DE-80539, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111117,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Computer Simulation', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.4403 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2012 Jan 13;31(1):45-55. doi: 10.1002/sim.4403.

It remains unclear whether hypermethylation of Wnt inhibitors is associated with molecular gene mutations in the development of AML. METHODS: We investigated the association of the promoter hypermethylation of six Wnt inhibitors (Wif-1, SFRP1, SFRR2, SFRP4, SFRP5, and DKK1) with gene aberrations in the leukaemogenesis of 269 AML patients. RESULTS: In total, 166 patients (61.7%) had hypermethylation of at least one Wnt inhibitor. The majority (68.5%) of patients with Wnt inhibitor hypermethylation had concurrent Class II gene mutations that affect transcription factors or cofactors. There was a close association of Wif-1 hypermethylation with t(15;17) (P=0.0005) and CEBPA mutation (P<0.0001), DKK1 hypermethylation with t(8;21) (P<0.0001) and ASXL1 mutation (P=0.0078), SFRP-1 hypermethylation with t(8;21) (P<0.0001), SFRP-2 hypermethylation with AML1/RUNX1 mutation (P=0.0012), and SFRP-5 hypermethylation with MLL/PTD (P=0.0505). On the other side, hypermethylation of Wnt inhibitors was always negatively associated with NPM1 mutation and FLT3/ITD. CONCLUSION: There was distinct association between hypermethylation of individual Wnt inhibitors and specific gene aberrations, especially Class II mutations.

In contrast to the overwhelming evidence that E/R is critical for the initiation of leukemia, its relevance for the maintenance of overt disease is less clear. To investigate this issue, we suppressed the endogenous E/R fusion protein with lentivirally transduced short hairpin RNA in the leukemia cell lines REH and AT-2, and found a distinct reduction of proliferation and cell survival. In line with the observed concurrent inactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, pharmacological inhibition diminished the phosphorylation of AKT and ribosomal protein S6, and significantly increased the apoptosis rate in E/R-positive leukemias. Moreover, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors sensitized glucocorticoid-resistant REH cells to prednisolone, an observation of potential relevance for improving treatment of drug-resistant relapses. Of note, knockdown of the E/R fusion gene also severely impaired the repopulation capacity of REH cells in non-obese deficient/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the E/R fusion protein activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and is indispensible for disease maintenance. Importantly, these results provide a first rationale and justification for targeting the fusion gene and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway therapeutically.","['Fuka, G', 'Kantner, H-P', 'Grausenburger, R', 'Inthal, A', 'Bauer, E', 'Krapf, G', 'Kaindl, U', 'Kauer, M', 'Dworzak, M N', 'Stoiber, D', 'Haas, O A', 'Panzer-Grumayer, R']","['Fuka G', 'Kantner HP', 'Grausenburger R', 'Inthal A', 'Bauer E', 'Krapf G', 'Kaindl U', 'Kauer M', 'Dworzak MN', 'Stoiber D', 'Haas OA', 'Panzer-Grumayer R']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111118,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011322 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.322 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):927-33. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.322.

NKL genes have been implicated in divergent types of cancer. In this review, we summarize the involvement of NKL genes in cancer and leukemia in particular. NKL genes can act as tumor-suppressor genes and as oncogenes, depending on tissue type. Aberrant expression of NKL genes is especially common in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In T-ALL, 8 NKL genes have been reported to be highly expressed in specific T-ALL subgroups, and in ~30% of cases, high expression is caused by chromosomal rearrangement of 1 of 5 NKL genes. Most of these NKL genes are normally not expressed in T-cell development. We hypothesize that the NKL genes might share a similar downstream effect that promotes leukemogenesis, possibly due to mimicking a NKL gene that has a physiological role in early hematopoietic development, such as HHEX. All eight NKL genes posses a conserved Eh1 repressor motif, which has an important role in regulating downstream targets in hematopoiesis and possibly in leukemogenesis as well. Identification of a potential common leukemogenic NKL downstream pathway will provide a promising subject for future studies.","['Homminga, I', 'Pieters, R', 'Meijerink, J P P']","['Homminga I', 'Pieters R', 'Meijerink JP']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111118,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antennapedia Homeodomain Protein/*genetics', 'Genes, Homeobox/*physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.2', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011330 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.330 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):572-81. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.330.

A total of 14 somatic mutations were identified, including four and seven protein-altering nucleotide substitutions in each ALL. Twelve mutations (86%) occurred in genes previously described to be mutated in other types of cancer, but none was found to be recurrent in an extended series of 29 ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALLs. The number of single nucleotide mutations was similar to the number of copy number alterations as detected by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays.

We report that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 kinase (S6K) are highly expressed in the undifferentiated promyelomonocytic leukemic HL-60 cell line, whereas PLD2 expression is minimal. The expression ratio of PLD2 to mTOR (or to S6K) is gradually inverted upon in vitro induction of differentiation toward the neutrophilic phenotype. We present three ways that profoundly affect the kinetics of differentiation as follows: (i) simultaneous overexpression of mTOR (or S6K), (ii) silencing of mTOR via dsRNA-mediated interference or inhibition with rapamycin, and (iii) PLD2 overexpression. The last two methods shortened the time required for differentiation. By determining how PLD2 participates in cell differentiation, we found that PLD2 interacts with and activates the oncogene Fes/Fps, a protein-tyrosine kinase known to be involved in myeloid cell development. Fes activity is elevated with PLD2 overexpression, phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. Co-immunoprecipitation indicates a close PLD2-Fes physical interaction that is negated by a Fes-R483K mutant that incapacitates its Src homology 2 domain. All these suggest for the first time the following mechanism: mTOR/S6K down-regulation-->PLD2 overexpression-->PLD2/Fes association-->phosphatidic acid-led activation of Fes kinase-->granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation shortening could have a clinical impact on reducing the time of return to normalcy of the white cell counts after chemotherapy in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Di Fulvio, Mauricio', 'Frondorf, Kathleen', 'Henkels, Karen M', 'Grunwald, William C Jr', 'Cool, David', 'Gomez-Cambronero, Julian']","['Di Fulvio M', 'Frondorf K', 'Henkels KM', 'Grunwald WC Jr', 'Cool D', 'Gomez-Cambronero J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wright State University School Medicine, Dayton, Ohio, 45435.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wright State University School Medicine, Dayton, Ohio, 45435.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wright State University School Medicine, Dayton, Ohio, 45435.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Wright State University School Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45435.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Wright State University School Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45435.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wright State University School Medicine, Dayton, Ohio, 45435.

Here, we report two chronic myelogenous leukemia patients; one had a suboptimal response according to European LeukemiaNet criteria (a major molecular response was not achieved after 18 months of standard-dose imatinib therapy) and the other had failure with a standard dose of imatinib. At the time of the suboptimal response in patient 1 and the failure in patient 2, we were able to detect the F359I mutation in the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain using DNA sequencing in both patients. Therefore, it was decided to change the therapeutic regimen to dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg once daily in both patients.

The genetic association studies (GAS) that investigated the association between ALL and the MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene variants have produced contradictory or inconclusive results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to decrease the uncertainty of estimated genetic risk effects, a meticulous meta-analysis of published GAS related the variants in the MTFHR gene with susceptibility to ALL was conducted. The risk effects were estimated based on the odds ratio (OR) of the allele contrast and the generalized odds ratio (OR(G)). Cumulative and recursive cumulative meta-analyses were also performed. RESULTS: The analysis showed marginal significant association for the C677T variant, overall [OR=0.91 (0.82-1.00) and OR(G)=0.89 (0.79-1.01)], and in Whites [OR=0.88 (0.77-0.99) and OR(G)=0.85 (0.73-0.99)]. The A1298C variant produced non-significant results. For both variants, the cumulative meta-analysis did not show a trend of association as evidence accumulates and the recursive cumulative meta-analysis indicated lack of sufficient evidence for denying or claiming an association. CONCLUSION: The current evidence is not sufficient to draw definite conclusions regarding the association of MTHFR variants and development of ALL.","['Zintzaras, Elias', 'Doxani, Chrysoula', 'Rodopoulou, Paraskevi', 'Bakalos, Georgios', 'Ziogas, Dimitris C', 'Ziakas, Panayiotis', 'Voulgarelis, Michael']","['Zintzaras E', 'Doxani C', 'Rodopoulou P', 'Bakalos G', 'Ziogas DC', 'Ziakas P', 'Voulgarelis M']","['Department of Biomathematics, University of Thessaly School of Medicine, Larissa, Greece. zintza@med.uth.gr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20111116,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,IM,"['Child', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/07/21 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(11)00153-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2011.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2012 Apr;36(2):169-76. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2011.10.002.

We find that CML multipotent progenitors (MPPs) exhibit an aberrant B-lymphoid potential but are redirected toward the myeloid lineage by the action of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. We show that BCR/ABL activity controls Il-6 expression thereby establishing a paracrine feedback loop that sustains CML development.

We observed altered gene expression related to mitochondrial function, metabolism, and hematopoietic regulation in pre-aHCT samples from patients who subsequently developed t-MDS/AML. Progression to overt t-MDS/AML was associated with additional alterations in cell-cycle regulatory genes.

METHODS: A total of 32 APL patients with an induction of CR by ATRA at our hospital from January 2000 to October 2007 received conventional standard chemotherapy as a consolidation regimen. Stratified according to age, those under 50 years old received an intermediate dose of cytarabine(IDAra-C)and over 50 years old non-IDAra-C regimen. Maintenance regimen: all patients received ATRA, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) + methotrexate (MTX) alternately and sequentially for 3 years. The efficacy and side effects of these chemotherapies were observed. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 72 (40 - 124) months. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of under 50 years old and over 50 years old were 94.7% and 92.3% respectively. The difference was statistically insignificant (P > 0.05). One patient relapsed after a consolidation therapy and so did another on a maintenance regimen. Thirty patients achieved a constant CR. And 16 of 30 patients completed chemotherapy beyond 5 years and survived disease-free. The 5-year DFS rate of 32 patients was 93.8%. CONCLUSION: After the achievement of CR with ATRA, all APL patients have a higher rate of DFS after stratification. The side effects are generally mild. Thus a stratification therapy is both feasible and efficacious.","['Xu, Jian-li', 'Jiang, Ming', 'Halida, Yasheng', 'Duan, Xian-lin', 'Guo, Xin-hong', 'Hao, Jian-ping', 'Fu, Mei-lan', 'Qu, Jian-hua', 'Wang, Lei']","['Xu JL', 'Jiang M', 'Halida Y', 'Duan XL', 'Guo XH', 'Hao JP', 'Fu ML', 'Qu JH', 'Wang L']","['Department of Hematology, Xinjiang Medical University, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumqi, China.']",['chi'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Aug 30;91(32):2254-7.,,,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 112 CML patients were recruited from August 2008 to February 2010 in our hospital. There were 72 males and 40 females with a median age of 39 years old (range: 6 - 76 years old). Among them, 102 patients were in chronic phase, 4 in accelerated phase and 6 in blastic phase. Ninety-nine patients were treated with imatinib while 13 patients received hydroxyurea. Twenty healthy blood donors were designated as the control group. The serum AGP levels of all patients were detected by immuno-turbidimetric assay. And the concentrations of AGP and imatinib were detected in 12 patients before and after 3 months of imatinib therapy respectively. For 84 CML patients, their plasma trough concentrations of imatinib were detected by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry simultaneously. All patients were divided into 5 groups by efficacy to evaluate the significance of serum AGP and its relationship with imatinib concentration. RESULTS: Serum AGP of no response (NR) group [(1.18 +/- 0.26) g/L] was significant higher than that of complete cytogenetic response (CCR), complete hematologic response (CHR) and control group [(0.60 +/- 0.21), (0.71 +/- 0.17), (0.52 +/- 0.15) g/L, all P < 0.05]. Serum AGP of accelerated/blastic phase group [(1.28 +/- 0.50) g/L] was significant higher than CCR or control group (P < 0.05). Serum AGP of CHR group was higher than that of control group (P < 0.05). No significant difference existed between CCR, CHR or control group (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences between NR, relapse or accelerated/blastic phase group (P > 0.05). The serum AGP of 12 patients on a 3-month therapy of imatinib were lower than that of patients at pre-treatment [(0.54 +/- 0.17) g/L vs (0.83 +/- 0.31) g/L, P < 0.01]. The plasma trough concentration of imatinib was (1307 +/- 586) microg/L (range: 109 - 3400 microg/L) in 84 patients. And it was positively correlated with the serum level of AGP (r = 0.443, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The serum level of AGP can reflect the in vivo loads of leukemic cells for CML patients. There is a positive correlation between the serum level of AGP and the plasma trough concentration of imatinib. Serum AGP can be used as a monitoring index of efficacy for CML patients.","['Zhong, Jian-sheng', 'Meng, Fan-yi', 'Xu, Dan', 'Dai, Min', 'Wei, Yong-qiang', 'Zhou, Hong-sheng']","['Zhong JS', 'Meng FY', 'Xu D', 'Dai M', 'Wei YQ', 'Zhou HS']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orosomucoid/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Aug 16;91(30):2120-3.,,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report nicotinic attenuation of inflammation and alteration of apoptotic protein expression pattern in murine muscle tissue and cultured myotubes, involving the RNA-binding protein, Tristetraprolin, and the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1. In muscles and C2C12 myotubes, cholinergic excitation by exposure to nicotine or the organophosphorous pesticide, Paraoxon, induced Tristetraprolin overproduction while reducing pro-inflammatory transcripts such as IL-6, CXCL1 (KC) and CCL2 (MCP-1). Furthermore, nicotinic excitation under exposure to the bacterial endotoxin LPS attenuated over-expression of the CCL2 and suppressed the transcriptional activity of NF-kB and AP-1. Tristetraprolin was essential for this anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine in basal conditions. However, its knockdown also impaired the pro-inflammatory response to LPS. Finally, in vivo administration of Paraoxon or recombinant Acetylcholinesterase, leading respectively to either gain or loss of cholinergic signaling, modified muscle expression of key mRNA processing factors and several of their apoptosis-related targets. Specifically, cholinergic imbalances enhanced the kinase activators of the Serine-Arginine splicing kinases, Clk1 and Clk3. Moreover, Paraoxon raised the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, through a previously unrecognized polyadenylation site selection mechanism, producing longer, less stable Mcl-1 mRNA transcripts. Together, our findings demonstrate that in addition to activating muscle function, acetylcholine regulates muscle inflammation and cell survival, and point to Tristetraprolin and the choice of Mcl-1 mRNA polyadenylation sites as potential key players in muscle reactions to insults.","['Geyer, Brian C', 'Ben Ari, Shani', 'Barbash, Shahar', 'Kilbourne, Jacqueline', 'Mor, Tsafrir S', 'Soreq, Hermona']","['Geyer BC', 'Ben Ari S', 'Barbash S', 'Kilbourne J', 'Mor TS', 'Soreq H']","['School of Life Sciences and The Biodesign Institute, P.O.

The NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model of ALL is a clinically relevant model in which the mice develop a systemic leukemia which retains the fundamental biological characteristics of the original disease. Here we report a study evaluating the NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model to investigate glucocorticoid-induced gene expression. Cells from a glucocorticoid-sensitive xenograft derived from a child with B-cell precursor ALL were inoculated into NOD/SCID mice. When highly engrafted the mice were randomized into groups of 4 to receive dexamethasone 15 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection or vehicle control. Leukemia cells were harvested from mice spleens at 0, 8, 24 or 48 hours thereafter, and gene expression analyzed on Illumina WG-6_V3 chips, comparing all groups to time 0 hours. RESULTS: The 8 hour dexamethasone-treated timepoint had the highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes, with fewer observed at the 24 and 48 hour timepoints, and with minimal changes seen across the time-matched controls. When compared to publicly available datasets of glucocorticoid-induced gene expression from an in vitro cell line study and from an in vivo study of patients with ALL, at the level of pathways, expression changes in the 8 hour xenograft samples showed a similar response to patients treated with glucocorticoids. Replicate analysis revealed that at the 8 hour timepoint, a dataset with high signal and differential expression, using data from 3 replicates instead of 4 resulted in excellent recovery scores of > 0.9. However at other timepoints with less signal very poor recovery scores were obtained with 3 replicates. CONCLUSIONS: The NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model provides a reproducible experimental system in which to investigate clinically-relevant mechanisms of drug-induced gene regulation in ALL; the 8 hour timepoint provides the highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes; time-matched controls are redundant and excellent recovery scores can be obtained with 3 replicates.","['Bhadri, Vivek A', 'Cowley, Mark J', 'Kaplan, Warren', 'Trahair, Toby N', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Bhadri VA', 'Cowley MJ', 'Kaplan W', 'Trahair TN', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111117,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,"['Animals', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome']",PMC3228854,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-12-565 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-12-565 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2011 Nov 17;12:565. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-12-565.,,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The NB4 cell was incubated with simvastatin and ATRA alone or in combination. And the NB4 cell without any treatment was adopted as a normal control. The cells of different groups were collected at 24, 48 and 72 h post-incubation. Their morphological changes were observed after Wright staining. The method of MTT was employed to assay the growth inhibition rate and flow cytometry was used to detect the early-stage ratios of apoptosis and cell necrosis. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the WT1/hDMP1 gene expression levels. RESULTS: The cell inhibition rates increased gradually (F = 7.15, P = 0.000) at 15, 10 and 5 micromol/L SV respectively. And so did the expression levels of CD11b (F = 3.41, P = 0.014) and Annexin-V (F = 43.38, P = 0.000). However the expression levels of WT1 decreased gradually (F = 5.35, P = 0.001) reversely with the elevated levels of hDMP1 (F = 22.61, P = 0.000). Furthermore the NB4 cell exhibited the most significant changes at 15 micromol/L SV. After a 72-hour incubation, the expression levels of CD11b (89.46% +/- 9.13%)and hDMP1 (626.9 +/- 56.9) in NB4 cells at 15 micromol/L SV plus 0.5 micromol/L ATRA were significantly higher than those with ATRA(71.27% +/- 7.27%, P = 0.000 and 421.8 +/- 38.3, P = 0.003 in each) and SV alone(62.41% +/- 6.37%, P = 0.003 and 241.4 +/- 21.9, P = 0.003 in each). A combination of 15 micromol/L SV with 0.5 micromol/L ATRA displayed obvious interactions with the expressions of CD11b and hDMP1 (F = 4.09, P = 0.025 and F = 29.58, P = 0.000 in each). And there was no significant interaction for cell inhibition rates and Annexin-V expression. CONCLUSION: Simvastatin in vitro inhibits the proliferation of NB4 cell, induces its differentiation and promotes its apoptosis. And the lowered expression of WT1 has a dose-dependent correlation with the elevated expression of hDMP1. It indicates that simvastatin has the synergistic in vitro anti-promyelocytic potency.","['Jiang, Ting-xiu', 'Gu, Wei-ying', 'Qiu, Guo-qiang', 'Chen, Zi-xing', 'Wang, Zhi-lin', 'Wu, Hao-qing', 'Hua, Xiao-ying', 'He, Bai', 'Wu, Wei', 'Xie, Xiao-bao', 'Cao, Xiang-shan']","['Jiang TX', 'Gu WY', 'Qiu GQ', 'Chen ZX', 'Wang ZL', 'Wu HQ', 'Hua XY', 'He B', 'Wu W', 'Xie XB', 'Cao XS']","[""Department of Hematology, First People's Hospital, Changzhou, China.""]",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Simvastatin/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/04/27 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Jul 12;91(26):1856-60.,,,"['0 (DMP1 protein, human)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further characterize the mechanism underlying restriction of the late stages of HIV-1 replication, we assessed the ability of IFNbeta-induced genes to restrict HIV-1 Gag particle production and have identified a potentially novel host factor called HECT domain and RCC1-like domain-containing protein 5 (HERC5) that blocks a unique late stage of the HIV-1 life cycle. RESULTS: HERC5 inhibited the replication of HIV-1 over multiple rounds of infection and was found to target a late stage of HIV-1 particle production. The E3 ligase activity of HERC5 was required for blocking HIV-1 Gag particle production and correlated with the post-translational modification of Gag with ISG15. HERC5 interacted with HIV-1 Gag and did not alter trafficking of HIV-1 Gag to the plasma membrane. Electron microscopy revealed that the assembly of HIV-1 Gag particles was arrested at the plasma membrane, at an early stage of assembly. The mechanism of HERC5-induced restriction of HIV-1 particle production is distinct from the mechanism underlying HIV-1 restriction by the expression of ISG15 alone, which acts at a later step in particle release. Moreover, HERC5 restricted murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag particle production, showing that HERC5 is effective in restricting Gag particle production of an evolutionarily divergent retrovirus. CONCLUSIONS: HERC5 represents a potential new host factor that blocks an early stage of retroviral Gag particle assembly. With no apparent HIV-1 protein that directly counteracts it, HERC5 may represent a new candidate for HIV/AIDS therapy.","['Woods, Matthew W', 'Kelly, Jenna N', 'Hattlmann, Clayton J', 'Tong, Jessica G K', 'Xu, Li S', 'Coleman, Macon D', 'Quest, Graeme R', 'Smiley, James R', 'Barr, Stephen D']","['Woods MW', 'Kelly JN', 'Hattlmann CJ', 'Tong JG', 'Xu LS', 'Coleman MD', 'Quest GR', 'Smiley JR', 'Barr SD']","['The University of Western Ontario, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Center for Human Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dental Sciences Building Room 3006b, London, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111117,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Infections/*metabolism/*virology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Ubiquitins/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Assembly']",PMC3228677,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-8-95 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-8-95 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2011 Nov 17;8:95. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-8-95.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HERC5 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '60267-61-0 (ISG15 protein, human)']",,,,,,['Retrovirology. 2012;9:19.

The use of pediatric-intensive regimens in young and middle-aged adults shows promise in improving outcomes. The addition of monoclonal antibody therapy to chemotherapy appears to hold great promise in lessening relapse rates. The anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, which has been of such benefit in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, now seems poised to bring significant benefit to adults with ALL. Other monoclonal antibody approaches are in earlier stages of development, but will likely be of significant benefit. The BiTE antibody, blinatumomab, represents an exciting new approach in this arena. As new molecular abnormalities are identified in ALL, these will certainly become new targets for drug development. The increasing use of MRD testing by molecular or flow cytometric techniques will also be invaluable in further refining prognostication in ALL in helping with the selection of patients most likely to benefit from BMT. Several new small molecules and chemotherapeutic agents will, it is hoped, also find a niche in the therapy for ALL. Early examples including NOTCH1 inhibitors; hypomethylating agents such as decitabine, folic acid, antagonists, flavopiridol, bortezomib, and mTOR inhibitors will all hopefully find a role in the therapy for this challenging disorder.

In the adult setting, most patients will ultimately die of their disease, whereas in the pediatric setting, relapsed and refractory disease remains a therapeutic challenge. Cellular therapy through allo-HSCT remains an option for these patients, and recent advances in alternative forms of allo-HSCT, including unrelated donor transplants, UCB transplants, and haploidentical transplants, have expanded the numbers of patients eligible for allo-HSCT but have not improved outcomes when compared with HLA-matched related allo-HSCTs. In light of this persistent failure, several novel adoptive cellular approaches are being investigated to treat patients with ALL. The use of enriched WT-1-specific donor T cells to treat patients with ALL is currently under investigation in phase I trials at several centers. Treatment of ALL with genetically modified T cells targeted to the CD19 antigen through the expression of a CD19-specific CAR also have entered phase I clinical trials at several centers. Similarly, a clinical trial treating patients with ALL with genetically modified NK cells targeted to the CD19 antigen has recently opened for accrual. Collectively, these ongoing and anticipated trials provide a promising role for adoptive cellular therapies in the treatment of ALL. What remains to be seen is whether this promise will either translate into improved outcomes for these patients or provide significant insights on which to design second-generation adoptive cell therapeutic clinical trials for ALL in the future.","['Park, Jae H', 'Sauter, Craig', 'Brentjens, Renier']","['Park JH', 'Sauter C', 'Brentjens R']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 569, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', '*Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",PMC3551618,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0889-8588(11)00112-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.hoc.2011.09.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2011 Dec;25(6):1281-301. doi: 10.1016/j.hoc.2011.09.015.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The data with IDH enzyme mutations are less clear, in that individual IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may have different clinical effects and the data so far have not suggested a uniform effect on outcome. Despite the exciting data indicating that mutational testing for these alterations may be clinically useful, several challenges to understanding their clinical relevance remain. First, patients may simultaneously have mutations in multiple genes described in this article (FLT3, NPM1, CEBPa, DNMT3a, IDH1/2, or TET2), and in additional genes not mentioned earlier (Ras,47 PTEN,48 PHF6,49 ASXL1,15 and RUNX145). Furthermore, comprehensive sequencing studies of well-annotated, homogeneously treated patient cohorts are needed to understand the clinical implications of integrated mutational profiling in AML. An additional challenge to using mutational analysis for TET2 and DNMT3a in clinical use is identifying a means for rapid molecular testing of these mutations. This challenge may be met by the use of non-polymerase chain reaction-based methods of target enrichment, such as hybrid capture, followed by next-generation sequencing technologies. Moreover, clinical studies evaluating the biochemical consequences of mutations in some of these genes (eg, production of 2-HG in bodily fluids from patients with IDH-mutant AML or increased hydroxymethylcytosine levels in pretreatment blast DNA in patients with TET2/IDH mutant AML) may also prove to be useful in identifying biomarkers. Alternatively, protein-based technologies such as immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry may be used in the clinical setting to detect the mutant proteins or loss of expression of specific proteins in patients with mutations. An additional area of importance highlighted by these discoveries is the increasing realization that several of these genes encode enzymes or result in alterations in enzymatic activities, which may represent novel, tractable therapeutic targets for patients with AML. This finding may hopefully lead to the development of novel targeted therapeutics for patients with specific genetic alterations in AML. This development may be occurring now with the advent of DOT1L-targeted therapy for leukemic cells with translocations involving MLL1.50,51 Studies to identify whether the neomorphic enzymatic activity of IDH1/2 mutations may be targetable or if the downstream effects of TET2 mutations can be targeted are ongoing and may lead to the development of rational epigenetic therapies that improve outcomes for patients with AML.","['Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Patel, Jay', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Abdel-Wahab O', 'Patel J', 'Levine RL']","['Leukemia Service and Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 20, New York, NY 10065, USA. abdelwao@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['U54CA143798-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111029,United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,IM,"['DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0889-8588(11)00110-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.hoc.2011.09.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2011 Dec;25(6):1119-33. doi: 10.1016/j.hoc.2011.09.013.

METHODS: The karyotype analysis was performed in 178 AML using the short-term culture of bone marrow cell and G-banding technique. RESULTS: Among the 178 patients, 171 had enough metaphases for analysis and 128 (74.9%) had clonal karyotypic abnormalities. Twenty-seven patients were secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-AML), with 25 (92.6%) patients carrying clonal karyotypic abnormalities. Among the remaining 144 patients of de novo AML, 103 (71.5%) had clonal karyotypic abnormalities. The rate of abnormal clonal karyotype was higher in MDS-AML than that of de novo AML (P = 0.021). Among the 171 patients, 41 (24.0%) were in favorable risk group, 80(46.8%) in intermediate risk group and 50 (29.2%) in adverse risk group. t(15;17) was the most common chromosomal aberration. The majority intermediate risk chromosomal aberration was normal karyotype. The most common cytogenetic abnormality among adverse group was a complex karyotype. Adverse cytogenetic aberrations, such as -5/5q-, -7/7q-, frequently occurred in conjunction with one another as part of a complex karyotype. Totally 75 patients were 60 years or older, among them, 16.0% were in favorable risk group, 48.0% in intermediate risk group and 36.0% in adverse risk group. Among 96 younger patients, 30.2% were in favorable risk group, 45.8% in intermediate risk group and 24.0% in adverse risk group. The rate of favorable risk chromosomal aberration was lower in elder patients than in younger (P = 0.031). The rate of adverse risk chromosomal aberration and the rate of monosomal karyotype were higher in MDS-AML than in de novo AML patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The most common favorable, intermediate and adverse chromosomal aberrations were t(15;17), normal karyotype and complex karyotype respectively.

A CBC showed severe nonregenerative anemia and moderate numbers of atypical cells with morphologic features most consistent with megakaryoblastic origin. Similar cells were identified in a bone marrow aspirate and accounted for 23% of all nucleated cells. Atypical promegakaryocytes and megakaryocytes were also noted. Myelodysplastic syndrome affecting the megakaryocytic lineage was suspected. Cytologic examination of a fine-needle aspirate of the spleen revealed rare megakaryoblasts similar to those in blood and bone marrow. At necropsy, the bone marrow consisted of atypical megakaryoblasts and megakaryocytes that were also infiltrating spleen, liver, lymph nodes, renal perihilar tissue, and visceral adipose tissue, consistent with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Immunohistochemical analysis of splenic sections confirmed megakaryoblastic origin (immunoreactive for CD61 and von Willebrand factor).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether or not persistence of symptoms could be due to sensitization against endogenous human milk proteins with a high degree of similarity to bovine allergens. METHODS: Ten peptides representing known bovine milk IgE-binding epitopes [alpha-lactalbumin (ALA), beta- and kappa-casein] and the corresponding, highly homologous human milk peptides were labelled with sera from 15 breastfed infants with CMA, aged 3 weeks to 12 months, and peptide (epitope)-specific IgE antibodies were assessed. Nine of the 15 breastfed infants became asymptomatic during strict maternal avoidance of milk and other major food allergens; six infants remained symptomatic until weaned. Ten older children, aged 5-15 years, with CMA were also assessed. The functional capacity of specific IgE antibodies was assessed by measuring beta-hexosaminidase release from rat basophilic leukaemia cells passively sensitized and stimulated with human and bovine ALA. RESULTS: A minimum of one human milk peptide was recognized by IgE antibodies from 9 of 15 (60%) milk-allergic infants, and the majority of older children with CMA. Genuine sensitization to human milk peptides in the absence of IgE to bovine milk was occasionally seen. There was a trend towards specific IgE being detected to more human milk peptides in those infants who did not respond to the maternal milk elimination diet than in those who did (P = 0.099). Functional IgE antibody to human ALA was only detected in infants not responding to the maternal diet. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Endogenous human milk epitopes are recognized by specific IgE from the majority of infants and children with CMA. Such autoreactive, human milk-specific IgE antibodies appear to have functional properties in vitro. Their role in provoking allergic symptoms in infants exclusively breastfed by mothers strictly avoiding dietary milk remains unclear.","['Jarvinen, K M', 'Geller, L', 'Bencharitiwong, R', 'Sampson, H A']","['Jarvinen KM', 'Geller L', 'Bencharitiwong R', 'Sampson HA']","['Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029-6574, USA. kirsi.jarvinen-seppo@mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['K12 HD052890-03/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'RR026134/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD052890/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI044236/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI066738/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AI091655/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR029887/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI044236/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI44236/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI066738/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110921,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity/genetics/*immunology', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/genetics/*immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Milk Hypersensitivity/blood/genetics/*immunology', 'Milk Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Peptides/genetics/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",PMC3780604,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03864.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2012 Feb;42(2):238-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03864.x.

AIM: To examine the association between chemotherapy before the age of 8 years and (1): microdontia; (2): hypodontia of premolars and permanent molars. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In The Danish Registry of Childhood Cancer (DBCR), we identified 203 children who met the following inclusion criteria: (1) age below 8 years at the start of treatment; (2) age between 12 to 18 years upon dental examination; (3) had received chemotherapy The exclusion criterion was radiotherapy to the head and neck. A total of 150 children fulfilled the inclusion criteria. As controls, a random sample of 193 age-matched unexposed children was included. RESULTS: Microdontia was found in a total of 88 teeth in 29 (19.3%) of the 150 children who had been exposed to chemotherapy, while none of the controls had microdontia of premolars or permanent molars (difference: 19.3%; 95% CL: 13.5%; 26.4%). The earlier the exposure, the more frequent was microdontia. We found a total of 27 missing premolars and permanent molars in 14 (9.3%) of the exposed children and a total of 18 missing premolars and permanent molars in 8 (4.1%) of the controls (difference: 5.2%; 95% CL: -0.1%; 11.3%). CONCLUSION: The present study confirms findings from previous studies that chemotherapy, especially in very young children, causes microdontia and hypodontia of premolars and permanent molars.","['Pedersen, Lisbeth Bonlokke', 'Clausen, Niels', 'Schroder, Henrik', 'Schmidt, Malene', 'Poulsen, Sven']","['Pedersen LB', 'Clausen N', 'Schroder H', 'Schmidt M', 'Poulsen S']","['Department of Pediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111117,England,Int J Paediatr Dent,International journal of paediatric dentistry,9107511,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anodontia/*chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Autonomic Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy', 'Bicuspid/*abnormalities', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Denmark', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Molar/*abnormalities', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy', '*Survivors']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-263X.2011.01199.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Paediatr Dent. 2012 Jul;22(4):239-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-263X.2011.01199.x.

Ileal endoscopic biopsies might not be performed because of technical difficulty and effort required to prepare the colon. It is not known whether or not histopathology of feline duodenal and ileal biopsies for detection of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and small cell lymphoma (SC-LSA) provides comparable results. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the agreement between endoscopic biopsies of duodenum and ileum in cats with IBD and SC-LSA. ANIMALS: Seventy client-owned cats with gastrointestinal disease and adequate duodenal and ileal tissue biopsies obtained endoscopically. METHODS: Retrospective study: Search of medical records of cats with enteropathy and endoscopy. Samples were blinded and re-evaluated by single pathologist (JM) for quality, number of biopsies, and diagnosis according to WSAVA standards. Agreement of IBD and SC-LSA diagnoses among biopsy sites assessed using Cohen's Kappa. RESULTS: Eighteen of 70 cats (26%) were diagnosed with SC-LSA in duodenum, ileum, or both. Of these 18 cats, 7 (39%) were diagnosed with only duodenal SC-LSA, 8 (44%) were diagnosed with only ileal SC-LSA, and 3 (17%) had SC-LSA in both duodenum and ileum. There was poor agreement on diagnosis between duodenal and ileal biopsies (kappa = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Although review by a single pathologist remains a limitation of this study, results suggest that there is a population of cats in which diagnosis of SC-LSA can be found only by evaluation of ileal biopsies. Clinicians should consider performing both upper and lower GI endoscopic biopsies in cats with infiltrative small bowel disease.","['Scott, K D', 'Zoran, D L', 'Mansell, J', 'Norby, B', 'Willard, M D']","['Scott KD', 'Zoran DL', 'Mansell J', 'Norby B', 'Willard MD']","['Department of Veterinary Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-4474, USA. kscott@cvm.tamu.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111101,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,IM,"['Animals', 'Biopsy/methods/veterinary', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Cats', 'Duodenum/*pathology', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal/*veterinary', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Ileum/pathology', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.00831.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2011 Nov-Dec;25(6):1253-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.00831.x.

The molecular mechanism of IFN-alpha efficacy in the treatment of CML is not fully clear. OBJECTIVES: To identify the peptides and/or proteins that bind to the proteins specifically expressed on the surface of IFN-alpha-sensitive CML cells by using a phage display library. DESIGN/METHODS: IFN-alpha-sensitive KT-1/A3 cells were used as the target, and IFN-alpha-resistant subline KT-1/A3R was used as absorber for phage display biopanning. The positive phage clones were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. The peptides were deduced from their DNA sequences. RESULTS: Multiple clones showed high binding efficiency to KT-1/A3 cells compared with that of the other leukemia cells. One of the peptides, KLWVIPQ, has a partial amino acid sequence homology with the C-terminal domain of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the identification of specific heptapeptides that bind to IFN-alpha-sensitive KT-1/A3 cells.

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Single academic institution. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 60 and older with newly diagnosed AML and planned chemotherapy. MEASUREMENTS: Bedside GA was performed during inpatient exmination for AML. GA measures included the modified Mini-Mental State Examination; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; Distress Thermometer, Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability (includes self- reported activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, and mobility questions); Short Physical Performance Battery (includes timed 4-m walk, chair stands, standing balance); grip strength, and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Of 54 participants (mean age 70.8 +/- 6.4) eligible for this analysis, 92.6% completed the entire GA battery (mean time 44.0 +/- 14 minutes). The following impairments were detected: cognitive impairment, 31.5%; depression, 38.9%; distress, 53.7%; impairment in ADLs, 48.2%; impaired physical performance, 53.7%; and comorbidity, 46.3%. Most were impaired in one (92.6%) or more (63%) functional domains. For the 38 participants rated as having good performance status according to standard oncologic assessment (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance Scale score </=1), impairments in individual GA measures ranged from 23.7% to 50%. Significant variability in cognitive, emotional, and physical status was detected even after stratification according to tumor biology (cytogenetic risk group classification). CONCLUSION: Inpatient GA was feasible and added new information to standard oncology assessment, which may be important for stratifying therapeutic risk in older adults with AML.","['Klepin, Heidi D', 'Geiger, Ann M', 'Tooze, Janet A', 'Kritchevsky, Stephen B', 'Williamson, Jeff D', 'Ellis, Leslie R', 'Levitan, Denise', 'Pardee, Timothy S', 'Isom, Scott', 'Powell, Bayard L']","['Klepin HD', 'Geiger AM', 'Tooze JA', 'Kritchevsky SB', 'Williamson JD', 'Ellis LR', 'Levitan D', 'Pardee TS', 'Isom S', 'Powell BL']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA. hklepin@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['K23 AG038361/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG021332/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG-021332/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110913,United States,J Am Geriatr Soc,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,7503062,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment/*methods', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'North Carolina', 'Nursing Assessment', 'Prospective Studies']",PMC3782375,2011/11/19 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03614.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Geriatr Soc. 2011 Oct;59(10):1837-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03614.x.

Seven randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria including in total 1045 parents participants. A variety of cognitive-behavioral interventions problem-solving skills training programs have been used for managing distress in parents and children. Outcome measures are assessed by self-report, observer report, behavioral/psychological, and physiological measures. The most prominent methodological problems were the marked heterogeneity in stress measurement and the relative absence of proper measurement and adjustment of moderating and mediating factors. The largest effect has been obtained by combined cognitive-behavioral interventions with promising but limited evidence for several other psychological interventions. Conclusions. Recommendations for future RCTs are provided, and particular attention to the quality of trial design and reporting is highlighted.","['Bougea, A', 'Darviri, C', 'Alexopoulos, E C']","['Bougea A', 'Darviri C', 'Alexopoulos EC']","['Stress Management and Health Promotion Postgraduate Course, Medical School, University of Athens, 115 27 Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110825,Egypt,ISRN Oncol,ISRN oncology,101567026,,,PMC3195328,2011/11/18 06:00,2011/11/18 06:01,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5402/2011/959247 [doi]'],ppublish,ISRN Oncol. 2011;2011:959247. doi: 10.5402/2011/959247.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has overcome the hurdles of unavailability of abnormal and/or lack of metaphase cells, and detection of cryptic, submicroscopic rearrangements. In the present study, besides diagnostic approach we sought to analyze these cases for identification and characterization of cryptic rearrangements, deletion variants and unknown RARA translocation variants by application of D-FISH and RARA break-apart probe strategy on interphase and metaphase cells in a large series of 200 cases of APL. Forty cases (20%) had atypical PML-RARA and/or RARA variants. D-FISH with PML/RARA probe helped identification of RARA insertion to PML. By application of D-FISH on metaphase cells, we documented that translocation of 15 to 17 leads to 17q deletion which results in loss of reciprocal fusion and/or residual RARA on der(17). Among the complex variants of t(15;17), PML-RARA fusion followed by residual RARA insertion closed to PML-RARA on der(15) was unique and unusual. FISH with break-apart RARA probe on metaphase cells was found to be a very efficient strategy to detect unknown RARA variant translocations like t(11;17)(q23;q21), t(11;17)(q13;q21) and t(2;17)(p21;q21). These findings proved that D-FISH and break-apart probe strategy has potential to detect primary as well as secondary additional aberrations of PML, RARA and other additional loci. The long-term clinical follow-up is essential to evaluate the clinical importance of these findings.","['Amare, Pratibha Kadam', 'Baisane, Chanda', 'Nair, Reena', 'Menon, Hari', 'Banavali, Shripad', 'Kabre, Sharayu', 'Gujral, Sumit', 'Subramaniam, P']","['Amare PK', 'Baisane C', 'Nair R', 'Menon H', 'Banavali S', 'Kabre S', 'Gujral S', 'Subramaniam P']","['Cancer Cytogenetics Laboratory, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Hum Genet,Indian journal of human genetics,101223637,,,PMC3214318,2011/11/18 06:00,2011/11/18 06:01,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-6866.86174 [doi]', 'IJHG-17-54 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hum Genet. 2011 May;17(2):54-8. doi: 10.4103/0971-6866.86174.,['NOTNLM'],"['17q deletion', 'APL', 'D-FISH', 'PML-RARA', 'RARA variant']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitors identified from the screen exhibit a diverse range of scaffolds and the structure of one of the inhibitors, NSC13000 cocrystalized with NQO2, has been solved. This has been used to aid the generation of a structure-activity relationship between the computationally derived binding affinity and experimentally measured enzyme inhibitory potency. Many of the compounds are functionally active as inhibitors of NQO2 in cells at nontoxic concentrations. To show this, advantage was taken of the NQO2-mediated toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drug CB1954. The toxicity of this drug is substantially reduced when the function of NQO2 is inhibited, and many of the compounds achieve this in cells at nanomolar concentrations. The NQO2 inhibitors also attenuated TNFalpha-mediated, NF-small ka, CyrillicB-driven transcriptional activity. The link between NQO2 and the regulation of NF-small ka, CyrillicB was confirmed by using short interfering RNA to NQO2 and by the observation that NRH, the cofactor for NQO2 enzyme activity, could regulate NF-small ka, CyrillicB activity in an NQO2-dependent manner. NF-small ka, CyrillicB is a potential therapeutic target and this study reveals an underlying mechanism that may be usable for developing new anticancer drugs.","['Nolan, Karen A', 'Dunstan, Mark S', 'Caraher, Mary C', 'Scott, Katherine A', 'Leys, David', 'Stratford, Ian J']","['Nolan KA', 'Dunstan MS', 'Caraher MC', 'Scott KA', 'Leys D', 'Stratford IJ']","['School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Manchester and Manchester Cancer Research Centre, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['08-0152/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'G0500366/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0500366(73607)/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111116,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Aziridines/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Quinone Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",PMC3272422,2011/11/18 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0543 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0543 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Jan;11(1):194-203. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0543.

We now investigate whether Ran is a potential therapeutic target of cancers with frequently found mutations that lead to higher Ras/MEK/ERK [mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; MEK)] and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTORC1 activities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry [propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V staining] and MTT assay in cancer cells grown under different conditions after knockdown of Ran. The correlations between Ran expression and patient survival were examined in breast and lung cancers. RESULTS: Cancer cells with their PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways inhibited are less susceptible to Ran silencing-induced apoptosis. K-Ras-mutated, c-Met-amplified, and Pten-deleted cancer cells are also more susceptible to Ran silencing-induced apoptosis than their wild-type counterparts and this effect is reduced by inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 and MEK/ERK pathways. Overexpression of Ran in clinical specimens is significantly associated with poor patient outcome in both breast and lung cancers. This association is dramatically enhanced in cancers with increased c-Met or osteopontin expression, or with oncogenic mutations of K-Ras or PIK3CA, all of which are mutations that potentially correlate with activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 and/or Ras/MEK/ERK pathways. Silencing Ran also results in dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport of transcription factors and downregulation of Mcl-1 expression, at the transcriptional level, which are reversed by inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 and MEK/ERK pathways. CONCLUSION: Ran is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of cancers with mutations/changes of expression in protooncogenes that lead to activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways.","['Yuen, Hiu-Fung', 'Chan, Ka-Kui', 'Grills, Claire', 'Murray, James T', 'Platt-Higgins, Angela', 'Eldin, Osama Sharaf', ""O'Byrne, Ken"", 'Janne, Pasi', 'Fennell, Dean A', 'Johnston, Patrick G', 'Rudland, Philip S', 'El-Tanani, Mohamed']","['Yuen HF', 'Chan KK', 'Grills C', 'Murray JT', 'Platt-Higgins A', 'Eldin OS', ""O'Byrne K"", 'Janne P', 'Fennell DA', 'Johnston PG', 'Rudland PS', 'El-Tanani M']","[""Center for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, UK.""]",['eng'],"['A9310/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'G0801447/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111116,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Osteopontin/genetics/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'ran GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3272446,2011/11/18 06:00,2012/08/02 06:00,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2035 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2035 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jan 15;18(2):380-91. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2035.

While exploring potential disease mechanisms, we found that XMRV infection induced apoptosis in SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting a mechanism for the neuromuscular pathology seen in CFS. Several lines of evidence show that the cell entry receptor for XMRV, Xpr1, mediates this effect, and chemical cross-linking studies show that Xpr1 is associated with the Gbeta subunit of the G-protein heterotrimer. The activation of adenylate cyclase rescued the cells from XMRV toxicity, indicating that toxicity resulted from reduced G-protein-mediated cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling. Some proteins with similarity to Xpr1 are involved in phosphate uptake into cells, but we found no role of Xpr1 in phosphate uptake or its regulation. Our results indicate that Xpr1 is a novel, atypical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and that xenotropic or polytropic retrovirus binding can disrupt the cAMP-mediated signaling function of Xpr1, leading to the apoptosis of infected cells. We show that this pathway is also responsible for the classic toxicity of the polytropic mink cell focus-forming (MCF) retrovirus in mink cells. Although it now seems clear that the detection of XMRV in humans was the result of sample contamination with a recombinant mouse virus, our findings may have relevance to neurologic disease induced by MCF retroviruses in mice.","['Vaughan, Andrew E', 'Mendoza, Ramon', 'Aranda, Ramona', 'Battini, Jean-Luc', 'Miller, A Dusty']","['Vaughan AE', 'Mendoza R', 'Aranda R', 'Battini JL', 'Miller AD']","['Human Biology Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['U54 CA132383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA132383-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA080416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA080416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111116,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Nervous System/virology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Virulence', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*pathogenicity']",PMC3264382,2011/11/18 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06073-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06073-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Feb;86(3):1661-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06073-11.

However, the underlying mechanisms and cellular factors involved in the process are largely uncharacterized. The viral receptor for ecotropic MLV (eMLV), a classical model for retrovirus infection mechanisms and pathogenesis, is mouse cationic amino acid transporter 1 (mCAT-1). Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) is an adaptor protein that has been shown to couple cell surface receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor, to intracellular signaling events. Here we examined if GRB2 could also play a role in controlling infection by retroviruses by affecting receptor function. The GRB2 RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of endogenous GRB2 resulted in a consistent and significant reduction of virus binding and membrane fusion. The binding between eMLV and cells promoted increased GRB2-mCAT-1 interactions, as detected by immunoprecipitation. Consistently, the increased colocalization of GRB2 and mCAT-1 signals was detected by confocal microscopy. This association was time dependent and paralleled the kinetics of cell-virus membrane fusion. Interestingly, unlike the canonical binding pattern seen for GRB2 and growth factor receptors, GRB2-mCAT-1 binding does not depend on the GRB2-SH2 domain-mediated recognition of tyrosine phosphorylation on the receptor. The inhibition of endogenous GRB2 led to a reduction in surface levels of mCAT-1, which was detected by immunoprecipitation and by a direct binding assay using a recombinant MLV envelope protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Consistent with this observation, the expression of a dominant negative GRB2 mutant (R86K) resulted in the sequestration of mCAT-1 from the cell surface into intracellular vesicles. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel role for GRB2 in ecotropic MLV entry and infection by facilitating mCAT-1 trafficking.","['Chen, Zeming', 'Kolokoltsov, Andrey A', 'Wang, Jia', 'Adhikary, Shramika', 'Lorinczi, Marta', 'Elferink, Lisa A', 'Davey, Robert A']","['Chen Z', 'Kolokoltsov AA', 'Wang J', 'Adhikary S', 'Lorinczi M', 'Elferink LA', 'Davey RA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI063513/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI063513-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111116,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism/*physiology', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'TRPV Cation Channels/*metabolism']",PMC3264351,2011/11/18 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05993-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05993-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Feb;86(3):1421-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05993-11.

During maturation the Gag polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved, yielding mature structural proteins, matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC), that reassemble into a mature viral particle. Proteolytic cleavage causes the N terminus of CA to fold back to form a beta-hairpin, anchored by an internal salt bridge between the N-terminal proline and the inner aspartate. Using an in vitro assembly system of capsid-nucleocapsid protein (CANC), we studied the formation of virus-like particles (VLP) of a gammaretrovirus, the xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus (XMRV). We show here that, unlike other retroviruses, XMRV CA and CANC do not assemble tubular particles characteristic of mature assembly. The prevention of beta-hairpin formation by the deletion of either the N-terminal proline or 10 initial amino acids enabled the assembly of DeltaProCANC or Delta10CANC into immature-like spherical particles. Detailed three-dimensional (3D) structural analysis of these particles revealed that below a disordered N-terminal CA layer, the C terminus of CA assembles a typical immature lattice, which is linked by rod-like densities with the RNP.","['Hadravova, Romana', 'de Marco, Alex', 'Ulbrich, Pavel', 'Stokrova, Jitka', 'Dolezal, Michal', 'Pichova, Iva', 'Ruml, Tomas', 'Briggs, John A G', 'Rumlova, Michaela']","['Hadravova R', 'de Marco A', 'Ulbrich P', 'Stokrova J', 'Dolezal M', 'Pichova I', 'Ruml T', 'Briggs JA', 'Rumlova M']","['Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., IOCB and Gilead Research Center, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA027834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA027834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111116,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA Primers', 'Escherichia coli/ultrastructure/virology', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteolysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Virion/*physiology', '*Virus Assembly']",PMC3264384,2011/11/18 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05564-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05564-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Feb;86(3):1297-306. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05564-11.

However, residual disease can be detected in the majority of patients treated with imatinib. Compensatory activation of MAP kinases (MAPK1/2) in response to BCR-ABL-inhibitors has been reported as a potential cytokine-dependent resistance mechanism leading to the rescue of leukemic progenitor cells. METHODS: Differential MAPK-modulating activity of clinically approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors was assessed in vitro using BCR-ABL-transformed cells. CD34+-enriched progenitors of newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia patients were exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. MAPK-signaling was studied by Western blot technique. Proliferation assays were used to analyze response to antileukemic treatment. RESULTS: The ABL-inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib activate MAPKs in CD34+ chronic myelogenous leukemia progenitor cells, whereas treatment with the SRC/ABL-inhibitor dasatinib does not affect MAPK-activation at clinically relevant concentrations. Similar results are seen in BCR-ABL-transformed cells in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3). Experiments using BCR-ABL-mutant T315I, a resistance mutation not amenable to tyrosine kinase inhibitor binding, demonstrate that ABL-inhibitor-induced MAPK-activation does not depend on BCR-ABL-inhibition and cannot be prevented by selective SRC-inhibition. However, BCR-ABL-T315I enhances MAPK-activation, suggesting a T315I-dependent positive feedback of MAPK-activation. An autocrine IL-3-loop as trigger for aberrant T315I-dependent MAPK-activation was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant MAPK-activation triggered by ABL-inhibitors and positively regulated by BCR-ABL kinase mutation T315I might be an experimental explanation for the clinical observation that patients carrying high-resistance mutations show a highly aggressive course of their disease when tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment is not discontinued in time.","['Hartel, Nicolai', 'Klag, Thomas', 'Hanfstein, Benjamin', 'Mueller, Martin C', 'Schenk, Thomas', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'La Rosee, Paul']","['Hartel N', 'Klag T', 'Hanfstein B', 'Mueller MC', 'Schenk T', 'Erben P', 'Hochhaus A', 'La Rosee P']","['III.

Cytogenetic analysis has proven to be a mandatory part of the diagnosis of MDS as well as a major indicator for predicting clinical course and outcome. Studies on cytogenetics of MDS are reported mostly from the West and only a few are available from Asian countries. We report herein cytogenetic studies on 40 Indian patients with primary MDS to find out the occurrence and type of chromosome abnormalities and recurring defects. METHODS: Cytogenetic analysis was done using GTG banding and karyotyped according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN). RESULTS: Of the 40 patients, 19 patients (47.5%) showed clonal karyotypic abnormalities with distribution as follows: 3 of 15 (20%) of refractory anaemia (RA), 4 of 7 (57%) of refractory anaemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1), 4 of 6 (67%) of refractory anaemia with excess blasts 2 (RAEB-2), 2 of 3 (67%) of refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), 2 of 4 (50%) of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), none (0%) RCMD-ringed sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) and 4 patients with 5q syndrome. The frequent abnormalities observed in our study were -7, 5q-and trisomy 8. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Two rare chromosomal abnormalities (6q-, 3q-) were found with unknown prognostic significance. Hence, cytogenetic analysis may be incorporated in the routine diagnosis of MDS since there are racial differences in clinical pictures and the molecular events.","['Chaubey, Rekha', 'Sazawal, Sudha', 'Dada, Rima', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Chaubey R', 'Sazawal S', 'Dada R', 'Mahapatra M', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/diagnosis/genetics', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/diagnosis/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Trisomy/diagnosis/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC3237242,2011/11/18 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['IndianJMedRes_2011_134_4_452_89865 [pii]'],ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2011 Oct;134:452-7.,,,"['Chromosome 8, trisomy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of a patient's DNA, as identified by STR analysis, may indicate residual or recurrent malignant disease or may represent normal hematopoiesis of patient origin. The ratio of patient-derived to donor-derived alleles is used to calculate the relative amount of patient cells (both benign and malignant) to donor cells. STRs on chromosomes known to be gained or lost in a patient's tumor are generally ignored because it is difficult to perform meaningful calculations of mixed chimerism. However, in this study, we present evidence that STR loci on gained or lost chromosomes are useful in distinguishing the benign or malignant nature of chimeric DNA. In the peripheral blood or bone marrow of 4 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients with leukemia or lymphoma, we identified tumor DNA on the basis of STR loci showing copy number alteration. We propose that a targeted evaluation of STR loci showing altered copy number in posttransplant chimerism analysis can provide evidence of residual cancer cells.","['Lin, Ming-Tseh', 'Tseng, Li-Hui', 'Beierl, Katie', 'Harada, Shuko', 'Hafez, Michael J', 'Eshleman, James R', 'Gocke, Christopher D']","['Lin MT', 'Tseng LH', 'Beierl K', 'Harada S', 'Hafez MJ', 'Eshleman JR', 'Gocke CD']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['R21 HG004315/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HG004315-02/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21HG004315/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/isolation & purification', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis']",PMC3219907,2011/11/18 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PDM.0b013e31821dac16 [doi]', '00019606-201112000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2011 Dec;20(4):194-202. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0b013e31821dac16.,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,['NIHMS293730'],,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, these models using human acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia cells as xenografts recapitulate many clinical features of the disease. Similar to the human environment (for example, in the bone marrow), transplanted leukemia cells in the murine setting are exposed to both favorable and unfavorable conditions for engraftment that may exert a distinct pressure for selection of subclones. Thus, results obtained in these models may vary depending on the experimental setup.

However, CML apparently can not be cured by BCR-ABL inhibitors alone, likely due to treatment-resistance of CML stem/progenitor cells, which provokes a relapse of disease after cessation of therapy. Evidence from patients treated with allogenic stem cell transplantation or IFN-alpha points to an important role of anti-tumor immunity for durable control of CML disease. Data from multiple in vitro and ex vivo studies indicate that BCR-ABL inhibitors may also influence anti-tumor immunity. Varying effects on different immune effector cell subsets and of the different compounds have been reported, the latter being due to their particular and diverse potency and spectrum of target kinases. As multiple approaches presently aim to combine BCR-ABL inhibition with immunotherapeutic strategies to improve disease control in CML, immunomodulatory effects of the available BCR-ABL inhibitors may be of direct clinical relevance. Here we review the available data regarding the effects of imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib on dendritic cells, T cells and natural killer cells as important cellular components of anti-tumor immunity.","['Krusch, M', 'Salih, H R']","['Krusch M', 'Salih HR']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Otfried-Mueller Str. 10, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",,2011/11/18 06:00,2012/06/29 06:00,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CMC/E-Pub/2011/384 [pii]', '10.2174/092986711798184271 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2011;18(34):5174-84. doi: 10.2174/092986711798184271.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed oligonucleotide-based comparative genomic hybridization microarray analysis on 34 samples with CLL and known abnormal karyotypes previously determined by cytogenetics and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: Using a custom designed microarray that targets >1800 genes involved in hematologic disease and other malignancies, we identified additional cryptic aberrations and novel findings in 59% of cases. These included gains and losses of genes associated with cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and susceptibility loci on 3p21.31, 5q35.2q35.3, 10q23.31q23.33, 11q22.3, and 22q11.23. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that microarray analysis will detect known aberrations, including microscopic and cryptic alterations. In addition, novel genomic changes will be uncovered that may become important prognostic predictors or treatment targets for CLL in the future.","['Kolquist, Kathryn A', 'Schultz, Roger A', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'McDaniel, Lisa D', 'Brown, Theresa C', 'Tubbs, Raymond R', 'Cook, James R', 'Theil, Karl S', 'Cawich, Victoria', 'Valentin, Caitlin', 'Minier, Sara', 'Neill, Nicholas J', 'Byerly, Steve', 'Morton, S Annie', 'Sahoo, Trilochan', 'Ballif, Blake C', 'Shaffer, Lisa G']","['Kolquist KA', 'Schultz RA', 'Slovak ML', 'McDaniel LD', 'Brown TC', 'Tubbs RR', 'Cook JR', 'Theil KS', 'Cawich V', 'Valentin C', 'Minier S', 'Neill NJ', 'Byerly S', 'Morton SA', 'Sahoo T', 'Ballif BC', 'Shaffer LG']","['Signature Genomic Laboratories, PerkinElmer Inc,, 2820 North Astor Street, Spokane, WA, 99207, USA. lisa.shaffer@perkinelmer.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111116,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,PMC3253687,2011/11/18 06:00,2011/11/18 06:01,['2011/11/18 06:00'],"['2011/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/18 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-4-25 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-4-25 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2011 Nov 16;4:25. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-4-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These endogenous clastogens, formed as a consequence of increased superoxide production by inflammatory cells, can be detected with cytogenetic methods, as they are used for exogenous clastogens. The long-lived, autosustained DNA-damaging effects of CFs are risk factors for the development of cancer and leukemia. In hepatitis C, the highest clastogenic scores has been observed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In agreement with the link to inflammation, clastogenic score are correlated with necro-inflammatory scores in liver biopsies. Antioxidant therapy with a powerful superoxide scavenger resulted in normalization of clastogenic scores and significant decreases in aminotransferase levels, but did not influence the virus load. Preliminary results of our study on a limited number of patients suggest that pre-treatment with antioxidants may improve the outcome of interferon/ribavirin treatment. A comparison of a three-month treatment with either interferon alone or the antioxidant alone, yielded similar results for reduction of ALT levels, but only complete normalization of clastogenic scores for the antioxidant. Further studies have to be conducted to see whether a combination of an antiviral agent with an appropriate antioxidant would allow to reduce interferon and its side effects.Combination of antioxidants with IFN/RIBA was also reported by other authors with discordant results.

EpK contains an N-terminal cysteine residue, a low-density lipoprotein receptor-binding fragment, a 6 x lysine linker and a lipid-binding fragment. The recombinant peptide was expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified with a chitin bead column followed by a Heparin Sepharose CL-6B column to yield pure peptide. EpK displayed high solubility in aqueous solution at neutral pH and adopted a low content of alpha-helical structure which was significantly increased in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol or upon lipid binding. EpK retained similar 1,2-dimyristoyl(d54)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine binding activity as human apoE3 albeit with slower kinetics. Cell culture studies showed that EpK mediated cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded primary murine macrophages with higher mass-based efficiency than human apoAI and human apoE3, and that EpK inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in murine macrophages. When injected into apoE(-/-)mice, EpK predominantly associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which was also shown in in vitro incubation experiments. Moreover, association of EpK with HDL enhanced the ability of HDL in mediating cholesterol efflux and suppressing LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in cholesterol-loaded human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) macrophages. These data suggest that this novel recombinant apoE mimetic peptide enhances HDL function and harbors antiatherogenic potential.","['Zhao, Wentao', 'Du, Fen', 'Zhang, Michelle', 'Sun, Shengfang', 'Yu, Hong', 'Fan, Daping']","['Zhao W', 'Du F', 'Zhang M', 'Sun S', 'Yu H', 'Fan D']","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, School of Medicine, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29209, USA.']",['eng'],"['P20 RR-016434/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR-016461/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111115,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,IM,"['Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Atherosclerosis/prevention & control', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ebm.2011.011169 [pii]', '10.1258/ebm.2011.011169 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2011 Dec;236(12):1468-76. doi: 10.1258/ebm.2011.011169.

However, many cancers remain resistant to TRAIL. To overcome TRAIL resistance, combination therapies using sensitizers of the TRAIL pathway would be an efficacious approach. To investigate potential sensitizers of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we used TRAIL-resistant human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells as a model system. So far, HTLV-1-associated ATL is incurable by presently known therapies. Here, we show that wogonin and the structurally related natural flavones apigenin and chrysin break TRAIL resistance in HTLV-1-associated ATL by transcriptional down-regulation of c-FLIP, a key inhibitor of death receptor signaling, and by up-regulation of TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2). This effect is mediated through transcriptional inhibition of the p53 antagonist murine double minute 2 (Mdm2), leading to an increase in p53 levels and, consequently, to up-regulation of the p53 target gene TRAIL-R2. We also show that these flavones can sensitize to TNFalpha- and CD95-mediated cell death. Furthermore, we show that wogonin, apigenin, and chrysin also enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in other human cancer cell lines including breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, colon cancer cell line HT-29, hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, melanoma cell line SK-MEL-37, and pancreatic carcinoma cell line Capan-1 by the same mechanism. Thus, our study suggests the potential use of these flavones as an adjuvant for TRAIL-mediated anticancer therapy.","['Ding, Jie', 'Polier, Gernot', 'Kohler, Rebecca', 'Giaisi, Marco', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Li-Weber, Min']","['Ding J', 'Polier G', 'Kohler R', 'Giaisi M', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.

DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on bone marrow morphology. The presence of fibrosis, JAK2/MPL mutation or +9/13q- cytogenetic abnormality is supportive but not essential for diagnosis. Prefibrotic PMF mimics essential thrombocythemia in its presentation and the distinction is prognostically relevant. Differential diagnosis of myelofibrosis should include chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. RISK STRATIFICATION: The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System-plus (DIPSS-plus) prognostic model for PMF can be applied at any point during the disease course and uses eight independent predictors of inferior survival: age >65 years, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, leukocytes >25 x 10(9) /L, circulating blasts >/=1%, constitutional symptoms, red cell transfusion dependency, platelet count <100 x 10(9) /L, and unfavorable karyotype (i.e., complex karyotype or sole or two abnormalities that include +8, -7/7q-, i(17q), inv(3), -5/5q-, 12p- or 11q23 rearrangement). The presence of 0, 1, ""2 or 3,"" and >/=4 adverse factors defines low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk disease with median survivals of ~15.4, 6.5, 2.9, and 1.3 years, respectively. A >80% two-year mortality is predicted by monosomal karyotype, inv(3)/i(17q) abnormalities, or any two of circulating blasts >9%, leukocytes >/=40 x 10(9) /L or other unfavorable karyotype. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Observation alone is adequate for asymptomatic low/intermediate-1 risk disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation or experimental drug therapy is considered for intermediate-2/ high risk disease. Conventional or experimental drug therapy is reasonable for symptomatic intermediate-1 risk disease. Splenectomy and low-dose radiotherapy are used for drug-refractory splenomegaly. Radiotherapy is also used for the treatment of non-hepatosplenic EMH, PMF-associated pulmonary hypertension, and extremity bone pain.","['Tefferi, Ayalew']",['Tefferi A'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/genetics/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.22210 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2011 Dec;86(12):1017-26. doi: 10.1002/ajh.22210.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the clinical and prognostic relevance of low plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). A total of 409 patients were studied: 247 (60%) with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 74 (18%) with de novo MDS, 63 (15%) with polycythemia vera (PV), and 25 (6%) with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Plasma 25(OH)D levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; a level lower than 25 ng/mL indicated vitamin D insufficiency and a level lower than 10 ng/mL indicated severe deficiency. The proportion of patients with 25(OH)D insufficiency was significantly greater in PMF (48%) and PV (43%) when compared with ET (28%) and MDS (28%) (P = 0.01). Severe 25(OH)D deficiency was significantly more frequent in ET (12%) and PMF (9%), compared with PV (3%) and MDS (1%) (P = 0.05). There were no significant correlations between 25(OH)D insufficiency, or severe deficiency, and a variety of clinical or laboratory variables in PMF, MDS, or PV. Furthermore, Vitamin D insufficiency did not influence either overall or leukemia-free survival in PMF, MDS, or PV (P > 0.05). We conclude that while hypovitaminosis D is relatively common in MPN and MDS, its clinical relevance for prognosis is limited.","['Pardanani, Animesh', 'Drake, Matthew T', 'Finke, Christy', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Rozell, Shaina A', 'Jimma, Thitina', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Pardanani A', 'Drake MT', 'Finke C', 'Lasho TL', 'Rozell SA', 'Jimma T', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. pardanani.animesh@mayo.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2/blood', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Calcifediol/blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*diagnosis/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*diagnosis/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.22181 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2011 Dec;86(12):1013-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.22181.,,,"['21343-40-8 (25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2)', 'P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it has been reported that JHDM1B is highly expressed in various human tumors, including leukemias. However, it is not clearly understood how JHDM1B contributes to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the cellular and molecular function of JHDM1B in AML cells. In AML cell lines and AML-derived ALDH(hi) (high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity)/CD34(+) cells, the levels of JHDM1B mRNA were significantly higher than in normal ALDH(hi) /CD34(+) cells. Reduction of JHDM1B expression in AML cells inhibited cell proliferation compared to control cells, through induction of G1 cell cycle arrest, an increase in the p15(Ink4b) mRNA and protein expression. JHDM1B mRNA was overexpressed in all 133 AML clinical specimens tested (n = 22, 57, 34, and 20 for M1, 2, 4, and 5 subtypes respectively). Compared to normal ALDH(hi) /CD34(+) cells, JHDM1B gene expression was 1.57- to 1.87-fold higher in AML-derived ALDH(hi) /CD34(+) cells. Moreover, the JHDM1B protein was more strongly expressed in AML-derived ALDH(hi) /CD34(+) cells from compared to normal ALDH(hi) /CD34(+) cells. In addition, depletion of JHDM1B reduced colony formation of AML-derived ALDH(hi) /CD34(+) cells due to induction of p15(Ink4b) expression through direct binding to p15(Ink4b) promoter and loss of demethylation of H3K36me2. In summary, we found that JHDM1B mRNA is predominantly expressed in AML-derived ALDH(hi) /CD34(+) cells, and that aberrant expression of JHDM1B induces AML cell proliferation through modulation of cell cycle progression. Thus, inhibition of JHDM1B expression represents an attractive target for AML therapy.","['Nakamura, Satoki', 'Tan, Lin', 'Nagata, Yasuyuki', 'Takemura, Tomonari', 'Asahina, Aya', 'Yokota, Daisuke', 'Yagyu, Tomohiro', 'Shibata, Kiyoshi', 'Fujisawa, Shinya', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori']","['Nakamura S', 'Tan L', 'Nagata Y', 'Takemura T', 'Asahina A', 'Yokota D', 'Yagyu T', 'Shibata K', 'Fujisawa S', 'Ohnishi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111115,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2013/02/23 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.20878 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2013 Jan;52(1):57-69. doi: 10.1002/mc.20878.

During the latter part of the treatment, the maintenance therapy, the patients receive oral doses of two cytostatics.

In 1992-1996, the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) conducted a randomised study (NOPHO-ALL-92) to investigate the effect of a new and more sophisticated dynamic treatment strategy. Unexpectedly, the new strategy worsened the outcome for the girls, whereas there were no treatment differences for the boys. There are as yet no general guidelines for optimising the treatment. On basis of the data from this study, our goal is to formulate an alternative dosing strategy. We use recently developed methods proposed by van der Laan et al. to obtain statistical models that may be used in the guidance of how the physicians should assign the doses to the patients to obtain the target of the treatment. We present a possible strategy and discuss the reliability of this strategy.

For comparative purposes, the sensitivity of leukemic cells obtained from the same CLL patients to conventional purine analogs and the selective CDK inhibitor R-roscovitine (ROSC) was determined, with and without the addition of an alkylating agent, prior to the onset of in vivo therapy. The kinetics and rate of spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis of CLL cells under ex vivo conditions differed significantly between patients, mirroring the variability observed during in vivo treatment. Interestingly, individual patients' leukemic cells were comparably sensitive to the drugs under both conditions. Of the drugs examined, ROSC exerted the highest therapeutic efficacy under ex vivo conditions. Our results indicate that ex vivo testing might be useful for identifying the most potent first-line therapeutic regimen for specific CLL patients and possibly for the design of therapies tailored for individual CLL patients.","['Zolnierczyk, Jolanta D', 'Komina, Oxana', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Borowiak, Arleta', 'Cebula-Obrzut, Barbara', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robak, Pawel', 'Kilianska, Zofia M', 'Wesierska-Gadek, Jozefa']","['Zolnierczyk JD', 'Komina O', 'Blonski JZ', 'Borowiak A', 'Cebula-Obrzut B', 'Smolewski P', 'Robak P', 'Kilianska ZM', 'Wesierska-Gadek J']","['Department of Cytobiochemistry, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111116,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Roscovitine', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0105-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):2111-26. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0105-8.

Recently, deregulation of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) has been linked to several types of cancer. Monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ) is a member of the MYST family of HATs, which regulate gene expression in cell proliferation and differentiation. Deregulation of these processes through constitutively active MOZ fusion proteins gives rise to the formation of leukemic stem cells, rendering MOZ an excellent target for treating myeloid leukemia. The authors implemented a hit discovery campaign to identify small-molecule inhibitors of MOZ-HAT activity. They developed a robust, homogeneous assay measuring the acetylation of synthetic histone peptides. In a primary screening campaign testing 243 000 lead-like compounds, they identified inhibitors from several chemical classes. Secondary assays were used to eliminate assay-interfering compounds and prioritize confirmed hits.

We previously reported that occupational exposures near the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit (8 hr) of 1 ppm was associated with sperm aneuploidy. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether occupational exposures near 1 ppm increase the incidence of sperm carrying structural chromosomal aberrations. METHODS: We applied a sperm fluorescence in situ hybridization assay to measure frequencies of sperm carrying partial chromosomal duplications or deletions of 1cen or 1p36.3 or breaks within 1cen-1q12 among 30 benzene-exposed and 11 unexposed workers in Tianjin, China, as part of the China Benzene and Sperm Study (C-BASS). Exposed workers were categorized into low-, moderate-, and high-exposure groups based on urinary benzene (medians: 2.9, 11.0, and 110.6 microg/L, respectively). Median air benzene concentrations in the three exposure groups were 1.2, 3.7, and 8.4 ppm, respectively. RESULTS: Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all structural aberrations combined were 1.42 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.83), 1.44 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.85), and 1.75 (95% CI: 1.36, 2.24) and for deletion of 1p36.3 alone were 4.31 (95% CI: 1.18, 15.78), 6.02 (95% CI: 1.69, 21.39), and 7.88 (95% CI: 2.21, 28.05) for men with low, moderate, and high exposure, respectively, compared with unexposed men. Chromosome breaks were significantly increased in the high-exposure group [IRR 1.49 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.02)]. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposures to benzene were associated with increased incidence of chromosomally defective sperm, raising concerns for worker infertility and spontaneous abortions as well as mental retardation and inherited defects in their children. Our sperm findings point to benzene as a possible risk factor for de novo 1p36 deletion syndrome. Because chromosomal aberrations in sperm can arise from defective stem cells/spermatogonia, our findings raise concerns that occupational exposure to benzene may have persistent reproductive effects in formerly exposed workers.","['Marchetti, Francesco', 'Eskenazi, Brenda', 'Weldon, Rosana H', 'Li, Guilan', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Rappaport, Stephen M', 'Schmid, Thomas E', 'Xing, Caihong', 'Kurtovich, Elaine', 'Wyrobek, Andrew J']","['Marchetti F', 'Eskenazi B', 'Weldon RH', 'Li G', 'Zhang L', 'Rappaport SM', 'Schmid TE', 'Xing C', 'Kurtovich E', 'Wyrobek AJ']","['Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['R03 ES015340/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 ES015340-02/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'IAG Y01-ES-8016-5/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111115,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/analysis/standards/*toxicity', 'China', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Pollutants/standards/*toxicity/urine', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Sorbic Acid/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Spermatozoa/*drug effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC3279447,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1103921 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2012 Feb;120(2):229-34. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1103921.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) represent a class of agents that can modulate gene expression to reduce tumor growth, and we and others have noted some antiglioma activity from HDACIs, such as vorinostat, although insufficient to warrant use as monotherapy. We have recently demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, dramatically sensitized highly resistant glioma cells to apoptosis induction, suggesting that proteasomal inhibition may be a promising combination strategy for glioma therapeutics. In this study, we examined whether bortezomib could enhance response to HDAC inhibition in glioma cells. Although primary cells from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients and established glioma cell lines did not show significant induction of apoptosis with vorinostat treatment alone, the combination of vorinostat plus bortezomib significantly enhanced apoptosis. The enhanced efficacy was due to proapoptotic mitochondrial injury and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Our results also revealed that combination of bortezomib with vorinostat enhanced apoptosis by increasing Mcl-1 cleavage, Noxa upregulation, Bak and Bax activation, and cytochrome c release. Further downregulation of Mcl-1 using shRNA enhanced cell killing by the bortezomib/vorinostat combination. Vorinostat induced a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of histone H2AX in primary GBM and T98G cells, and this effect was significantly enhanced by co-administration of bortezomib. Vorinostat/bortezomib combination also induced Rad51 downregulation, which plays an important role in the synergistic enhancement of DNA damage and apoptosis. The significantly enhanced antitumor activity that results from the combination of bortezomib and HDACIs offers promise as a novel treatment for glioma patients.","['Premkumar, Daniel R', 'Jane, Esther P', 'Agostino, Naomi R', 'DiDomenico, Joseph D', 'Pollack, Ian F']","['Premkumar DR', 'Jane EP', 'Agostino NR', 'DiDomenico JD', 'Pollack IF']","[""Department of Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15223, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P01 NS040923/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01NS40923/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111115,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Glioma/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vorinostat', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC4068609,2011/11/17 06:00,2013/04/16 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.21835 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2013 Feb;52(2):118-33. doi: 10.1002/mc.21835.

We assessed AL incidence rates (IRs), IR ratios (IRRs), and relative survival in the United States (2001-2007) in one of the first population-based, comprehensive assessments. Most subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/L) predominated among males, from twice higher incidence of T-cell ALL/L among males than among females (IRR = 2.20) to nearly equal IRs of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; IRR = 1.08). Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics had significantly higher incidence of B-cell ALL/L (IRR = 1.64) and APL (IRR = 1.28); blacks had lower IRs of nearly all AL subtypes. All ALL/L but only some AML subtypes were associated with a bimodal age pattern. Among AML subtypes, survival was highest for APL and AML with inv(16). B-cell ALL/L had more favorable survival than T-cell ALL/L among the young; the converse occurred at older ages. Limitations of cancer registry data must be acknowledged, but the distinct AL incidence and survival patterns based on the World Health Organization classification support biologic diversity that should facilitate etiologic discovery, prognostication, and treatment advances.","['Dores, Graca M', 'Devesa, Susan S', 'Curtis, Rochelle E', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Morton, Lindsay M']","['Dores GM', 'Devesa SS', 'Curtis RE', 'Linet MS', 'Morton LM']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA. doresg@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111115,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3251235,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38534-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-347872 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 5;119(1):34-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-347872.

Signaling via the B-cell receptor is thought to activate proliferation and survival pathways in CLL cells and also has been linked to poor outcome. Here, we have analyzed the expression of the proto-oncoprotein MYC, an essential positive regulator of the cell cycle, after stimulation of surface IgM (sIgM). MYC expression was rapidly increased after sIgM stimulation in a subset of CLL samples. The ability of sIgM stimulation to increase MYC expression was correlated with sIgM-induced intracellular calcium fluxes. MYC induction was partially dependent on the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and MYC and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were both expressed within proliferation centers in vivo. Although stimulation of sIgD also resulted in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, responses were relatively short lived compared with sIgM and were associated with significantly reduced MYC induction, suggesting that the kinetics of ERK1/2 activation is a critical determinant of MYC induction. Our results suggest that ERK1/2-dependent induction of MYC is likely to play an important role in antigen-induced CLL cell proliferation.","['Krysov, Sergey', 'Dias, Samantha', 'Paterson, Alex', 'Mockridge, C Ian', 'Potter, Kathleen N', 'Smith, Kelly-Ann', 'Ashton-Key, Margaret', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Packham, Graham']","['Krysov S', 'Dias S', 'Paterson A', 'Mockridge CI', 'Potter KN', 'Smith KA', 'Ashton-Key M', 'Stevenson FK', 'Packham G']","['Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom. s.krysov@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111115,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin M/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38549-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-370403 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 5;119(1):170-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-370403.

Recent observations suggest that alterations in BMPs and BMP signaling are associated with tumorigenesis and disease progression in various types of malignancies. This study investigated the methylation status of the BMP6 gene promoter in various types of plasma cell proliferative disorders by combined bisulfite restriction analysis. While BMP6 methylation was not detected in any samples from monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance, intramedullary multiple myeloma (MM), plasma cell leukemia or solitary plasmacytoma, both case studies and cell line studies showed that multiple extramedullary plasmacytoma (MEP) consistently carried a methylated BMP6 promoter. The BMP6 methylation-positive MEP was an aggressive form of MM with extremely high levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Bisulfite sequencing analysis confirmed intensive methylation at CpG sites of the BMP6 promoter region. The methylation of BMP6 was correlated with decreased levels of mRNA transcripts. Expression of BMP6 was restored by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, suggesting that the methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing. Our study implied that BMP6 promoter methylation is not a common event in MMs, but occurs in aggressive MEP.

Several studies have showed OCT4 expression in human solid tumor and adult stem or progenitor cells. However, whether OCT4 is expressed in normal hematopoietic system including the peripheral blood and bone marrow remains controversial. Furthermore, the functional expression of OCT4 in leukemia cells and its potential significance in leukemia studies have been poorly defined. The aim of this study was to examine and analyze the genuine expression of OCT4 in human leukemia cells by means of RT-PCR, flow cytometry, PCR product sequencing and alignment with NCBI BLAST and DNAMAN software. The full lengths of the putative OCT4 genes were amplified in 2/9 leukemia cell lines and 7/49 leukemia patients' samples. However, many base mutations in putative OCT4 positive samples were found. Sequence alignment analysis showed a higher similarity between the putative OCT4 PCR products and the pseudogenes in chromosomes 1 and 8. The positive rates of OCT4 protein detected with flow cytometry were low, and almost all of them were less than 10% of positivity. A very small fraction of leukemia stem cells with OCT4 protein expression was found. We conclude that OCT4 pseudogenes in chromosomes 1 and 8 present in the panel of leukemia cells tested and the OCT4 protein is rarely detected with flow cytometry in leukemia cells.","['Guo, Xiaoping', 'Tang, Yongmin']","['Guo X', 'Tang Y']","[""Division of Hematology-oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China. lovelyappleguo@163.com""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111116,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*genetics', '*Pseudogenes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10238-011-0163-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2012 Dec;12(4):207-16. doi: 10.1007/s10238-011-0163-4.

In this phase I study, we vaccinated 15 asymptomatic CLL patients at five time points with Apo-DC administered intradermally either alone (cohort I), or in combination with subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) (cohort II) or with GM-CSF and intravenous low-dose cyclophosphamide (cohort III). Aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Apo-DC alone or in combination with GM-CSF and low-dose cyclophosphamide in CLL patients. All patients completed the vaccination schedule without dose-limiting toxicity. No objective clinical responses were seen. Vaccine-induced leukemia-specific immune responses were evaluated by IFN-gamma ELISpot and proliferation assays over a 52 weeks observation period and immune response criteria were defined. According to these criteria, 10/15 patients were defined as immune responders. The frequency of immune-responding patients was higher in cohorts II (3/5) and III (5/5) than in cohort I (2/5). In order to further characterize the induced immune response, estimation of secreted cytokines and CD107-degranulation assay were performed. Clustering of T and CLL cells was observed in CD107-degranulation assay and visualized by confocal microscopy. Additionally, assessment of regulatory T cells (T(regs)) revealed their significantly lower frequencies in immune responders versus non-responders (P < 0.0001). Cyclophosphamide did not reduce T(regs) frequency. In conclusion, vaccination with Apo-DC + GM-CSF and cyclophosphamide was safe and elicited anti-CLL immune responses that correlated inversely with T(regs) levels. Lack of clinical responses highlights the necessity to develop more potent vaccine strategies in B cell malignancies.","['Palma, Marzia', 'Hansson, Lotta', 'Choudhury, Aniruddha', 'Nasman-Glaser, Barbro', 'Eriksson, Ingrid', 'Adamson, Lars', 'Rossmann, Eva', 'Widen, Karin', 'Horvath, Rudolf', 'Kokhaei, Parviz', 'Vertuani, Simona', 'Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Osterborg, Anders']","['Palma M', 'Hansson L', 'Choudhury A', 'Nasman-Glaser B', 'Eriksson I', 'Adamson L', 'Rossmann E', 'Widen K', 'Horvath R', 'Kokhaei P', 'Vertuani S', 'Mellstedt H', 'Osterborg A']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Cancer Centre Karolinska, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111116,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['*Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/immunology/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Vaccination']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/08/21 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-1149-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2012 Jun;61(6):865-79. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-1149-5.

Among the metabolites R-amphetamine has retained the adhesion inducer and the chemorepellent effect of the parent drug on the most significant level. In contrast, a reversed chemotactic effect and an improved cytotoxic character were detected in the presence of fluoro group (p-fluoro-S-deprenyl).

This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of heat inactivation of FCS and LPS contamination on the human T lymphoblast proteome. Human T lymphoblastic leukaemia (CCRF-CEM) cells were grown in FCS, either non-heated, or heat inactivated, having low (< 1 EU/mL) or regular (< 30 EU/mL) LPS concentrations. Protein lysates were resolved by 2-DE followed by phospho-specific and silver nitrate staining. Differentially regulated spots were identified by nano LC ESI Q-TOF MS/MS analysis. RESULTS: A total of four proteins (EIF3M, PRS7, PSB4, and SNAPA) were up-regulated when CCRF-CEM cells were grown in media supplemented with heat inactivated FCS (HE) as compared to cells grown in media with non-heated FCS (NHE). Six proteins (TCPD, ACTA, NACA, TCTP, ACTB, and ICLN) displayed a differential phosphorylation pattern between the NHE and HE groups. Compared to the low concentration LPS group, regular levels of LPS resulted in the up-regulation of three proteins (SYBF, QCR1, and SUCB1). CONCLUSION: The present study provides new information regarding the effect of FCS heat inactivation and change in FCS-LPS concentration on cellular protein expression, and post-translational modification in human T lymphoblasts. Both heat inactivation and LPS contamination of FCS were shown to modulate the expression and phosphorylation of proteins involved in basic cellular functions, such as protein synthesis, cytoskeleton stability, oxidative stress regulation and apoptosis. Hence, the study emphasizes the need to consider both heat inactivation and LPS contamination of FCS as factors that can influence the T lymphoblast proteome.","['Rahman, Hazir', 'Qasim, Muhammad', 'Schultze, Frank C', 'Oellerich, Michael', 'R Asif, Abdul']","['Rahman H', 'Qasim M', 'Schultze FC', 'Oellerich M', 'R Asif A']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Centre, Goettingen, Germany. asif@med.uni-goettingen.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111115,England,Proteome Sci,Proteome science,101170539,,,PMC3280938,2011/11/17 06:00,2011/11/17 06:01,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/17 06:01 [medline]']","['1477-5956-9-71 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-5956-9-71 [doi]']",epublish,Proteome Sci. 2011 Nov 15;9(1):71. doi: 10.1186/1477-5956-9-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urine is potentially a rich source of volatile organic metabolites (VOMs) that can be used as potential cancer biomarkers. Our aim was to develop a generally reliable, rapid, sensitive, and robust analytical method for screening large numbers of urine samples, resulting in a broad spectrum of native VOMs, as a tool to evaluate the potential of these metabolites in the early diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: To investigate urinary volatile metabolites as potential cancer biomarkers, urine samples from 33 cancer patients (oncological group: 14 leukaemia, 12 colorectal and 7 lymphoma) and 21 healthy (control group, cancer-free) individuals were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. Dynamic solid-phase microextraction in headspace mode (dHS-SPME) using a carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) sorbent in combination with GC-qMS-based metabolomics was applied to isolate and identify the volatile metabolites. This method provides a potential non-invasive method for early cancer diagnosis as a first approach. To fulfil this objective, three important dHS-SPME experimental parameters that influence extraction efficiency (fibre coating, extraction time and temperature of sampling) were optimised using a univariate optimisation design. The highest extraction efficiency was obtained when sampling was performed at 50 degrees C for 60 min using samples with high ionic strengths (17% sodium chloride, w v(-1)) and under agitation. RESULTS: A total of 82 volatile metabolites belonging to distinct chemical classes were identified in the control and oncological groups. Benzene derivatives, terpenoids and phenols were the most common classes for the oncological group, whereas ketones and sulphur compounds were the main classes that were isolated from the urine headspace of healthy subjects. The results demonstrate that compound concentrations were dramatically different between cancer patients and healthy volunteers. The positive rates of 16 patients among the 82 identified were found to be statistically different (P<0.05). A significant increase in the peak area of 2-methyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, p-cymene, anisole, 4-methyl-phenol and 1,2-dihydro-1,1,6-trimethyl-naphthalene in cancer patients was observed. On average, statistically significant lower abundances of dimethyl disulphide were found in cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gas chromatographic peak areas were submitted to multivariate analysis (principal component analysis and supervised linear discriminant analysis) to visualise clusters within cases and to detect the volatile metabolites that are able to differentiate cancer patients from healthy individuals. Very good discrimination within cancer groups and between cancer and control groups was achieved.","['Silva, C L', 'Passos, M', 'Camara, J S']","['Silva CL', 'Passos M', 'Camara JS']","['Centro de Quimica da Madeira, Centro de Ciencias Exactas e da Engenharia, Universidade da Madeira, Campus Universitario da Penteada, Funchal, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111115,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*urine', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Limit of Detection', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*urine', 'Volatile Organic Compounds/*urine']",PMC3251876,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2011437 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.437 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2011 Dec 6;105(12):1894-904. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.437.

Limited data are available evaluating toxicity of antihormonal treatments in male breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed male breast cancer patients evaluated at our institution (1999-2009). Of 126 patients, 64 met the following inclusion criteria: stage I-III, treated with tamoxifen, at least one follow-up visit after starting tamoxifen. A descriptive analysis of toxic effects was carried out on these 64 patients. RESULTS: Median follow-up from start of tamoxifen therapy was 3.9 years (range 0.3-19.4 years). Median age at diagnosis was 61 years (range 30-79 years). Breakdown by stage: 29.7% (n = 19) stage I, 54.7% (n = 35) stage II, and 15.6% (n = 10) stage III. Thirty-four (53%) patients experienced one or more toxicity while taking tamoxifen. Most common toxic effects are weight gain (14 patients, 22%) and sexual dysfunction (14 patients, 22%). Thirteen (20.3%) patients discontinued tamoxifen due to toxicity: one ocular, one leg cramps, two neurocognitive deficits, two bone pain, three sexual dysfunction, and four thromboembolic events.

We first examined the expression of PRC1 genes during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated differentiation of human HL-60 cells, and identified PCGF2 as a gene down-regulated by ATRA in a time-dependent manner. Upon gene silencing of PCGF2 with lentiviral short hairpin RNA, granulocytic differentiation was induced as assessed by differentiation marker gene expression, nitroblue tetrazolium staining, Wright-Giemsa staining, and cell cycle analysis. We next identified HOXA7 as a homeobox gene up-regulated by ATRA and successfully induced granulocytic differentiation by overexpression of HOXA7. We next tested the relationship between PCGF2 and HOXA7 by quantifying the changes in HOXA7 and PCGF2 expression upon PCGF2 gene silencing and HOXA7 overexpression, respectively. HOXA7 expression was up-regulated by PCGF2 gene silencing, while PCGF2 expression remained unchanged by ectopic HOXA7 expression, suggesting PCGF2 as acting upstream of HOXA7. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed with HOXA7 chromatin. We observed gene-specific reduction in direct binding of Pcgf2 protein to HOXA7 chromatin upon PCGF2 gene silencing. Taken together, these results support the notion that down-regulation of PCGF2 is sufficient to induce granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells via de-repression of HOXA7 gene expression. In conclusion, we report that PCGF2, a PRC1 gene, played a negative role in the granulocytic differentiation of human APL cells.","['Jo, Sungsin', 'Lee, Hongki', 'Kim, Sojin', 'Hwang, Eun Mi', 'Park, Jae-Yong', 'Kang, Sang Soo', 'Chung, Heekyoung']","['Jo S', 'Lee H', 'Kim S', 'Hwang EM', 'Park JY', 'Kang SS', 'Chung H']","['Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Bioengineering, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Seongdong-gu, Seoul 133-791, Republic of Korea. joejo0517@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111109,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/01/28 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)01986-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.152 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Dec 9;416(1-2):86-91. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.152.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate BIRC6 gene expression in childhood acute leukemia in relation to clinicopathological characteristics at presentation, therapeutic response, and prognosis. METHODS: BIRC6 expression level was assessed in 75 children with acute leukemia; 30 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 45 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The median level of BIRC6 expression did not differ significantly between AML and ALL patients. BIRC6 expression level was higher in patients with AML and ALL with extramedullary involvement, white blood cell (WBC) count >/= 10 x 10(9) /L, and unfavorable cytogenetics at diagnosis. BIRC6 gene expression was higher in patients with unfavorable response to therapy at day 14, those who developed relapse or died in both leukemic groups. The best cutoff value of BIRC6 to predict therapeutic response and disease outcome was determined. AML and ALL patients with BIRC6 overexpression had significantly shorter overall and disease free survivals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to study BIRC6 gene in pediatric ALL. Our results suggested that BIRC6 gene expression could be considered as an adverse risk factor in childhood acute leukemia and, hence, could be used to guide therapeutic regimens.","['Ismail, Eman Abdel Rahman', 'Mahmoud, Hanan Mohamed', 'Tawfik, Lamis Mohamed', 'Habashy, Deena Mohamed', 'Adly, Amira Abdel Moneam', 'El-Sherif, Nayera Hazaa', 'Abdelwahab, Mahmoud Ahmed']","['Ismail EA', 'Mahmoud HM', 'Tawfik LM', 'Habashy DM', 'Adly AA', 'El-Sherif NH', 'Abdelwahab MA']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20120104,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01734.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Feb;88(2):118-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01734.x.

Interactions between transplanted cells and host tissue remain poorly understood. Trophic factor secretion is postulated a primary or supplementary mechanism of action for many transplanted cells, however, there is little direct evidence to support trophin production by transplanted cells in situ. In the present study, trophic factor expression was characterized in uninjured, injured-untreated, injured-treated with transplanted cells, and corresponding control tissue from the adult rat spinal cord. Candidate trophic factors were identified in a literature search, and primers were designed for these genes. We examined in vivo trophin expression in 3 paradigms involving transplantation of either brain or spinal cord-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Injury without further treatment led to a significant elevation of nerve growth factor (NGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and lower expression of vascular endothelial growth factor isoform A (VEGF-A) and platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A). Transplantation of NPCs led to modest changes in trophin expression, and the co-administration of intrathecal trophins resulted in significant elevation of the neurotrophins, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), LIF, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). BMSCs transplantation upregulated NGF, LIF, and IGF-1. NPCs isolated after transplantation into the injured spinal cord expressed the neurotrophins, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and bFGF at higher levels than host cord. These data show that trophin expression in the spinal cord is influenced by injury and cell transplantation, particularly when combined with intrathecal trophin infusion. Trophins may contribute to the benefits associated with cell-based repair strategies for spinal cord injury.","['Hawryluk, Gregory W J', 'Mothe, Andrea', 'Wang, Jian', 'Wang, Shelly', 'Tator, Charles', 'Fehlings, Michael G']","['Hawryluk GW', 'Mothe A', 'Wang J', 'Wang S', 'Tator C', 'Fehlings MG']","['Division of Genetics and Development, Krembil Neuroscience Center, Toronto Western Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120207,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cervical Vertebrae/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Transgenic', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Spinal Cord/metabolism', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*therapy', 'Thoracic Vertebrae/pathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3411361,2011/11/17 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2011/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2011.0596 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2012 Aug 10;21(12):2222-38. doi: 10.1089/scd.2011.0596.

In the human, the activating receptor CD94/NKG2C associates with DAP12 by an ionic bond between oppositely charged residues within the transmembrane regions of NKG2C and DAP12. The lysine residue responsible for DAP12 association is absent in rat and mouse NKG2C and -E, raising questions about signaling mechanisms in these species. As a possible substitute, rat and mouse NKG2C and -E contain an arginine residue in the transition between the transmembrane and stalk regions. In this article, we demonstrate that, similar to their human orthologs, NKG2A inhibits, whereas NKG2C activates, rat NK cells. Redirected lysis assays using NK cells transfected with a mutated NKG2C construct indicated that the activating function of CD94/NKG2C did not depend on the transmembrane/stalk region arginine residue. Flow cytometry and biochemical analysis demonstrated that both DAP12 and DAP10 can associate with rat CD94/NKG2C. Surprisingly, DAP12 and DAP10 did not associate with NKG2C but instead with CD94. These associations depended on a transmembrane lysine residue in CD94 that is unique to rodents. Thus, in the mouse and rat, the ability to bind activating adaptor proteins has been transferred from NKG2C/E to the CD94 chain as a result of mutation events in both chains. Remarkable from a phylogenetic perspective, this sheds new light on the evolution and function of the CD94/NKG2 receptor family.","['Saether, Per C', 'Hoelsbrekken, Sigurd E', 'Fossum, Sigbjorn', 'Dissen, Erik']","['Saether PC', 'Hoelsbrekken SE', 'Fossum S', 'Dissen E']","['Department of Anatomy, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway. p.c.sather@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111114,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arginine/chemistry/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388', 'Lysine/chemistry/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/genetics/*metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism']",,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1102345 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1102345 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Dec 15;187(12):6365-73. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1102345.

NK-sensitive tumor cells provide both priming and triggering signals. NK-resistant tumors evade lysis, mostly by failure to prime; however, we recently reported a tumor cell line (CTV-1) that primes resting NK cells but fails to trigger lysis. In this article, we report two additional leukemia cell lines that prime NK cells but are resistant to lysis. Tumor-mediated NK priming is via CD2 binding to a ligand within CD15 on the tumor cell. NK-resistant RAJI cells became susceptible to NK lysis following transfection and expression of CD15. Blockade of CD15 on K562 cells or on CD15(+) RAJI cells significantly inhibited lysis, as did blockade of CD2 on resting NK cells. NK priming via CD2 induced CD16 shedding, releasing CD3zeta to the CD2, leading to its phosphorylation and the subsequent phosphorylation of linker for activation of T cells and STAT-5 and synthesis of IFN-gamma. Blockade of C-type lectin receptors significantly suppressed the tumor-mediated priming of NK cells, whereas blockade of Ig-superfamily-like receptors had no effect at the NK-priming stage. Tumor priming of resting NK cells was irrespective of HLA expression, and blockade of HLA-killer Ig-like receptor interactions did not influence the incidence or degree of priming. However, CD15-CD2 interactions were critical for NK priming and were required, even in the absence of HLA-mediated NK inhibition. Tumor-mediated priming led to a sustained primed state, and the activated NK cells retained the ability to lyse NK-resistant tumors, even after cryopreservation.","['Sabry, May', 'Tsirogianni, Maria', 'Bakhsh, Ismail A', 'North, Janet', 'Sivakumaran, Janani', 'Giannopoulos, Konstantinos', 'Anderson, Robert', 'Mackinnon, Stephen', 'Lowdell, Mark W']","['Sabry M', 'Tsirogianni M', 'Bakhsh IA', 'North J', 'Sivakumaran J', 'Giannopoulos K', 'Anderson R', 'Mackinnon S', 'Lowdell MW']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital Campus, University College London Medical School, London NW3 2PF, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111114,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['CD2 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Resistance', 'Fucosyltransferases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism/*physiology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR/*physiology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1101640 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1101640 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Dec 15;187(12):6227-34. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1101640.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 133 patients with AML-NK confirmed by metaphase cytogenetics (MC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis were included in this study. Analysis by Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array was performed by using DNAs derived from marrow samples at diagnosis. RESULTS: Forty-three patients (32.3%) had at least one abnormal SNP lesion that was not detected by MC. One hundred thirteen abnormal SNP lesions included 55 losses, 23 gains, and 35 copy-neutral losses of heterozygosity. Multivariate analyses showed that detection of abnormal SNP lesions by SNP-A karyotyping results in an unfavorable prognostic value for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.69; 95% CI, 1.50 to 4.82; P = .001); other significant prognostic factors included secondary AML (HR, 5.55; 95% CI, 1.80 to 17.14; P = .003), presence of the FLT3 mutation (HR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.71 to 5.87; P < .001), and age (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.05; P = .020). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that abnormal SNP lesions detected by SNP-A karyotyping might indicate an adverse prognosis in patients with AML-NK, thus requiring a more sophisticated treatment strategy for improvement of treatment outcomes.","['Yi, Jun Ho', 'Huh, Jungwon', 'Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Kim, Sun-Hee', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Kim, Sung Hyun', 'Kim, Kyoung Ha', 'Won, Jong Ho', 'Mun, Yeung Chul', 'Kim, Hawk', 'Park, Jinny', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Kim, Dong Hwan']","['Yi JH', 'Huh J', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim SH', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YK', 'Sohn SK', 'Moon JH', 'Kim SH', 'Kim KH', 'Won JH', 'Mun YC', 'Kim H', 'Park J', 'Jung CW', 'Kim DH']","['Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111114,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.35.5719 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.35.5719 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Dec 10;29(35):4702-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.5719.

Apigenin induced apoptosis by inactivation of Akt with a concomitant activation of JNK, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 downregulation, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and activation of caspases. Constitutively active myristolated Akt prevented apigenin-induced JNK, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Conversely, LY294002 and a dominant-negative construct of Akt potentiated apigenin-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. Interruption of the JNK pathway showed marked reduction in apigenin-induced caspase activation and apoptosis in leukemia cells. Furthermore, in vivo administration of apigenin resulted in attenuation of tumor growth in U937 xenografts accompanied by inactivation of Akt and activation of JNK. Attenuation of tumor growth in U937 xenografts by apigenin raises the possibility that apigenin may have clinical implications and can be further tested for incorporating in leukemia treatment regimens.","['Budhraja, Amit', 'Gao, Ning', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Son, Young-Ok', 'Cheng, Senping', 'Wang, Xin', 'Ding, Songze', 'Hitron, Andrew', 'Chen, Gang', 'Luo, Jia', 'Shi, Xianglin']","['Budhraja A', 'Gao N', 'Zhang Z', 'Son YO', 'Cheng S', 'Wang X', 'Ding S', 'Hitron A', 'Chen G', 'Luo J', 'Shi X']","['Graduate Center for Toxicology, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AA015407/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA119028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES015375/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111114,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Apigenin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4430727,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0343 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0343 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Jan;11(1):132-42. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0343.

The FLT-3 receptor tyrosine kinase plays an essential role in regulating normal hematopoiesis, but its constitutive activation via mutation in acute leukemias is generally associated with poor outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate interactions between the FLT-3 and VEGF signaling pathways in acute leukemia using cell lines and ex vivo cultures of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells following expansion of direct patient explants in immunodeficient mice. Different xenograft lines exhibited variable cell surface FLT-3 expression, as well as basal and FLT-3 ligand-induced VEGF secretion, whereas the MV4;11 cell line, which expresses constitutively active FLT-3, secreted high levels of VEGF. The FLT-3 inhibitor, SU11657, significantly reduced VEGF secretion in three of six xenograft lines and MV4;11 cells, in conjunction with inhibition of FLT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, exposure of xenograft cells to the FLT-3-blocking antibody, D43, also reduced VEGF secretion to basal levels and decreased FLT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. In terms of downstream signaling, SU11657 and D43 both caused dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, with no changes in AKT or STAT5 phosphorylation. Finally, partial knockdown of FLT-3 expression by short interfering RNA also resulted in inhibition of VEGF secretion. These results indicate that FLT-3 signaling plays a central role in the regulation of VEGF secretion and that inhibition of the FLT-3/VEGF pathway may disrupt paracrine signaling between leukemia cells and the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Markovic, Ana', 'MacKenzie, Karen L', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Markovic A', 'MacKenzie KL', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111114,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Blocking/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Organic Chemicals/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0503 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0503 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Jan;11(1):183-93. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0503.

Conventional antisense oligonucleotides targeting c-myc may attenuate leukemic cell growth, however, are poorly taken into cells, rapidly degraded, and have unwanted effects on normal cells. The c-myc promoter contains a guanine-rich sequence (PU27) capable of forming quadruplex (four-stranded) DNA, which may negatively regulate c-myc transcription. However, its biological significance is unknown. We show that treatment of leukemia with an oligonucleotide encoding the genomic PU27 sequence induces cell-cycle arrest and death by oncotic necrosis due to PU27-mediated suppression of c-myc mRNA/protein expression. Furthermore, PU27 is abundantly taken into cells, localized in the cytoplasm/nucleus, inherently stable in serum and intracellularly, and has no effect on normal cells. Suppression of c-myc expression by PU27 caused significant DNA damage, cell and mitochondrial swelling, and membrane permeability characteristic of oncotic necrosis. Induction of oncosis caused mitochondrial dysfunction, depletion of cellular ATP levels, and enhanced oxidative stress. This novel antileukemic strategy addresses current concerns of oligonucleotide therapeutics including problems with uptake, stability, and unintentional effects on normal cells and is the first report of selective cancer cell killing by a genomic DNA sequence.","['Sedoris, Kara C', 'Thomas, Shelia D', 'Clarkson, Cortney R', 'Muench, David', 'Islam, Ashraful', 'Singh, Rajesh', 'Miller, Donald M']","['Sedoris KC', 'Thomas SD', 'Clarkson CR', 'Muench D', 'Islam A', 'Singh R', 'Miller DM']","['Department of Medicine, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['G12 RR003034/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S21 MD000101/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MD008173/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20111114,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*G-Quadruplexes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3701457,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0515 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0515 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Jan;11(1):66-76. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0515.

The prevailing model proposes that during the initial, polyclonal stage of disease most of the infected cells terminally differentiate, resulting in acute erythrocytosis. In the late stage of disease, a clonal leukemia develops through the acquisition of new mutations--proviral insertional activation of Spi1/Pu.1 and mutation of p53. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that Friend virus activates the bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4)-dependent stress erythropoiesis pathway, which leads to the rapid expansion of stress erythroid progenitors, which are the targets for Friend virus in the spleen. We recently showed that stress erythroid progenitors have intrinsic self-renewal ability and therefore could function as leukemia stem cells (LSCs) when infected with Friend virus. Here, we show that the two stages of Friend virus-induced disease are caused by infection of distinct stress progenitor populations in the spleen. The development of leukemia relies on the ability of the virus to hijack the intrinsic self-renewal capability of stress erythroid progenitors leading to the generation of LSCs. Two signals are required for the self-renewal of Friend virus LSCs proviral insertional activation of Spi1/Pu.1 and Hedgehog-dependent signaling. Surprisingly, mutation of p53 is not observed in LSCs. These data establish a new model for Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia and demonstrate the utility of Friend virus as a model system to study LSC self-renewal.","['Hegde, Shailaja', 'Hankey, Pamela', 'Paulson, Robert F']","['Hegde S', 'Hankey P', 'Paulson RF']","['Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 DK080040/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology/virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Polycythemia', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Proviruses', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology/virology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', '*Virus Integration']",PMC3341850,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.781 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Feb;30(2):121-30. doi: 10.1002/stem.781.,,,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],,,['NIHMS372964'],,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we examine the effects of 31 mutations at 26 amino acid positions in protease to determine their impact on infectivity and protease inhibitor sensitivity. We found that primary resistance mutations individually decrease fitness and generally increase sensitivity to protease inhibitors, indicating that reduced virion-associated protease activity reduces virion infectivity and the reduced level of per virion protease activity is then more easily titrated by a protease inhibitor. Conversely, mutations at more variable positions (compensatory mutations) confer low-level decreases in sensitivity to all protease inhibitors with little effect on infectivity. We found significant differences in the observed effect on infectivity with a pseudotype virus assay that requires the protease to cleave the cytoplasmic tail of the amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) Env protein. Additionally, we were able to mimic the fitness loss associated with resistance mutations by directly reducing the level of virion-associated protease activity. Virions containing 50% of a D25A mutant protease were 3- to 5-fold more sensitive to protease inhibitors. This level of reduction in protease activity also resulted in a 2-fold increase in sensitivity to nonnucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and a similar increase in sensitivity to zidovudine (AZT), indicating a pleiotropic effect associated with reduced protease activity. These results highlight the interplay between enzyme activity, viral fitness, and inhibitor mechanism and sensitivity in the closed system of the viral replication complex.","['Henderson, Gavin J', 'Lee, Sook-Kyung', 'Irlbeck, David M', 'Harris, Janera', 'Kline, Melissa', 'Pollom, Elizabeth', 'Parkin, Neil', 'Swanstrom, Ronald']","['Henderson GJ', 'Lee SK', 'Irlbeck DM', 'Harris J', 'Kline M', 'Pollom E', 'Parkin N', 'Swanstrom R']","['UNC Center for AIDS Research, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01-GM066524/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007419/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI07419/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F30-DA019379/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 GM066524/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 DA019379/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111114,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance, Viral/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV Protease/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/enzymology/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', '*Mutation', 'Virion/drug effects/enzymology/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Virus Replication/drug effects/physiology']",PMC3264268,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.05549-11 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.05549-11 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012 Feb;56(2):623-33. doi: 10.1128/AAC.05549-11.

In this study, we investigated the involvement of the expression of leptin and adiponectin receptors in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) pathogenesis. METHODS: The expression of leptin receptor isoforms, OB-Rt, OB-Ra, and OB-Rb, and the expression of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, were measured as mRNA levels in two CML cell lines (K562 and Meg-01) and 20 CML patients and 24 healthy controls by using RT-PCR. RESULTS: OB-Rt and OB-Ra isoforms expression of the leptin receptors were found to be significantly lower in Meg-01 cell lines than K562 cells. All leptin receptors were downregulated in CML patients and more particularly OB-Rb level was found to be undetectably low in normal PBMC as well as in CML patients. AdipoR1 expression level was higher in Meg-01 than in K562, whereas AdipoR2 level was found to be unchanged in both cell lines. Interestingly, while AdipoR1 expression increased in CML patients, AdipoR2 decreased. Moreover, imatinib therapy did not affect both leptin and adiponectin isoform expressions. CONCLUSION: While the decrease in leptin receptor levels in CML patients was confirmed, the increase in AdipoR1 levels and relevant decrease in AdipoR2 levels depicted their possible involvement in CML pathogenesis. This suggests different functions of adiponectin receptors in CML development.","['Ozturk, Kamile', 'Avcu, Ferit', 'Ural, A Ugur']","['Ozturk K', 'Avcu F', 'Ural AU']","['Aksaray University, Faculty of Science and Letters, Molecular Biology Department, Aksaray, Turkey. kamileztrk@yahoo.com.tr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111113,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Adiponectin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Leptin/*genetics/metabolism']",,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/07/04 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-4666(11)00787-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2011.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2012 Jan;57(1):61-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2011.10.004.

A single 1-1.5 blood volume leukocytopheresis is expected to reduce the leukocyte count by 30-60%. CASE REPORT: A 35 year old man presented with a 2 month history of hearing and visual loss and was found to have chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase with 700,000 WBC/muL. The blast count was 1%. The spleen was markedly enlarged. He was referred for leukocytopheresis and treatment of his leukemia. Despite the extremely high white cell count, he had a hematocrit of 24, platelets of 161,000/muL, and normal lung, liver and renal function. RESULTS: A 15 L leukocytapheresis was performed with a Cobe Spectra with the removal of 1.86 L of bloody fluid with a hematocrit of 10% and a leukocrit of 28%. The blood white cell count decreased from 599,000 to 498,500/muL, and the patient felt better. He was started on hydroxyuria and 8 days later his WBC was 7000/muL. DISCUSSION: The patient's oncologists were initially concerned by the only 17% reduction in his white cell count. However, calculations based on his hematocrit and leukocrit in blood and waste bag suggested that he was 140% blood volume expanded by his leukemia and that the cytopheresis removed about half of the extra volume along with an additional 250 mL of leukocytes, about 35% of his pre-treatment WBC volume. The case and its implications for similar patients are discussed.","['Chekol, Seble S', 'Bhatnagar, Bhavana', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Hess, John R']","['Chekol SS', 'Bhatnagar B', 'Gojo I', 'Hess JR']","['Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States. schekol@umm.edu']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111113,England,Transfus Apher Sci,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,101095653,,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/blood/complications/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/complications/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/blood/complications/*therapy', 'Male']",,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/06/23 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1473-0502(11)00184-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transci.2011.10.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Apher Sci. 2012 Feb;46(1):29-31. doi: 10.1016/j.transci.2011.10.022.

Patterns of treatment-related mortality are likely to differ between low and high-income centres. Understanding low-income setting patterns is necessary before effective interventions aimed at decreasing treatment-related mortality can be designed. Our aim was to describe the incidence, timing and predictors of treatment-related mortality among Central American children with acute myeloid leukaemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated patients younger than 21 years diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia from 2000 to 2008 in El Salvador, Honduras or Guatemala. Biologic, socioeconomic and nutritional variables collected prospectively were examined as potential predictors of treatment-related mortality. RESULTS: Among 279 patients, treatment-related mortality occurred in 65 (23%). Of 65 deaths, 51 (78.5%) occurred before or during induction, resulting in an early death rate of 18.3%. The most common causes of treatment-related mortality were infection (29/65; 45%) and haemorrhage (13/65; 20%). Infection accounted for 33% of treatment-related mortality before remission induction therapy versus 40% during induction and 77% after induction (P = 0.03). Rates of treatment-related mortality did not vary between time periods 1 and 2 (24.8% versus 21.4%; P = 0.32). Only lower initial platelet count predicted early death (odds ratio per 10 x 10(9)/L = 0.88, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.79-0.97; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-related mortality remains a significant cause of treatment failure. Supportive care interventions are needed. Children presenting with low initial platelet counts were at highest risk of induction death, suggesting that transfusion practices should be evaluated.","['Gupta, Sumit', 'Bonilla, Miguel', 'Valverde, Patricia', 'Fu, Ligia', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Gupta S', 'Bonilla M', 'Valverde P', 'Fu L', 'Howard SC', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Sung L']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology and Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111113,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Central America', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Developed Countries', 'El Salvador/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Guatemala/epidemiology', 'Honduras/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/09/19 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00796-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2012 Jun;48(9):1363-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.10.009.

This study assessed the combination of temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, and lower-dose clofarabine as salvage therapy in older patients with AML. Induction consisted of clofarabine 20mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and temsirolimus 25mg (flat dose) on days 1, 8 and 15. Patients achieving complete remission with (CR) or without (CRi) full haematological recovery could receive monthly temsirolimus maintenance. In 53 evaluable patients, the overall remission rate (ORR) was 21% (8% CR, 13% CRi). Median disease-free survival was 3.5months, and median overall survival was 4months (9.1months for responders). The most common non-haematological severe adverse events included infection (48%), febrile neutropenia (34%) and transaminitis (11%). The 30-d all-cause induction mortality was 13%. Laboratory data from 25 patients demonstrated that a >50%in vivo inhibition of S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation was highly correlated with response rate (75% with inhibition versus 0% without inhibition; P=0.0001), suggesting that targeting the mTOR pathway is clinically relevant.

Thirty five trials with a total of 1029 AML (n = 814) and MDS (n = 215) patients were included for analysis. The CR rate of AML (57.9%) was significantly higher than that of MDS (45.7%) (p < 0.01).

Remarkably, the CR rate of CAG was significantly higher than those of non-CAG regimens (odds ratio 2.43). CAG regimen was well tolerated, with cardiotoxicity in 2.3% and early death in 5.2% of the cases. In conclusion, CAG regimen was an effective and safe regimen for the treatment of AML, and may be more effective than non-CAG regimens.

However, the function of NADPH oxidase in differentiation is not well elucidated. With 150-500 muM H2O2 inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells, we measured phagocytosis of latex beads and investigated cell electrophoresis. Two inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, DPI (diphenyleneiodonium) and APO (apocynin), blocked the differentiation potential of cells induced by 200 muM H2O2. However, H2O2 stimulated the generation of intracellular superoxide (O2*-), which decreased in the presence of the two inhibitors. DPI also inhibited H2O2-induced ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) activation, as detected by Western blotting. Furthermore, PD98059, the inhibitor of the ERK pathway, inhibited the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by H2O2. This shows that H2O2 can activate NADPH oxidase, leading to O2*- production, followed by ERK activation and ultimately resulting in the differentiation of HL-60 cells. The data indicate that NADPH oxidase is an important cell signal regulating cell differentiation.","['Lin, Changjun', 'Wang, Huan']","['Lin C', 'Wang H']","['School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples Republic of China. linc@lzu.edu.cn']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Microspheres', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Onium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,2011/11/16 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2011/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['CBI20110290 [pii]', '10.1042/CBI20110290 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2012 Apr 1;36(4):391-5. doi: 10.1042/CBI20110290.,,,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', 'B6J7B9UDTR (acetovanillone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single center experience.,850-61,,"Mutations in DNMT3A encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A were recently described in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. To assess their prognostic significance, we determined the mutational status of DNMT3A exon 23 in 288 patients with AML excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, aged from 18 to 65 years and treated in Toulouse University Hospital. A mutation was detected in 39 patients (13.5%). All DNMT3A exon 23+ patients had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Mutations significantly correlated with a higher WBC count (p less than 0.001), NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations (p=0.027). DNMT3A mutations were conserved through xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice. No difference in outcome between DNMT3A exon 23+ and DNMT3A exon 23- patients was found even if the results were stratified by NPM1 or FLT3-ITD status. However, DNMT3A exon 23+ patients had better median DFS (not reached vs 11.6 months, p=0.009) and OS (not reached vs 14.3 months, p=0.005) as compared to DNMT3A exon 23- patients when treated with idarubicin, whereas patients treated with daunorubicin had similar outcome regardless the DNMT3A status. This study shows that DNMT3A mutations have no impact on outcome but could be a predictive factor for response to idarubicin and thus, could have a direct influence in the way AML patients should be managed.","['LaRochelle, Olivier', 'Bertoli, Sarah', 'Vergez, Francois', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Mansat-De Mas, Veronique', 'Dobbelstein, Sophie', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Strzelecki, Anne-Claire', 'Cavelier, Cindy', 'Creancier, Laurent', 'Pillon, Arnaud', 'Kruczynski, Anna', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Sarry, Audrey', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Recher, Christian', 'Delabesse, Eric']","['LaRochelle O', 'Bertoli S', 'Vergez F', 'Sarry JE', 'Mansat-De Mas V', 'Dobbelstein S', 'Dastugue N', 'Strzelecki AC', 'Cavelier C', 'Creancier L', 'Pillon A', 'Kruczynski A', 'Demur C', 'Sarry A', 'Huguet F', 'Huynh A', 'Recher C', 'Delabesse E']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Toulouse, Hopital Purpan.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",PMC3260002,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['347 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.347 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2011 Nov;2(11):850-61. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.347.,,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a large Taiwanese cohort, we have evaluated whether body fat and its distribution is associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and leukemia mortalities. METHODS: During 1997-2007 in Taiwan, 383,956 subjects aged 19-98 years without any cancer history were obtained through a health screening center and followed up for a median of 7.2 years. Unit records were linked to the national death registry; ICD-9 codes were used to identify 143 NHL and 73 leukemia deaths. Objectively, height, weight, and waist circumference data were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI) and central obesity status. Based on World Health Organization criteria modified for Asia and Taiwan, BMI was classified to <18.5, 18.5-23.9, 24-26.9, and >/= 27 kg/m(2). Waist circumference >/= 90 cm in men and >/= 80 cm in women was defined as central obesity. Cox proportional hazard regression models were adjusted for possible confounders including gender, age, education, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and clinic location. RESULTS: BMI was not associated with NHL deaths, although the trend was significant, but central obesity with adjustment was (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-2.75) compared with non-centrally obese subjects. BMI, but not central obesity, was associated with leukemia mortality (HR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.00-3.75). CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk for NHL with increased abdominal fatness and more so with lower BMI is apparent in Taiwanese; this may indicate that metabolically localized and proinflammatory fat is important. For leukemia, where most is myeloid leukemia, increased general fatness is evidently a risk with Taiwanese ethnicity.","['Chu, Da-Ming', 'Wahlqvist, Mark L', 'Lee, Meei-Shyuan', 'Chang, Hsing-Yi']","['Chu DM', 'Wahlqvist ML', 'Lee MS', 'Chang HY']","['Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Coll Nutr,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,8215879,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Asians', 'Body Fat Distribution', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity, Abdominal/complications/*mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Waist Circumference', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['30/5/310 [pii]', '10.1080/07315724.2011.10719974 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Coll Nutr. 2011 Oct;30(5):310-9. doi: 10.1080/07315724.2011.10719974.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the psychological impact of this life-threatening condition and its intensive treatment has not been systematically examined. In the present study, we investigate the prevalence and correlates of post-traumatic stress symptoms in this population. METHODS: Patients with acute myeloid, lymphocytic, and promyelocytic leukemia who were newly diagnosed, recently relapsed, or treatment failures were recruited at a comprehensive cancer center in Toronto, Canada. Participants completed the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, CARES Medical Interaction Subscale, and other psychosocial measures. A multivariate regression analysis was used to assess independent predictors of post-traumatic stress symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 205 participants, 58% were male, mean age was 50.1 +/- 15.4 years, 86% were recently diagnosed, and 94% were receiving active treatment. The mean Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire score was 30.2 +/- 22.5, with 27 of 200 (14%) patients meeting criteria for acute stress disorder and 36 (18%) for subsyndromal acute stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were associated with more physical symptoms, physical symptom distress, attachment anxiety, and perceived difficulty communicating with health-care providers, and poorer spiritual well-being (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that clinically significant symptoms of traumatic stress are common in acute leukemia and are linked to the degree of physical suffering, to satisfaction with relationships with health-care providers, and with individual psychological characteristics. Longitudinal study is needed to determine the natural history, but these findings suggest that intervention may be indicated to alleviate or prevent traumatic stress in this population.","['Rodin, Gary', 'Yuen, Dora', 'Mischitelle, Ashley', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Marmar, Charles', 'Gagliese, Lucia', 'Lo, Christopher', 'Rydall, Anne', 'Zimmermann, Camilla']","['Rodin G', 'Yuen D', 'Mischitelle A', 'Minden MD', 'Brandwein J', 'Schimmer A', 'Marmar C', 'Gagliese L', 'Lo C', 'Rydall A', 'Zimmermann C']","['Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. gary.rodin@uhn.ca']",['eng'],"['84317-1/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'MOP-84317/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111113,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Canada', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Professional-Patient Relations', 'Regression Analysis', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC3808346,2011/11/15 06:00,2013/08/01 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.2092 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2013 Feb;22(2):299-307. doi: 10.1002/pon.2092.

HNSCC is the tenth most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in males worldwide, but it is the seventh most common cause of cancer-related death. The circadian clock regulates daily rhythmic variations in various physiologic processes including sleep and activity, appetite, hormone levels, metabolism, and gene expression. Many recent studies have demonstrated that the disruption of circadian rhythm is associated with cancer development and tumor progression, such as chronic myeloid leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, and breast cancer. However the direct links between aberrant circadian clock gene expression and human malignancies, including HNSCC, remain largely unknown. In this study, the expression profiles of nine circadian clock genes of cancer tissue and noncancerous part from 40 patients of HNSCC were investigated. The expression of PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRY2, CKIepsilon, and BMAL1 showed significant downregulation in the cancer tissues (p < 0.005). Downregulated PER3, CRY2, and BMAL1 expression was correlated with more advanced cancer stages (p < 0.05). Downregulated PER3 and upregulated TIM expression correlated with larger tumor size (p < 0.05), and lower expression of PER3 correlated with deeper tumor invasion (p < 0.05). Poor survival was related to lower expression of PER1 (p < 0.05) and PER3 (p < 0.01). These results indicate a possible association of circadian clock gene, especially PER3, expression with the pathogenesis of HNSCC.","['Hsu, Cheng-Ming', 'Lin, Sheng-Fung', 'Lu, Cheng-Tung', 'Lin, Pei-Mei', 'Yang, Ming-Yu']","['Hsu CM', 'Lin SF', 'Lu CT', 'Lin PM', 'Yang MY']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, 123 Da-Pei Rd, Niaosung Shiang, 833 Kaohsiung City, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111115,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics', 'Circadian Clocks/*genetics', 'Circadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-011-0258-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2012 Feb;33(1):149-55. doi: 10.1007/s13277-011-0258-2.

About 36.7% patients had episodes of nausea on day four of chemotherapy in ondansetron group and it was only 3.3% in granisetron group due to adverse effects of antiemetic drug itself (p=0.001). Maximum episodes of vomiting were found on the second day in ondansetron group 33.3% and in granisetron group 3.3% (p=0.003). Though adverse effects like headache, constipation, abdominal pain and loose motion were common in both group of children but their number was much less in children who received granisetron. On second day of therapy score of nausea and vomiting was maximum in ondansetron and minimum in granisetron treated on day 4 and the result was significant. So, to prevent acute and delayed CINV in children with ALL, oral graniseteron can be considered as more effective and well tolerated with minimum adverse effects compared with ondansetrons.","['Siddique, R', 'Hafiz, M G', 'Rokeya, B', 'Jamal, C Y', 'Islam, A']","['Siddique R', 'Hafiz MG', 'Rokeya B', 'Jamal CY', 'Islam A']","['Department of Pediatrics Haematology & Oncology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Shahbagh, Dhaka, Bangladesh.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,Bangladesh,Mymensingh Med J,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,9601799,IM,"['Antiemetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Granisetron/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nausea/*prevention & control', 'Ondansetron/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Serotonin Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Vomiting/*prevention & control']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mymensingh Med J. 2011 Oct;20(4):680-8.,,,"['0 (Antiemetics)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)', '4AF302ESOS (Ondansetron)', 'WZG3J2MCOL (Granisetron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A serious complication of ATRA is retinoic acid syndrome (RAS), which is characterized by an inflammatory reaction with capillary leakage and myeloid cell tissue invasion that presents with cardiopulmonary symptoms and occasionally acute kidney injury. CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: We report the case of a 3-year-old child with APL who developed transient nephrotic-range proteinuria (max urine protein:creatinine ratio 8.6) during two episodes of RAS while on ATRA therapy. ATRA was temporarily discontinued and the patient was treated with a 3-day course of dexamethasone during each episode. He maintained normal renal function throughout and the proteinuria completely resolved. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported occurrence of nephrotic-range proteinuria in a child treated with ATRA. Nephrologists should be aware that RAS is a serious complication of ATRA that may lead to proteinuria.","['Sethna, Christine B', 'Reddy, Kiranmye', 'Fein-Levy, Carolyn', 'Trachtman, Howard']","['Sethna CB', 'Reddy K', 'Fein-Levy C', 'Trachtman H']","[""Division of Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York, 269-01 76th Avenue, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, USA. csethna@nshs.edu""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111113,Germany,Pediatr Nephrol,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",8708728,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Proteinuria/*chemically induced', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00467-011-2048-x [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Nephrol. 2012 Mar;27(3):485-8. doi: 10.1007/s00467-011-2048-x.

Also, somatic point mutations of NF2 mutation have been reported in tumours originated from nerve structures. A recent study revealed that NF2 gene was mutated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as well, suggesting a possibility that NF2 gene might be somatically mutated in other human cancers. The aim of this study was to explore whether NF2 genes are somatically mutated, and contribute to tumorigenesis in common human cancers. METHODS: For this, we analysed the entire coding region of NF2 gene in 45 colorectal carcinomas, 45 gastric, 45 breast, 45 lung, 45 hepatocellular (HCC), 45 prostate carcinomas, and 45 acute leukaemias by a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. RESULTS: Overall, we found NF2 mutations in one HCC (1/45; 2.2%) (hepatitis B virus-related HCC), one lung carcinoma (1/45; 2.2%) (squamous cell carcinoma), and one acute leukaemia (1/45; 2.2%) (acute myelogenous leukaemia minimally differentiated). All of the mutations were missense mutations that would substitute amino acids in the NF2 protein (p.A238 V, p.A451T and p.R467K). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that somatic mutation of NF2 gene is not prevalent in common human cancers, and its mutation somatically occurs in a minor fraction of HCC, lung cancer and acute leukaemia. These data suggest that somatic mutation of NF2 tumour suppressor gene may not play a central role in development of common cancers.","['Yoo, Nam Jin', 'Park, Sang Wook', 'Lee, Sug Hyung']","['Yoo NJ', 'Park SW', 'Lee SH']","['Departments of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/diagnosis/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAT.0b013e32834c3599 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 2012 Jan;44(1):29-32. doi: 10.1097/PAT.0b013e32834c3599.,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although reduced MIM expression has been associated with bladder, breast and gastric cancers, evidence for the role of MIM in tumor progression remains scarce and controversial. Herein we characterized a MIM knockout mouse strain and observed that MIM-deficient mice often developed enlarged spleens. Autopsy and histological analysis revealed that nearly 78% of MIM(-/-) mice developed tumors with features similar to diffuse large B lymphoma during a period from 1 to 2 years. MIM(-/-) mice also exhibited abnormal distribution of B cells in lymphoid organs with decrease in the spleen but increase in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood. Furthermore, the bone marrow of MIM(-/-) mice contained a higher percentage of pre-B2 cells but fewer immature B-cells than wild-type mice. In response to CXCL13, a B-cell chemokine released from splenic stromal cells, MIM-deficient B-cells did not undergo chemotaxis or morphological changes in response to the chemokine and also did not internalize CXCR5, the receptor of CXCL13. Microarray analyses demonstrated that MIM is the only member of the I-BAR domain family that was highly expressed in human B cells. However, low or absent MIM expression was common in either primary B-cell malignancies or established B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphomas. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time an important role for MIM in B-cell development and suggest that predisposition of MIM-null mice to lymphomagenesis may involve aberrant interactions between B lineage cells and the lymphoid microenvironment.","['Yu, D', 'Zhan, X H', 'Zhao, X F', 'Williams, M S', 'Carey, G B', 'Smith, E', 'Scott, D', 'Zhu, J', 'Guo, Y', 'Cherukuri, S', 'Civin, C I', 'Zhan, X']","['Yu D', 'Zhan XH', 'Zhao XF', 'Williams MS', 'Carey GB', 'Smith E', 'Scott D', 'Zhu J', 'Guo Y', 'Cherukuri S', 'Civin CI', 'Zhan X']","['Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI070823/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113809-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20111114,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL13/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microfilament Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR5/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",PMC3350826,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011509 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.509 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Jul 26;31(30):3561-8. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.509.

However, mechanisms for coordinating actions of multiple co-regulator proteins are poorly understood. We demonstrate that multiple protein-protein interactions by the protein acetyltransferase TIP60 are required for estrogen-induced transcription of a subset of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) target genes in human cells. Estrogen-induced recruitment of TIP60 requires direct binding of TIP60 to ERalpha and the action of chromatin-remodeling ATPase BRG1, leading to increased recruitment of histone methyltransferase MLL1 and increased monomethylation of histone H3 at Lys4. TIP60 recruitment also requires preferential binding of the TIP60 chromodomain to histone H3 containing monomethylated Lys4, which marks active and poised enhancer elements. After recruitment, TIP60 increases acetylation of histone H2A at Lys5. Thus, complex cooperation of TIP60 with ERalpha and other chromatin-remodeling enzymes is required for estrogen-induced transcription.","['Jeong, Kwang Won', 'Kim, Kyunghwan', 'Situ, Alan Jialun', 'Ulmer, Tobias S', 'An, Woojin', 'Stallcup, Michael R']","['Jeong KW', 'Kim K', 'Situ AJ', 'Ulmer TS', 'An W', 'Stallcup MR']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL089726-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM84209/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL089726/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK043093/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL089726/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM084209/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43093/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL089726-02S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111113,United States,Nat Struct Mol Biol,Nature structural & molecular biology,101186374,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism/physiology', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'Estrogens/metabolism', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Lysine Acetyltransferase 5', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC3230772,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['nsmb.2153 [pii]', '10.1038/nsmb.2153 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2011 Nov 13;18(12):1358-65. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.2153.,,,"['0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Setd1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Lysine Acetyltransferase 5)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",,,,,['NIHMS321138'],,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that activity of the Mi-2beta nucleosome-remodeling and histone-deacetylase (NuRD) complex was controlled by the Ikaros family of lymphoid lineage-determining proteins. Ikaros, an integral component of the NuRD complex in lymphocytes, tethered this complex to active genes encoding molecules involved in lymphoid differentiation. Loss of Ikaros DNA-binding activity caused a local increase in chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation and suppression of lymphoid cell-specific gene expression. Without Ikaros, the NuRD complex also redistributed to transcriptionally poised genes that were not targets of Ikaros (encoding molecules involved in proliferation and metabolism), which induced their reactivation. Thus, release of NuRD from Ikaros regulation blocks lymphocyte maturation and mediates progression to a leukemic state by engaging functionally opposing epigenetic and genetic networks.","['Zhang, Jiangwen', 'Jackson, Audrey F', 'Naito, Taku', 'Dose, Marei', 'Seavitt, John', 'Liu, Feifei', 'Heller, Elizabeth J', 'Kashiwagi, Mariko', 'Yoshida, Toshimi', 'Gounari, Fotini', 'Petrie, Howard T', 'Georgopoulos, Katia']","['Zhang J', 'Jackson AF', 'Naito T', 'Dose M', 'Seavitt J', 'Liu F', 'Heller EJ', 'Kashiwagi M', 'Yoshida T', 'Gounari F', 'Petrie HT', 'Georgopoulos K']","['FAS Research Computing, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.', 'CBRC, Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, 02129, USA.', 'CBRC, Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, 02129, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'CBRC, Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, 02129, USA.', 'CBRC, Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, 02129, USA.', 'CBRC, Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, 02129, USA.', 'CBRC, Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, 02129, USA.', 'CBRC, Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, 02129, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA.', 'CBRC, Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA158006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA162092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA162092-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI033062-18/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI033062/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5R01AI042254/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '2T32AI007529/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA158006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007529/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI042254/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20111113,United States,Nat Immunol,Nature immunology,100941354,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology/immunology', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Thymocytes/metabolism']",PMC3868219,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/ni.2150 [doi]'],epublish,Nat Immunol. 2011 Nov 13;13(1):86-94. doi: 10.1038/ni.2150.,,,"['148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex)']",,,,,['NIHMS328217'],['Nat Immunol. 2012 Jan;13(1):16-8.

The pathogenesis of these conditions is poorly understood. For example, the signaling mechanisms contributing to the dysregulated growth of the neoplastic T cells are not well defined. Here, we demonstrate that loss of nuclear localization of pro-IL-16 facilitates CTCL cell proliferation by causing a decrease in expression of the cyclin dependent-kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. The decrease in p27Kip1 expression was directly attributable to an increase in expression of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2). Regulation of Skp2 is in part attributed to the nuclear presence of the scaffold protein pro-IL-16. T cells isolated from 11 patients with advanced CTCL, but not those from healthy controls or patients with T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL), demonstrated reduction in nuclear pro-IL-16 levels. Sequence analysis identified the presence of mutations in the 5' end of the PDZ1 region of pro-IL-16, a domain required for association of pro-IL-16 with the nuclear chaperone HSC70 (also known as HSPA8). HSC70 knockdown led to loss of nuclear translocation by pro-IL-16 and subsequent increases in Skp2 levels and decreases in p27Kip1 levels, which ultimately enhanced T cell proliferation. Thus, our data indicate that advanced CTCL cell growth is facilitated, at least in part, by mutations in the scaffold protein pro-IL-16, which directly regulates Skp2 synthesis.","['Curiel-Lewandrowski, Clara', 'Yamasaki, Hisato', 'Si, Chuan Ping', 'Jin, Xiaoyi', 'Zhang, Yujun', 'Richmond, Jillian', 'Tuzova, Marina', 'Wilson, Kevin', 'Sullivan, Beth', 'Jones, David', 'Ryzhenko, Nataliya', 'Little, Frederick', 'Kupper, Thomas S', 'Center, David M', 'Cruikshank, William W']","['Curiel-Lewandrowski C', 'Yamasaki H', 'Si CP', 'Jin X', 'Zhang Y', 'Richmond J', 'Tuzova M', 'Wilson K', 'Sullivan B', 'Jones D', 'Ryzhenko N', 'Little F', 'Kupper TS', 'Center DM', 'Cruikshank WW']","['Department of Dermatology, Cutaneous Oncology Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20111114,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-16/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sezary Syndrome/genetics/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology']",PMC3225985,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2009/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['41769 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI41769 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2011 Dec;121(12):4838-49. doi: 10.1172/JCI41769.

RECENT FINDINGS: The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in pediatric leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant populations has been evaluated in recent studies. Several centers have noted increased rates of antibiotic resistance in patients receiving prophylaxis.

Transplant success is dependent on identifying at-risk patients and proceeding to transplant before the development of severe infections or malignant transformation. This review focuses on recent advancements in risk stratification of SCN patients, indications for HCT, and review of published transplant studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with poor neutrophil response despite high doses of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are at greatest risk for malignant transformation. Other studies demonstrate elevated risk with mutations in the G-CSF receptor gene and a specific mutation in the ELANE gene. These patients are at high-risk of sepsis or leukemia development and should proceed to transplant with best available donor. As recent published studies demonstrate, HCT is highly successful in patients without leukemia and, therefore, may be considered in selected low-risk patients given the life-long risk of malignancy and infection. SUMMARY: The decision whether to proceed to HCT in healthy patients maintained on G-CSF is difficult. As transplant-related mortality continues to decrease, the role of transplant in SCN is likely to expand to more patients.","['Connelly, James A', 'Choi, Sung W', 'Levine, John E']","['Connelly JA', 'Choi SW', 'Levine JE']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046592-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 AI049393/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/genetics/surgery', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics']",PMC3291495,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834da96e [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Jan;19(1):44-51. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834da96e.,,,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, Autosomal Recessive 3']",,,,,['NIHMS354900'],,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with cyclopamine increases the expression of monocytic cell markers CD11b and CD14, but the expression of CD13, CD33 and CD38 is unchanged. The monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by cyclopamine is also evidenced by an increase in Egr-1 expression.

Fifty-five patients had a Hickman((R)) catheter (18 H-Surg, 37 H-IR) and 92 patients had a PICC (69 PICC-palp, 23 PICC-U/S). Significant improvements from H-Surg to H-IR catheters include the reduction in exit-site inflammation and infection (27.8% to 5.4%) and in bacteremic episodes (72.2% to 27.0%). Compared to PICC-U/S, H-IR had fewer cases of thrombophlebitis (0.0% vs. 8.7%); H-IR also required fewer instillations of a thrombolytic agent than the PICC-U/S (8.1% vs. 69.6%). Both CVCs have shown improvements from pre- to post-2007 insertion methods.

DESIGN: Prospective data entry as per a specified format. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: From January 1998 to December 2009, 40 children were diagnosed with acquired aplastic anemia; 33 patients, who received IST, were analyzed. 31 children (94%) received one course of e-ATG and CsA. 2 patients (6%) received two courses of ATG. INTERVENTION: Immunosuppressive therapy using equine ATG and cyclosporine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall response and overall survival. RESULTS: The overall response (complete response + partial response) to IST at 6 months was 87.9%. 8 (24.2%) patients achieved CR, 21 (63.6%) patients had PR and 4 (12.1%) patients did not respond to IST. Median follow-up was 24 (6-102) months. Overall survival at 24 months was 90%, with an actual survival of 85.4% at 5 years. Seventeen patients (51.5%) received G-CSF for a median duration of 32 (23-64) days. The patients who received G-CSF had fewer infectious complications (P=0.002), but G-CSF administration did not influence survival/ outcome. No patient developed myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The survival of patients who respond to IST is excellent. Also, G-CSF reduces the infectious complications without conferring any survival advantage.","['Nair, Velu', 'Sondhi, Vishal', 'Sharma, Ajay', 'Das, Satyaranjan', 'Sharma, Sanjeevan']","['Nair V', 'Sondhi V', 'Sharma A', 'Das S', 'Sharma S']","['Department of Medicine, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, Maharashtra, India. profvelunair@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111030,India,Indian Pediatr,Indian pediatrics,2985062R,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'India/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S097475591100298-I [pii]', '10.1007/s13312-012-0086-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian Pediatr. 2012 May;49(5):371-6. doi: 10.1007/s13312-012-0086-5.

Rapamycin analogs, which are allosteric mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitors, are active in mantle cell lymphoma and other lymphoid neoplasms, but responses are usually partial and short-lived. In the present study we compared the effects of rapamycin with the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor OSI-027 in cell lines and clinical samples representing divers lymphoid malignancies. In contrast to rapamycin, OSI-027 markedly diminished proliferation and induced apoptosis in a variety of lymphoid cell lines and clinical samples, including specimens of B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and Sezary syndrome. Additional analysis demonstrated that OSI-027-induced apoptosis depended on transcriptional activation of the PUMA and BIM genes. Overexpression of Bcl-2, which neutralizes Puma and Bim, or loss of procaspase 9 diminished OSI-027-induced apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, OSI-027 inhibited phosphorylation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 substrates, up-regulated Puma, and induced regressions in Jeko xenografts. Collectively, these results not only identify a pathway that is critical for the cytotoxicity of dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors, but also suggest that simultaneously targeting mTORC1 and mTORC2 might be an effective anti-lymphoma strategy in vivo.","['Gupta, Mamta', 'Hendrickson, Andrea E Wahner', 'Yun, Seong Seok', 'Han, Jing Jing', 'Schneider, Paula A', 'Koh, Brian D', 'Stenson, Mary J', 'Wellik, Linda E', 'Shing, Jennifer C', 'Peterson, Kevin L', 'Flatten, Karen S', 'Hess, Allan D', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Barr, Sharon', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Gupta M', 'Hendrickson AE', 'Yun SS', 'Han JJ', 'Schneider PA', 'Koh BD', 'Stenson MJ', 'Wellik LE', 'Shing JC', 'Peterson KL', 'Flatten KS', 'Hess AD', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Barr S', 'Witzig TE', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA127433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008685/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111111,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Triazines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3257013,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38634-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-346601 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 12;119(2):476-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-346601.

However, the mechanism underlying HS-induced apoptosis remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated a novel evidence that checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) plays crucial roles in the apoptosis and regulation of cell cycle progression in cells under HS. In human leukemia Jurkat cells, interestingly, the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad-3 related (ATR)-Chk1 pathway was preferentially activated rather than the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) pathway under HS. The selective inhibitors of ATR or Chk1 abrogated HS-induced apoptosis in human leukemia Jurkat cells whereas the inhibition of ATM or Chk2 caused only marginal effects. Inhibition of ATR and Chk1 also abrogated G2/M checkpoint activation by HS in Jurkat cells. The effects of small interfering RNA targeting Chk1 were similar to those of the selective inhibitor of Chk1. In addition, the efficiencies of Chk1 inhibition on G2/M checkpoint abrogation and apoptosis induction were confirmed in the adherent cancer cell lines HeLa, HSC3, and PC3, suggesting that the targeting of Chk1 can be effective in solid tumors cells. In conclusion, these findings indicate a novel molecular basis of G2/M checkpoint activation and apoptosis in cells exposed to HS.","['Furusawa, Yukihiro', 'Iizumi, Takashi', 'Fujiwara, Yoshisada', 'Zhao, Qing-Li', 'Tabuchi, Yoshiaki', 'Nomura, Takaharu', 'Kondo, Takashi']","['Furusawa Y', 'Iizumi T', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Zhao QL', 'Tabuchi Y', 'Nomura T', 'Kondo T']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, Life Science Research Center, Graduate School of Medicine Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', '*Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Fever/*enzymology/genetics/*physiopathology', '*G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', '*Heat-Shock Response', 'Humans', '*M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0660-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2012 Jan;17(1):102-12. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0660-7.,,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 28 therapy-related myeloid neoplasm patients were identified, including 19 patients from 3 well-controlled FCR frontline trials (n=426 patients), giving an estimated frequency of 4.5% (1.9-8.3%) in a follow-up period of 44 months (range 5-122 months). Clinically, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms could emerge directly from 'prolonged myelosuppression' after FCR (10 patients), or after achieving complete hematological recovery (n=18). The overall latency was 35 months (range 3-118 months), with the former group of 23 months and the latter 42 months (P<0.001). In all, 10 cases presented as therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and 18 as therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes. Abnormal cytogenetics was present in 26 of 27 (96%) patients, with frequent chromosomes 5 and 7 abnormalities. The median survival was 7 months after therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Our results indicate that the risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms secondary to frontline FCR therapy may not be as high as previously reported after removing the confounding factor of previous cytotoxic exposure, but this risk increased with older age and likely growth factor co-administration. Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after FCR therapy shares clinicopathological features with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms secondary to other alkylating agents, but has a shorter latency interval indicating possible synergetic effects of the nucleotide analog fludarabine. The fact that therapy-related myeloid neoplasms can directly emerge from 'prolonged myelosuppression' warrants a bone marrow examination to rule out therapy-related myeloid neoplasms in this clinical setting.","['Zhou, Yi', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'McDonnell, Timothy J', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wierda, William G', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Zhou Y', 'Tang G', 'Medeiros LJ', 'McDonnell TJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20111111,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/05/19 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2011158 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2011.158 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2012 Feb;25(2):237-45. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2011.158.

Eighteen patients with a previous malignancy treated at our institution and three patients with a nonmalignant primary tumor received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) on the pediatric bone marrow (BM) transplantation service for the treatment of tMDS/tAML over a 15-year period. Five patients proceeded to HSCT without induction chemotherapy. Fourteen patients received high-dose cytarabine according to the Capizzi II regimen as first-line induction therapy with 13 of them achieving complete remission (CR) or refractory anemia (RA) with persistent cytogenetic abnormalities after this treatment. Two patients received an anthracycline-based induction therapy. Conditioning regimens were selected according to previous therapies: 11 patients received busulfan-melphalan-fludarabine (BU-MEL-FLU), which consisted of busulfan (0.8 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours x10 doses), melphalan (70 mg/m(2)/dose x two doses), and fludarabine (25 mg/m(2)/dose x five doses) for cytoreduction; three patients received a total body irradiation (TBI)-containing regimen; seven patients received myeloablative regimens containing busulfan and/or melphalan and/or thiotepa with doses modified for organ toxicity. Sixteen patients received T cell-depleted (TCD) grafts; four patients received unmodified grafts; one patient received a double-unit cord blood transplantation (DUCBT). Donors included HLA-matched (n = 9), or mismatched (n = 3) related donors, or HLA-matched (n = 4), or mismatched (n = 4) unrelated donors, or DUCBT (n = 1). Disease status at the time of HSCT was: morphologic and cytogenetic CR (n = 12); RA with positive cytogenetics (n = 6); and refractory disease (n = 3). With a median follow-up of 5.9 years (2.2-15.7 years), the 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates for the entire group were 61.1% with 12 patients alive without evidence of either primary disease or tMDS/tAML. The OS and DFS rate for the 11 patients who received the BU-MEL-FLU cytoreduction with TCD grafts was 54.5%. DFS was 65.7% for patients in RA or CR at HSCT compared with 0% for patients with >5% residual marrow blasts (P = .015). Nine patients died; the cause of death was relapse of MDS/AML (n = 4) or primary disease (n = 2), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; n = 2), and infection (n = 1). Four patients developed grade II to IV acute GVHD. One patient developed localized chronic GVHD. Our results suggest that the strategy of induction with high-dose cytarabine therapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation improves the overall outcome for patients with tMDS/tAML. In addition, the use of a TCD transplantation with BU-MEL-FLU as cytoreduction may decrease the toxicity of transplantation in heavily pretreated patients without an increase in relapse rate.","['Kobos, Rachel', 'Steinherz, Peter G', 'Kernan, Nancy A', 'Prockop, Susan E', 'Scaradavou, Andromachi', 'Small, Trudy N', 'Shukla, Neerav', 'Khalaf, Ramzi', ""O'Reilly, Richard J"", 'Boulad, Farid']","['Kobos R', 'Steinherz PG', 'Kernan NA', 'Prockop SE', 'Scaradavou A', 'Small TN', 'Shukla N', 'Khalaf R', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Boulad F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA. kobosr@mskcc.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111110,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*surgery', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*surgery', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00478-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.11.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Mar;18(3):473-80. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.11.009.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 32 patients (14 PM, 18 DM) associated with hematological malignancies. In our 32 PM/DM patients, hematological malignancy was concurrently identified (18.8%) or occurred during the course of PM/DM (31.2%); although, PM/DM more often preceded hematological malignancy onset (50%). We observed that the types of hematological malignancies varied, consisting of: B-cell lymphoma (n=20), T-cell lymphoma (n=4), Hodgkin's disease (n=2), multiple myeloma (n=1), myelodysplastic syndrome without excess of blasts (n=3), hairy cell (n=1) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=1). In 21 patients of our 32 patients with PM/DM-associated hematological malignancy (65.6% of cases), PM/DM paralleled the course of hematological malignancy. Finally, we observed that patients with PM/DM-associated hematological malignancies had a poor prognosis, the survival status ranging from 96.9%, 78.1% and 51.4% at 1, 3 and 5years, respectively. Interestingly, we found that patients with hematological malignancies, compared with those without were older and more frequently had DM; on the other hand, these patients less commonly exhibited: joint involvement (p=0.017), interstitial lung disease (p=0.06) and anti-Jo1 antibody (p=0.001). Taken together, our study underscores that the association between PM/DM and hematological malignancy, especially lymphoma, should not be ignored. Our findings also suggest that antisynthetase syndrome may be a protective factor of hematological malignancy in PM/DM patients.","['Marie, I', 'Guillevin, L', 'Menard, J-F', 'Hatron, P Y', 'Cherin, P', 'Amoura, Z', 'Cacoub, P', 'Bachelez, H', 'Buzyn, A', 'Le Roux, G', 'Ziza, J M', 'Brice, P', 'Munck, J N', 'Sarrot-Reynauld, F', 'Piette, J C', 'Larroche, C']","['Marie I', 'Guillevin L', 'Menard JF', 'Hatron PY', 'Cherin P', 'Amoura Z', 'Cacoub P', 'Bachelez H', 'Buzyn A', 'Le Roux G', 'Ziza JM', 'Brice P', 'Munck JN', 'Sarrot-Reynauld F', 'Piette JC', 'Larroche C']","['Department of Internal medicine, CHU Rouen, Rouen, France. isabelle.marie@chu-rouen.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111030,Netherlands,Autoimmun Rev,Autoimmunity reviews,101128967,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dermatomyositis/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myositis/pathology', 'Polymyositis/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1568-9972(11)00244-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.autrev.2011.10.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Autoimmun Rev. 2012 Jul;11(9):615-20. doi: 10.1016/j.autrev.2011.10.024.

Over 80% of AML patients express CD33, a target of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO). GO is an active drug in childhood AML but has not been studied in a myeloablative conditioning regimen. We sought to determine the safety of GO in combination with busulfan/cyclophosphamide (Bu/Cy) conditioning before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). GO was administered on day -14 at doses of 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, and 7.5 mg/m(2), busulfan on days -7, -6, -5, -4 (12.8-16.0 mg/kg), and cyclophosphamide on days -3 and -2 (60 mg/kg/day). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. We enrolled 12 patients: 8 IF, 3 RR, 1 CR3; median age: 3 years (1-17); median follow-up: 1379 days (939-2305). Nine received umbilical cord blood (UCB), 2 matched unrelated donors (MUDs) and 1 HLA-matched sibling donor: 3 patients each at GO doses of 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, or 7.5 mg/m(2). No dose-limiting toxicities secondary to GO were observed. Day 100 treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 0%. Myeloid and platelet engraftment was observed in 92% and 75% of patients at median day 22 (12-40) and 42 (21-164), respectively. Median day +30 donor chimerism was 99% (85%-100%). The probability of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 42% and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 28%. One-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.8-73.6). GO combined with Bu/Cy regimen followed by alloSCT is well tolerated in children with poor-risk AML. GO at 7.5 mg/m(2) in combination with Bu/Cy is currently being tested in a phase II study.","['Satwani, Prakash', 'Bhatia, Monica', 'Garvin, James H Jr', 'George, Diane', 'Dela Cruz, Filemon', 'Le Gall, John', 'Jin, Zhezhen', 'Schwartz, Joseph', 'Duffy, Deirdre', 'van de Ven, Carmella', 'Foley, Sandra', 'Hawks, Ria', 'Morris, Erin', 'Baxter-Lowe, Lee Ann', 'Cairo, Mitchell S']","['Satwani P', 'Bhatia M', 'Garvin JH Jr', 'George D', 'Dela Cruz F', 'Le Gall J', 'Jin Z', 'Schwartz J', 'Duffy D', 'van de Ven C', 'Foley S', 'Hawks R', 'Morris E', 'Baxter-Lowe LA', 'Cairo MS']","[""Department of Pediatric, New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111109,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aminoglycosides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Siblings', 'Survival Rate', 'Tacrolimus/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00476-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Feb;18(2):324-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.11.007.

The largest subgroup of 35 patients had American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation high-risk, active disease. All evaluable patients engrafted with a median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery of 10 and 18 days, respectively. The cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality was 26% at 1 year.

Diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), used in the Aldeflour assay, has been considered a specific inhibitor for ALDH1A1 isoform. In this study, we explore the effects of human ALDH isoenzymes, ALDH1A2 and ALDH2, on drug resistance and proliferation, and the specificity of DEAB as an inhibitor. We also screened for the expression of 19 ALDH isoenzymes in K562 cells using TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA). We used lentiviral vectors containing the full cDNA length of either ALDH2 or ALDH1A2 to over express the enzymes in K562 leukemia and H1299 lung cancer cell lines. Successful expression was measured by activity assay, Western blot, RT-PCR, and Aldefluor assay. Both cell lines, with either ALDH1A2 or ALDH2, exhibited higher cell proliferation rates, higher clonal efficiency, and increased drug resistance to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. In order to study the specificity of known ALDH activity inhibitors, DEAB and disulfiram, we incubated each cell line with either inhibitor and measured the remaining ALDH enzymatic activity. Both inhibitors reduced ALDH activity of both isoenzymes by 65-90%. Furthermore, our TLDA results revealed that ALDH1, ALDH7, ALDH3 and ALDH8 are expressed in K562 cells. We conclude that DEAB is not a specific inhibitor for ALDH1A1 and that Aldefluor assay is not specific for ALDH1A1 activity. In addition, other ALDH isoenzymes seem to play a major role in the biology and drug resistance of various malignant cells.","['Moreb, Jan S', 'Ucar, Deniz', 'Han, Shuhong', 'Amory, John K', 'Goldstein, Alex S', 'Ostmark, Blanca', 'Chang, Lung-Ji']","['Moreb JS', 'Ucar D', 'Han S', 'Amory JK', 'Goldstein AS', 'Ostmark B', 'Chang LJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States.']",['eng'],"['U01 HD060488-01S1/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000064/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HD060488-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HD060488-02S1/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HD060488-02/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HD060488/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HD060488-04/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HD060488-03/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111103,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial', 'Benzaldehydes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Disulfiram/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3350780,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(11)00311-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2012 Jan 5;195(1):52-60. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2011.10.007.

Culture results, geographical distribution and clinical presentation of 339 cases.",934-44,10.1016/j.jfms.2011.07.012 [doi],"This study investigated 339 cases of feline mycobacterial disease from cats with cutaneous lesions or masses found at exploratory laparotomy. Tissue samples were submitted to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for mycobacterial culture over a 4-year period to December 2008. The study assessed which species of culturable mycobacteria were involved, where the cats lived, and their clinical presentation (physical findings, serum biochemistry, radiography, feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus status). Mycobacterium microti was cultured from 19%, Mycobacterium bovis 15%, Mycobacterium avium 7%, non-M avium non-tuberculous mycobacteria 6%, with no growth in 53% of samples. M microti, M bovis and M avium were found in almost mutually exclusive clusters within Great Britain (GB) (ie, M bovis in South-West England/Wales/Welsh Border, M avium in eastern England and M microti south of London and in South-West Scotland). While differences were seen in the clinical presentation and distribution of lesions caused by the different infections, these were not sufficiently different to be diagnostic. Cats commonly presented with single or multiple cutaneous lesions (74%), which were sometimes ulcerated or discharging, located most frequently on the head (54%). Lymph nodes were usually involved (47%); typically the submandibular nodes. Systemic or pulmonary signs were rarely seen (10-16%).

Recently, we found Bik accumulation in cancer cell lines after they were treated with bortezomib. However, recent evidence indicates that proteasome inhibitors may also induce the accumulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. The current study was designed to analyze the levels of several anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family in different human cancer cell lines after they were treated with proteasome inhibitors. METHODS: Different human cancer cell lines were treated with proteasome inhibitors. Western blot were used to investigate the expression of Mcl-1 and activation of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. Cell viability was investigated using SRB assay, and induction of apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found elevated Mcl-1 level in human colon cancer cell lines DLD1, LOVO, SW620, and HCT116; human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3; and human lung cancer cell line H1299, but not in human breast cancer cell line MCF7 after they were treated with bortezomib. This dramatic Mcl-1 accumulation was also observed when cells were treated with other two proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and calpain inhibitor I (ALLN). Moreover, our results showed Mcl-1 accumulation was caused by stabilization of the protein against degradation. Reducing Mcl-1 accumulation by Mcl-1 siRNA reduced Mcl-1 accumulation and enhanced proteasome inhibitor-induced cell death and apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that it was not only Bik but also Mcl-1 accumulation during the treatment of proteasome inhibitors, and combining proteasome inhibitors with Mcl-1 siRNA would enhance the ultimate anticancer effect suggesting this combination might be a more effective strategy for cancer therapy.","['Zhou, Wei', 'Hu, Jingzi', 'Tang, Haimei', 'Wang, Da', 'Huang, Xuefeng', 'He, Chao', 'Zhu, Hongbo']","['Zhou W', 'Hu J', 'Tang H', 'Wang D', 'Huang X', 'He C', 'Zhu H']","['Department of Colorectal Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111114,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology']",PMC3226681,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-485 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-485 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Nov 14;11:485. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-485.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this elusive symptom complex of haematological malignancy is not easily recognised in the emergency room (ER) where musculoskeletal problems are frequent. This study reviews bony complaints of childhood haematological malignancy in the ER. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 148 children diagnosed with haematological malignancy between March 2002 and February 2007. RESULTS: Twenty-one cases (14.2%) presented with bony complaints to the ER within 3 months prior diagnosis of malignancy. The median age was 5.1 years, and majority (90.5%) had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Fifteen cases were undiagnosed for malignancy at first visit; diagnoses included pulled elbow, lower limb sprain and septic arthritis, with 21 days median time to correct diagnosis. In this undiagnosed group, history of trauma, fever, multiple bony site involvement, normal radiography and blood counts were common. Undiagnosed cases were referred to orthopaedics, paediatrics, rheumatology or the general practitioner, hospitalised or discharged without follow-up. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of childhood haematological malignancy with first bony presentation to the ER was challenging, with a high prevalence of 71.4% undiagnosed cases at first visit. We highlight the common misdiagnoses because failure to correctly diagnose could delay timely institution of treatment. Trauma or normal investigations do not exclude an underlying haematological malignancy. This rare diagnosis in the ER should always be considered when challenged with recurrent bony complaints.","['Teo, Wan-Yee', 'Chan, Mei-Yoke', 'Ng, Kee-Chong', 'Tan, Ah-Moy']","['Teo WY', 'Chan MY', 'Ng KC', 'Tan AM']","[""Department of Paediatric Medicine, Haematology Oncology Service, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore. pault1@chw.edu.au""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111114,Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,IM,"['Bone and Bones/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Pain', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore/epidemiology']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1754.2011.02230.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 2012 Apr;48(4):311-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2011.02230.x.

Expanded NK cells can be transduced with genes encoding chimeric antigen receptors that stimulate tumor cell-specific cytotoxicity. These methods for NK cell expansion and genetic modification have been adapted to large-scale, clinical-grade, Current Good Manufacturing Practice conditions and support two active clinical trials.

Overexpression of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of 3BP2 results in the dramatic suppression of antigen-induced degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Previously, a linker for activation of T cells (LAT) was identified as one of the 3BP2 SH2 domain-binding protein. In this report, to further understand the functions of 3BP2 in FcepsilonRI-mediated activation of mast cell, we explored the protein that associates with the SH2 domain of 3BP2 and found that SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) inducibly interacts with the SH2 domain of 3BP2 after the aggregation of FcepsilonRI. The phosphorylation of Tyr(564) in the carboxy (C)-terminal tail region of SHP-1 is required for the direct interaction of SHP-1 to the SH2 domain of 3BP2. The expression of the mutant form of SHP-1 which was unable to interact with 3BP2 resulted in the significant reduction in SHP-1-mediated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production without any effects on the degranulation in antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. These findings suggest that 3BP2 directly interacts with Tyr(564) -phosphorylated form of SHP-1 and positively regulates the function of SHP-1 in FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling in mast cells.","['Chihara, Kazuyasu', 'Nakashima, Kenji', 'Takeuchi, Kenji', 'Sada, Kiyonao']","['Chihara K', 'Nakashima K', 'Takeuchi K', 'Sada K']","['Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathological Sciences, University of Fukui, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111113,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Allergens/administration & dosage/adverse effects/immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hypersensitivity/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mast Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains/*genetics/immunology']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/04/05 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2443.2011.01557.x [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Cells. 2011 Dec;16(12):1133-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2011.01557.x.

A second-hit mutation precedes the predominant NF1 neoplasms, which include myeloid leukemia, optic glioma, and plexiform neurofibroma. Despite this requisite NF1 loss of heterozygosity in the tumor cell of origin, nontumorigenic cells contribute to both generalized and specific disease manifestations. In mouse models of plexiform neurofibroma formation, Nf1 haploinsufficient mast cells promote inflammation, accelerating tumor formation and growth. These recruited mast cells, hematopoietic effector cells long known to permeate neurofibroma tissue, mediate key mitogenic signals that contribute to vascular ingrowth, collagen deposition, and tumor growth. Thus, the plexiform neurofibroma microenvironment involves a tumor/stromal interaction with the hematopoietic system that depends, at the molecular level, on a stem cell factor/c-kit-mediated signaling axis. These observations parallel findings in other NF1 disease manifestations and are clearly relevant to medical management of these neurofibromas.","['Staser, Karl', 'Yang, Feng-Chun', 'Clapp, D Wade']","['Staser K', 'Yang FC', 'Clapp DW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 NS052606-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA111198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA074177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA074177-11A1/D/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 NS052606/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20111107,United States,Annu Rev Pathol,Annual review of pathology,101275111,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Hematopoietic System/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Neurofibroma, Plexiform/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/genetics/*pathology', 'Neurofibromin 1/genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC3694738,2011/11/15 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1146/annurev-pathol-011811-132441 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Pathol. 2012;7:469-95. doi: 10.1146/annurev-pathol-011811-132441.

Accordingly, interest in using IFN-?2 in the treatment of patients with PV and related neoplasms has been revived. This article highlights the current status of IFN-?2 in the treatment of patients with ET, PV, primary myelofibrosis and myelofibrosis following ET and PV. In the context of being able to induce ?minimal residual disease? in a subset of patients after long-term treatment with IFN-?2, the current risk-stratification systems used for treatment decisions are being challenged. It is argued that in 2011, the bulk of evidence for the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferons in treating patients with these neoplasms favors the upfront use of pegylated interferons, the goal being to influence the development of the disease at the molecular level and revert patients to a stage of ?minimal residual disease/operational cure? instead of progressive clonal evolution, genomic instability and leukemic or myelofibrotic transformation during long-term treatment with hydroxyurea.","['Hasselbalch, Hans Carl']",['Hasselbalch HC'],"['Department of Hematology, Roskilde Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. hans.hasselbalch@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/complications', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/drug therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/drug therapy']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/ehm.11.63 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2011 Dec;4(6):637-55. doi: 10.1586/ehm.11.63.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can affect any or multiple joints but the hip and knee are most frequently involved and a cause of long-term disability. The problem is almost exclusively that of older children and young adults of whom over 70% have asymptomatic changes on screening magnetic resonance imaging and 15-20% have resulting symptoms. Dexamethasone is associated with a higher risk than prednisolone in US but not European or UK trials and alternate week scheduling of dexamethasone in the intensification course is associated with a lower risk than a continuous 3-week schedule in US trials. Genetic factors and obesity contribute to the risk, as do metabolic abnormalities caused by drugs, such as asparaginase, which increase tissue exposure to steroids. Management is primarily supportive but a minority of patients require surgical intervention including replacement of the affected joint. A variety of surgical techniques and, latterly, bisphophonates, have been tried to prevent progression but their efficacy remains uncertain. Whether patients should continue to receive steroids after diagnosis of osteonecrosis is uncertain but most trial investigators recommend stopping them after completion of the intensification phase of treatment.","['Vora, Ajay']",['Vora A'],"[""Department of Paediatric Haematology, The Children's Hospital Sheffield, Sheffield, UK. ajay.vora@sch.nhs.uk""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110921,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/03 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08871.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Dec;155(5):549-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08871.x.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a death ligand with promising anti-cancer effects. However, some tumor types develop resistance to TRAIL. We examined the effect of aclarubicin (ACR), an anthracycline, in combination with TRAIL. The combination of TRAIL and ACR synergistically induced apoptosis in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells and human lung cancer A549 cells. In contrast, another anthracycline, doxorubicin (DOX), only slightly sensitized Jurkat cells and A549 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, with weaker enhancement of death receptor 5 (DR5) expression than ACR. The RNase protection assay, real time RT-PCR and western blot demonstrated that ACR upregulated the expression of a TRAIL receptor, DR5. Caspase inhibitors and dominant negative DR5 efficiently reduced the apoptotic response to the treatment with ACR and TRAIL, indicating that the combined effect depends on caspase activities and the interaction between TRAIL and its receptor. ACR but not DOX increased the activity of the DR5 gene promoter in Jurkat cells carrying a mutation in the p53 gene, suggesting that ACR upregulates DR5 expression through p53-independent transcription. These results suggest the combination of TRAIL and ACR to be a promising treatment for malignant tumors.","['Horinaka, Mano', 'Yoshida, Tatsushi', 'Nakata, Susumu', 'Shiraishi, Takumi', 'Tomosugi, Mitsuhiro', 'Yoshikawa, Sae', 'Wakada, Miki', 'Sakai, Toshiyuki']","['Horinaka M', 'Yoshida T', 'Nakata S', 'Shiraishi T', 'Tomosugi M', 'Yoshikawa S', 'Wakada M', 'Sakai T']","['Department of Molecular-Targeting Cancer Prevention, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111213,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Aclarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02150.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Feb;103(2):282-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02150.x.

Here, we assessed the prognostic role of NOTCH1 mutations in CLL. Two series of newly diagnosed CLL were used as training (n = 309) and validation (n = 230) cohorts. NOTCH1 mutations occurred in 11.0% and 11.3% CLL of the training and validation series, respectively. In the training series, NOTCH1 mutations led to a 3.77-fold increase in the hazard of death and to shorter overall survival (OS; P < .001). Multivariate analysis selected NOTCH1 mutations as an independent predictor of OS after controlling for confounding clinical and biologic variables. The independent prognostic value of NOTCH1 mutations was externally confirmed in the validation series. The poor prognosis conferred by NOTCH1 mutations was attributable, at least in part, to shorter treatment-free survival and higher risk of Richter transformation. Although NOTCH1 mutated patients were devoid of TP53 disruption in more than 90% cases in both training and validation series, the OS predicted by NOTCH1 mutations was similar to that of TP53 mutated/deleted CLL. NOTCH1 mutations are an independent predictor of CLL OS, tend to be mutually exclusive with TP53 abnormalities, and identify cases with a dismal prognosis.","['Rossi, Davide', 'Rasi, Silvia', 'Fabbri, Giulia', 'Spina, Valeria', 'Fangazio, Marco', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Bruscaggin, Alessio', 'Cerri, Michaela', 'Monti, Sara', 'Cresta, Stefania', 'Fama, Rosella', 'De Paoli, Lorenzo', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Capello, Daniela', 'Rabadan, Raul', 'Pasqualucci, Laura', 'Dalla-Favera, Riccardo', 'Foa, Robin', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Rossi D', 'Rasi S', 'Fabbri G', 'Spina V', 'Fangazio M', 'Forconi F', 'Marasca R', 'Laurenti L', 'Bruscaggin A', 'Cerri M', 'Monti S', 'Cresta S', 'Fama R', 'De Paoli L', 'Bulian P', 'Gattei V', 'Guarini A', 'Deaglio S', 'Capello D', 'Rabadan R', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Dalla-Favera R', 'Foa R', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy. rossidav@med.unipmn.it']",['eng'],"['P01 CA092625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA092625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111110,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",PMC3257017,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38639-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-09-379966 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 12;119(2):521-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-09-379966.

In the present study of 500 patients with de novo AML, DNMT3A mutations were identified in 14% of total patients and in 22.9% of AML patients with normal karyotype. DNMT3A mutations were positively associated with older age, higher WBC and platelet counts, intermediate-risk and normal cytogenetics, FLT3 internal tandem duplication, and NPM1, PTPN11, and IDH2 mutations, but were negatively associated with CEBPA mutations. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the DNMT3A mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and relapse-free survival in total patients and also in normokaryotype group. A scoring system incorporating the DNMT3A mutation and 8 other prognostic factors, including age, WBC count, cytogenetics, and gene mutations, into survival analysis was very useful in stratifying AML patients into different prognostic groups (P < .001). Sequential study of 138 patients during the clinical course showed that DNMT3A mutations were stable during AML evolution. In conclusion, DNMT3A mutations are associated with distinct clinical and biologic features and poor prognosis in de novo AML patients. Furthermore, the DNMT3A mutation may be a potential biomarker for monitoring of minimal residual disease.","['Hou, Hsin-An', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Liu, Chieh-Yu', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Lee, Ming Cheng', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Lin, Liang-In', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Huang, Chi-Fei', 'Chiang, Ying-Chieh', 'Lee, Fen-Yu', 'Liu, Ming-Chih', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yao, Ming', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Hou HA', 'Kuo YY', 'Liu CY', 'Chou WC', 'Lee MC', 'Chen CY', 'Lin LI', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Chiang YC', 'Lee FY', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Hsu SC', 'Wu SJ', 'Tsay W', 'Chen YC', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111110,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38643-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-369934 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 12;119(2):559-68. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-369934.

It inhibits enzymes involved in the folate pathway, for which the presence of its free carboxylic groups is necessary. The heteroaromatic ring system of Pem has a modifiable amino group, which opens a possibility to apply a new strategy to conjugate Pem to carrier molecules. Considering this as well as the necessity of untouched carboxylic groups of Pem in the new conjugates, we developed a new synthesis strategy. Here, we describe the synthesis and the characterization of new Pem-peptide conjugates in which cell-penetrating octaarginine or/and lung-targeting H-Ile-Glu-Leu-Leu-Gln-Ala-Arg-NH(2) peptide is attached to the drug by thioether bond. The conjugates characterized by RP-HPLC and MS exhibited cytostatic effect in vitro on non-small cell lung carcinoma as well as on human leukemia cell lines. The IC(50) values of the conjugates were similar, but the conjugates with H-Ile-Glu-Leu-Leu-Gln-Ala-Arg-NH(2) sequence were slightly more effective. Our data show that the in vitro cytostatic effect of the free Pem was essentially maintained after conjugation with cell-penetrating or cell-targeting peptides. Thus, the conjugation strategy reported could lead to the development of a new generation of active Pem conjugates.","['Miklan, Zsanett', 'Orban, Erika', 'Banoczi, Zoltan', 'Hudecz, Ferenc']","['Miklan Z', 'Orban E', 'Banoczi Z', 'Hudecz F']","['Research Group of Peptide Chemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/*chemical synthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Carriers/*chemical synthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Glutamates/*chemical synthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia', 'Pemetrexed']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/09 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/psc.1407 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Sci. 2011 Dec;17(12):805-11. doi: 10.1002/psc.1407.,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Glutamates)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2011 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator for controlling energy metabolism, is activated in response to ATP-exhausting stress. We investigated whether cellular energy homeostasis is associated with maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency in mouse ESCs (mESCs) by using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) as an activator of AMPK. We demonstrate that AICAR treatment activates the p53/p21 pathway and markedly inhibits proliferation of R1 mESCs by inducing G(1) /S-phase cell cycle arrest, without influencing apoptosis. Treatment with AICAR also significantly reduces pluripotent stem cell markers, Nanog and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1, in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor, without affecting expression of Oct4. H9 human ESCs also responded to AICAR with induction of p53 activation and repression of Nanog expression. AICAR reduced Nanog mRNA levels in mESCs transiently, an effect not due to expression of miR-134 which can suppress Nanog expression. AICAR induced Nanog degradation, an effect inhibited by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Although AICAR reduced embryoid body formation from mESCs, it increased expression levels of erythroid cell lineage markers (Ter119, GATA1, Klf1, Hbb-b, and Hbb-bh1). Although erythroid differentiation was enhanced by AICAR, endothelial lineage populations were remarkably reduced in AICAR-treated cells. Our results suggest that energy metabolism regulated by AMPK activity may control the balance of self-renewal and differentiation of ESCs.","['Chae, Hee-Don', 'Lee, Man-Ryul', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E']","['Chae HD', 'Lee MR', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL056416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL067384/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL67384/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Adenylate Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Embryoid Bodies/cytology/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Activators/*pharmacology', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lewis X Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC3349353,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.778 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Feb;30(2):140-9. doi: 10.1002/stem.778.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (NANOG protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '53IEF47846 (acadesine)', 'EC 2.7.4.3 (Adenylate Kinase)']",,['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],,,['NIHMS374016'],,,,,,,,,,

In the last decade, several studies suggested that PrP(C) displays antiviral properties by restricting the replication of different viruses, and in particular retroviruses such as murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this context, we previously showed that PrP(C) displays important similarities with the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein and found that PrP(C) expression in a human cell line strongly reduced HIV-1 expression and virus production. Using different PrP(C) mutants, we report here that the anti-HIV-1 properties are mostly associated with the amino-terminal 24-KRPKP-28 basic domain. In agreement with its reported RNA chaperone activity, we found that PrP(C) binds to the viral genomic RNA of HIV-1 and negatively affects its translation. Using a combination of biochemical and cell imaging strategies, we found that PrP(C) colocalizes with the virus assembly machinery at the plasma membrane and at the virological synapse in infected T cells. Depletion of PrP(C) in infected T cells and microglial cells favors HIV-1 replication, confirming its negative impact on the HIV-1 life cycle.","['Alais, Sandrine', 'Soto-Rifo, Ricardo', 'Balter, Vincent', 'Gruffat, Henri', 'Manet, Evelyne', 'Schaeffer, Laurent', 'Darlix, Jean Luc', 'Cimarelli, Andrea', 'Raposo, Graca', 'Ohlmann, Theophile', 'Leblanc, Pascal']","['Alais S', 'Soto-Rifo R', 'Balter V', 'Gruffat H', 'Manet E', 'Schaeffer L', 'Darlix JL', 'Cimarelli A', 'Raposo G', 'Ohlmann T', 'Leblanc P']","['Universite de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111111,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis', 'HIV-1/genetics/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'PrPC Proteins/analysis/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00018-011-0879-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2012 Apr;69(8):1331-52. doi: 10.1007/s00018-011-0879-z.

METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients treated with MTX in MS centers under the Italian national health care system between 1998 and 2008. Demographic, disease, treatment, and follow-up information were collected using hospital records. RESULTS: Data were available for 3,220 patients (63% women) from 40 Italian centers. Follow-up (mean +/- SD) was 49 +/- 29 months (range 12-140 months). We observed 30 cases of AML (incidence 0.93% [95% confidence interval 0.60%-1.26%]). The mean cumulative dose was higher in patients with AML (78 vs 65 mg/m(2), p = 0.028). The median interval from the start of therapy to AML diagnosis was longer than expected at 33 months (range 13-84 months); 8 patients (27%) developed AML 4 years or more after the first MTX infusion. The rate of mortality associated with AML was 37%. CONCLUSIONS: This higher than expected risk of AML and related mortality requires that treatment decisions must be made jointly between clinicians and patients who understand their prognosis, treatment options, and treatment-related risks. The now large exposed MS population must be monitored for hematologic abnormalities for at least 6 years from the end of therapy, to ensure the rapid actions needed for early diagnosis and treatment of AML.","['Martinelli, V', 'Cocco, E', 'Capra, R', 'Salemi, G', 'Gallo, P', 'Capobianco, M', 'Pesci, I', 'Ghezzi, A', 'Pozzilli, C', 'Lugaresi, A', 'Bellantonio, P', 'Amato, M P', 'Grimaldi, L M', 'Trojano, M', 'Mancardi, G L', 'Bergamaschi, R', 'Gasperini, C', 'Rodegher, M', 'Straffi, L', 'Ponzio, M', 'Comi, G']","['Martinelli V', 'Cocco E', 'Capra R', 'Salemi G', 'Gallo P', 'Capobianco M', 'Pesci I', 'Ghezzi A', 'Pozzilli C', 'Lugaresi A', 'Bellantonio P', 'Amato MP', 'Grimaldi LM', 'Trojano M', 'Mancardi GL', 'Bergamaschi R', 'Gasperini C', 'Rodegher M', 'Straffi L', 'Ponzio M', 'Comi G']","['Department of Neurology, INSPE, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. martinelli.vittorio@hsr.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111109,United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,IM,"['Aged', 'Analgesics/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/*adverse effects', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/01/11 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['WNL.0b013e318238ee00 [pii]', '10.1212/WNL.0b013e318238ee00 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurology. 2011 Nov 22;77(21):1887-95. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318238ee00.

Patients with CML-AP (N = 137) with at least 24 months of follow-up or who discontinued early were evaluated to determine the efficacy and tolerability of nilotinib. The majority (55%) of patients achieved a confirmed hematologic response, and 31% attained a confirmed complete hematologic response on nilotinib treatment. Overall, 32% of patients achieved major cytogenetic responses (MCyR), with most being complete cytogenetic responses. Responses were durable, with 66% of patients maintaining MCyR at 24 months.

The etiology of ALL is believed to be multifactorial and likely to involve an interplay of environmental and genetic variables. We performed a genome-wide association study of 355 750 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 474 controls and 419 childhood ALL cases characterized by a t(12;21)(p13;q22) - the most common chromosomal translocation observed in childhood ALL - which leads to an ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion. The eight most strongly associated SNPs were followed-up in 951 ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases and 3061 controls from Germany/Austria and Italy, respectively. We identified a novel, genome-wide significant risk locus at 3q28 (TP63, rs17505102, P(CMH)=8.94 x 10(-9), OR=0.65). The separate analysis of the combined German/Austrian sample only, revealed additional genome-wide significant associations at 11q11 (OR8U8, rs1945213, P=9.14 x 10(-11), OR=0.69) and 8p21.3 (near INTS10, rs920590, P=6.12 x 10(-9), OR=1.36). These associations and another association at 11p11.2 (PTPRJ, rs3942852, P=4.95 x 10(-7), OR=0.72) remained significant in the German/Austrian replication panel after correction for multiple testing. Our findings demonstrate that germline genetic variation can specifically contribute to the risk of ETV6-RUNX1-positive childhood ALL. The identification of TP63 and PTPRJ as susceptibility genes emphasize the role of the TP53 gene family and the importance of proteins regulating cellular processes in connection with tumorigenesis.","['Ellinghaus, E', 'Stanulla, M', 'Richter, G', 'Ellinghaus, D', 'te Kronnie, G', 'Cario, G', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Horstmann, M', 'Panzer Grumayer, R', 'Cave, H', 'Trka, J', 'Cinek, O', 'Teigler-Schlegel, A', 'ElSharawy, A', 'Hasler, R', 'Nebel, A', 'Meissner, B', 'Bartram, T', 'Lescai, F', 'Franceschi, C', 'Giordan, M', 'Nurnberg, P', 'Heinzow, B', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Schreiber, S', 'Schrappe, M', 'Franke, A']","['Ellinghaus E', 'Stanulla M', 'Richter G', 'Ellinghaus D', 'te Kronnie G', 'Cario G', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Horstmann M', 'Panzer Grumayer R', 'Cave H', 'Trka J', 'Cinek O', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'ElSharawy A', 'Hasler R', 'Nebel A', 'Meissner B', 'Bartram T', 'Lescai F', 'Franceschi C', 'Giordan M', 'Nurnberg P', 'Heinzow B', 'Zimmermann M', 'Schreiber S', 'Schrappe M', 'Franke A']","['Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111111,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics']",PMC3356560,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011302 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.302 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):902-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.302.

The discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation and other biomarkers has advanced our understanding of these diseases. There is a strong association between the presence of the JAK2V617F mutation and the development of thrombosis in ET. If venous thrombosis presents with unusual manifestations, the diagnosis of a MPN, such as PV or ET, should be part of the differentials. Treatment of venous thrombosis in MPN follows the same principle as in other patients with venous thrombosis, but careful attention to primary and secondary prophylaxis in addition to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be given. Cytoreductive therapy is indicated in high-risk subgroups of PV and ET patients, and alternative therapeutic agents have different effects on risk of venous thrombosis. New therapeutic approaches are emerging, and JAK2 inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors and next-generation anticoagulants are in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of MPN, but their exact role in thrombosis prevention and treatment remains unclear.","['Reikvam, H', 'Tiu, R V']","['Reikvam H', 'Tiu RV']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Medicine University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111111,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Phlebotomy', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*complications/genetics', 'Venous Thromboembolism/*etiology/prevention & control/therapy']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011314 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.314 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):563-71. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.314.

There is additional evidence that PLAGL2 can function as a tumor suppressor by initiating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, PLAGL2 has also been implicated in human myelodysplastic syndrome, a disease that is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and can lead to fatal cytopenias (low blood counts) as a result of increased apoptosis in the marrow, or, in about one-third of cases, can progress to AML. To gain a better understanding of the actions of PLAGL2 in human myeloid cells, we generated a stable PLAGL2-inducible cell line, using human promonocytic U937 cells. PLAGL2 expression inhibited cell proliferation which correlated with an accumulation of cells in G1, apoptotic DNA-laddering, an increase in caspase 3, 8, and 9 activity, and a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. There was significant increase in the p53 homologue, p73, with PLAGL2 expression, and consistent with mechanisms of p73-regulated cell cycle control and apoptosis, there was increased expression of known p73 target genes p21, DR5, TRAIL, and Bax. PLAGL2-induced cell cycle block was abolished in the presence of p73 siRNA. Together, these data support a role for PLAGL2 in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis via activation of p73.","['Hanks, Tracey S', 'Gauss, Katherine A']","['Hanks TS', 'Gauss KA']","['Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Montana State University, 960 Technology Blvd., Bozeman, MT 59718, USA.']",['eng'],['P20 RR-024237/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0672-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2012 Mar;17(3):236-47. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0672-3.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PLAGL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 61-year-old female was admitted due to fatigue, weight loss, and exertional dyspnea. Plasmacytoid cells were counted up to 76% at a peripheral blood film, but bone marrow aspiration failed because of dry-tapping. Flow cytometric analysis showed positive for CD138 and cytoplasmic kappa light chain. Chromosome analysis revealed t(6;14)(p21;q32), which was confirmed by an IGH split-out probe in FISH analysis. Immunofixation electrophoresis also presented monoclonal bands identified as IgG and kappa light chain. Finally, she was diagnosed as primary PCL associated with t(6;14) and IGH rearrangement. Although considerable advances have been made in the understanding of the biology and molecular pathogenesis of PCL, further clinical, laboratory, and genetic studies of PCL associated with such a rare IGH rearrangement would be necessary in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PCL associated with t(6;14) as a sole chromosomal abnormality.","['Cho, Sun Young', 'Lim, Gayoung', 'Oh, Seung Hwan', 'Lee, Hee Joo', 'Suh, Jin-Tae', 'Lee, Juhie', 'Lee, Woo-In', 'Lee, Hong Ghi', 'Yoon, Hwi-Joong', 'Park, Tae Sung']","['Cho SY', 'Lim G', 'Oh SH', 'Lee HJ', 'Suh JT', 'Lee J', 'Lee WI', 'Lee HG', 'Yoon HJ', 'Park TS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Syndecan-1/blood', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['41/3/277 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2011 Summer;41(3):277-81.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (SDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Syndecan-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Androgens have been shown to down-regulate GnRH mRNA levels through an androgen receptor (AR)-dependent mechanism. Here, we investigate how androgen regulates expression from the GnRH regulatory region in the GT1-7 cell line, a model of GnRH neurons. A synthetic androgen, R1881, repressed transcription from the GnRH promoter (GnRH-P) in an AR-dependent manner, and liganded AR associated with the chromatin at the GnRH-P in live GT1-7 cells. The three known octamer-binding transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) binding sites in GnRH-P were required for AR-mediated repression, although other sequences were also involved. Although a multimer of the consensus Oct-1 binding site was not repressed, a multimer of the cluster of Oct-1, Pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor (Pbx)/Prep, and NK2 homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1) binding sites, found at -106/-91 in GnRH-P, was sufficient for repression. In fact, overexpression of any of these factors disrupted the androgen response, indicating that a balance of factors in this tripartite complex is required for AR repression. AR bound to this region in EMSA, indicating a direct interaction of AR with DNA or with other transcription factors bound to GnRH-P at this sequence. Collectively, our data demonstrate that GnRH transcription is repressed by AR via multiple sequences in GnRH-P, including three Oct-1 binding sites, and that this repression requires the complex interaction of several transcription factors.","['Brayman, Melissa J', 'Pepa, Patricia A', 'Berdy, Sara E', 'Mellon, Pamela L']","['Brayman MJ', 'Pepa PA', 'Berdy SE', 'Mellon PL']","['Department of Reproductive Medicine and The Center for Reproductive Science and Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0674, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HD072754/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD007203/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD020377/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HD020377/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK044838/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HD012303/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HD012303/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DA007315/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES010337/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK063491/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 HD058460/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111110,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,IM,"['Androgens/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Female', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metribolone/pharmacology', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",PMC3248321,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/07/03 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2011-1015 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2011-1015 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2012 Jan;26(1):2-13. doi: 10.1210/me.2011-1015.

The success of implantation further relies upon a two-way dialogue between the embryo and uterus. However, molecular bases of these preimplantation and implantation processes in humans are not well known. We performed genome expression analyses of human embryos (n = 128) and human endometria (n = 8). We integrated these data with protein-protein interactions in order to identify molecular networks within the endometrium and the embryo, and potential embryo-endometrium interactions at the time of implantation. For that, we applied a novel network profiling algorithm HyperModules, which combines topological module identification and functional enrichment analysis. We found a major wave of transcriptional down-regulation in preimplantation embryos. In receptive-stage endometrium, several genes and signaling pathways were identified, including JAK-STAT signaling and inflammatory pathways. The main curated embryo-endometrium interaction network highlighted the importance of cell adhesion molecules in the implantation process. We also identified cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions involved in implantation, where osteopontin (SPP1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and leptin (LEP) pathways were intertwining. Further, we identified a number of novel players in human embryo-endometrium interactions, such as apolipoprotein D (APOD), endothelin 1 (END1), fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7), gastrin (GAST), kringle containing trnasmembrane protein 1 (KREMEN1), neuropilin 1 (NRP1), serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A member 3 (SERPINA3), versican (VCAN), and others.

Their effects result from gene regulations via the GC receptor (NR3C1/GR), but it is unknown how these changes evolve, what the primary GR targets are, and to what extent responses differ between ALL subtypes and nonlymphoid malignancies. We delineated the transcriptional response to GC on the exon level in a time-resolved manner in a precursor B- and a T childhood ALL model employing Exon microarrays and combined this with genome-wide NR3C1-binding site detection using chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip technology. This integrative approach showed that the response was strongly influenced by kinetics and extent of GR autoinduction in both models. Although remarkable differences between the ALL systems were apparent, we defined a set of common response genes enriched in apoptosis-related processes. Globally, GR binding was higher for GC-induced vs. -repressed genes, suggesting that GR mediates gene repression by interaction with distant enhancers or by cross talk with other transcription factors. Exon level analysis defined several new GC-regulated transcript variants of genes, including ATP4B, GPR98, TBCD, and ZBTB16. Our study provides unprecedented insight into the transcriptional response to GC in ALL cells, essential to understand this biologically and clinically important phenomenon. We found evidence of cell type-specific as well as common responses, possibly related to apoptosis induction, and detected induction of novel transcript variants by GC in the investigated systems. Finally, we implemented a bioinformatic framework that might be useful for high-density microarray analyses to identify alternative transcript variant expression.","['Rainer, Johannes', 'Lelong, Julien', 'Bindreither, Daniel', 'Mantinger, Christine', 'Ploner, Christian', 'Geley, Stephan', 'Kofler, Reinhard']","['Rainer J', 'Lelong J', 'Bindreither D', 'Mantinger C', 'Ploner C', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R']","['Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.

In the case of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), the key external factor that maintains their undifferentiated state is the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF removal causes mESCs to exit their pluripotent state and differentiate into more restricted precursors. Although LIF is known to activate multiple different phosphorylation cascades, the mechanisms by which its removal leads to mESC differentiation are not well understood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In order to identify the molecular events that occur upon LIF removal, we developed a set of novel experimental approaches that allowed identification and quantification of global phosphorylation changes that occur when mESCs are deprived of LIF. These included growth of mESCs on permeable membranes and development of a robust and sensitive phospho-proteomics platform to quantify early signaling events. RESULTS: In addition to the well-characterized tyrosine 705 phosphorylation of STAT3, LIF removal results in the rapid phosphorylation of multiple other proteins known to regulate the mESC self-renewal on both tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues. We hypothesize that these unique posttranslational modifications help drive the exit of mESCs from the pluripotent state. CONCLUSIONS: Our data set the stage for future studies investigating the functional role of these phosphorylation events in mESCs. These studies were greatly facilitated by the National Blood Foundation, whose support in the crucial initiation phase of these studies was invaluable.","['Luckey, C John', 'Lu, Yu', 'Marto, Jarrod A']","['Luckey CJ', 'Lu Y', 'Marto JA']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. cluckey@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['K08 AI063386/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AI063386-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL111866/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AI063386-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2 HL102815/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2 HL102815-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Organism', 'Coculture Techniques/instrumentation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",PMC3293186,2011/12/07 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03374.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2011 Nov;51 Suppl 4:118S-124S. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03374.x.,,,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,['(c) 2011 American Association of Blood Banks.'],,,['NIHMS343486'],,,,,,,,,,

Novel therapeutic approaches directly targeting pulmonary vascular remodeling are warranted. AREAS COVERED: This review delineates the current limitations in the management of PAH and focuses on a novel, anti-proliferative therapeutic concept. It will help readers understand the mechanisms of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, with a special focus on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors and their role in the pathobiology of PAH. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive summary regarding the rationale, efficacy and safety of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate , which potently inhibits the PDGF receptor, as an additional treatment option in PAH. EXPERT OPINION: PDGF is a potent mitogen for pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and represents an important mediator of pulmonary vascular remodeling. Imatinib mesylate, a compound that inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase and was developed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, also targets PDGF receptors. Both experimental and clinical data indicate that it reverses the vascular remodeling process even when it is fully established. Results from Phase II and III clinical trials suggest potent and prolonged efficacy in patients with severe PAH (i.e., pulmonary vascular resistance > 800 dynes*s*cm(-5)). Future studies should evaluate the long-term clinical efficacy and safety of imatinib, including patients with less impaired hemodynamics. Based on the current knowledge, this compound is likely to become an additional treatment option for patients with PAH and has the potential to at least partially correct the pathology of the disease.","['ten Freyhaus, Henrik', 'Dumitrescu, Daniel', 'Berghausen, Eva', 'Vantler, Marius', 'Caglayan, Evren', 'Rosenkranz, Stephan']","['ten Freyhaus H', 'Dumitrescu D', 'Berghausen E', 'Vantler M', 'Caglayan E', 'Rosenkranz S']","['Klinik III fur Innere Medizin, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, Universitat zu Koln, Kerpener Str. 62, 50924 Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111111,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/15 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.632408 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Jan;21(1):119-34. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.632408.

A retrospective analysis of 589 high risk patient-episodes revealed that 125 of 155 'possible' (81%) and 12 of 16 'probable' (75%) cases of IA should be changed to 'non-classifiable' when the new criteria were applied.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective-prospective study analyzed the medical records of the Department of Pediatrics in Tuzla of 334 patients in age from 0 to 14 years, in which the clinical signs of palpable lymph nodes of one or more regions was diagnosed in the period from January 1st 1998 to June 30th 2003. The anamnesis data, clinical findings, diagnostic procedures results, therapeutic approach and disease outcome etiology defined lymphadenopathy were analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 334 children, localized lymphadenopathy have been verified in 230, and generalized in 104. Male/female ratio was 1:1.8. Final results of our study have shown the etiologies as following: Infectious etiologies, 79.34%, neoplastic 11.34%, and non-neoplastic 9.28%. In neoplastic etiologies, lymphoblastic leukemia has been the most often verified neoplastic disease (68.4%), not related to the age or sex of patient, and equally presented as localized and generalized lymphadenopathy. In this study lymphomas were presented by generalized lymphadenopathy. CONCLUSION: The regional and generalized lymphadenopathy in children depends on their etiology and has significant prognostic value for the disease.","['Latifagic, Amila', 'Iljazovic, Ermina', 'Colic, Belkisa', 'Mladina, Nada']","['Latifagic A', 'Iljazovic E', 'Colic B', 'Mladina N']","['Pediatric Clinic, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Trnovac bb, 75000 Tuzla, Bosna i Hercegovina. a_latifagic@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Med Arh,Medicinski arhiv,0400722,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphatic Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Male']",,2011/11/12 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/11/12 06:00'],"['2011/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5455/medarh.2011.65.295-299 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Arh. 2011;65(5):295-9. doi: 10.5455/medarh.2011.65.295-299.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This plant is widely known in Brazilian traditional medicine for its use in the treatment of several kinds of cancer, including leukaemia, prostate and breast cancers. Here, we investigated the effect of euphol on experimental models of colitis and the underlying mechanisms involved in its action. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Colitis was induced in mice either with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and the effect of euphol (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) on colonic injury was assessed. Pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines were measured by immunohistochemistry, enzyme-Linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry. Preventive and therapeutic oral administration of euphol attenuated both DSS- and TNBS-induced acute colitis as observed by a significant reduction of the disease activity index (DAI), histological/microscopic damage score and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in colonic tissue. Likewise, euphol treatment also inhibited colon tissue levels and expression of IL-1beta, CXCL1/KC, MCP-1, MIP-2, TNF-alpha and IL-6, while reducing NOS2, VEGF and Ki67 expression in colonic tissue. This action seems to be likely associated with inhibition of activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). In addition, euphol decreased LPS-induced MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma, but increased IL-10 secretion from bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro. Of note, euphol, at the same schedule of treatment, markedly inhibited both selectin (P- and E-selectin) and integrin (ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and LFA-1) expression in colonic tissue. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these results clearly demonstrated that orally-administered euphol, both preventive or therapeutic treatment were effective in reducing the severity of colitis in two models of chemically-induced mouse colitis and suggest this plant-derived compound might be a potential molecule in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases.","['Dutra, Rafael C', 'Claudino, Rafaela F', 'Bento, Allisson F', 'Marcon, Rodrigo', 'Schmidt, Eder C', 'Bouzon, Zenilda L', 'Pianowski, Luiz F', 'Calixto, Joao B']","['Dutra RC', 'Claudino RF', 'Bento AF', 'Marcon R', 'Schmidt EC', 'Bouzon ZL', 'Pianowski LF', 'Calixto JB']","['Department of Pharmacology, Centre of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111102,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Colitis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Lanosterol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3206917,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027122 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-08421 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27122. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027122.

However, little is known about NSPC from the adult human spinal cord as a donor source. We demonstrate for the first time that multipotent and self-renewing NSPC can be cultured, passaged and transplanted from the adult human spinal cord of organ transplant donors. Adult human spinal cord NSPC require an adherent substrate for selection and expansion in EGF (epidermal growth factor) and FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor) enriched medium. NSPC as an adherent monolayer can be passaged for at least 9 months and form neurospheres when plated in suspension culture. In EGF/FGF2 culture, NSPC proliferate and primarily express nestin and Sox2, and low levels of markers for differentiating cells. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promotes NSPC proliferation and significantly enhances GFAP expression in hypoxia. In differentiating conditions in the presence of serum, these NSPC show multipotentiality, expressing markers of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) significantly enhances neuronal differentiation. We transplanted the multipotent NSPC into SCI rats and show that the xenografts survive, are post-mitotic, and retain the capacity to differentiate into neurons and glia.Together, these findings reveal that multipotent self-renewing NSPC cultured and passaged from adult human spinal cords of organ transplant donors, respond to exogenous factors that promote selective differentiation, and survive and differentiate after transplantation into the injured spinal cord.","['Mothe, Andrea J', 'Zahir, Tasneem', 'Santaguida, Carlo', 'Cook, Douglas', 'Tator, Charles H']","['Mothe AJ', 'Zahir T', 'Santaguida C', 'Cook D', 'Tator CH']","['Division of Genetics and Development, Toronto Western Research Institute and Krembil Neuroscience Centre, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. amothe@uhnres.utoronto.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111102,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Neural Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Spinal Cord/*cytology']",PMC3206885,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027079 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-09439 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27079. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027079.

We observed in this model that miR-223 significantly suppressed the proliferation, growth rate, colony formation of HeLa cells in vitro, and in vivo tumorigenicity or tumor formation in nude mice. To investigate the mechanisms involved, we scanned and examined the potential and putative target molecules of miR-223 by informatics, quantitative PCR and Western blot, and found that insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was the functional target of miR-223 inhibition of cell proliferation. Targeting IGF-1R by miR-223 was not only seen in HeLa cells, but also in leukemia and hepatoma cells. The downstream pathway, Akt/mTOR/p70S6K, to which the signal was mediated by IGF-1R, was inhibited as well. The relative luciferase activity of the reporter containing wild-type 3'UTR(3'untranslated region) of IGF-1R was significantly suppressed, but the mutant not. Silence of IGF-1R expression by vector-based short hairpin RNA resulted in the similar inhibition with miR-223. Contrarily, rescued IGF-1R expression in the cells that over-expressed miR-223, reversed the inhibition caused by miR-223 via introducing IGF-1R cDNA that didn't contain the 3'UTR. Meanwhile, we also noted that miR-223 targeted Rasa1, but the downstream molecules mediated by Rasa1 was neither targeted nor regulated. Therefore we believed that IGF-1R was the functional target for miR-223 suppression of cell proliferation and its downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway suppressed by miR-223 was by targeting IGF-1R.","['Jia, Cheng You', 'Li, Hui Hui', 'Zhu, Xu Chao', 'Dong, Yi Wei', 'Fu, Da', 'Zhao, Qian Lei', 'Wu, Wei', 'Wu, Xing Zhong']","['Jia CY', 'Li HH', 'Zhu XC', 'Dong YW', 'Fu D', 'Zhao QL', 'Wu W', 'Wu XZ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Key Lab of Glycoconjugate Research, Ministry of Public Health, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111102,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",PMC3206888,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027008 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-10968 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27008. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027008.

The UL35 gene from human cytomegalovirus is important for viral gene expression and efficient replication and encodes two proteins, UL35 and UL35a, whose mechanism of action is not well understood. Here, affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry was used to identify previously unknown human cellular targets of UL35 and UL35a. We demonstrate that both viral proteins interact with the ubiquitin-specific protease USP7, and that UL35 expression can alter USP7 subcellular localization. In addition, UL35 (but not UL35a) was found to associate with three components of the Cul4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (DCAF1, DDB1, and DDA1) previously shown to be targeted by the HIV-1 Vpr protein. The coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy of DCAF1 mutants revealed that the C-terminal region of DCAF1 is required for association with UL35 and mediates the dramatic relocalization of DCAF1 to UL35 nuclear bodies, which also contain conjugated ubiquitin. As previously reported for the Vpr-DCAF1 interaction, UL35 (but not UL35a) expression resulted in the accumulation of cells in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle, which is typical of a DNA damage response, and activated the G(2) checkpoint in a DCAF1-dependent manner. In addition, UL35 (but not UL35a) induced gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 foci, indicating the activation of DNA damage and repair responses. Therefore, the identified interactions suggest that UL35 can contribute to viral replication through the manipulation of host responses.","['Salsman, Jayme', 'Jagannathan, Madhav', 'Paladino, Patrick', 'Chan, Pak-Kei', 'Dellaire, Graham', 'Raught, Brian', 'Frappier, Lori']","['Salsman J', 'Jagannathan M', 'Paladino P', 'Chan PK', 'Dellaire G', 'Raught B', 'Frappier L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111109,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology/*virology', '*DNA Repair', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', '*Proteomics', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3255807,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/02/23 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05442-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05442-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Jan;86(2):806-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05442-11.

This situation can be mimicked by in vitro stimulation with CD40 ligand (CD40L) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). Our study investigates the impact of the drug leflunomide to overcome apoptosis resistance of CLL cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CLL cells were stimulated with CD40L and IL-4 and treated with fludarabine and the leflunomide metabolite A771726. RESULTS: Resistance to fludarabine-mediated apoptosis was induced by CD40 activation alone stimulating high levels of BCL-XL and MCL1 protein expression. Apoptosis resistance was further enhanced by a complementary Janus-activated kinase (JAK)/STAT signal induced by IL-4. In contrast, CLL proliferation required both a CD40 and a JAK/STAT signal and could be completely blocked by pan-JAK inhibition. Leflunomide (A771726) antagonized CD40L/IL-4-induced proliferation at very low concentrations (3 mug/mL) reported to inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. At a concentration of 10 mug/mL, A771726 additionally attenuated STAT3/6 phosphorylation, whereas apoptosis of CD40L/IL-4-activated (""resistant"") CLL cells was achieved with higher concentrations (IC(50): 80 mug/mL). Apoptosis was also effectively induced by A771726 in clinically refractory CLL cells with and without a defective p53 pathway. Induction of apoptosis involved inhibition of NF-kappaB activity and loss of BCL-XL and MCL1 expression. In combination with fludarabine, A771726 synergistically induced apoptosis (IC(50): 56 mug/mL). CONCLUSION: We thus show that A771726 overcomes CD40L/IL-4-mediated resistance to fludarabine in CLL cells of untreated as well as clinically refractory CLL cells.

We used a BCR-ABL1 transduction/transplantation mouse model to study the mechanisms of DLI in MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched allogeneic chimeras with CML-like leukemia, in which DLI can be administered at the time of transplantation (early) or after recovery of hematopoiesis (delayed). After early DLI, CML-like leukemia cannot be transferred into immunocompetent secondary recipients as soon as 4 days after primary transplantation, demonstrating that cotransplantation of T lymphocytes blocks the engraftment of BCR-ABL1-transduced stem cells. In contrast, in allogeneic chimeras with established CML-like leukemia, combined treatment with delayed DLI and the kinase inhibitor imatinib eradicates leukemia with minimal GVHD. The GVL effect is directed against minor histocompatibility antigens shared by normal and leukemic stem cells, and is mediated predominantly by CD8+ T cells, with minor contributions from CD5- splenocytes, including natural killer cells. These results define a physiologic model of adoptive immunotherapy of CML that will be useful for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of GVL.","['Lu, Yi-Fen', 'Gavrilescu, L Cristina', 'Betancur, Monica', 'Lazarides, Katherine', 'Klingemann, Hans', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Lu YF', 'Gavrilescu LC', 'Betancur M', 'Lazarides K', 'Klingemann H', 'Van Etten RA']","['Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA090576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL093981/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL093981/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA090576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*mortality/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC3251232,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38560-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-331009 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 5;119(1):273-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-331009.

Here, we identified the binding sites for Hoxa9 and the Hox cofactor Meis1 on a genome-wide level and profiled their associated epigenetic modifications and transcriptional targets. Hoxa9 and the Hox cofactor Meis1 cobind at hundreds of highly evolutionarily conserved sites, most of which are distant from transcription start sites. These sites show high levels of histone H3K4 monomethylation and CBP/P300 binding characteristic of enhancers. Furthermore, a subset of these sites shows enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. Many Hoxa9 and Meis1 binding sites are also bound by PU.1 and other lineage-restricted transcription factors previously implicated in establishment of myeloid enhancers. Conditional Hoxa9 activation is associated with CBP/P300 recruitment, histone acetylation, and transcriptional activation of a network of proto-oncogenes, including Erg, Flt3, Lmo2, Myb, and Sox4. Collectively, this work suggests that Hoxa9 regulates transcription by interacting with enhancers of genes important for hematopoiesis and leukemia.","['Huang, Yongsheng', 'Sitwala, Kajal', 'Bronstein, Joel', 'Sanders, Daniel', 'Dandekar, Monisha', 'Collins, Cailin', 'Robertson, Gordon', 'MacDonald, James', 'Cezard, Timothee', 'Bilenky, Misha', 'Thiessen, Nina', 'Zhao, Yongjun', 'Zeng, Thomas', 'Hirst, Martin', 'Hero, Alfred', 'Jones, Steven', 'Hess, Jay L']","['Huang Y', 'Sitwala K', 'Bronstein J', 'Sanders D', 'Dandekar M', 'Collins C', 'Robertson G', 'MacDonald J', 'Cezard T', 'Bilenky M', 'Thiessen N', 'Zhao Y', 'Zeng T', 'Hirst M', 'Hero A', 'Jones S', 'Hess JL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109-0602, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA116570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA151425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116570-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epigenomics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3257007,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38625-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-03-341081 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 12;119(2):388-98. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-03-341081.

Here, the authors describe their experience with a large cohort of patients who were treated at a single institution to describe patterns of recurrence after curative therapy. METHODS: Review of a prospective database was performed. Patient-related, tumor-related, and treatment-related variables were recorded, and the site and timing of initial recurrence were recorded. Factors associated with receipt of adjuvant therapy and recurrence were determined. RESULTS: In total, 364 patients with stage I through III MCC who underwent complete resection were identified. Adjuvant local radiation therapy (RT), lymph node RT, and chemotherapy were received selectively by 23%, 23%, and 15% of patients, respectively. Factors associated with the receipt of adjuvant therapy included younger age, primary tumor features (larger size, lymphovascular invasion [LVI], positive margin excision), and increasing pathologic stage. With median follow-up of 3.6 years, 108 patients (30%) developed a recurrence, including 11 local recurrences (3%), 12 in-transit recurrences (3%), 43 lymph node recurrences (12%), and 42 distant recurrences (12%). Clinically involved lymph nodes, primary tumor LVI, and a history of leukemia/lymphoma were predictive of recurrence. The majority of recurrences (80%) occurred in patients who had clinically involved lymph nodes or patients who did not undergo pathologic lymph node evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: A low recurrence rate in patients with clinically lymph node-negative MCC was achieved with adequate surgery (including sentinel lymph node biopsy) and the selective use of adjuvant RT for high-risk tumors. In contrast, patients with clinically lymph node-positive MCC had significantly higher rates of recurrence, especially distant recurrence. The authors concluded that contemporary natural history studies are critical in designing treatment pathways and clinical trials for MCC.","['Fields, Ryan C', 'Busam, Klaus J', 'Chou, Joanne F', 'Panageas, Katherine S', 'Pulitzer, Melissa P', 'Allen, Peter J', 'Kraus, Dennis H', 'Brady, Mary S', 'Coit, Daniel G']","['Fields RC', 'Busam KJ', 'Chou JF', 'Panageas KS', 'Pulitzer MP', 'Allen PJ', 'Kraus DH', 'Brady MS', 'Coit DG']","['Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111109,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/pathology/surgery/*therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Irradiation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Recurrence', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology/surgery/*therapy']",,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/08/22 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26626 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jul 1;118(13):3311-20. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26626.

Using long distance inverse-polymerase chain reaction, we mapped and sequenced six breakpoints of a complex BCL6 rearrangement t(3;13)(q27;q31)t(12;13)(p11;q31) in DLBCL cells, which places miR-17~92 antisense within the resulting ITPR2-BCL6 chimeric fusion gene rearrangement. MiR-17~92 members were upregulated ~15-fold over controls in a copy number independent manner consistent with structural deregulation. MIR17HG and ITPR2-BCL6 were, despite their close configuration, independently expressed, discounting antisense regulation. MIR17HG in t(3;13)t(12;13) cells proved highly responsive to treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors implicating epigenetic deregulation, consistent with which increased histone-H3 acetylation was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation near the upstream MIR17HG breakpoint. Remarkably, 5/6 DNA breaks in the t(3;13)t(12;13) precisely cut at stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) peaks reminiscent of chromosomal fragile sites, while the sixth lay 150 bp distant. Extended SIDD profiling showed that additional oncomiRs also map to SIDD peaks.

About half of the patients with AML are found to have ""normal"" cytogenetic analysis by standard culture techniques. These patients are considered as an intermediate risk group. Cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) is the largest cytogenetic risk group, and the variation in clinical outcome of patients in this group is greater than in any other cytogenetic group. Besides mutation testing, age and presenting white blood cell count are important predictors of overall survival, suggesting that other factors independent of cytogenetic abnormalities, contribute to the outcome of patients with AML. The expanding knowledge at the genetic and molecular levels is helping define several subgroups of patients with CN-AML with variable prognosis.

Also, certain molecular genetic aberrations characterize DS-related leukemias, such as GATA1 mutations in ML-DS and deregulation of the CRLF2 gene in DS-ALL. Whether microdeletions/microduplications also vary between DS and non-DS cases is presently unclear. To address this issue, we performed single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses of eight pediatric ML-DS and 17 B-cell precursor DS-ALL. In the ML-DS cases, a total of 29 imbalances (20 gains and nine losses) and two partial uniparental isodisomies (pUPDs) were detected. None of the 11 small (defined as <10 Mb) imbalances were recurrent, nor were the pUPDs, whereas of the 18 large aberrations, three were recurrent-dup(1q), +8 and +21. In contrast, several frequent changes were identified in the DS-ALL cases, which harbored 82 imbalances (30 gains and 52 losses) and four pUPDs. Of the 40 large changes, 28 were gains and 12 losses, with +X, dup(Xq), dup(1q), del(7p), dup(8q), del(9p), dup(9p), del(12p), dup(17q), and +21 being recurrent. Of the 40 microdeletions identified, several targeted specific genes, with the following being repeatedly deleted: BTG1 and CDKN2A/B (29% of cases), ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5 and SERP2 (18%), and BTLA, INPP4B, P2RY8, and RB1 (12%). Loss of the SERP2 and INPP4B genes, encoding the stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein family member 2 and the inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase-II, respectively, has previously never been implicated in leukemia. Although deletions of the other genes have been associated with ALL, the high frequency of BTG1 loss is a novel finding. Such deletions may characterize a clinical subgroup of DS-ALL, comprising mainly boys with a high median age. In conclusion, ML-DS and DS-ALL are genetically distinct, with mainly gains in ML-DS and deletions in DS-ALL. Furthermore, DS-ALL is characterized by several recurrent gene deletions, with BTG1 loss being particularly frequent.","['Lundin, Catarina', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Nordgren, Ann', 'Palmqvist, Lars', 'Andersen, Mette Klarskov', 'Biloglav, Andrea', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Lundin C', 'Hjorth L', 'Behrendtz M', 'Nordgren A', 'Palmqvist L', 'Andersen MK', 'Biloglav A', 'Forestier E', 'Paulsson K', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Sweden. catarina.lundin@med.lu.se']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111110,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*genetics']",,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20944 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2012 Feb;51(2):196-206. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20944.

We studied the potential contribution of miRNAs in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell NB4 during the apoptosis induction by arsenic trioxide (ATO). The apoptotic effects of ATO on the NB4 cell line at a pharmacological dose (2 muM) was verified using cell growth and viability assays, MTT assay, BrdU cell proliferation assay, flow cytometric analysis, and caspase-3 activity assay. miRNAs from untreated and 2 muM ATO-treated NB4 cell line were extracted, purified, and converted to complementary DNAs. Differential expressions of 88 cancer-related miRNAs were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription PCR using miRNA PCR cancer-array system. After normalizing to the average Ct value of three housekeeping genes in the array (U6, SNORD47, and SNORD48), the fold change of miRNAs was calculated in the ATO-treated cells as compared to untreated. Among the 88 cancer-focused miRNAs, 51 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed more than 2-fold after ATO treatment. Of these, 48 miRNAs were upregulated up to 21.65-fold changes, while three miRNAs were downregulated up to 5.19-fold changes. By screening the literature, a majority of these upregulated miRNAs were found to have tumor and/or metastatic suppressors' functions associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as well as inhibition of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Our results demonstrate that ATO, at the relevant concentration, modulate a substantial number of cancer-related miRNAs in APL cell line; most of these are known to function as a tumor and/or metastatic suppressors and have confirmed targets involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The results of this study support the hypothesis that miRNAs may play a mediatory role in eliciting the multi-target and pleiotropic action of ATO.","['Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Bashash, Davood', 'Dizaji, Majid Zaki', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran']","['Ghaffari SH', 'Bashash D', 'Dizaji MZ', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Alimoghaddam K']","['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. shghaffari200@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111110,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology']",,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-011-0259-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2012 Feb;33(1):157-72. doi: 10.1007/s13277-011-0259-1.

Moreover, the effects of ER stress and TRAIL in nontransformed cells remain to be investigated. In this study we report that ER stress-inducing agents sensitizes both transformed and nontransformed cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In addition, glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (GRP78) knockdown by RNA interference induces ER stress and facilitates apoptosis by TRAIL. We demonstrate that TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation and early signaling are enhanced in ER stressed cells. ER stress alters the cellular levels of different apoptosis-related proteins including a decline in the levels of FLIP and Mcl-1 and the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2. Up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 following ER stress is dependent on the expression of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and independent of CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and Ire1alpha. Silencing of TRAIL-R2 expression by siRNA blocks the ER stress-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, simultaneous silencing of cFLIP and Mcl-1 expression by RNA interference results in a marked sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Finally, in FLIP-overexpressing cells ER stress-induced sensitization to TRAIL-activated apoptosis is markedly reduced. In summary, our data reveal a pleiotropic mechanism involving both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins for the sensitizing effect of ER stress on the regulation of TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptosis in both transformed and nontransformed cells.","['Martin-Perez, Rosa', 'Niwa, Maho', 'Lopez-Rivas, Abelardo']","['Martin-Perez R', 'Niwa M', 'Lopez-Rivas A']","['Centro Andaluz de Biologia Molecular y Medicina Regenerativa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Sevilla, Spain.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM087415/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM087415/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response', 'Up-Regulation', 'eIF-2 Kinase/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4096301,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0673-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2012 Apr;17(4):349-63. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0673-2.,,,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",,,,,['NIHMS596868'],,,,,,,,,,

HER2-targeted therapies have shown minimal benefit in molecularly unselected patients. We investigated clinical and potential molecular factors associated with HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A total of 224 lung adenocarcinoma samples were examined for activating mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; exons 18-22), V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS; exons 2 and 3), and HER2 (exons 18-21) by direct sequencing. Gene copy number and protein expression of both EGFR and HER2 were further explored in samples harboring HER2 mutations using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: The mutation rates of EGFR, KRAS, HER2 were 63.39% (142/224), 4.46% (10/224), and 3.57% (8/224), respectively. All mutations were mutually exclusive. All eight HER2 mutations occurred in never smokers and seven were in women. The HER2 mutation rate in samples without EGFR and KRAS mutations was 11.11% (8/72). Seven of eight HER2-mutated tumors showed HER2 copy number gains (CNGs) and five showed EGFR CNGs. All of the HER2-mutated samples showed either HER2 or EGFR CNGs. Gene amplification of HER2 and EGFR was mutually exclusive in HER2-mutated samples. CONCLUSION: HER2 mutations in lung adenocarcinoma predominantly occurred in women and never smokers. Most HER2-mutated tumors showed HER2 CNGs. As all of the samples with HER2 mutation showed either HER2 or EGFR CNGs, these patients could potentially benefit from novel EGFR/HER2 dual or pan-erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Li, Chenguang', 'Sun, Yihua', 'Fang, Rong', 'Han, Xiangkun', 'Luo, Xiaoyang', 'Wang, Rui', 'Pan, Yunjian', 'Hu, Haichuan', 'Zhang, Yang', 'Pao, William', 'Shen, Lei', 'Ji, Hongbin', 'Chen, Haiquan']","['Li C', 'Sun Y', 'Fang R', 'Han X', 'Luo X', 'Wang R', 'Pan Y', 'Hu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Pao W', 'Shen L', 'Ji H', 'Chen H']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Aged', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation Rate', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Smoking/genetics', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e318234f0a2 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)31763-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2012 Jan;7(1):85-9. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e318234f0a2.,,,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax1 protein encoded by HTLV-I is known as a transcription activator for viral and cellular genes. We found that the 8C cells expressing the Tax1 protein (8C/TaxWT cells) can produce more progeny viruses than 8C cells when the cells were exposed to cell-free HTLV-I.

The clinical presentation at diagnosis is due to bone marrow infiltration or extra-medullary involvement. Maxillofacial localization is very rare in ALL. We report a case of T-ALL revealed by right cheek swelling in a 14-year-old boy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old boy had presented with a 6 cm right cheek swelling for two months, complicated by pyrexia, cervical adenopathy, and splenomegaly. CT scan revealed a 3x7x8 cm swelling surrounded by voluminous sub chin, subclavicular, mediastinal, and paratracheal bilateral adenopathies. The biological analyses revealed normocytic anemia, hyperleukocytosis with 83.6% blast cells, neutropenia, and thrombopenia. The biopsy histology and the immuno-histochemical analysis suggested a diffuse small-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The myelogram identified a type 1 ALL and immunophenotyping on bone marrow cells suggested phenotype T ALL. The patient was treated according to the MARALL-06 protocol and died on the 17th day of induction, in septic shock. DISCUSSION: Despite their rare occurrence, ALL should be included in the differential diagnosis of jugal swelling. The evident hematological context should suggest the diagnosis and a myelogram should be performed as soon as possible because the outcome is rapidly fatal.","['Nafil, H', 'Tazi, I', 'Mahmal, L']","['Nafil H', 'Tazi I', 'Mahmal L']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Universite Cadi Ayyad, CHU Mohamed VI, Marrakech, Maroc. solhatim@hotmail.com""]",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20111108,France,Rev Stomatol Chir Maxillofac,Revue de stomatologie et de chirurgie maxillo-faciale,0201010,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Edema/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Fever/diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Zygoma/*pathology']",,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2010/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0035-1768(11)00162-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stomax.2011.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Stomatol Chir Maxillofac. 2011 Dec;112(6):379-81. doi: 10.1016/j.stomax.2011.09.003.

This described the general nature of stem and progenitor cells and the pathways of cell development. Recent years have seen many attempts to re-draw the map of haematopoiesis. These have become increasingly complex, and they often envisage multiples routes to some cell types. The 'established' view that self-renewal in haematopoiesis only occurs in HSCs has been challenged by the recognition of self-renewing HSC-derived progenitor cells that display at least some fate restriction. This evolution of how normal haematopoiesis is viewed has inevitable implications for understanding the origins, disease progression and classification of the leukaemias. In essence, some progenitor cells are now seen as possessing a larger repertoire of routes to end-fates than was previously thought.

In 2 immunocompetent mouse brain tumor models (CT26-BALB/c and Tu-2449-B6C3F1), we showed that a nonlytic retroviral replicating vector (Toca 511) stably delivers an optimized cytosine deaminase prodrug activating gene to the tumor lesion and leads to long-term survival after treatment with 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). Survival benefit is dose dependent for both vector and 5-FC, and as few as 4 cycles of 5-FC dosing after Toca 511 therapy provides significant survival advantage. In the virally permissive CT26-BALB/c model, spread of Toca 511 to other tissues, particularly lymphoid tissues, is detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) over a wide range of levels. In the Tu-2449-B6C3F1 model, Toca 511 PCR signal in nontumor tissues is much lower, spread is not always observed, and when observed, is mainly detected in lymphoid tissues at low levels. The difference in vector genome spread correlates with a more effective antiviral restriction element, APOBEC3, present in the B6C3F1 mice. Despite these differences, neither strain showed signs of treatment-related toxicity. These data support the concept that, in immunocompetent animals, a replicating retroviral vector carrying a prodrug activating gene (Toca 511) can spread through a tumor mass, leading to selective elimination of the tumor after prodrug administration, without local or systemic pathology. This concept is under investigation in an ongoing phase I/II clinical trial of Toca 511 in combination with 5-FC in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01156584).","['Ostertag, Derek', 'Amundson, Karin K', 'Lopez Espinoza, Fernando', 'Martin, Bryan', 'Buckley, Taylor', 'Galvao da Silva, Ana Paula', 'Lin, Amy H', 'Valenta, David T', 'Perez, Omar D', 'Ibanez, Carlos E', 'Chen, Ching-I', 'Pettersson, Par L', 'Burnett, Ryan', 'Daublebsky, Veronika', 'Hlavaty, Juraj', 'Gunzburg, Walter', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki', 'Gruber, Harry E', 'Jolly, Douglas J', 'Robbins, Joan M']","['Ostertag D', 'Amundson KK', 'Lopez Espinoza F', 'Martin B', 'Buckley T', 'Galvao da Silva AP', 'Lin AH', 'Valenta DT', 'Perez OD', 'Ibanez CE', 'Chen CI', 'Pettersson PL', 'Burnett R', 'Daublebsky V', 'Hlavaty J', 'Gunzburg W', 'Kasahara N', 'Gruber HE', 'Jolly DJ', 'Robbins JM']","['Tocagen, 3030 Bunker Hill St., San Diego, CA 92109, USA.']",['eng'],['U01 NS059821/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111109,England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flucytosine/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Fluorouracil/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage', 'Glioma/drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3266384,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/05/16 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['nor199 [pii]', '10.1093/neuonc/nor199 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2012 Feb;14(2):145-59. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/nor199.

Small-molecule modulators of HePTP activity may become valuable in treating hematopoietic malignancies such as T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Moreover, such compounds will further elucidate the regulation of MAPKs in hematopoietic cells. Although transient activation of MAPKs is crucial for growth and proliferation, prolonged activation of these important signaling molecules induces differentiation, cell cycle arrest, cell senescence, and apoptosis. Specific HePTP inhibitors may promote the latter and thereby may halt the growth of cancer cells. Here, we report the development of a small molecule that augments ERK1/2 and p38 activation in human T cells, specifically by inhibiting HePTP. Structure-activity relationship analysis, in silico docking studies, and mutagenesis experiments reveal how the inhibitor achieves selectivity for HePTP over related phosphatases by interacting with unique amino acid residues in the periphery of the highly conserved catalytic pocket. Importantly, we utilize this compound to show that pharmacological inhibition of HePTP not only augments but also prolongs activation of ERK1/2 and, especially, p38. Moreover, we present similar effects in leukocytes from mice intraperitoneally injected with the inhibitor at doses as low as 3 mg/kg. Our results warrant future studies with this probe compound that may establish HePTP as a new drug target for acute leukemic conditions.","['Sergienko, Eduard', 'Xu, Jian', 'Liu, Wallace H', 'Dahl, Russell', 'Critton, David A', 'Su, Ying', 'Brown, Brock T', 'Chan, Xochella', 'Yang, Li', 'Bobkova, Ekaterina V', 'Vasile, Stefan', 'Yuan, Hongbin', 'Rascon, Justin', 'Colayco, Sharon', 'Sidique, Shyama', 'Cosford, Nicholas D P', 'Chung, Thomas D Y', 'Mustelin, Tomas', 'Page, Rebecca', 'Lombroso, Paul J', 'Tautz, Lutz']","['Sergienko E', 'Xu J', 'Liu WH', 'Dahl R', 'Critton DA', 'Su Y', 'Brown BT', 'Chan X', 'Yang L', 'Bobkova EV', 'Vasile S', 'Yuan H', 'Rascon J', 'Colayco S', 'Sidique S', 'Cosford ND', 'Chung TD', 'Mustelin T', 'Page R', 'Lombroso PJ', 'Tautz L']","['Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, United States.']",['eng'],"['U54 HG005033-01/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 MH084230-01A1/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'X01 MH077603-01/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH52711/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA132121/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21 CA132121/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 MH084230/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'X01MH077603/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'X01 MH077603/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH052711-15/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG005033/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA132121-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH052711/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH091037/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111117,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC3288537,2011/11/11 06:00,2012/06/06 06:00,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb2004274 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2012 Feb 17;7(2):367-77. doi: 10.1021/cb2004274.

Snake venoms represent an essentially unexplored source of bioactive compounds that may cure disease conditions which do not respond to currently available therapies. These venoms possess many pharmacological activities, as cytotoxic and/or lytic effects on tumor cells in vitro. Herein, were investigated the in vitro cytotoxicity of three Bothrops venoms in tumor cell lines. METHODS: Cytotoxic effect was evaluated in HCT-8 (colon - human), SF-295 (nervous system - human), HL-60 (human leukemia) and MDAMB-435 (breast - human). Cell density and membrane integrity were determined by the exclusion of propidium iodide. To determine whether Bothrops venoms treated cells were undergoing an apoptotic and/ or necrosis death, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization was measured after the incubation with the venom. RESULTS: Botrhops venons showed significant cytotoxcity against all cell lines in study. Cell density and membrane integrity were determined by the exclusion of propidium iodide. The Bothrops venoms reduced the cell number and revealed the presence of a necrotic population when the cells was exposed to the B. pauloensis B. diporus and B. pirajai venoms. To determine whether Bothrops venoms treated cells were undergoing an apoptotic and/or necrosis death, PS externalization was measured after the incubation with the venom and it was observed necrotic and apoptotic cells.

Crude euphorbia extract causes local toxicity and transient inflammation when applied topically and has been used in the treatment of warts, skin keratoses and skin cancer. PEP005 is a broad range activator of the classical (alpha, beta, gamma) and novel (delta, epsilon, eta, theta) protein kinase C isoenzymes. Direct pro-apoptotic effects of this drug have been demonstrated in several malignant cells, including melanoma cell lines and primary human acute myelogenous leukemia cells. At micromolar concentrations required to kill melanoma cells this agent causes PKC-independent secondary necrosis. In contrast, the killing of leukemic cells occurs in the nanomolar range, requires activation of protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) and is specifically associated with translocation of PKCdelta from the cytoplasm to the nuclear membrane. However, in addition to this pro-apoptotic effect the agent seems to have immunostimulatory effects, including: (i) increased chemokine release by malignant cells; (ii) a general increase in proliferation and cytokine release by activated T cells, including T cells derived from patients with chemotherapy-induced lymphopenia; (iii) local infiltration of neutrophils after topical application with increased antibody-dependent cytotoxicity; and (iv) development of specific anti-cancer immune responses by CD8(+) T cells in animal models. Published studies mainly describe effects from in vitro investigations or after topical application of the agent, and careful evaluation of the toxicity after systemic administration is required before the possible use of this agent in the treatment of malignancies other than skin cancers.","['Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Kittang, Astrid Olsnes', 'Hampson, Peter', 'Sand, Kristoffer', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Lord, Janet M', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ersvaer E', 'Kittang AO', 'Hampson P', 'Sand K', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Lord JM', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, The University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. elisabeth.ersvar@med.uib.no']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100122,Switzerland,Toxins (Basel),Toxins,101530765,IM,"['Animals', '*CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Melanoma', 'Necrosis', '*Protein Kinase C-delta']",PMC3206618,2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3390/toxins2010174 [doi]', 'toxins2010174 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxins (Basel). 2010 Jan;2(1):174-94. doi: 10.3390/toxins2010174.

Rho family GTPases regulate multiple signaling pathways in tumorigenesis: cytoskeletal organization, transcription, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. Geranylgeranylation of Rho family GTPases is essential for cell membrane localization and activation of these proteins. It is currently unknown whether HTLV-1-transformed cells are preferentially sensitive to geranylgeranylation inhibitors, such as GGTI-298. In this report, we demonstrate that GGTI-298 decreased cell viability and induced G(2)/M phase accumulation of HTLV-1-transformed cells, independent of p53 reactivation. HTLV-1-LTR transcriptional activity was inhibited and Tax protein levels decreased following treatment with GGTI-298. Furthermore, GGTI-298 decreased activation of NF-kappaB, a downstream target of Rho family GTPases. These studies suggest that protein geranylgeranylation contributes to dysregulation of cell survival pathways in HTLV-1-transformed cells.","['Edwards, Dustin C', 'McKinnon, Katherine M', 'Fenizia, Claudio', 'Jung, Kyung-Jin', 'Brady, John N', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A']","['Edwards DC', 'McKinnon KM', 'Fenizia C', 'Jung KJ', 'Brady JN', 'Pise-Masison CA']","['Virus Tumor Biology Section, Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. edwardsd2@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20111010,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/drug effects/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/virology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Prenylation/*drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",PMC3205383,2011/11/10 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/v3101815 [doi]', 'v3101815 [pii]']",ppublish,Viruses. 2011 Oct;3(10):1815-35. doi: 10.3390/v3101815.

Furthermore, a characteristic liver pathology observed in ALL patients implies that the hepatic microenvironment provides an extramedullary niche for leukemic cells. However, it remains unclear whether the liver actually provides a specific niche. The mechanism underlying this pathology is also poorly understood. Here, to answer these questions, we reconstituted the histopathology of leukemic liver by using patients-derived primary ALL cells into NOD/SCID/Yc (null) mice. The liver pathology in this model was similar to that observed in the patients. By using this model, we clearly demonstrated that bile duct epithelial cells form a hepatic niche that supports infiltration and proliferation of ALL cells in the liver. Furthermore, we showed that functions of the niche are maintained by the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, proposing a novel therapeutic approach targeting the extramedullary niche by inhibition of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the liver dissemination of leukemia is not due to nonselective infiltration, but rather systematic invasion and proliferation of leukemic cells in hepatic niche. Although the contribution of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is reported in some cancer cells or leukemic niches such as bone marrow, we demonstrated that this axis works even in the extramedullary niche of leukemic cells. Our findings form the basis for therapeutic approaches that target the extramedullary niche by inhibiting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.","['Kato, Itaru', 'Niwa, Akira', 'Heike, Toshio', 'Fujino, Hisanori', 'Saito, Megumu K', 'Umeda, Katsutsugu', 'Hiramatsu, Hidefumi', 'Ito, Mamoru', 'Morita, Makiko', 'Nishinaka, Yoko', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Ishikawa, Fumihiko', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi']","['Kato I', 'Niwa A', 'Heike T', 'Fujino H', 'Saito MK', 'Umeda K', 'Hiramatsu H', 'Ito M', 'Morita M', 'Nishinaka Y', 'Adachi S', 'Ishikawa F', 'Nakahata T']","['Department of Clinical Application, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111101,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzylamines', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokine CXCL12/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclams', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3206061,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2010/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0027042 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-05558 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(11):e27042. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027042.

Bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood can all serve as primary sources of cells for HCT. The number of cord blood units currently stored is large, although it represents only a fraction of potential collections. With much of the collection being sequestered in private banks for possible autologous use, there is a reason to expect that public banks may not be able to provide for the demand in coming years as use of cord blood for treatment of patients with diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma continues to increase. We suggest that a possible solution to encourage private banks to share their valuable units is to apply recent methodologies to generate induced pluripotent stem cells from cord cells and to optimize techniques to generate hematopoietic lineages from them. This strategy would allow us to take advantage of the units already collected under appropriate regulatory guidelines, to access a pristine cell that can be converted to a pluripotent cell at a much higher efficiency and in a shorter time period than other cells. The ability to potentially replenish a used cord unit with new cells, as well as extend the potential utility of cord blood for additional therapeutic applications, should allow banks to develop an appropriate business model for both private and public cord blood banks to flourish.","['Rao, Mahendra', 'Ahrlund-Richter, Lars', 'Kaufman, Dan S']","['Rao M', 'Ahrlund-Richter L', 'Kaufman DS']","['National Center for Regenerative Medicine, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. mahendra.rao@nih.gov']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['*Blood Banks/ethics', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Private Sector', 'Public Sector', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.770 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Jan;30(1):55-60. doi: 10.1002/stem.770.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: CD25(+) human xenografts growing rapidly in nude mice had intratumoral sCD25 at levels that were between 21- and 2,200 (median 118)-fold higher than in serum, indicating that interstitial sCD25 interacts with LMB-2 in tumors. Intratumoral sCD25 levels were in the range 21 to 157 (median 54) ng/mL without treatment and 0.95 to 6.1 (median 2.6) ng/mL (P < 0.0001) 1 day after gemcitabine administration. CD25(+) xenografts that were too large to regress with LMB-2 alone were minimally responsive to gemcitabine alone but completely regressed with the combination. Ex vivo, different ratios of gemcitabine and LMB-2 were cytotoxic to the CD25(+) tumor cells in an additive, but not synergistic, manner. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine is synergistic with LMB-2 in vivo unrelated to improved cytotoxicity. Synergism, therefore, appears to be related to improved distribution of LMB-2 to CD25(+) tumors, and is preceded by decreased sCD25 within the tumor because of chemotherapy. To test the concept of combined treatment clinically, patients with relapsed/refractory ATL are being treated with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide before LMB-2.","['Singh, Rajat', 'Zhang, Yujian', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Kreitman, Robert J']","['Singh R', 'Zhang Y', 'Pastan I', 'Kreitman RJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Z01 BC010301-11/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20111108,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Exotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3251712,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-1839 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1839 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jan 1;18(1):152-60. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1839.

Among these compounds, 3-methylcyclopentylidene-[4-(4'-chlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl]hydrazone (CPTH6) has been selected and used throughout this study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effect of CPTH6 on histone acetylation, cell viability and differentiation, cell-cycle distribution, and apoptosis in a panel of acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumor cell lines has been evaluated. RESULTS: Here, we showed that CPTH6 leads to an inhibition of Gcn5 and pCAF HAT activity. Moreover, it inhibits H3/H4 histones and alpha-tubulin acetylation of a panel of leukemia cell lines. Concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of cell viability, paralleled by accumulation of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase and depletion from the S/G(2)M phases, was observed. The role of mitochondrial pathway on CPTH6-induced apoptosis was shown, being a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, from mitochondria to cytosol, induced by CPTH6. Also the involvement of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL on CPTH6-induced apoptosis was found after overexpression of the two proteins in leukemia cells. Solid tumor cell lines from several origins were shown to be differently sensitive to CPTH6 treatment in terms of cell viability, and a correlation between the inhibitory efficacy on H3/H4 histones acetylation and cytotoxicity was found. Differentiating effect on leukemia and neuroblastoma cell lines was also induced by CPTH6. CONCLUSIONS: These results make CPTH6 a suitable tool for discovery of molecular targets of HAT and, potentially, for the development of new anticancer therapies, which warrants further investigations.","['Trisciuoglio, Daniela', 'Ragazzoni, Ylenia', 'Pelosi, Andrea', 'Desideri, Marianna', 'Carradori, Simone', 'Gabellini, Chiara', 'Maresca, Giovanna', 'Nescatelli, Riccardo', 'Secci, Daniela', 'Bolasco, Adriana', 'Bizzarri, Bruna', 'Cavaliere, Chiara', ""D'Agnano, Igea"", 'Filetici, Patrizia', 'Ricci-Vitiani, Lucia', 'Rizzo, Maria Giulia', 'Del Bufalo, Donatella']","['Trisciuoglio D', 'Ragazzoni Y', 'Pelosi A', 'Desideri M', 'Carradori S', 'Gabellini C', 'Maresca G', 'Nescatelli R', 'Secci D', 'Bolasco A', 'Bizzarri B', 'Cavaliere C', ""D'Agnano I"", 'Filetici P', 'Ricci-Vitiani L', 'Rizzo MG', 'Del Bufalo D']","[""Experimental Chemotherapy Laboratory, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Via delle Messi d'Oro 156, 00158 Rome, Italy. delbufalo@ifo.it""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111108,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/08/02 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-0579 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0579 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jan 15;18(2):475-86. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0579.

Retrospectively, the study of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and the related virus HTLV-I was a forerunner for all of human retrovirology, in which AIDS and the related retrovirus HIV were identified a few years later in the 1980s. Using the anti-TAC monoclonal antibody generated by the late Takashi Uchiyama during his stay in T. A. Waldmann's laboratory in NIH Bethesda, a cDNA encoding IL-2Ralpha chain was cloned by our group in Kyoto and by Waldmann's group in Bethesda. Abnormal IL-2Ralpha chain expression and the IL-2 dependency of ATL cell lines greatly contributed to the study of leukemogenesis of ATL. A new soluble factor named ADF/ATL-derived factor was also detected in ATL cell lines. After years of study, ADF proved to be a first human counterpart of thiol-related oxido-reductase thioredoxin/TRX, which opened the field of redox regulation of cell signaling involved in a variety of diseases. Close interaction among Drs. Kimishige Ishizaka, Kiyoshi Takastuki and T. A.

METHODS: Vital status and cause of death through 31 December 2006 were obtained by the National Center for Health Statistics for NHANES III participants. The cadmium concentration of spot urine samples was measured and corrected for urine creatinine (uCd). Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the time metric was applied to estimate sex-specific adjusted HRs (aHRs) of mortality associated with uCd for all cancers and the cancers responsible for the most deaths in the USA. Estimates were stratified by smoking history and adjusted for education, body mass index and race. RESULTS: uCd was associated with cancer mortality (aHR per twofold higher uCd (95% CI), men: 1.26 (1.07 to 1.48); women: 1.21 (1.04 to 1.42)). In men, mortality from lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was associated with uCd; an association with leukaemia mortality was suggested. In women, associations were suggested with mortality due to lung cancer, leukaemia, ovarian and uterine cancer, but evidence was weaker than in men. CONCLUSIONS: Cadmium appears to be associated with overall cancer mortality in men and women, but the specific cancers associated differ between men and women, suggesting avenues for future research. Limitations of the study include the possibility of uncontrolled confounding by cigarette smoking or other factors, and the limited number of deaths due to some cancers.","['Adams, Scott V', 'Passarelli, Michael N', 'Newcomb, Polly A']","['Adams SV', 'Passarelli MN', 'Newcomb PA']","['Cancer Prevention Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA. sadams@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['R25 CA094880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA094880-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111107,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cadmium/*adverse effects/urine', 'Cause of Death', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Metals, Heavy/*adverse effects/urine', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/chemically induced/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC3289533,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/02/23 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2011-100111 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2011-100111 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2012 Feb;69(2):153-6. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2011-100111.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting up-regulated profibrotic pathways, such as imatinib mesylate, have been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for patients with scGVHD. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI with a well-established safety and efficacy profile in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, who are refractory or intolerant to imatinib, has also shown potent antifibrotic effects. We present here the first direct clinical evidence, from 3 patients treated in a small single-center series, suggesting that dasatinib can be a therapeutic option for patients with severe scGVHD resistant or intolerant to imatinib. All patients achieved partial response, with improvement in scGHVD target organs severity, joint mobility, lung impairment, and deep fibrotic lesions. This clinical response has remained stable or continued to improve after a median of 22 months (20-25) on dasatinib treatment, with very good tolerance. In addition, corticosteroids could be discontinued or significantly reduced in all patients. This clinical evidence suggests that dasatinib could be a safe and effective alternative for scGVHD patients refractory to corticosteroids and resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Based on these preliminary findings, and in order to address appropriate patient selection, time of intervention, and choice of drug, future larger studies should more formally establish the efficacy and safety of second-generation TKI for the treatment of scGVHD.","['Sanchez-Ortega, Isabel', 'Servitje, Octavio', 'Arnan, Montserrat', 'Orti, Guillermo', 'Peralta, Teresa', 'Manresa, Federico', 'Duarte, Rafael F']","['Sanchez-Ortega I', 'Servitje O', 'Arnan M', 'Orti G', 'Peralta T', 'Manresa F', 'Duarte RF']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Av.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 282 patients with CML-CP who received imatinib 400 mg/d as first-line therapy followed by dasatinib or nilotinib if treatment with imatinib failed. We used a receiver operating characteristic curve to identify the cutoffs in transcript levels at 3, 6, and 12 months that would best predict patient outcome. We validated our findings in an independent cohort of 95 patients treated elsewhere. RESULTS: Patients with transcript levels of more than 9.84% (n = 68) at 3 months had significantly lower 8-year probabilities of OS (56.9% v 93.3%; P < .001), progression-free survival, cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response, and complete molecular response than those with higher transcript levels. Similarly, transcript levels of more than 1.67% (n = 87) at 6 months and more than 0.53% (n = 93) at 12 months identified high-risk patients. However, transcript levels at 3 months were the most strongly predictive for the various outcomes. When we compared OS for the groups defined molecularly at 6 and 12 months with the usual cytogenetic milestones, categorization by transcript numbers was the only independent predictor for OS (relative risk, 0.207; P < .001 and relative risk, 0.158; P < .001, respectively). CONCLUSION: A single measurement of BCR-ABL1 transcripts performed at 3 months is the best way to identify patients destined to fare poorly, thereby allowing early clinical intervention.","['Marin, David', 'Ibrahim, Amr R', 'Lucas, Claire', 'Gerrard, Gareth', 'Wang, Lihui', 'Szydlo, Richard M', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Bua, Marco', 'Pavlu, Jiri', 'Paliompeis, Christos', 'Reid, Alistair', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Goldman, John M', 'Foroni, Letizia']","['Marin D', 'Ibrahim AR', 'Lucas C', 'Gerrard G', 'Wang L', 'Szydlo RM', 'Clark RE', 'Apperley JF', 'Milojkovic D', 'Bua M', 'Pavlu J', 'Paliompeis C', 'Reid A', 'Rezvani K', 'Goldman JM', 'Foroni L']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom. d.marin@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111107,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6366954,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/06/01 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.38.6565 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.38.6565 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jan 20;30(3):232-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.38.6565.

The more melanoma-specific melanoma markers, MelanA/MART-1, HMB45, and tyrosinase, used in addition to S100 protein, all have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we evaluated 2 new melanoma markers, monoclonal antibodies KBA62 and PNL2 to yet unidentified antigens, using a large panel of metastatic melanomas (n=214), desmoplastic melanomas (n=34), gastrointestinal mucosal melanomas (n=54), benign nevi (n=27), clear cell sarcomas (n=16), and nonmelanocytic tumors (n=1218). Immunoreactivity for KBA62 and PNL2 was found in all pigmented nevi and in 86% and 90% of metastatic melanomas, respectively. Mucosal melanomas showed a similar rate of PNL2 immunoreactivity but somewhat less frequent KBA62 positivity (72%). In addition, KBA62 was found to be a sensitive diagnostic marker for desmoplastic melanoma (28 of 34; 82%), whereas PNL2 was only rarely positive (2 of 34; 6%). KBA62-positive normal tissues included pericytes, vascular and parenchymal smooth muscles, and basal cells of complex epithelia, including myoepithelia, whereas PNL2 labeled only melanocytes and neutrophils. Among nonmelanocytic tumors, those that were KBA62 positive were nodular fasciitis, leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, benign and malignant nerve sheath tumors, synovial sarcoma, and subsets of various carcinomas, especially those with squamous cell/stratified epithelial differentiation. PNL2 positivity in nonmelanocytic tumors was more restricted but occurred consistently in angiomyolipoma and other perivascular epitheloid cell tumor and in chronic myeloid leukemia tissue infiltrates. KBA62 may assist in the identification of desmoplastic melanomas, but its widespread occurrence in nonmelanomas limits utility. PNL2 is highly specific for melanomas but lacks reactivity with desmoplastic melanomas. It is also an excellent supplementary marker for perivascular epitheloid cell tumor at various sites.","['Aung, Phyu Phyu', 'Sarlomo-Rikala, Maarit', 'Lasota, Jerzy', 'Lai, Jin-Ping', 'Wang, Zeng-Feng', 'Miettinen, Markku']","['Aung PP', 'Sarlomo-Rikala M', 'Lasota J', 'Lai JP', 'Wang ZF', 'Miettinen M']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Institutes of Health, NCI, 10 Center Drive, Room 2B50,Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Melanoma/*chemistry/*pathology/secondary', 'Mucous Membrane/pathology']",PMC3261309,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e31823651cb [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2012 Feb;36(2):265-72. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e31823651cb.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,,,['NIHMS330265'],,,,,,,,,,

Long-term continuous treatment with lenalidomide beyond first response may be important to optimize responses and delay relapse. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the lenalidomide mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, key clinical studies with a focus on safety and post-marketing surveillance data. The necessity for early adverse-event management, including dose modifications for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, where applicable, in order to maintain patients on treatment and achieve optimal efficacy, is discussed. Secondary primary malignancies in MM and progression to acute myeloid leukemia in MDS patients in the context of lenalidomide treatment are also discussed. Finally, as lenalidomide is renally excreted, the requirement for dose adjustment according to creatinine clearance is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Lenalidomide is highly effective and generally well tolerated. Most adverse events occur early during the course of treatment and are manageable. Lenalidomide is not associated with peripheral neuropathy and has a lack of cumulative toxicity, making it an effective treatment option for long-term use in the management of MM and low/intermediate-1-risk MDS, specifically with chromosome 5q deletion with or without other cytogenetic abnormalities.","['Palumbo, Antonio', 'Freeman, John', 'Weiss, Lilia', 'Fenaux, Pierre']","['Palumbo A', 'Freeman J', 'Weiss L', 'Fenaux P']","[""Divisione di Ematologia dell'Universita di Torino, Azienda Ospedaliera San Giovanni Battista, Via Genova 3, 10126 Turin, Italy. appalumbo@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111109,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Product Surveillance, Postmarketing', 'Renal Insufficiency/complications', 'Thalidomide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740338.2011.619975 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2012 Jan;11(1):107-20. doi: 10.1517/14740338.2011.619975.

We describe a multimodality imaging approach to the diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of Loeffler disease complicated by thrombus formation and neoangiogenesis of LV apex.","['Del Bene, Maria Riccarda', 'Cappelli, Francesco', 'Rega, Luigi', 'Venditti, Francesco', 'Barletta, Giuseppe']","['Del Bene MR', 'Cappelli F', 'Rega L', 'Venditti F', 'Barletta G']","['Department of Heart and Vessels, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111108,United States,Echocardiography,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)",8511187,IM,"['Computer Systems', 'Contrast Media', 'Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*diagnostic imaging', 'Middle Aged', '*Phospholipids', '*Sulfur Hexafluoride']",,2011/11/10 06:00,2012/07/27 06:00,['2011/11/10 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1540-8175.2011.01570.x [doi]'],ppublish,Echocardiography. 2012 Mar;29(3):E62-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8175.2011.01570.x.

Various protein kinases C are involved in the regulation of investigated lipid levels at certain stages of signal transduction both in norm, and in blast cells. Short-term (5, 10 s) activations of healthy donors lymphocytes are coupled to functioning of Ca2+-independent isoforms of protein kinase C. The inhibition of this protein kinase C in leukemic cells leads to normalization of the investigated lipid release.

We evaluated the correlation between serum concentration of BAFF or APRIL and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). METHODS: Fifteen patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation for leukemia and developed acute GVHD were enrolled. We determined serum concentrations of BAFF and APRIL at the onset of the first clinical manifestation of GVHD by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Nine patients had grade 2 acute GVHD, and 6 had grade 3-4 acute GVHD. The BAFF serum concentration was higher in patients with grade 3-4 acute GVHD (1,093.42 in grade 2 vs. 2,171.99 pg/mL in grade 3-4), although the difference was not significant (P=0.077). However, the ratio of BAFF serum concentration to absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (BAFF/ALC) was significantly higher in patients with grade 3-4 acute GVHD (P=0.045). The APRIL serum concentration and APRIL/ALC ratio showed similar results (P=0.077 and P=0.013, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients with grade 3-4 acute GVHD had higher BAFF/ALC and APRIL/ALC ratios than patients with grade 2 acute GVHD. These findings suggest that B cells might play an important role in the development of acute GVHD, and that the BAFF and APRIL concentrations in serum might be significant predictive factors for estimating the severity of acute GVHD. Their clinical significance should be further evaluated in a larger patient population.","['Kim, Jin Seok', 'Kim, Soo-Jeong', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Kim, Yundeok', 'Hwang, Doh Yu', 'Yoon, Sulhee', 'Jang, Jieun', 'Hyun, Shin Young', 'Min, Yoo Hong']","['Kim JS', 'Kim SJ', 'Cheong JW', 'Kim Y', 'Hwang DY', 'Yoon S', 'Jang J', 'Hyun SY', 'Min YH']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110930,Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,PMC3208200,2011/11/09 06:00,2011/11/09 06:01,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2011.46.3.175 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2011 Sep;46(3):175-9. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2011.46.3.175.

The majority of newly diagnosed patients treated for CP-CML achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and over time, most of these eventually achieve major molecular responses (MMRs) and even complete molecular responses (CMRs). In ongoing phase 3 randomized trials of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), nilotinib and dasatinib have been found to have superior efficacies in helping achieve cytogenetic and molecular responses, including MMRs and CMRs. However, only the MMR rate was significantly higher in bosutinib compared with the imatinib control, but not in CCyR rate. Current reports of imatinib discontinuation suggested that achieving CMR is an important prerequisite for CML to be cured. Recent data from the STIM (Stop Imatinib) trial showed that imatinib can be successfully discontinued in patients who achieve a certain level of CMR. Standardized real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) assays have been available in routine clinical practice, and efforts are being focused on achieving higher sensitivity and optimizing the time of imatinib discontinuation. Although very few patients are cured by administration of only Bcr-Abl TKIs, including imatinib and second-generation TKIs, current advances may eventually make this possible. This report summarizes the detailed clinical data obtained in the DASISION, ENESTnd, and BELA studies and discusses high-sensitivity detection methods and future therapeutic strategies.","['Kim, Dong-Wook']",['Kim DW'],"[""Department of Hematology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110930,Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,PMC3208199,2011/11/09 06:00,2011/11/09 06:01,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2011.46.3.169 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2011 Sep;46(3):169-74. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2011.46.3.169.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Physicians at 2 large pediatric hospitals were recruited to participate in a physician-directed intervention (PDI), which included 1 full-day seminar and successive half-day booster sessions. ICCs were then observed, audiotaped, coded, and analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Data also were collected at 2 control sites. Between 2003 and 2007, 59 ICCs were observed and analyzed. RESULTS: Significant group differences were found in physician rapport-building behaviors. Physicians in the PDI + booster session group engaged in greater rapport-building than did physicians in the PDI group who did not attend booster sessions and physicians in the control group. No group differences were detected for physician partnership-building. In addition, parents in the PDI + booster session group engaged in more general communication and study-related communication, and mothers in the PDI groups asked significantly more questions per minute than did mothers in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the effectiveness of the PDI at enhancing positive physician behaviors. Booster-session attendance is a critical component of physician-directed interventions to improve parental participation and physician-parent communication during ICCs.","['Cousino, Melissa', 'Hazen, Rebecca', 'Yamokoski, Amy', 'Miller, Victoria', 'Zyzanski, Stephen', 'Drotar, Dennis', 'Kodish, Eric']","['Cousino M', 'Hazen R', 'Yamokoski A', 'Miller V', 'Zyzanski S', 'Drotar D', 'Kodish E']","['Department of Psychology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA083267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 083267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111107,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Communication', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', '*Leukemia', 'Male', '*Parents', '*Physician-Patient Relations']",PMC3387902,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2010-3542 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2010-3542 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2011 Dec;128(6):e1544-51. doi: 10.1542/peds.2010-3542.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to describe the prevalence of MIDi and risk factors for its development. METHODS: We retrospectively gathered demographic, disease course and treatment data on 363 patients aged 1 to 17.9 years diagnosed with ALL at a pediatric tertiary care hospital between 1998 and 2005. MIDi was defined as blood glucose >/=200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) on at least 2 separate days during induction. RESULTS: Fifty-seven subjects (15.7%) developed MIDi during the study period. Patients >/=10 years were more likely to develop MIDi than those <10 years (odds ratio [OR] 9.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1-17.8). BMI percentile among those with MIDi (mean +/- SD 58.2 +/- 31.0) did not differ from those without MIDi (52.2 +/- 32.0, P = 0.429). The presence of Trisomy 21 (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.1-11.4, P = 0.030) and CNS involvement at diagnosis (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.4-10.1, P = 0.009) were associated with an increased risk of MIDi. After adjustment for potential confounding variables, age >/=10 years and the presence of CNS disease at diagnosis remained significantly associated with MIDi. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and CNS involvement at diagnosis increase the risk of MIDi. In contrast to previous studies, higher BMI was not associated with MIDi in our population.","['Koltin, Dror', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Naqvi, Ahmed', 'Urbach, Stacey L']","['Koltin D', 'Sung L', 'Naqvi A', 'Urbach SL']","['The Division of Endocrinology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. dror.koltin@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111108,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asparagine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,2011/11/09 06:00,2013/01/10 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-011-1307-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2012 Sep;20(9):2009-15. doi: 10.1007/s00520-011-1307-5.

However, cases may deviate from the typical immunophenotype; therefore, there is a need for adding new marker(s) for differentiating BCLPDs.Lately, few researches highlighted CD200 expression in some BCLPDs. Our aim was to evaluate CD200 expression in different BCLPDs and whether adding CD200 to BCLPD-FCIP routine panels could improve the ability of their differential diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated CD200 expression in 49 BCLPD patients and 26 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping first panel included CD5, CD19, sIg, CD23, CD22, CD79b, and FMC7; for BCLPDs other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma, CD11c, CD103, CD25, and CD10 were evaluated. RESULTS: Using tricolor FCIP, CD200 showed high bright expression on CD5/19-positive clone in all B-CLL patients (100%), with a mean of 94% (SD, 11%); in the 2 cases of hairy cell leukemia, CD200 was brightly expressed on 96% and 99% of cells. In all other BCLPDs including mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and splenic marginal zone lymphoma, CD200 expression (on CD19/22-positive cells) was less than 20% with a mean of 10% (SD, 8%) and a dim pattern. CD200 expression was significantly higher in CLL compared with non-Hodgkin lymphoma groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating CD200 expression has a great impact on accurate BCLPDs diagnosis and could be added to the BCLPD routine panels. The high expression of CD200 in B-cell CLL and hairy cell leukemia could open the option for targeted immune (anti-CD200) therapy.","['El Desoukey, Nermeen Ahmed', 'Afify, Reham Abd Aleem', 'Amin, Dalia Gamil', 'Mohammed, Rasha Faragaly']","['El Desoukey NA', 'Afify RA', 'Amin DG', 'Mohammed RF']","['Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2011/11/09 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2310/JIM.0b013e31823908f9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Investig Med. 2012 Jan;60(1):56-61. doi: 10.2310/JIM.0b013e31823908f9.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transplant is often the only curative therapy for cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Between 40% and 80% of patients who receive transplant become long-term survivors, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates are between 24% and 44% during the peritransplant period. The aggressive nature of hematopoietic stem cell transplant has a drastic impact on the physical and emotional state of the patient and family. From the day of diagnosis of any blood cancer, patients and families are faced with decisions and challenges ranging from quality of life and mortality to insurance coverage and financial concerns. The purpose of this article is to provide the experienced ICU nurse with background on the hematopoietic stem cell transplant process as a basis for interventions that can improve patient- and family-centered care, to provide tools that improve the transitions between the transplant and ICU teams, and to support communication between nursing teams for patients who survive the ICU stay and for those at the end of life.

However, its therapeutic success is limited by the appearance of relapse and recalcitrant cases, poor aqueous solubility and high degradability. In the current work, we prepared two types of atRA-loaded copolymer nanoparticles - PL1RA and PC1RA, based on poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG)-poly(l-lactide) and PEG-poly(epsilon-caprolactone), respectively. We then evaluated their physico-chemical properties and compared their differentiation-inducing potential of HL-60 cells with free atRA. These nanoparticles were in the size range 100-150nm, possessed moderate colloidal stability and exhibited around 30% encapsulation efficiencies. In vitro release studies indicated pseudo-zero order release of a sustained nature, with PL1RA showing 71% and PC1RA exhibiting 84% drug release over a period of two weeks. Photostability measurements exhibited considerable increase in atRA photostability in the nanoparticle forms: 25% of the drug in PL1RA and 19% in PC1RA was intact as compared to only 5% for free atRA after 8h of light exposure. PL1RA and PC1RA exhibited efficacies comparable to free atRA in inducing HL-60 respiratory burst as assessed by nitroblue tetrazolium and 2',7'-dichlorodihydro fluorescein diacteate assays. The average CD11b expressions for atRA, PL1RA and PC1RA on day 5 of treatment were 58%, 49% and 60%, respectively. Post-differentiation apoptosis ( approximately 40%) and reduction in mitochondrial transmembrane potentials ( approximately 60-70%) were also comparable across all treatment groups. Therefore, our block copolymer nanoparticles, PL1RA and PC1RA, are attractive and effective vehicles for atRA delivery which maintain its activity and enhance its stability resulting in efficient induction of HL-60 differentiation.","['Tiwari, Manu D', 'Mehra, Sarika', 'Jadhav, Sameer', 'Bellare, Jayesh R']","['Tiwari MD', 'Mehra S', 'Jadhav S', 'Bellare JR']","['Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111028,Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', '*Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0928-0987(11)00367-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2011.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2011 Dec 18;44(5):643-52. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2011.10.014.

We analyzed the fusion transcripts in 20 new cases of CALM/AF10-positive leukemias, and compared the gene expression profile of 10 of these to 125 patients with other types of leukemia and 10 normal bone marrow samples. Based on gene set enrichment analyses, the CALM/AF10-positive samples showed significant upregulation of genes involved in chromatin assembly and maintenance and DNA repair process, and downregulation of angiogenesis and cell communication genes. Interestingly, we observed a striking upregulation of four genes located immediately centromeric to the break point of the t(10;11)(p12;q14) on 10p12 (COMMD3 (COMM domain containing 3), BMI1 (B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog), DNAJC1 (DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog subfamily C member 1) and SPAG6 (sperm associated antigen 6)). We also conducted semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis on leukemic blasts from a murine CALM/AF10 transplantation model that does not have the translocation. Commd3, Bmi1 and Dnajc1, but not Spag6 were upregulated in these samples. These results strongly indicate that the differential regulation of these three genes is not due to the break point effect but as a consequence of the CALM/AF10 fusion gene expression, though the mechanism of regulation is not well understood.","['Mulaw, M A', 'Krause, A', 'Deshpande, A J', 'Krause, L F', 'Rouhi, A', 'La Starza, R', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Buske, C', 'Mecucci, C', 'Ludwig, W-D', 'Lottaz, C', 'Bohlander, S K']","['Mulaw MA', 'Krause A', 'Deshpande AJ', 'Krause LF', 'Rouhi A', 'La Starza R', 'Borkhardt A', 'Buske C', 'Mecucci C', 'Ludwig WD', 'Lottaz C', 'Bohlander SK']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Grosshadern, Ludwig Maximilians University and HelmholtzZentrum Muenchen, Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*genetics', '*Chromosome Fragile Sites', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', '*Up-Regulation']",,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011307 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.307 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):1012-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.307.

Though effective against BCL2 and BCL-X(L), ABT-737 poorly inhibits MCL-1. Here we report that, unexpectedly, ABT-737 induces activation of the extracellular receptor activated kinase and induction of MCL-1 in AML cells. MEK inhibitors such as PD0325901 and CI-1040 have been used successfully to suppress MCL-1. We report that PD0325901 blocked ABT-737-induced MCL-1 expression, and when combined with ABT-737 resulted in potent synergistic killing of AML-derived cell lines, primary AML blast and CD34+38-123+ progenitor/stem cells. Finally, we tested the combination of ABT-737 and CI-1040 in a murine xenograft model using MOLM-13 human leukemia cells.Whereas control mice and CI-1040-treated mice exhibited progressive leukemia growth, ABT-737, and to a significantly greater extent, ABT-737+CI-1040 exerted major anti-leukemia activity. Collectively, results demonstrated unexpected anti-apoptotic interaction between the BCL2 family-targeted BH3-mimetic ABT-737 and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in AML cells: the BH3 mimetic is not only restrained in its activity by MCL-1, but also induces its expression. However, concomitant inhibition by BH3 mimetics and MEK inhibitors could abrogate this effect and may be developed into a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for patients with AML.","['Konopleva, M', 'Milella, M', 'Ruvolo, P', 'Watts, J C', 'Ricciardi, M R', 'Korchin, B', 'McQueen, T', 'Bornmann, W', 'Tsao, T', 'Bergamo, P', 'Mak, D H', 'Chen, W', 'McCubrey, J', 'Tafuri, A', 'Andreeff, M']","['Konopleva M', 'Milella M', 'Ruvolo P', 'Watts JC', 'Ricciardi MR', 'Korchin B', 'McQueen T', 'Bornmann W', 'Tsao T', 'Bergamo P', 'Mak DH', 'Chen W', 'McCubrey J', 'Tafuri A', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA-55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diphenylamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/physiology']",PMC3604791,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011287 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.287 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):778-87. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.287.

Their reactivity is influenced by activating and inhibitory signals mediated by tumor-expressed ligands for NK receptors. Many members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family modulate differentiation, proliferation, activation and death of both tumor and immune effector cells. The TNF receptor family member glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR) stimulates anti-tumor immunity in mice, but available data indicate that GITR may mediate different effects in mice and men and impairs the reactivity of human NK cells. Here, we comprehensively studied the expression and function of GITR ligand (GITRL) in leukemia. Among the different leukemia entities, pronounced expression of GITRL on leukemic cells was observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and the GITR receptor was expressed at significantly higher levels on NK cells of CLL patients compared with healthy controls. Upon GITR-GITRL interaction, signaling via GITRL into the leukemia cells induced the release of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and TNF, which act as growth and survival factors for CLL cells. In addition, GITRL impaired both direct and Rituximab-induced degranulation, cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma production of NK cells, which could be restored by GITR blocking antibodies. Thus, GITRL may contribute to disease pathophysiology and resistance to direct and Rituximab-induced NK reactivity in CLL.","['Buechele, C', 'Baessler, T', 'Wirths, S', 'Schmohl, J U', 'Schmiedel, B J', 'Salih, H R']","['Buechele C', 'Baessler T', 'Wirths S', 'Schmohl JU', 'Schmiedel BJ', 'Salih HR']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls-University, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab']",,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011313 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.313 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):991-1000. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.313.

We hypothesized that co-inhibition of MDM2 and HDACs, with nutlin-3 and valproic acid (VPA) would additively inhibit growth in leukemic cells expressing wild type TP53 and induce p53-mediated apoptosis. In vitro studies with the combination demonstrated synergistic induction of apoptosis in AML cell lines and patient cells. Nutlin-3 and VPA co-treatment resulted in massive induction of p53, acetylated p53 and p53 target genes in comparison with either agent alone, followed by p53 dependent cell death with autophagic features. In primary AML cells, inhibition of proliferation by the combination therapy correlated with the CD34 expression level of AML blasts. To evaluate the combination in vivo, we developed an orthotopic, NOD/SCID IL2rgamma(null) xenograft model of MOLM-13 (AML FAB M5a; wild type TP53) expressing firefly luciferase. Survival analysis and bioluminescent imaging demonstrated the superior in vivo efficacy of the dual inhibition of MDM2 and HDAC in comparison with controls.

The main genotoxic effect of MTX resulting from inhibition of thymidylate synthase is mis-incorporation of uracil into DNA, which is considered essential for the effectiveness of the Protocol M in ALL IC BFM 2002/EURO LB 2002 regimens. In this study, we investigated the level of basal and induced DNA damage as well as the effectiveness of DNA repair in lymphocytes of children with ALL at four time-points during therapy with MTX and 6MP. To assess DNA damage and the efficacy of DNA repair we used the modified alkaline comet assay with uracil DNA glycosylase (Udg) and endonuclease III (EndoIII). In addition, we examined the induction of apoptosis in the lymphocytes of the patients during treatment. Finally, we compared the activity of base-excision repair (BER), involved in removal of both uracil and oxidized bases from DNA in lymphocytes of children with ALL and lymphocytes of healthy children. BER efficiency was estimated in an in vitro assay with cellular extracts and plasmid substrates of heteroduplex DNA with an AP-site. Our results indicate that there is a significant decrease in the efficacy of DNA repair associated with an increased level of uracil in DNA and induction of apoptosis during therapy. Moreover, it was found that the BER capacity was decreased in the lymphocytes of ALL patients in contrast to that in lymphocytes of healthy children. Thus, we suggest that an impairment of the BER pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis and therapy of childhood ALL.","['Stanczyk, M', 'Sliwinski, T', 'Trelinska, J', 'Cuchra, M', 'Markiewicz, L', 'Dziki, L', 'Bieniek, A', 'Bielecka-Kowalska, A', 'Kowalski, M', 'Pastorczak, A', 'Szemraj, J', 'Mlynarski, W', 'Majsterek, I']","['Stanczyk M', 'Sliwinski T', 'Trelinska J', 'Cuchra M', 'Markiewicz L', 'Dziki L', 'Bieniek A', 'Bielecka-Kowalska A', 'Kowalski M', 'Pastorczak A', 'Szemraj J', 'Mlynarski W', 'Majsterek I']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111030,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Uracil/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(11)00307-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2012 Jan 24;741(1-2):13-21. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.10.009.

Nearly one-third to one-half of these cases may be infectious in origin. As such, an awareness of infectious diseases causing central nervous system (CNS) signs in cats, and their clinical diagnosis and management, is relevant to anyone dealing with cats on a regular basis. GLOBAL IMPORTANCE: Some conditions (eg, rabies) are more common in certain countries than others. Conditions such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and toxoplasmosis are of global significance. PATIENT GROUP: Many infectious diseases may affect any feline population. Some, such as FIP, are more common in pedigree households, whereas others such as toxoplasmosis, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) infections, are more likely to affect a single cat with an outdoor lifestyle. EQUIPMENT: All patients benefit from thorough history taking and clinical, neurological and ophthalmic examinations, which all require minimal equipment. Infectious diseases may often be diagnosed on blood samples; however, definitive diagnosis may require more extensive investigation involving cerebrospinal fluid analysis or advanced imaging necessitating access to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. EVIDENCE BASE: The information in this review, which summarises current knowledge of infectious diseases affecting the CNS, is collated from publications on the infectious diseases comprising previous research papers, review articles, case series, case reports and textbooks, supplemented by the clinical experience of the authors.","['Gunn-Moore, Danielle A', 'Reed, Nicki']","['Gunn-Moore DA', 'Reed N']","['Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, Division of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Hospital for Small Animals, Easter Bush Veterinary Centre, Roslin, Midlothian EH25 9RG, Scotland.

We analyzed the association between race/ethnicity and outcomes of unrelated single UCBT for leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Our retrospective cohort study consisted of 885 adults and children (612 whites, 145 blacks, and 128 Hispanics) who received unrelated single UCBT for leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes between 1995 and 2006 and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. A 5-6/6 HLA-matched unit with a total nucleated cell count infused of >/=2.5 x 10(7)/kg was given to 40% white and 42% Hispanic, but only 21% black patients. Overall survival at 2 years was 44% for whites, 34% for blacks, and 46% for Hispanics (P = .008). In multivariate analysis adjusting for patient, disease, and treatment factors (including HLA match and cell dose), blacks had inferior overall survival (relative risk of death, 1.31; P = .02), whereas overall survival of Hispanics was similar (relative risk, 1.03; P = .81) to that of whites. For all patients, younger age, early-stage disease, use of units with higher cell dose, and performance status >/=80 were independent predictors of improved survival. Black patients and white patients infused with well-matched cords had comparable survival; similarly, black and white patients receiving units with adequate cell dose had similar survival. These results suggest that blacks have inferior survival to whites after single UCBT, but outcomes are improved when units with a higher cell dose are used.","['Ballen, Karen K', 'Klein, John P', 'Pedersen, Tanya L', 'Bhatla, Deepika', 'Duerst, Reggie', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'LeMaistre, Charles F', 'McCarthy, Phillip', 'Mehta, Paulette', 'Palmer, Jeanne', 'Setterholm, Michelle', 'Wingard, John R', 'Joffe, Steven', 'Parsons, Susan K', 'Switzer, Galen E', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Majhail, Navneet S']","['Ballen KK', 'Klein JP', 'Pedersen TL', 'Bhatla D', 'Duerst R', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Lazarus HM', 'LeMaistre CF', 'McCarthy P', 'Mehta P', 'Palmer J', 'Setterholm M', 'Wingard JR', 'Joffe S', 'Parsons SK', 'Switzer GE', 'Lee SJ', 'Rizzo JD', 'Majhail NS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA. kballen@partners.org']",['eng'],"['U01 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U01HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111104,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Blacks', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/immunology/*transplantation', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', '*Hispanic or Latino', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*ethnology/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*ethnology/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', '*Whites']",PMC3874400,2011/11/09 06:00,2013/05/04 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00465-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jun;18(6):903-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.040.

As such, Hsp90 inhibition is a promising anti-cancer strategy. Several inhibitors that act on Hsp90 by binding to its N-terminal ATP pocket have entered clinical evaluation. Robust pre-clinical data suggested anti-tumor activity in multiple cancer types. Clinically, encouraging results have been demonstrated in melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, castrate refractory prostate cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma and multiple myeloma. In breast cancer, proof-of-concept was demonstrated by first generation Hsp90 inhibitors in combination with trastuzumab mainly in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+metastatic breast cancer. There are a multitude of second generation Hsp90 inhibitors currently under investigation. To date, however, there is no FDA approved Hsp90 inhibitor nor standardized assay to ascertain Hsp90 inhibition. This review summarizes the current status of both first and second generation Hsp90 inhibitors based on their chemical classification and stage of clinical development. It also discusses the pharmacodynamic assays currently implemented in clinic as well as other novel strategies aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of Hsp90 inhibitors. Ultimately, these efforts will aid in maximizing the full potential of this class of agents.

Ceramide and, more recently, other sphingolipid species (e.g., dihydroceramide and dihydrosphingosine) have been implicated in 4-HPR-mediated tumor cell death. Because sphingolipid metabolism has been reported to be altered in drug-resistant tumor cells, we studied the implication of sphingolipids in acquired resistance to 4-HPR based on an acute lymphoblastic leukemia model. METHODS: CCRF-CEM cell lines resistant to 4-HPR were obtained by gradual selection. Endogenous sphingolipid profiles and in situ enzymatic activities were determined by LC/MS, and resistance to 4-HPR or to alternative treatments was measured using the XTT viability assay and annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide labeling. RESULTS: No major crossresistance was observed against other antitumoral compounds (i.e. paclitaxel, cisplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride) or agents (i.e. ultra violet C, hydrogen peroxide) also described as sphingolipid modulators. CCRF-CEM cell lines resistant to 4-HPR exhibited a distinctive endogenous sphingolipid profile that correlated with inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase. Cells maintained acquired resistance to 4-HPR after the removal of 4-HPR though the sphingolipid profile returned to control levels. On the other hand, combined treatment with sphingosine kinase inhibitors (unnatural (dihydro)sphingosines ((dh)Sph)) and glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor (PPMP) in the presence or absence of 4-HPR increased cellular (dh)Sph (but not ceramide) levels and were highly toxic for both parental and resistant cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the leukemia model, acquired resistance to 4-HPR is selective and persists in the absence of sphingolipid profile alteration. Therapeutically, the data demonstrate that alternative sphingolipid-modulating antitumoral strategies are suitable for both 4-HPR-resistant and sensitive leukemia cells. Thus, whereas sphingolipids may not be critical for maintaining resistance to 4-HPR, manipulation of cytotoxic sphingolipids should be considered a viable approach for overcoming resistance.","['Apraiz, Aintzane', 'Idkowiak-Baldys, Jolanta K', 'Boyano, Maria Dolores', 'Perez-Yarza, Gorka', 'Hannun, Yusuf A', 'Asumendi, Aintzane']","['Apraiz A', 'Idkowiak-Baldys JK', 'Boyano MD', 'Perez-Yarza G', 'Hannun YA', 'Asumendi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country, Barrio Sarriena s/n, 48940 Leioa (Bizkaia), Spain.']",['eng'],"['C06 RR018823/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA097132/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111107,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3218121,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/11/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-477 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-477 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Nov 7;11:477. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-477.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.1.- (dihydroceramide desaturase)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted on 40 subjects, including 10 healthy volunteers as the control group and 30 patients presented with de novo chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), all of them were subjected to thorough history taking, full clinical examinations, routine laboratory investigations and flowcytometric assessment of CD40L and Bcl-2 on lymphocytes. There was a highly significant increase in TLC, absolute lymphocytic count, serum LDH, B2-microglobulin and Bcl-2 expression (P<0.001); there was a significant increase in CD40L expression (P<0.05); whereas there was a highly significant decrease in hemoglobin concentration and platelets count between the study group (P<0.001). There was no significant difference as regard direct Coombs' test between both groups. There was no significant relation between CD154 expression and clinical findings, Rai staging system and other laboratory parameters. CD40L expression is increased with staging of Modified Rai staging system but not reaching the significant level.

In contrast, little is known about the prognostic relevance of normal blood counts in this setting. DESIGN AND METHODS: Normal hematopoiesis during and after induction treatment (days 8, 15 and 33) was correlated with therapeutic outcome in a cohort of 256 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated in one of three consecutive ALL-BFM trials at a single institute. Replication analysis of positive findings was performed in an independent cohort of 475 patients from the ALL-BFM 2000 multicenter trial. RESULTS: A platelet count in the first quartile on treatment day 33 and a neutrophil count above the median on day 8 were significantly associated with treatment outcome, conferring multivariate risk ratios for an event of 3.27 (95% confidence interval 1.60-6.69) and 2.26 (95% confidence interval 1.23-4.29), respectively. Replication analysis confirmed the prognostic effect of platelet count on treatment day 33 and demonstrated a strong association with minimal residual disease-based risk group distribution (P<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Platelet counts after induction treatment may improve treatment stratification for patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and be of particular interest in non-minimal residual disease-based trials.

The objective of this study was to quantify blood and tissue levels of Th17 and other interleukin-17-producing cells in patients with this disease and correlate blood levels with clinical outcome. DESIGN AND METHODS: Intracellular interleukin-17A was assessed in blood and splenic mononuclear cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and healthy subjects using flow cytometry. Interleukin-17A-producing cells were analyzed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded spleen and lymph node sections using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The absolute numbers of Th17 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the percentages of Th17 cells in spleen cell suspensions were higher in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia than in healthy subjects; in six out of eight paired chronic lymphocytic leukemia blood and spleen sample comparisons, Th17 cells were enriched in spleen suspensions. Circulating Th17 levels correlated with better prognostic markers and longer overall survival of the patients. Two ""non-Th17"" interleukin-17-expressing cells were identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia spleens: proliferating cells of the granulocytic lineage and mature mast cells. Granulocytes and mast cells in normal spleens did not express interleukin-17. Conversely, both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and healthy lymph nodes contained similar numbers of interleukin-17+ mast cells as well as Th17 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Th17 cells are elevated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with better prognostic markers and correlate with longer survival. Furthermore, non-Th17 interleukin-17A-expressing cells exist in chronic lymphocytic leukemia spleens as maturing granulocytes and mature mast cells, suggesting that the microenvironmental milieu in leukemic spleens promotes the recruitment and/or expansion of Th17 and other IL-17-expressing cells. The pathophysiology of Th17 and non-Th17-interleukin-producing cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and their distributions and roles in this disease merit further study.","['Jain, Preetesh', 'Javdan, Mohammad', 'Feger, Franziska K', 'Chiu, Pui Yan', 'Sison, Cristina', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Bhuiya, Tawfiqul A', 'Sen, Filiz', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Sherry, Barbara']","['Jain P', 'Javdan M', 'Feger FK', 'Chiu PY', 'Sison C', 'Damle RN', 'Bhuiya TA', 'Sen F', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Burger JA', 'Rosenwald A', 'Allen SL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Sherry B']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, 350 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-17/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/mortality', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Prognosis', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/metabolism']",PMC3347674,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.047316 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.047316 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Apr;97(4):599-607. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.047316.

This protection is partially mediated by the chemokine SDF-1alpha (CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4 (CD184) present on the chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell surface. DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, we investigated the ability of AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, to sensitize chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to chemotherapy in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia/mesenchymal stromal cell based or nurse-like cell based microenvironment co-culture model. RESULTS: AMD3100 decreased CXCR4 expression signal (n=15, P=0.0078) and inhibited actin polymerization/migration in response to SDF-1alpha (n=8, P<0.01) and pseudoemperipolesis (n=10, P=0.0010), suggesting that AMD3100 interferes with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell trafficking. AMD3100 did not have a direct effect on apoptosis when chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were cultured alone (n=10, P=0.8812). However, when they were cultured with SDF-1alpha, mesenchymal stromal cells or nurse-like cells (protecting them from apoptosis, P<0.001), chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell pre-treatment with AMD3100 significantly inhibited these protective effects (n=8, P<0.01) and decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 and FLIP. Furthermore, combining AMD3100 with various drugs (fludarabine, cladribine, valproic acid, bortezomib, flavopiridol, methylprednisolone) in our mesenchymal stromal cell co-culture model enhanced drug-induced apoptosis (n=8, P<0.05) indicating that AMD3100 could mobilize chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells away from their protective microenvironment, making them more accessible to conventional therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that interfering with the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 axis by using AMD3100 inhibited chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell trafficking and microenvironment-mediated protective effects. Combining AMD3100 with other drugs may, therefore, represent a promising therapeutic approach to kill chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.","['Stamatopoulos, Basile', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'De Bruyn, Cecile', 'Pieters, Karlien', 'Mineur, Philippe', 'Le Roy, Christine', 'Saint-Georges, Stephane', 'Varin-Blank, Nadine', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Lagneaux, Laurence']","['Stamatopoulos B', 'Meuleman N', 'De Bruyn C', 'Pieters K', 'Mineur P', 'Le Roy C', 'Saint-Georges S', 'Varin-Blank N', 'Cymbalista F', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L']","['Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Institut Jules Bordet, Laboratoire de Therapie Cellulaire Clinique (LTCC), Boulevard de Waterloo 121, 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium. bstamato@ulb.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzylamines', 'Cell Communication/*drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclams', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/immunology', 'Protein Multimerization/drug effects', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects']",PMC3347654,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.052779 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.052779 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Apr;97(4):608-15. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.052779.

Given the established activity of hypomethylating agents such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia with 20-30% bone marrow blasts, we investigated whether this drug is also active in patients with more than 30% blasts. DESIGN AND METHODS: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of decitabine in patients over 60 years old with untreated acute myeloid leukemia ineligible for induction chemotherapy, 227 patients (median age, 72 years), many with comorbidities, adverse cytogenetics and/or preceding myelodysplastic syndrome were treated with this hypomethylating agent. During the initial decitabine treatment (135 mg/m(2) total dose infused intravenously over 72 hours every 6 weeks), a median of two cycles was administered (range, 1-4). All-trans retinoic acid was administered to 100 patients during course 2. Fifty-two patients who completed four cycles of treatment subsequently received a median of five maintenance courses (range, 1-19) with a lower dose of decitabine (20 mg/m(2)) infused over 1 hour on 3 consecutive days every 4-6 weeks. RESULTS: The complete and partial remission rate was 26%, 95% CI (20%, 32%), and an antileukemic effect was noted in 26% of patients. Response rates did not differ between patients with or without adverse cytogenetics; patients with monosomal karyotypes also responded. The median overall survival from the start of decitabine treatment was 5.5 months (range, 0-57.5+) and the 1-year survival rate was 28%, 95%CI (22%,34%). Toxicities were predominantly hematologic. CONCLUSIONS: Decitabine is well tolerated by older, medically non-fit patients with acute myeloid leukemia; myelosuppression is the major toxicity. The response rate and overall survival were not adversely influenced by poor-risk cytogenetics or myelodysplastic syndrome. Because of these encouraging results, randomized studies evaluating single-agent decitabine versus conventional treatment are warranted.

We report here the functional analysis of the NUP98-coiled-coil domain-containing protein 28A (NUP98-CCDC28A) fusion protein, expressed as the consequence of a recurrent t(6;11)(q24.1;p15.5) translocation. DESIGN AND METHODS: To gain insight into the function of the native CCDC28A gene, we collected information on any differential expression of CCDC28A among normal hematologic cell types and within subgroups of acute leukemia. To assess the in vivo effects of the NUP98-CCDC28A fusion, NUP98-CCDC28A or full length CCDC28A were retrovirally transduced into primary murine bone marrow cells and transduced cells were next transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated recipient mice. RESULTS: Our in silico analyses supported a contribution of CCDC28A to discrete stages of murine hematopoietic development. They also suggested selective enrichment of CCDC28A in the French-American-British M6 class of human acute leukemia. Primary murine hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with NUP98-CCDC28A generated a fully penetrant and transplantable myeloproliferative neoplasm-like myeloid leukemia and induced selective expansion of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors in the bone marrow of transplanted recipients, showing that NUP98-CCDC28A promotes the proliferative capacity and self-renewal potential of myeloid progenitors. In addition, the transformation mediated by NUP98-CCDC28A was not associated with deregulation of the Hoxa-Meis1 pathway, a feature shared by a diverse set of NUP98 fusions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the recurrent NUP98-CCDC28A is an oncogene that induces a rapid and transplantable myeloid neoplasm in recipient mice. They also provide additional evidence for an alternative leukemogenic mechanism for NUP98 oncogenes.","['Petit, Arnaud', 'Ragu, Christine', 'Soler, Gwendoline', 'Ottolenghi, Chris', 'Schluth, Caroline', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Schneider-Maunoury, Sylvie', 'Callebaut, Isabelle', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Drabkin, Harry A', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Romana, Serge', 'Penard-Lacronique, Virginie']","['Petit A', 'Ragu C', 'Soler G', 'Ottolenghi C', 'Schluth C', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Schneider-Maunoury S', 'Callebaut I', 'Dastugue N', 'Drabkin HA', 'Bernard OA', 'Romana S', 'Penard-Lacronique V']","['INSERM U985, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC3291592,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.047969 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.047969 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Mar;97(3):379-87. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.047969.

TWIST2 modulates the activity of a number of important transcription factors and is known to be a regulator of hematopoietic differentiation. Here, we investigated the significance of epigenetic regulation of TWIST2 in the control of cell growth and survival and in response to cytotoxic agents in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: TWIST2 promoter methylation status was assessed quantitatively, by combined bisulfite and restriction analysis (COBRA) and pyrosequencing assays, in multiple types of leukemia and TWIST2 expression was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. The functional role of TWIST2 in cell proliferation, survival and response to chemotherapy was assessed in transient and stable expression systems. RESULTS: We found that TWIST2 was inactivated in more than 50% of cases of childhood and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia through promoter hypermethylation and that this epigenetic regulation was especially prevalent in RUNX1-ETV6-driven cases. Re-expression of TWIST2 in cell lines resulted in a dramatic reduction in cell growth and induction of apoptosis in the Reh cell line. Furthermore, re-expression of TWIST2 resulted in increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide, daunorubicin and dexamethasone and TWIST2 hypermethylation was almost invariably found in relapsed adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (91% of samples hypermethylated). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a dual role for epigenetic inactivation of TWIST2 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, initially through altering cell growth and survival properties and subsequently by increasing resistance to chemotherapy.","['Thathia, Shabnam H', 'Ferguson, Stuart', 'Gautrey, Hannah E', 'van Otterdijk, Sanne D', 'Hili, Michela', 'Rand, Vikki', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Meyer, Stefan', 'Brown, Robert', 'Strathdee, Gordon']","['Thathia SH', 'Ferguson S', 'Gautrey HE', 'van Otterdijk SD', 'Hili M', 'Rand V', 'Moorman AV', 'Meyer S', 'Brown R', 'Strathdee G']","['Crucible Laboratory, Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE1 3BZ, UK.']",['eng'],['13086/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/*genetics']",PMC3291591,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.049593 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.049593 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Mar;97(3):371-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.049593.

Molecular characterization of a t(7;19)(q34;p13) in a pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient led to the identification of a translocation between the TRB@ and LYL1 loci. Similar to incidental T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases with synergistic, double translocations affecting TAL1/2 and LMO1/2 oncogenes, this LYL1-translocated patient also had an LMO2 rearrangement pointing to oncogenic cooperation between LYL1 and LMO2. In hierarchical cluster analyses based on gene-expression data, this sample consistently clustered along with cases having TAL1 or LMO2 rearrangements.

The resistance of certain patients to this monoclonal antibody prompted us to set up in vitro studies of another CD20-specific monoclonal antibody, B1 (later termed tositumomab). We hypothesized that the membrane lipid organization of leukemic B cells might be instrumental in the cells' sensitivity to the B1 monoclonal antibody. DESIGN AND METHODS: B lymphocytes from 36 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 13 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were investigated for B1-triggered cell death. Membrane components, such as sphingomyelin and ganglioside M1, were investigated by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation, together with the Csk-binding protein. RESULTS: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients segregated into two groups: B cells from one group were sensitive to B1, whereas those from the second group were not. Further results ascribed the resistance of these latter cases to a defective recruitment of Csk-binding protein, resulting in a lack of sphingomyelin and ganglioside M1 at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of their malignant B cells. Sphingolipids were indeed retained in the cytoplasm, because of lowered activity of P-glycoprotein. Supporting this mechanism, rifampicin, an inducer of P-glycoprotein, improved the activity of this transmembrane efflux pump, normalized the quantity of sphingomyelin within the membrane, and thereby restored the efficacy of the B1 monoclonal antibody in the formerly B1-resistant cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The lipid organization of membranes of B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia differs from one patient to another. In practice, given the relevance of the membrane lipid distribution to the efficacy of biotherapies, this observation is of potential importance.","['Hammadi, Mariam', 'Youinou, Pierre', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Tobon, Gabriel', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Bordron, Anne', 'Pers, Jacques-Olivier']","['Hammadi M', 'Youinou P', 'Tempescul A', 'Tobon G', 'Berthou C', 'Bordron A', 'Pers JO']","['EA2216 Immunology & Pathology, and IFR 148 ScInBioS, European University of Brittany, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Sphingolipids/*biosynthesis']",PMC3269491,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.051938 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.051938 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Feb;97(2):288-96. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.051938.

The p185(BCR/ABL) or the p210(BCR/ABL) fusion proteins are encoded as a result of the translocation, depending on whether a ""minor"" or ""major"" breakpoint occurs, respectively. Both p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) exhibit constitutively activated ABL kinase activity. Through fusion to BCR the ABL kinase in p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) ""escapes"" the auto-inhibition mechanisms of c-ABL, such as allosteric inhibition. A novel class of compounds including GNF-2 restores allosteric inhibition of the kinase activity and the transformation potential of BCR/ABL. Here we investigated whether there are differences between p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) regarding their sensitivity towards allosteric inhibition by GNF-2 in models of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the anti-proliferative activity of GNF-2 in different Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia models, such as cell lines, patient-derived long-term cultures and factor-dependent lymphatic Ba/F3 cells expressing either p185(BCR/ABL) or p210(BCR/ABL) and their resistance mutants. RESULTS: The inhibitory effects of GNF-2 differed constantly between p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) expressing cells. In all three Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia models, p210(BCR/ABL)-transformed cells were more sensitive to GNF-2 than were p185BCR/ABL-positive cells. Similar results were obtained for p185(BCR/ABL) and the p210(BCR/ABL) harboring resistance mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the first evidence of a differential response of p185(BCR/ABL)- and p210(BCR/ABL)- transformed cells to allosteric inhibition by GNF-2, which is of importance for the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia.","['Mian, Afsar A', 'Metodieva, Anna', 'Najajreh, Yousef', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Mahajna, Jamal', 'Ruthardt, Martin']","['Mian AA', 'Metodieva A', 'Najajreh Y', 'Ottmann OG', 'Mahajna J', 'Ruthardt M']","['Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany. mian@med.unifrankfurt.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Allosteric Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC3269486,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.047191 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.047191 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Feb;97(2):251-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.047191.

However, definitive identification of putative tumor suppressor genes remains controversial. Here we show that a 106-nucleotide noncoding RNA vault RNA2-1 (vtRNA2-1), previously misannotated as miR886, could potentially play a role in the biology and prognosis of AML. vtRNA2-1 is transcribed by polymerase III and is monoallelically methylated in 75% of healthy individuals whereas the remaining 25% of the population have biallelic hypomethylation. AML patients without methylation of VTRNA2-1 have a considerably better outcome than those with monoallelic or biallelic methylation (n = 101, P = .001). We show that methylation is inversely correlated with vtRNA2-1 expression, and that 5-azanucleosides induce vtRNA2-1 and down-regulate the phosphorylated RNA-dependent protein kinase (pPKR), whose activity has been shown to be modulated by vtRNA2-1. Because pPKR promotes cell survival in AML, the data are consistent with vtRNA2-1 being a tumor suppressor in AML. This is the first study to show that vtRNA2-1 might play a significant role in AML, that it is either mono- or biallelically expressed in the blood cells of healthy individuals, and that its methylation state predicts outcome in AML.","['Treppendahl, Marianne Bach', 'Qiu, Xiangning', 'Sogaard, Alexandra', 'Yang, Xiaojing', 'Nandrup-Bus, Cecilie', 'Hother, Christoffer', 'Andersen, Mette Klarskov', 'Kjeldsen, Lars', 'Mollgard, Lars', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Jendholm, Johan', 'Porse, Bo T', 'Jones, Peter A', 'Liang, Gangning', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten']","['Treppendahl MB', 'Qiu X', 'Sogaard A', 'Yang X', 'Nandrup-Bus C', 'Hother C', 'Andersen MK', 'Kjeldsen L', 'Mollgard L', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Jendholm J', 'Porse BT', 'Jones PA', 'Liang G', 'Gronbaek K']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA1378794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA82422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137894/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA082422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase III', 'RNA, Untranslated/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*genetics', 'eIF-2 Kinase/metabolism']",PMC3251229,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38554-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-362541 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 5;119(1):206-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-362541.

However, very little is known about their contribution to the progression of hematopoietic cancers. We investigated the role of monocytes in the progression of human B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). We demonstrated that coculturing human monocytes in vitro with CD19+ BCP-ALL blasts from patients ""conditioned"" them to an inflammatory phenotype characterized by significant up-regulation of the chemokine, CXCL10. This phenotype was also observable ex vivo in monocytes isolated from BCP-ALL patients, which show elevated CXCL10 production compared with monocytes from healthy donors. Functionally, the ""conditioned"" monocytes promoted migration and invasive capacity of BCP-ALL cells. Increased invasion was mediated by matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression and activity in the BCP-ALL cells induced by the monocyte-derived CXCL10. However, neither the ""conditioned"" monocytes nor the CXCL10 produced by these cells had any effect on the proliferation/viability of BCP-ALL cells and angiogenesis. Collectively, our results strongly suggest a protumoral role for human monocytes in BCP-ALL, orchestrated by CXCL10 and its effect on tumor cell migration and invasion.

We describe the case of a 37-year-old woman who had CML and pain in the extremities. She was diagnosed with lymphoid blast crisis of CML on the basis of the following findings: presence of promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes in peripheral blood smear; detection of major and minor BCR/ABL transcripts by polymerase chain reaction analysis; proliferation of lymphoblastic cells with abnormal B-cell phenotype; and aberrant expression of myeloid antigens in the bone marrow. The patient underwent one course of idarubicin and cytosine arabinose therapy combined with imatinib followed by daunorubicin/cyclophosphamide plus vincristine and prednisone/L: -asparaginase (DNR/COP/L: -ASP) therapy, high-dose cytosine arabinose, and CHOP therapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone). Subsequently, the patient underwent high-dose chemotherapy (total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide) followed by allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated donor. After these treatments, the patient was disease-free for 19 months.

Using a series of agents with known sub-cellular targets, we explored the determinants of photodynamic inhibition of endocytic processes in three cell lines: A murine leukemia, a murine hepatoma, and a non-malignant epithelial cell line of human origin. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PI-3 kinase antagonist wortmannin blocks endosomal processing pathway dependent on this enzyme, providing an indication of the ""flux"" of endocytosis. Microscopic observations were used to assess the effect of photodamage on this pathway. Photosensitizing agents specific for mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomal, and endosomal photodamage were employed. RESULTS: Sub-lethal photodamage directed against endosomes or lysosomes interrupted early steps in this endocytic process in the hepatoma cell line. A mechanism for these effects is proposed. Mitochondrial photodamage could interrupt endocytosis, but at levels that also induced apoptosis. ER photodamage did not affect endocytosis even at lethal levels. Somewhat similar results were obtained with other cell lines, but there were sufficient differences to indicate that the cell phenotype is, in part, a determinant of the endocytic response to PDT. CONCLUSIONS: PDT is therefore seen to have an effect on endocytic processes. Further work will be needed to delineate the role of these endocytic effects in the array of responses to photodynamic therapy.","['Kessel, David']",['Kessel D'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA. dhkessel@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA023378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA023378-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA 23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Lasers Surg Med,Lasers in surgery and medicine,8007168,IM,"['Androstadienes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Mesoporphyrins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Organelles/drug effects/physiology', 'Organometallic Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Porphyrins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Wortmannin']",PMC3211108,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/08/11 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/lsm.21067 [doi]'],ppublish,Lasers Surg Med. 2011 Sep;43(7):542-7. doi: 10.1002/lsm.21067.,,,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Mesoporphyrins)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '113719-89-4 (benzoporphyrin D)', '68637-19-4 (aluminum phthalocyanine disulfonate)', 'FU21S769PF (temoporfin)', 'P4ROX5ELT2 (Talaporfin)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS292010'],,,,,,,,,,

The KMWNTs-[BMIM]PF(6) can electrocatalyze oxygen reduction to generate a strong current signal in neutral solution. Compared with KMWNTs without [BMIM]PF(6) or MWNTs-[BMIM]PF(6) composites, the KMWNTs-[BMIM]PF(6) can enhance the oxygen reduction peak current by 6.2-fold and 2.8-fold, which greatly increases the detection sensitivity of oxygen. Then, O(2) (-) biosensors are fabricated by mixing superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the KMWNTs-[BMIM]PF(6) gels via monitoring oxygen produced by an enzymic reaction between SOD/O(2) (-) without the help of electron mediators. The resulting biosensors show a linear range from 0.04 to 38 muM with a high sensitivity of 98.2 muA mM(-1), and a lower detection limit of 0.024 muM. The common interferents such as hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), and metabolites of neurotransmitters, do not interfere with the detection of O(2) (-).

We show that treatment with b-AP15 inhibited tumor progression in four different in vivo solid tumor models and inhibited organ infiltration in an acute myeloid leukemia model. Our results show that the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle is a new anticancer drug target.","[""D'Arcy, Padraig"", 'Brnjic, Slavica', 'Olofsson, Maria Hagg', 'Fryknas, Marten', 'Lindsten, Kristina', 'De Cesare, Michelandrea', 'Perego, Paola', 'Sadeghi, Behnam', 'Hassan, Moustapha', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Linder, Stig']","[""D'Arcy P"", 'Brnjic S', 'Olofsson MH', 'Fryknas M', 'Lindsten K', 'De Cesare M', 'Perego P', 'Sadeghi B', 'Hassan M', 'Larsson R', 'Linder S']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111106,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Carboxypeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Piperidones/*pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/drug effects/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2010/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2536 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2536 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Med. 2011 Nov 6;17(12):1636-40. doi: 10.1038/nm.2536.,,,"['0 (3,5-bis((4-nitrophenyl)methylidene)-1-prop-2-enoylpiperidin-4-one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Piperidones)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (USP14 protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (Usp14 protein, mouse)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.- (Carboxypeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (UCHL5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 13)']",,,,,,"['Nat Rev Cancer. 2012 Jan;12(1):5.

To help resolve the potential role of XMRV in human disease, it is critical to develop sensitive and accurate reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays to screen for the virus. Single-round RT-PCR assays were developed on the automated m2000 system for detection of the pol or env regions of XMRV in whole blood, plasma, urine cell pellets and urogenital swab samples. Assay performance was assessed by testing two blinded panels, one comprised of whole blood and the other of plasma spiked with serial dilutions of XMRV-infected tissue culture cells and supernatant, respectively, prepared by the Blood XMRV Scientific Research Working Group (SRWG). For both whole blood and plasma panel testing, the assays showed excellent specificity and sensitivity as compared to the other tests included in the SRWG phase I study. Analytical specificity of the assays was also evaluated. Neither pol nor env PCR assays detected a panel of potential cross-reactive microorganisms, although some cross-reaction was observed with mouse genomic DNA. Screening of 196 normal human blood donor plasma, 214 HIV-1 seropositive plasma, 20 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate cancer specimens, 4 FFPE benign prostate specimens, 400 urine pellets from prostate cancer patients, 166 urine pellets from non-prostate cancer patients, and 135 cervical swab specimens, detected no samples as unequivocally XMRV positive.","['Tang, Ning', 'Frank, Andrea', 'Leckie, Gregor', 'Hackett, John Jr', 'Simmons, Graham', 'Busch, Michael', 'Abravaya, Klara']","['Tang N', 'Frank A', 'Leckie G', 'Hackett J Jr', 'Simmons G', 'Busch M', 'Abravaya K']","['Abbott Molecular Inc., Des Plaines, IL 60018, USA. ning.tang@abbott.com']",['eng'],['HHSN268200517181C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111025,Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,IM,"['Aged', 'Automation/methods', 'Blood/virology', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', 'Gene Products, pol/*genetics', 'Genitalia/virology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/*methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Retroviridae Infections/*diagnosis/virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Urine/virology', 'Virology/methods', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*isolation & purification']",PMC3573700,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/04/20 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0166-0934(11)00426-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2012 Jan;179(1):127-34. doi: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.10.010.

This suggests that DDR1 might be a new therapeutic target. However, further insight into the DDR1 signaling pathway is required in order to support its further development. Here, we investigated DDR1 proximal signaling by the analysis of protein-protein interactions using proteomic approaches. All known interactors of DDR1 were identified and localized to specific phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor. In addition, we identified numerous signaling proteins as new putative phosphotyrosine mediated interactors including RasGAP, SHIP1, SHIP2, STATs, PI3K and the SRC family kinases. Most of the new proteins contain SH2 and PTB domains and for all interactors we could directly point the site of interaction to specific phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor. The identified proteins have roles in the early steps of the signaling cascade, propagating the signal from the DDR1 receptor into the cell. The map of phosphotyrosine mediated interactors of DDR1 created in this study will serve as a starting point for functional investigations which will enhance our knowledge on the role of the DDR1 receptor in health and disease.

Among the PCR-based markers, genetic alterations are found in acute myelogenous leukemia patients with cytogenetically normal karyotype and can be considered as applicable targets for monitoring of MRD. Screening, confirmation and quantification procedures are important to develop the patient- or tumor-specific MRD assays using the PCR-based markers. Wild-type blocking PCR or coamplification at lower denaturing temperature-PCR is suited for screening of low-abundant genetic alterations, and allele-specific qPCR using primers including mismatched base and locked nucleic acids can quantify not only insertion and duplication of several nucleotides but also single nucleotide mutation in the presence of an excess amount of wild-type nucleotides.

In the adult hematopoietic system, HH signaling regulates intrathymic T-cell development, and it is one of the survival signals provided by follicular dendritic cells to prevent apoptosis in germinal center B cells. HH signaling is required for primitive hematopoiesis; however, conflicting data have been reported regarding the role of the HH pathway in adult hematopoiesis. Inappropriate activation of the HH signaling pathway occurs in several human cancers, including hematological neoplasms. Emerging data demonstrate abnormal HH pathway activation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and acute leukemias. In these neoplasms, HH signaling promotes proliferation and survival, contributes to the maintenance of cancer stem cells, and enhances tolerance or resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we review current understanding of HH signaling, its role in the pathobiology of hematological malignancies, and its potential as a therapeutic target to treat malignant hematological neoplasms.","['Ok, Chi Young', 'Singh, Rajesh Ramachandra', 'Vega, Francisco']","['Ok CY', 'Singh RR', 'Vega F']","['Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA143151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P50CA136411-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 K08 CA143151-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111101,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/etiology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",PMC3338341,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9440(11)00899-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2012 Jan;180(1):2-11. doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.09.009.

We show that Bak is dispensable for apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli including ABT-737 but not for fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. In addition, Bax deficiency only provides partial protection against camptothecin and cisplatin-induced apoptosis and no protection against killing by Puma or ABT-737 plus Noxa overexpression. Moreover, Bak is activated normally in response to many chemotherapeutic drugs in the presence of Bax, but remains kept in check by Mcl-1 in the absence of Bax.

We performed a survey of vancomycin use in that population to assess the accuracy of our dosing guidelines. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts and laboratory results of vancomycin prescription and monitoring in adult acute myeloid leukemia patients with febrile neutropenia in a teaching hospital. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients received 67 vancomycin courses between January 2005 and April 2007. A loading dose was used in 97% of cases dosed at a mean 15.5+/-3.3mg/kg. It was followed by a continuous infusion of an average 35.4+/-6.9mg/kg per day maintenance dose. Serum monitoring yielded serum levels above the 20mg/L target in only 12% of cases. Despite higher dose, the target concentration was only reached in 32% of cases, after a mean 1.5 dose adjustment. The mean final maintenance dose was 42.1+/-9.4mg/kg per day. Vancomycin was well tolerated and induced only two temporary increases in serum creatinine. The treatment was microbiologically justified in only two cases. The mean length of therapy was 7.7+/-4.4 days and 41 over 65 (63%) non-documented infections were treated for more than five days despite local guidelines recommending a maximum 5-day course without bacterial documentation. Overall, only seven (10%) vancomycin courses complied with all defined criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin use was not optimal. We updated our guidelines after the study to dramatically reduce vancomycin indications in leukemia patients. When it is indicated, following the loading dose, we more closely monitor vancomycin serum levels to allow for an earlier dose adjustment when necessary.","['Hochart, C', 'Berthon, C', 'Corm, S', 'Gay, J', 'Cliquennois, M', 'Tricot, S', 'Alfandari, S']","['Hochart C', 'Berthon C', 'Corm S', 'Gay J', 'Cliquennois M', 'Tricot S', 'Alfandari S']","['Pharmacie centrale, CHRU de Lille, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111106,France,Med Mal Infect,Medecine et maladies infectieuses,0311416,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*blood/drug therapy/etiology', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Fever/*etiology', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Hospitals, University/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Inappropriate Prescribing', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Kidney Diseases/blood/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/complications/immunology', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staphylococcal Infections/blood/drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control', 'Vancomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0399-077X(11)00292-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.medmal.2011.09.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Mal Infect. 2011 Dec;41(12):652-6. doi: 10.1016/j.medmal.2011.09.014.

Immune modulators have been used in treatment; however, a novel class of thrombopoietin mimetics has recently been developed. Eltrombopag is approved for patients with chronic ITP who have failed initial treatments with traditional immune modulators or splenectomy. OBJECTIVES: The goals of this review were to summarize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy, and tolerability of eltrombopag and review the approved and investigational uses of this drug. METHODS: A search of Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted using the terms eltrombopag or SB-497115-GR. In addition, all reviews and preclinical and clinical studies published in English between January 1980 and January 2011 were identified in PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews using the same terms. RESULTS: A total of 153 publications and 13 clinical trials were identified; 14 publications were excluded because they were not published in English. A Phase III trial randomized 114 patients with ITP 2:1 to eltrombopag 50 mg or placebo and demonstrated by day 43 a significantly greater proportion of patients responding in the eltrombopag group than in the placebo group (59% vs 16%, odds ratio [OR] = 9.61; 95% CI, 3.31-27.86; P < 0.0001). The mean percentage change of platelets from baseline in the eltrombopag group was double that of the placebo group at day 8 and was sustained several-fold higher throughout the remainder of the treatment period. Another Phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag compared with placebo over 6 months. The odds of responding (defined as a platelet count of 50-400 x 10(9)/L) were 8 times higher in patients receiving eltrombopag than in those in the placebo group (95% CI, 3.59-18.73; P < 0.0001). Bone marrow fibrosis and hepatotoxicity are the most serious adverse effects, and nausea and vomiting are the most common. Eltrombopag is also being evaluated in the treatment of thrombocytopenia secondary to hepatitis C infection, chemotherapy, acute leukemia, and myelodysplasias. CONCLUSION: Eltrombopag is well tolerated and effective in raising platelet counts in patients with chronic ITP.","['Zhang, Yang', 'Kolesar, Jill M']","['Zhang Y', 'Kolesar JM']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111104,United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,IM,"['Benzoates/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*drug therapy', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*agonists']",,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(11)00675-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2011 Nov;33(11):1560-76. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.10.004.

This has changed the role of allo-SCT and the number of patients undergoing allo-SCT has declined dramatically. Allo-SCT is currently recommended for patients in accelerated/blast phase disease, those who have failed a second-generation TKI and those with TKI-resistant mutations such as T315I.

A few patients treated with imatinib are either refractory to imatinib or eventually relapse. Resistance is frequently associated with mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL. Over 100 point mutations coding for single amino acid substitutions in the BCR-ABL kinase domain have been isolated from CML patients resistant to imatinib treatment. Most reported mutants are rare, whereas 7 mutated residues comprise two-thirds of all mutations detected. BCR-ABL mutations affect amino acids involved in imatinib binding or in regulatory regions of the BCR-ABL kinase domain, resulting in decreased sensitivity to imatinib while retaining aberrant kinase activity. The early detection of BCR-ABL mutants during therapy may aid in risk stratification as well as molecularly based treatment decisions.","['Ernst, Thomas', 'La Rosee, Paul', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Ernst T', 'La Rosee P', 'Muller MC', 'Hochhaus A']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0889-8588(11)00102-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.hoc.2011.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,"Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2011 Oct;25(5):997-1008, v-vi. doi: 10.1016/j.hoc.2011.09.005.",,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['Copyright A(c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Cancer referral guidelines help GPs decide which patients to refer urgently for further investigation. AIM: To examine primary care referral patterns, compliance with referral guidance, and eventual outcome for patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective audit within general practice in Scotland. METHOD: GPs in Scotland reviewed all urgent suspected cancer referrals over a 6-month period. They noted the final diagnosis and assessed whether the referral was in accordance with agreed referral guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 18 775 urgent suspected cancer referrals were analysed from 516 GP practices. The referral rate ranged from 3.7 to 24.0 per 1000 per annum; 30.8% of referrals were for patients aged under 50 years, yet this age group accounts for only 11.1% of all diagnosed cancers; 10.3% of all urgent cancer referrals were for suspected melanoma, despite this cancer accounting for only 4.1% of new cancers. The proportion of patients subsequently diagnosed with cancer was greatest for leukaemia (61.7%), prostate (52.6%), and lung cancer referrals (39.7%), and lowest for melanoma (11.8%), oesophago-gastric (11.2%), brain (10.6%), and laryngeal cancer referrals (7.8%). Compliance with referral guidelines was 90.9%. A large proportion of referrals considered to be outside the guidelines still had a cancer diagnosed (urological 15.9%, lung 8.8%, colorectal 8.4%, and breast 6.4%). CONCLUSION: There is wide variation in GP referral rates for suspected cancer with a greater than expected proportion of referrals for younger people. Many referrals considered to be outside the national guidelines were diagnosed with cancer, suggesting factors other than those in referral guidelines alert GPs to the possibility of cancer.","['Baughan, Paul', 'Keatings, Jennifer', ""O'Neill, Bill""]","['Baughan P', 'Keatings J', ""O'Neill B""]","['Falkirk Community Hospital, Westburn Avenue, Falkirk, Scotland. paul.baughan@nhs.net']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Gen Pract,The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,9005323,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Delayed Diagnosis', 'Female', 'General Practice/*standards', 'Guideline Adherence/*standards', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prospective Studies', 'Referral and Consultation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Scotland/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3207087,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3399/bjgp11X606591 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Gen Pract. 2011 Nov;61(592):e700-6. doi: 10.3399/bjgp11X606591.,,,,,,,,,"['Br J Gen Pract. 2011 Nov;61(592):653-4.

The aim of the present research was to collect clinical data on efficacy and safety in a systematic way by conducting a survey on clinical experience with sorafenib. Thirty institutions were asked to document all patients treated with sorafenib diagnosed with AML. Of all 29 evaluable patients, six (21%) responded to sorafenib containing treatment by achieving a complete remission (CR, n = 2) or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRi, n = 4). In 23 patients receiving sorafenib as monotherapy, the CRi rate amounted to 13% and no CRs were documented. Of the 18 FLT-ITD positive patients with sorafenib monotherapy, two patients achieved a CRi (11%). In five FLT3-ITD negative cases, one CRi was documented (20%).

METHODS: A complex evaluation of the analytical properties of the three most frequently used detection methods--PCR followed by agarose (AGE), polyacrylamide (PAGE) or capillary electrophoresis (CE)--was performed on 95 DNA samples obtained from 73 AML patients. RESULTS: All the three methods verified the presence of a mutant allele in 20 samples from 18 patients. AGE and PAGE could detect the presence of 1%-2% mutant allele, while the detection limit of CE was 0.28%. However, acceptable reproducibility (inter-assay CV <25%) of the mutant allele rate determination was only achievable above 1.5% mutant/total allele rate. The reproducibility of the ITD size determination by CE was much better, but the ITD size calculated by PeakScanner or GeneScan analysis was 7% lower as compared to values obtained by DNA sequencing. The presence of multiple ITD was over-estimated by PAGE and AGE due to the formation of heteroduplexes.

HMGA1 functions as a potent oncogene in cultured cells and induces aggressive lymphoid tumors in transgenic mice. Because HMGA1 chromatin remodeling proteins regulate transcription, HMGA1 is thought to drive malignant transformation by modulating expression of specific genes. Genome-wide studies to define HMGA1 transcriptional networks during tumorigenesis, however, are lacking. To define the HMGA1 transcriptome, we analyzed gene expression profiles in lymphoid cells from HMGA1a transgenic mice at different stages in tumorigenesis. RESULTS: RNA from lymphoid samples at 2 months (before tumors develop) and 12 months (after tumors are well-established) was screened for differential expression of > 20,000 unique genes by microarray analysis (Affymetrix) using a parametric and nonparametric approach. Differential expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR in a subset of genes. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for cellular pathways and functions using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Early in tumorigenesis, HMGA1 induced inflammatory pathways with NFkappaB identified as a major node. In established tumors, HMGA1 induced pathways involved in cell cycle progression, cell-mediated immune response, and cancer. At both stages in tumorigenesis, HMGA1 induced pathways involved in cellular development, hematopoiesis, and hematologic development. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that stem cell and immature T cell genes are enriched in the established tumors. To determine if these results are relevant to human tumors, we knocked-down HMGA1 in human T-cell leukemia cells and identified a subset of genes dysregulated in both the transgenic and human lymphoid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: We found that HMGA1 induces inflammatory pathways early in lymphoid tumorigenesis and pathways involved in stem cells, cell cycle progression, and cancer in established tumors. HMGA1 also dyregulates genes and pathways involved in stem cells, cellular development and hematopoiesis at both early and late stages of tumorigenesis. These results provide insight into HMGA1 function during tumor development and point to cellular pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets in lymphoid and other human cancers with aberrant HMGA1 expression.","['Schuldenfrei, Andrew', 'Belton, Amy', 'Kowalski, Jeanne', 'Talbot, C Conover Jr', 'Di Cello, Francescopaolo', 'Poh, Weijie', 'Tsai, Hua-Ling', 'Shah, Sandeep N', 'Huso, Tait H', 'Huso, David L', 'Resar, Linda M S']","['Schuldenfrei A', 'Belton A', 'Kowalski J', 'Talbot CC Jr', 'Di Cello F', 'Poh W', 'Tsai HL', 'Shah SN', 'Huso TH', 'Huso DL', 'Resar LM']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['R03 CA139331/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA134292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA2149550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA149550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, cdc', 'HMGA1a Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', '*Transcriptome']",PMC3245506,2011/11/08 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-12-549 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-12-549 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2011 Nov 4;12:549. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-12-549.,,,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '124544-67-8 (HMGA1a Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median values of CD38%, sP53 and VEGF were significantly higher in both high and intermediate risk subgroups of the modified Rai staging system when compared to low risk subgroup. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between CD38% and VEGF in all subgroups. However, positive correlation between VEGF and sP53 was only observed in the high risk subgroup. The strong correlation between CD38 and VEGF in CLL patients, suggests the possibility that angiogenic factors might contribute to the more aggressive clinical behavior of CD38+ CLL.

Aberrations in the cell cycle control are often observed in tumors and might even be mandatory in tumor development. There are few molecular biologic determinants that may be prognostic for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To investigate the importance of cell cycle defects in AML, the cellular levels of cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P27 (Kip 1) were evaluated in thirty AML patients (11 males and 19 females) diagnosed by standard clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic criteria and staged according to the FAB classification. Using immunoblot analysis, cyclin E and P27 were detected in blast cells of AML patients who were then treated by the standard AML chemotherapeutic protocol and were followed up. With respect to cyclin E, it was detected in 9/30(30%) AML cases among them 13.3% (4/30 cases) exhibited very strong bands while 16.6% (5/30 cases) showed faint bands. Cyclin E was high among M4/M5 cases and low among M3 cases and showed a statistically significant positive correlation with percentage of blast cells, aberrant phenotype and abnormal karyotype at diagnosis. It also showed a significant negative correlation with complete remission (CR) rates. All our AML cases exhibited P27 at low and high levels as seen in 19/30 (63.4%) and 11/30 (36.6%) cases, respectively. P27 showed a statistically significant negative correlation to the percentage of blasts at diagnosis and a significant positive correlation with achievement of CR. A significant negative correlation between P27 and cyclin E (P < 0.004) was observed as well. The present study suggested that levels of cell cycle regulators cyclin E and P27 can be used as a useful prognostic molecular markers in AML patients.","['Abdel Alim, Afaf', 'Youssef, Soha R', 'Farouk, Hanan Mohamed']","['Abdel Alim A', 'Youssef SR', 'Farouk HM']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cyclin E/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",,2010/01/01 00:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2010;17(1):9-18.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of the disease provide hope that targeted therapies can more effectively treat the disease with less toxicity.","['Ribera, Josep-Maria']",['Ribera JM'],"[""Clinical Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain;""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Pediatr Rep,Pediatric reports,101551542,,,PMC3206531,2011/11/05 06:00,2011/11/05 06:01,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4081/pr.2011.s2.e1 [doi]', 'pr.2011.s2.e1 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Rep. 2011 Jun 22;3 Suppl 2:e1. doi: 10.4081/pr.2011.s2.e1.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adults.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Halofuginone (HF), a low-molecular-weight alkaloid that modulates TGFbeta signaling, was used to treat APL cell lines and non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice subjected to transplantation with leukemic cells from human chorionic gonadotrophin-PML-RARalpha transgenic mice (TG). Cell cycle analysis using incorporated bromodeoxyuridine and 7-amino-actinomycin D showed that, in NB4 and NB4-R2 APL cell lines, HF inhibited cellular proliferation (P<0.001) and induced apoptosis (P = 0.002) after a 24-hour incubation. Addition of TGFbeta revealed that NB4 cells were resistant to its growth-suppressive effects and that HF induced these effects in the presence or absence of the cytokine. Cell growth inhibition was associated with up-regulation of TGFbeta target genes involved in cell cycle regulation (TGFB, TGFBRI, SMAD3, p15, and p21) and down-regulation of MYC. Additionally, TGFbeta protein levels were decreased in leukemic TG animals and HF in vivo could restore TGFbeta values to normal. To test the in vivo anti-leukemic activity of HF, we transplanted NOD/SCID mice with TG leukemic cells and treated them with HF for 21 days. HF induced partial hematological remission in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. Together, these results suggest that HF has anti-proliferative and anti-leukemic effects by reversing the TGFbeta blockade in APL. Since loss of the TGFbeta response in leukemic cells may be an important second oncogenic hit, modulation of TGFbeta signaling may be of therapeutic interest.","['de Figueiredo-Pontes, Lorena L', 'Assis, Patricia A', 'Santana-Lemos, Barbara A A', 'Jacomo, Rafael H', 'Lima, Ana Silvia G', 'Garcia, Aglair B', 'Thome, Carolina H', 'Araujo, Amelia G', 'Panepucci, Rodrigo A', 'Zago, Marco A', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Falcao, Roberto P', 'Rego, Eduardo M']","['de Figueiredo-Pontes LL', 'Assis PA', 'Santana-Lemos BA', 'Jacomo RH', 'Lima AS', 'Garcia AB', 'Thome CH', 'Araujo AG', 'Panepucci RA', 'Zago MA', 'Nagler A', 'Falcao RP', 'Rego EM']","['Hematology Division of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111028,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Quinazolinones/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Smad3 Protein/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC3203897,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2010/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0026713 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-05501 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26713. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026713.

In the present study, we show that ATP and UTP have strikingly opposite effects on human acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cells. Leukemic cells express P2Rs. ATP-stimulated leukemic cells, but not normal CD34+ cells, undergo down-regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration, whereas cell-cycle inhibitors are up-regulated. Functionally, ATP induced the inhibition of proliferation and accumulation of AML cells, but not of normal cells, in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Exposure to ATP or UTP inhibited AML-cell migration in vitro. In vivo, xenotransplantation experiments demonstrated that the homing and engraftment capacity of AML blasts and CD34+CD38- cells to immunodeficient mice BM was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with nucleotides. P2R-expression analysis and pharmacologic profiling suggested that the inhibition of proliferation by ATP was mediated by the down-regulation of the P2X7R, which is up-regulated on untreated blasts, whereas the inhibition of chemotaxis was mainly mediated via P2Y2R and P2Y4R subtypes. We conclude that, unlike normal cells, P2R signaling inhibits leukemic cells and therefore its pharmacologic modulation may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.","['Salvestrini, Valentina', 'Zini, Roberta', 'Rossi, Lara', 'Gulinelli, Sara', 'Manfredini, Rossella', 'Bianchi, Elisa', 'Piacibello, Wanda', 'Caione, Luisa', 'Migliardi, Giorgia', 'Ricciardi, Maria Rosaria', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Romano, Marco', 'Salati, Simona', 'Di Virgilio, Francesco', 'Ferrari, Sergio', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Ferrari, Davide', 'Lemoli, Roberto M']","['Salvestrini V', 'Zini R', 'Rossi L', 'Gulinelli S', 'Manfredini R', 'Bianchi E', 'Piacibello W', 'Caione L', 'Migliardi G', 'Ricciardi MR', 'Tafuri A', 'Romano M', 'Salati S', 'Di Virgilio F', 'Ferrari S', 'Baccarani M', 'Ferrari D', 'Lemoli RM']","['Department of Hematology and Oncological Sciences, L. & A.

These morphological and biochemical changes are regulated by a plethora of ligands, which upon binding to specific receptors trigger the activation of many signaling pathways, such as janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (MAPK3/1). We used the forskolin-induced syncytialization of trophoblastlike BeWo cells to characterize at the cellular level the effect mediated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on trophoblast differentiation and to describe its action at the molecular level. Forskolin induces both hCG secretion and BeWo cell syncytial fusion. Although LIF had no effect on the undifferentiated state of the cells, the cytokine generated a strong reduction in forskolin-induced hCG release. In contrast to its effect on hCG secretion, LIF exerts a synergistic effect toward forskolin-induced fusion. LIF reduced hormonal production through a STAT1- and STAT3-dependent mechanism, whereas MAPK3/1 was not involved in this process. However, both types of signaling molecules were required to mediate the action of LIF in forskolin-induced cell fusion. These data provide novel insights into the regulation of trophoblast cell differentiation by LIF and describe for the first time the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of the cytokine.","['Leduc, Katy', 'Bourassa, Vincent', 'Asselin, Eric', 'Leclerc, Pierre', 'Lafond, Julie', 'Reyes-Moreno, Carlos']","['Leduc K', 'Bourassa V', 'Asselin E', 'Leclerc P', 'Lafond J', 'Reyes-Moreno C']","['Groupe de Recherche en Oncologie et Endocrinologie Moleculaires, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120229,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Choriocarcinoma/pathology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/physiology', 'Janus Kinase 2/physiology', 'Janus Kinases/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Trophoblastic Tumor, Placental Site/*pathology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/pathology']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.111.094334 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.111.094334 [doi]']",epublish,Biol Reprod. 2012 Feb 29;86(2):54. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.111.094334.

We hypothesized that tissue macrophages influence these events to promote uterine receptivity. To investigate the role of macrophages in regulating epithelial cell expression of genes linked to glycan-mediated embryo adhesion, Ishikawa, RL95-2 and HEC1A endometrial epithelial cells were cultured alone or with unactivated or lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytic U937 cells, separated using transwell inserts. Expression of mRNAs encoding two alpha1,2-fucosyltransferases (FUT1, FUT2) was increased in all three epithelial cell lines following co-culture with U937 cells, and was associated with increased fucosylation of cell surface glycoproteins detected using lectins from Ulex europaeus (UEA-1) and Dolichos biflorus (DBA). FUT1 induction by U937 cells also occurred in primary endometrial epithelial cells collected in luteal but not proliferative phase. Activation of the interleukin-6 (IL6)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine signaling pathway with phosphorylation of STAT3 and elevated SOCS3 mRNA expression was evident in epithelial cells stimulated by U937 co-culture. Several recombinant macrophage-secreted cytokines exerted stimulatory or inhibitory effects on FUT1 and FUT2 mRNA expression, and the macrophage-derived cytokine LIF partially replicated the effects of U937 cells on both FUT1 and FUT2 expression and UEA-1 and DBA lectin reactivity in Ishikawa cells. These results suggest that macrophage-derived factors including LIF might facilitate development of an implantation-receptive endometrium by regulating surface glycan structures in epithelial cells.

The aim was to study the effect of imatinib on growth in children with CML. PROCEDURE: Children </=13 years of age at diagnosis were enrolled retrospectively, from 2004 to 2011, from a single center in India. Patients who received imatinib for >1 year were included for growth assessment. Height standard deviation scores (SDS) were derived from WHO-AnthroPlus, a global growth monitoring tool. RESULTS: Thirty-four children received imatinib. Twenty children fulfilled the criteria for assessment of growth. Median age was 10 years (range: 2-13). Of 20 children, 13 were prepubertal at commencement of imatinib. The mean duration of imatinib in 20 children was 61.3 +/- 16.2 months (range: 31-83). No patient was treated with a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor or a stem cell transplant. Highly significant reduction in height SDS's was observed (P = 0.002 at 5th year). Children who started imatinib therapy after the onset of puberty were immune to this adverse effect (P = 0.448 and 0.003 at 5th year of treatment for pubertal and prepubertal children, respectively). The 5-year survival probability of 33 children who received imatinib in chronic phase was 80% with a median survival time of 60 months (mean: 70.2; 95% CI: 60-80.5). CONCLUSIONS: Growth retardation is a significant adverse effect of imatinib in children with CML. The failure to gain appropriate height was most discernible when imatinib was initiated in the prepubertal period. Etiology and remedial measures need to be investigated.","['Bansal, Deepak', 'Shava, Upender', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Trehan, Amita', 'Marwaha, R K']","['Bansal D', 'Shava U', 'Varma N', 'Trehan A', 'Marwaha RK']","['Advanced Pediatric Center, Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. deepakritu@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111102,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Body Height/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Growth/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23389 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Sep;59(3):481-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23389.

The quantification of MRD by flow cytometry (FC) is based on the identification of a leukemia-associated phenotype (LAP). Because phenotypic switch is common during treatment, multiple LAPs must be available and used for MRD detection over time. We evaluated the potential usefulness of CD304 as a new marker for monitoring MRD. CD304 was expressed in 48% of B-ALL (24/50) with discriminative fluorescence intensity compared with CD304-negative normal B-cell precursors (n = 15). The sensitivity of CD304-based MRD detection reached 10(-4), as with some of established LAPs. The stability of CD304 expression evaluated during therapy and at relapse confirms the usefulness of this marker for MRD quantification. Finally, CD304 was repeatedly expressed in patients with TEL-AML1 gene rearrangement, which warrants further investigation on its potential relevance as a prognosis marker or therapeutic target.","['Solly, Francoise', 'Angelot, Fanny', 'Garand, Richard', 'Ferrand, Christophe', 'Seilles, Estelle', 'Schillinger, Francoise', 'Decobecq, Agnes', 'Billot, Maryse', 'Larosa, Fabrice', 'Plouvier, Emmanuel', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Legrand, Faezeh', 'Saas, Philippe', 'Rohrlich, Pierre-Simon', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine']","['Solly F', 'Angelot F', 'Garand R', 'Ferrand C', 'Seilles E', 'Schillinger F', 'Decobecq A', 'Billot M', 'Larosa F', 'Plouvier E', 'Deconinck E', 'Legrand F', 'Saas P', 'Rohrlich PS', 'Garnache-Ottou F']","[""Etablissement Francais du sang Bourgogne franche Comte, Laboratoire d'hematologie-immunologie-biologie moleculaire, Besancon, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111103,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

CASE REPORT: we present a rare case of a 6.5-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and L-asparaginase (L-asp) induced pancreatitis, who developed epileptic seizures, possibly associated with octreotide administration. Her imaging and laboratory findings ruled out a leukemic involvement or infection of CNS. The EEG revealed repetitive sharp waves maximal on the frontal and temporal areas of the right hemisphere. The child was treated with diazepam and she continued with systemic anticonvulsant treatment with levetiracetam. After 2 weeks of conservative treatment, pancreatitis resolved and she continued her chemotherapy protocol. Levetiracetam treatment lasted 8 months. 7 months after the first episode, EEG was reported as normal, and the child completed the chemotherapy protocol without any further severe complications. CONCLUSIONS: Larger and well designed studies are needed to warrant the safety of octreotide in pediatric population.","['Hatzipantelis, E', 'Pana, Z D', 'Pavlou, E', 'Balakou, E', 'Tsotoulidou, V', 'Papageorgiou, T', 'Tragiannidis, A', 'Athanassiadou, F']","['Hatzipantelis E', 'Pana ZD', 'Pavlou E', 'Balakou E', 'Tsotoulidou V', 'Papageorgiou T', 'Tragiannidis A', 'Athanassiadou F']","['2nd Pediatric Department, AHEPA General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111103,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electroencephalography/drug effects', 'Epilepsy/*chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Levetiracetam', 'Octreotide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Piracetam/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0031-1287827 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2011 Nov;223(6):360-3. doi: 10.1055/s-0031-1287827.

So far the data does not support anti-cancer efficacy of retinoids in the prevention of prostate or pancreatic cancer and may possibly have harmful effects in the pathogenesis of lung cancer in smokers.

It has revolutionized the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is also FDA-approved for KIT-positive advanced gastrointestinal tumor (GIST) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. A wide spectrum of dermatologic toxicities has been associated with this agent, among which a maculopapular rash is the most common event. In addition, a variety of pigmentary abnormalities of the skin and mucosal surfaces have been reported. Hypopigmentation is a well-recognized adverse effect. In contrast, paradoxical hyperpigmentation has only rarely been documented.

Participants were children enrolled to the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 2891 with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. In phase 1 (induction) patients were randomized to 4 cycles of chemotherapy either administered as intensive or standard timing. In phase 2 (intensification), those achieving remission were allocated to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) if a suitable family donor was available while the remainder were randomized to autologous SCT or chemotherapy. Each infection was classified prospectively as nonlife-threatening, life-threatening, or fatal. The proportion of all infections that were considered life-threatening or fatal was higher with intensive timing compared with standard timing induction (60.3% vs. 37.3%, P<0.0001). Infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were significantly more likely to be severe during intensive compared with standard timing induction. Most molds were life-threatening or fatal. Chemotherapy intensification was not associated with less severe infections compared with SCT. Intensive timing was associated with more severe infections compared with standard timing induction.

The demographic characteristics, data about deferasirox treatment, and history of phlebotomy were obtained from the patients' files. The reduction in posttreatment ferritin levels was found statistically significant compared with pretreatment ferritin levels in both def+phlebotomy and def+nonphlebotomy groups (p = 0.025 and 0.017, respectively). The liver enzymes, especially ALT and bilirubins, were significantly reduced after the treatment (p < 0.05).

In the human postnatal thymus (PNT), DN, DP and single-positive (SP) TCRgammadelta(+) populations are present. Here, the precursor-progeny relationship of the various PNT TCRgammadelta(+) populations was studied and the role of the DP TCRgammadelta(+) population during T-cell differentiation was elucidated. We demonstrate that human TCRgammadelta(+) cells differentiate along two pathways downstream from an immature CD1(+) DN TCRgammadelta(+) precursor: a Notch-independent DN pathway generating mature DN and CD8alphaalpha SP TCRgammadelta(+) cells, and a Notch-dependent, highly proliferative DP pathway generating immature CD4 SP and subsequently DP TCRgammadelta(+) populations. DP TCRgammadelta(+) cells are actively rearranging the TCRalpha locus, and differentiate to TCR(-) DP cells, to CD8alphabeta SP TCRgammadelta(+) cells and to TCRalphabeta(+) cells. Finally, we show that the gammadelta subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) consists mainly of CD4 SP or DP phenotypes carrying significantly more activating Notch mutations than DN T-ALL. The latter suggests that activating Notch mutations in TCRgammadelta(+) thymocytes induce proliferation and differentiation along the DP pathway in vivo.","['Van Coppernolle, S', 'Vanhee, S', 'Verstichel, G', 'Snauwaert, S', 'van der Spek, A', 'Velghe, I', 'Sinnesael, M', 'Heemskerk, M H', 'Taghon, T', 'Leclercq, G', 'Plum, J', 'Langerak, A W', 'Kerre, T', 'Vandekerckhove, B']","['Van Coppernolle S', 'Vanhee S', 'Verstichel G', 'Snauwaert S', 'van der Spek A', 'Velghe I', 'Sinnesael M', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Taghon T', 'Leclercq G', 'Plum J', 'Langerak AW', 'Kerre T', 'Vandekerckhove B']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'Receptors, Notch/*physiology', 'Thymocytes/cytology/*immunology']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011324 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.324 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jan;26(1):127-38. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.324.

Here, we assessed the potential association between the immunophenotype of MC and multilineage KIT mutation in the BM of SM patients through the investigation of the flow cytometric protein expression profile (PEP) of bone marrow mast cells (BMMC) from 70 control individuals and 206 SM patients, classified according to the WHO (World Health Organization), and the degree of involvement of BM hematopoiesis by the D816V KIT mutation; additionally, we developed a score-based class prediction algorithm for the detection of SM cases with multilineage mutation. Our results show that aberrant expression of CD25 with a FcvarepsilonRI(lo), FSC(lo), SSC(lo) and CD45(lo) immature phenotype of BMMC, in the absence of coexisting normal MC in the BM, was associated with multilineage involvement by the D816V KIT mutation, regardless of the diagnostic subtype of the disease (for example, indolent vs aggressive SM), which supports the utility of the immunophenotype of BMMC as a surrogate marker to screen for multilineage KIT mutation in ISM.","['Teodosio, C', 'Garcia-Montero, A C', 'Jara-Acevedo, M', 'Alvarez-Twose, I', 'Sanchez-Munoz, L', 'Almeida, J', 'Morgado, J M', 'Matito, A', 'Escribano, L', 'Orfao, A']","['Teodosio C', 'Garcia-Montero AC', 'Jara-Acevedo M', 'Alvarez-Twose I', 'Sanchez-Munoz L', 'Almeida J', 'Morgado JM', 'Matito A', 'Escribano L', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio General de Citometria, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/genetics/*immunology', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011293 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.293 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):951-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.293.

Therefore, I follow a risk-oriented therapeutic approach to avoid inappropriate exposure to cytotoxic drugs on one side or suboptimal treatment on the other. Established predictors of cardiovascular events are represented by older age and previous thrombosis, whereas recent data suggest a prognostic role for novel risk factors, including leukocytosis and JAK2V617F mutational status. There is no indication for therapeutic intervention in asymptomatic, low-risk patients, while I treat high-risk patients with hydroxyurea (HU) first. Other therapeutic options, such as interferon alpha or anagrelide, may find place in selected patients including those who are resistant or intolerant to HU.

In addition to facilitating nutrient exchange before the establishment of a circulation, the VE is critical for patterning the epiblast. Since VE is derived from the primitive endoderm (PrE) of the blastocyst, and PrE-derived eXtraembryonic ENdoderm (XEN) cells can be propagated in vitro, XEN cells should provide an important tool for identifying factors that direct VE differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that BMP4 signaling induces the formation of a polarized epithelium in XEN cells. This morphological transition was reversible, and was associated with the acquisition of a molecular signature comparable to extraembryonic (ex) VE. Resembling exVE which will form the endoderm of the visceral yolk sac, BMP4-treated XEN cells regulated hematopoiesis by stimulating the expansion of primitive erythroid progenitors. We also observed that LIF exerted an antagonistic effect on BMP4-induced XEN cell differentiation, thereby impacting the extrinsic conditions used for the isolation and maintenance of XEN cells in an undifferentiated state. Taken together, our data suggest that XEN cells can be differentiated towards an exVE identity upon BMP4 stimulation and therefore represent a valuable tool for investigating PrE lineage differentiation.","['Artus, Jerome', 'Douvaras, Panagiotis', 'Piliszek, Anna', 'Isern, Joan', 'Baron, Margaret H', 'Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina']","['Artus J', 'Douvaras P', 'Piliszek A', 'Isern J', 'Baron MH', 'Hadjantonakis AK']","['Developmental Biology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HD052115-07/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK084391/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL62248/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK52191/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK084391/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL062248/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK084391-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HD052115/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD052115/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052191/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111015,United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Patterning/*drug effects/genetics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/*pharmacology', 'Cell Polarity/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Endoderm/cytology/*drug effects/*embryology', 'Epithelium/drug effects/embryology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Extraembryonic Membranes/*cytology/drug effects/embryology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Viscera/cytology/drug effects/*embryology']",PMC3246571,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0012-1606(11)01321-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.10.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2012 Jan 15;361(2):245-62. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.10.015.

These aberrations may dysregulate gene expressions, which in turn drive the malignancy of tumors. Deciphering the causal and statistical relations of molecular aberrations and gene expressions is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms of clinical phenotypes. RESULTS: In this work, we proposed a computational method to reconstruct association modules containing driver aberrations, passenger mRNA or microRNA expressions, and putative regulators that mediate the effects from drivers to passengers. By applying the module-finding algorithm to the integrated datasets of NCI-60 cancer cell lines, we found that gene expressions were driven by diverse molecular aberrations including chromosomal segments' copy number variations, gene mutations and DNA methylations, microRNA expressions, and the expressions of transcription factors. In-silico validation indicated that passenger genes were enriched with the regulator binding motifs, functional categories or pathways where the drivers were involved, and co-citations with the driver/regulator genes. Moreover, 6 of 11 predicted MYB targets were down-regulated in an MYB-siRNA treated leukemia cell line. In addition, microRNA expressions were driven by distinct mechanisms from mRNA expressions. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide rich mechanistic information regarding molecular aberrations and gene expressions in cancer genomes. This kind of integrative analysis will become an important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the era of personalized medicine.","['Li, Shyh-Dar', 'Tagami, Tatsuaki', 'Ho, Ying-Fu', 'Yeang, Chen-Hsiang']","['Li SD', 'Tagami T', 'Ho YF', 'Yeang CH']","['Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20111104,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Systems Biology/*methods']",PMC3259106,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-0509-5-186 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-0509-5-186 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2011 Nov 4;5:186. doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-5-186.,,,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These functions of miRNAs allow them to control key cellular processes such as development, differentiation and apoptosis, and they have also been implicated in several cancers such as leukaemia, lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer (OC). Unfortunately, the specific machinery of miRNA regulation, involving transcription factors (TFs) and transcription co-factors (TcoFs), is not well understood. In the present study we focus on computationally deciphering the underlying network of miRNAs, their targets, and their control mechanisms that have an influence on OC development. RESULTS: We analysed experimentally verified data from multiple sources that describe miRNA influence on diseases, miRNA targeting of mRNAs, and on protein-protein interactions, and combined this data with ab initio transcription factor binding site predictions within miRNA promoter regions. From these analyses, we derived a network that describes the influence of miRNAs and their regulation in human OC. We developed a methodology to analyse the network in order to find the nodes that have the largest potential of influencing the network's behaviour (network hubs). We further show the potentially most influential miRNAs, TFs and TcoFs, showing subnetworks illustrating the involved mechanisms as well as regulatory miRNA network motifs in OC. We find an enrichment of miRNA targeted OC genes in the highly relevant pathways cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: We combined several sources of interaction and association data to analyse and place miRNAs within regulatory pathways that influence human OC. These results represent the first comprehensive miRNA regulatory network analysis for human OC. This suggests that miRNAs and their regulation may play a major role in OC and that further directed research in this area is of utmost importance to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human cancer development and OC in particular.","['Schmeier, Sebastian', 'Schaefer, Ulf', 'Essack, Magbubah', 'Bajic, Vladimir B']","['Schmeier S', 'Schaefer U', 'Essack M', 'Bajic VB']","['Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC), 4700 King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111103,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/physiology']",PMC3219655,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/05/19 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-0509-5-183 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-0509-5-183 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2011 Nov 3;5:183. doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-5-183.,,,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to identify the immunophenotypic features that may predict FLT3 mutations. We report 3 (43%) of 7 CD117(+) T-LL cases harboring FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutation. Compared with 4 FLT3-unmutated cases, all 3 FLT3-mutated cases had a distinct immunophenotype (CD1a(-)/CD2(+)/CD7(+)/CD34(+)/CD117(uniform+)/Tdt(+)) corresponding to the stage of earliest thymic T-cell progenitors possessing myeloid lineage potential. Indeed, all FLT3-mutated T-LL cases expressed myeloperoxidase on a very small subset of blasts and, thus, may be further considered a mixed phenotype acute leukemia, T/myeloid, by the 2008 World Health Organization classification scheme. We conclude that this unique immunophenotype (CD1a(-)/CD2(+)/CD7(+)/CD34(+)/CD117(+)/Tdt(+)) is a better predictor of FLT3 mutation than sole CD117 expression.","['Zaremba, Charles M', 'Oliver, Dwight', 'Cavalier, Maryellen', 'Fuda, Franklin', 'Karandikar, Nitin J', 'Chen, Weina']","['Zaremba CM', 'Oliver D', 'Cavalier M', 'Fuda F', 'Karandikar NJ', 'Chen W']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, 75235, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111103,United States,Ann Diagn Pathol,Annals of diagnostic pathology,9800503,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/05/11 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1092-9134(11)00111-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2011.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Diagn Pathol. 2012 Jan;16(1):16-20. doi: 10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2011.07.005.

Unfortunately haemorrhage remains a major cause of early death, preventing some from reaching treatment. The coagulopathy is caused directly or indirectly by the leukaemic cells through expression of activators of coagulation and fibrinolysis, proteases and cytokine generation, compounded by failure of platelet production due to marrow invasion. At presentation the predominant feature is usually hyperfibrinolysis. Since the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), patient outcome has dramatically improved; yet, haemorrhagic complications remain the most frequent cause of mortality. Thrombotic complications occur but are less well recognized and potentially underreported. Supportive measures and prompt initiation of ATRA currently represent the mainstay of treatment of the coagulopathy in patients with suspected APML, but unanswered questions remain as to the optimal approach to further decrease the associated haemorrhagic and thrombotic risks. In particular, it is unclear how to best predict and monitor the coagulopathy; whether there is a role for the early use of antifibrinolytics; the most appropriate trigger for giving fibrinogen replacement and the value of low-dose anticoagulation to suppress coagulation activation once fibrinolysis has been suppressed.","['Breen, Karen A', 'Grimwade, David', 'Hunt, Beverley J']","['Breen KA', 'Grimwade D', 'Hunt BJ']","[""Department of Thrombosis and Vascular Biology, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['MR/J006742/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111103,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Blood Coagulation Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08922.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Jan;156(1):24-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08922.x.

STUDY DESIGN: Patients with syndromic SCN were characterized for associated malformations and referred to us for G6PC3 mutational analysis. RESULTS: In a cohort of 31 patients with syndromic SCN, we identified 16 patients with G6PC3 deficiency including 11 patients with novel biallelic mutations. We show that nonhematologic features of G6PC3 deficiency are good predictive indicators for mutations in G6PC3. Additionally, we demonstrate genetic variability in this disease and define novel features such as growth hormone deficiency, genital malformations, disrupted bone remodeling, and abnormalities of the integument. G6PC3 mutations may be associated with hydronephrosis or facial dysmorphism. The risk of transition to myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia may be lower than in other genetically defined SCN subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypic and molecular spectrum in G6PC3 deficiency is wider than previously appreciated. The risk of transition to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia may be lower in G6PC3 deficiency compared with other subgroups of SCN.","['Boztug, Kaan', 'Rosenberg, Philip S', 'Dorda, Marie', 'Banka, Siddharth', 'Moulton, Thomas', 'Curtin, Julie', 'Rezaei, Nima', 'Corns, John', 'Innis, Jeffrey W', 'Avci, Zekai', 'Tran, Hung Chi', 'Pellier, Isabelle', 'Pierani, Paolo', 'Fruge, Rachel', 'Parvaneh, Nima', 'Mamishi, Setareh', 'Mody, Rajen', 'Darbyshire, Phil', 'Motwani, Jayashree', 'Murray, Jennie', 'Buchanan, George R', 'Newman, William G', 'Alter, Blanche P', 'Boxer, Laurence A', 'Donadieu, Jean', 'Welte, Karl', 'Klein, Christoph']","['Boztug K', 'Rosenberg PS', 'Dorda M', 'Banka S', 'Moulton T', 'Curtin J', 'Rezaei N', 'Corns J', 'Innis JW', 'Avci Z', 'Tran HC', 'Pellier I', 'Pierani P', 'Fruge R', 'Parvaneh N', 'Mamishi S', 'Mody R', 'Darbyshire P', 'Motwani J', 'Murray J', 'Buchanan GR', 'Newman WG', 'Alter BP', 'Boxer LA', 'Donadieu J', 'Welte K', 'Klein C']","['Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (CeMM), Vienna, Austria. kboztug@cemm.oeaw.ac.at']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111101,United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Glucose-6-Phosphatase/*genetics', 'Glycogen Storage Disease Type I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/genetics', 'Phenotype']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-3476(11)00933-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.09.019 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 2012 Apr;160(4):679-683.e2. doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.09.019.

We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to study 39 haematological malignancies with translocations involving PRDM16 to assess the precise breakpoint on 1p36 and the identity of the partner locus. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in selected cases in order to confirm the partner locus. PRDM16 expression studies were performed on bone marrow samples of patients, normal controls and CD34(+) cells using TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR. PRDM16 was rearranged with the RPN1 (3q21) locus in 30 cases and with other loci in nine cases. The diagnosis was AML or MDS in most cases, except for two cases of lymphoid proliferation. We identified novel translocation partners of PRDM16, including the transcription factors ETV6 and IKZF1. Translocations involving PRDM16 lead to its overexpression irrespective of the consequence of the rearrangement (fusion gene or promoter swap).

However, nontargeted effects, in which DNA damage is produced in nonirradiated cells as a consequence of cell signaling processes, indicate additional mechanisms. Radiation-induced chromosomal instability, a nontargeted effect with the potential to produce pathological consequences, is characterized by an increased rate of chromosome aberrations many generations after the initial insult. In this study, using a mouse model that has been well characterized with respect to its susceptibility to both radiation-induced chromosomal instability and acute myeloid leukemia, we investigated whether the underlying signaling mechanism was an inflammatory process by studying the effects of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Treated mice showed significant reduction in expression of the chromosomal instability phenotype 100 days postirradiation associated with reduced expression of inflammatory markers. The data support the hypothesis that the radiation-induced chromosomal instability phenotype is not an intrinsic property of the cells but a consequence of inflammatory processes having the potential to contribute secondary damage expressed as nontargeted and delayed radiation effects.","['Mukherjee, Debayan', 'Coates, Philip J', 'Lorimore, Sally A', 'Wright, Eric G']","['Mukherjee D', 'Coates PJ', 'Lorimore SA', 'Wright EG']","['University of Dundee, Centre for Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Division of Medical Science, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom DD1 9SY.']",['eng'],['RRX 109/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111103,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Celecoxib', 'Chromosomal Instability/drug effects/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/03/08 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1667/RR2793.1 [pii]', '10.1667/rr2793.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2012 Jan;177(1):18-24. doi: 10.1667/rr2793.1.

Although immunohistochemistry can aid in its diagnosis, specific markers have not been clearly identified. We evaluated the utility of immunohistochemical markers in 57 cutaneous myeloid sarcoma cases. In addition to classical markers (CD117, CD163, CD34, myeloperoxidase and lysozyme), we used CD33 and CD14, recently described markers in paraffin-embedded tissue samples, and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF-4), a novel monocytic marker. Our results show that lysozyme was expressed in 91%, CD33 in 60%, myeloperoxidase in 54%, CD34 in 39% and CD117 in 36% of cases. An antibody panel that included lysozyme, CD117 and CD33 identified all cases. The monocytic markers CD14, KLF-4 and CD163 were expressed in 60, 58 and 40% of all cases, respectively. CD14 and KLF-4 expression was significantly more common in cases with monocytic differentiation. CD14 is the single most sensitive and specific marker for monocytic differentiation (79 and 80%). Although KLF-4 in isolation is relatively insensitive (50 and 87%), it enhances sensitivity in detecting monocytic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma when combined with CD14. Our results indicate that in addition to classical immunohistochemical markers, targeted use of newer antibodies, including CD33, CD14 and KLF-4 is useful in the diagnosis of cutaneous myeloid sarcoma and in the detection of monocytic differentiation.","['Amador-Ortiz, Catalina', 'Hurley, Maria Y', 'Ghahramani, Grant K', 'Frisch, Stephanie', 'Klco, Jeffery M', 'Lind, Anne C', 'Nguyen, Tudung T', 'Hassan, Anjum', 'Kreisel, Friederike H', 'Frater, John L']","['Amador-Ortiz C', 'Hurley MY', 'Ghahramani GK', 'Frisch S', 'Klco JM', 'Lind AC', 'Nguyen TT', 'Hassan A', 'Kreisel FH', 'Frater JL']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0560.2011.01809.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2011 Dec;38(12):945-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.2011.01809.x.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the majority of these data derive from either the use of expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to treat metastatic melanoma or the use of donor lymphocytes in relapsed hematological malignancies following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Genetic engineering of T cells to redirect specificity against tumor-associated antigens potentially overcomes one of the major hurdles to more widespread application. Despite early evidence of possible activity, limited in vivo expansion and persistence of adoptively transferred cells has been associated with disappointing clinical efficacy. A report from Porter and colleagues now demonstrates more fully the potential of such genetic modification in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, illustrating that when delivered in the right setting with appropriate costimulatory signaling, these cells can expand and persist, and in doing so effect quite remarkable anti-tumor activity.","['Peggs, Karl S']",['Peggs KS'],"[""Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, University College London, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK. k.peggs@cancer.ucl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],,"['Comment', 'Journal Article']",,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,,,,2011/11/05 06:00,2011/11/05 06:01,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1586/era.11.159 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2011 Nov;11(11):1667-70. doi: 10.1586/era.11.159.,,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 2011 Aug 25;365(8):725-33.

FLT3 is expressed at high levels in 70-100% of cases of AML and in virtually all cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. FLT3 is regarded as a molecular target in the development of novel therapies for acute leukemia patients. Currently, many small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors have been developed, but clinical trials have resulted in limited antileukemia effects because of off-target toxicities and drug resistance. The development of anti-FLT3 Abs might overcome these difficulties and enhance the antileukemia efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors. In the present study, we demonstrate the isolation of novel human mAbs against FLT3 with antagonistic or agonistic activities. An antagonistic Ab, designated A2, continuously inhibits FLT3 ligand (FL)-induced phosphorylation of FLT3 and MAPK. A2 cooperatively induces apoptosis with daunorubicin, even in the presence of FL. An agonistic Ab, designated 3E6, surprisingly induces the phosphorylation of FLT3 and MAPK, and supports the growth of a factor-dependent cell line independently of FL addition. In addition, A2 showed complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity, but was devoid of Ab-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we evaluated Ab internalization in a cell line. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses revealed that A2 is efficiently internalized. Collectively, these data demonstrate that A2 is a potent human Ab that might be capable of delivering cytotoxic reagents and that has antagonistic effects on FLT3 signaling. In addition, 3E6 might be a potential scaffold for novel dendritic cell-based immunotherapies.","['Yamamoto, Yukiya', 'Tsuzuki, Sachiko', 'Akahori, Yasushi', 'Ukai, Yoshinori', 'Sumitomo, Mariko', 'Murayama, Yuko', 'Yamamoto, Kiyoko', 'Inaguma, Youko', 'Tokuda, Masutaka', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Akatsuka, Yoshiki', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Kurosawa, Yoshikazu']","['Yamamoto Y', 'Tsuzuki S', 'Akahori Y', 'Ukai Y', 'Sumitomo M', 'Murayama Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Inaguma Y', 'Tokuda M', 'Abe A', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Emi N', 'Kurosawa Y']","['Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Fujita Health University, Aichi, Japan. yyukiya@fujita-hu.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111205,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*isolation & purification/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology/*metabolism']",,2011/11/05 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/05 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02141.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Feb;103(2):350-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02141.x.

The etiology of LGL leukemia is unknown. IL-15 is an inflammatory cytokine that stimulates T and natural killer cells and is critical for their survival and proliferation. IL-15 signals through a heterotrimeric receptor that is composed of a private receptor, IL-15Ralpha and IL-2/IL-15Rbeta and gamma(c) shared with IL-2. Using a newly developed assay, we demonstrated increased levels of soluble IL-15Ralpha in the serum of patients with T-LGL leukemia. Furthermore, IL-15Ralpha mRNA levels were also up-regulated in the PBMCs of these patients. FACS analysis indicated that IL-15Ralpha was expressed both on monocytes as well as on some CD8+ leukemic cells of the patients. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of IFN-gamma, a known inducer of IL-15Ralpha, were also up-regulated in patients' PBMCs. Moreover, PBMCs of some T-LGL patients proliferated at higher levels in response to exogenously added IL-15 compared with those of normal donors. In summary, our study demonstrated increased expression of IL-15Ralpha in T-LGL leukemia. It is conceivable that higher IL-15Ralpha expression may lower IL-15 response threshold in vivo and, therefore, may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Chen, Jing', 'Petrus, Mike', 'Bamford, Richard', 'Shih, Joanna H', 'Morris, John C', 'Janik, John E', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Chen J', 'Petrus M', 'Bamford R', 'Shih JH', 'Morris JC', 'Janik JE', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-1374, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111102,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/blood', 'Interleukin-15 Receptor alpha Subunit/*blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3251226,2011/11/04 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/11/04 06:00'],"['2011/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38545-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-346759 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 5;119(1):137-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-346759.

Antigen-specific T cells can be expanded in vitro but have a finite proliferative life span. After a limited period in culture, primary T cells undergo replicative senescence and stop dividing. This restricts their applicability to short-term experiments and complicates their use in adoptive immunotherapy. The proliferative life span of primary human and rhesus macaque T cells can be considerably extended by ectopically expressed human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). Antigen-specific T cells transduced with TERT-expressing retroviral vectors can proliferate and expand in culture for long periods of time while maintaining their primary T cell characteristics, including antigen-specific responses. Thus, TERT-immortalized T cells are an important and valuable resource for studying T cell-mediated immune responses and, potentially, for adoptive immunotherapy.","['Barsov, Eugene V']",['Barsov EV'],"['AIDS and Cancer Virus Program, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., Frederick, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Curr Protoc Immunol,Current protocols in immunology,9101651,IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Macaca mulatta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Telomerase/genetics/*immunology']",PMC3226752,2011/11/04 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/11/04 06:00'],"['2011/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/0471142735.im0721bs95 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Protoc Immunol. 2011 Nov;Chapter 7:Unit 7.21B. doi: 10.1002/0471142735.im0721bs95.,,,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,['NIHMS336482'],,,,,,,,,,

We studied adherence to imatinib therapy among CML patients treated at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital. We identified all CML patients that were alive at the 1st of January 2010 (n = 70). Nineteen patients were excluded due to a history of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and nine were excluded due to treatment with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thirty-eight out of 42 patients (90%) treated with imatinib accepted inclusion in the study. The patients were interviewed in a structured way, and adherence was evaluated in a standardized way using the nine-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale that ranges from 1 to 13. A Morisky score </=10 indicates nonadherence and >/=11 indicates adherence. In addition, predefined follow-up questions were asked to identify factors known to influence adherence to therapy. In contrast to previous studies, our patients showed good adherence to imatinib therapy with a mean Morisky score of 12.3 out of 13 (range, 9-13). The interviews revealed factors known to predict adherence to therapy, namely being well informed and having frequent contact with a single hematologist. Furthermore, the patients had easy access to the treating clinic and felt that they took part in decisions concerning their disease and treatment. We show that adherence to imatinib can be very good in CML patients, and we suggest that simple measures such as increased patient information and continuity of care will increase adherence in patients with CML.","['Jonsson, Sofia', 'Olsson, Bob', 'Soderberg, Jenny', 'Wadenvik, Hans']","['Jonsson S', 'Olsson B', 'Soderberg J', 'Wadenvik H']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, SE-413 45, Gothenburg, Sweden. sofia.jonsson@vgregion.se.', 'Department of Neurochemistry and Psychiatry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Health Solutions AB, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, SE-413 45, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111103,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/11/04 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2011/11/04 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-011-1359-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-011-1359-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 May;91(5):679-685. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1359-0.

Main differential diagnoses are graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and viral infections. In this retrospective analysis, we included 50 patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea in the first year after allo-SCT. One hundred two biopsies obtained by colonoscopy or endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract were analysed by conventional histology for signs of GvHD and by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral DNA of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and other virus of the herpes family. DNA of HHV-6 was detected in 38 of 75 initial samples (51%) and in 19 of 27 follow-up biopsies (70%). In the initial samples (n = 75), HHV-6 DNA was detected in 20/37 (54%) biopsies in the presence of GvHD compared to 18/38 (47%) biopsies without signs of GvHD. At the time of the first endoscopic investigation, most patients received antiviral prophylaxis with aciclovir. None of the follow-up biopsies was HHV-6 DNA negative after antiviral treatment with aciclovir, foscarnet or ganciclovir. By univariate analysis, no risk factor for HHV-6 detection could be demonstrated. In this cohort of patients with severe gastrointestinal complications, there was no significant difference in the overall survival between patients with or without HHV-6 DNA detection in the gastrointestinal tract. In summary, the detection of HHV-6 DNA had no impact on overall survival. Moreover, antiviral therapy against HHV-6 was without effect. Thus, positive PCR results in GI tract samples do not necessarily reflect reactivation of HHV-6. Further studies are needed to define the significance of HHV-6 for GI tract symptoms after allo-SCT.","['Mousset, S', 'Martin, H', 'Berger, A', 'Hess, S', 'Bug, G', 'Kriener, S', 'Engels, K', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Klein, S A']","['Mousset S', 'Martin H', 'Berger A', 'Hess S', 'Bug G', 'Kriener S', 'Engels K', 'Hoelzer D', 'Klein SA']","['Medizinische Klinik II, J.

No difference in cytotoxic activity was observed between scdsFv-HA22-LR and prototype HA22-LR. Next, we attempted to increase the affinity of scdsFv-HA22-LR by using alanine scanning mutagenesis of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) to assess the specific contribution of each CDR residue to the antigen binding. We found that mutation of asparagine 34 in VLCDR1, which is located at the VL/VH interface, to alanine (N34A) caused a substantial increase in affinity and activity. Estimated KD values measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting were lowered by 10-fold: 0.056 nM in the N34A mutant compared to 0.58 nM in wild type (WT). Cell viability assays of CD22-positive B-cell lymphoma and leukemia cell lines showed that the N34A mutant had increased cytotoxicity ranging from ~2 (HAL-1, IC 50(WT): 2.37 +/- 0.62 ng/ml, IC 50(N34A): 1.32 +/- 0.41 ng/ml) to 10 (SUDHL-6, IC 50(WT): 0.47 +/- 0.090 ng/ml, IC 50(N34A): 0.048 +/- 0.018 ng/ml)-fold compared to WT immunotoxin.

Antibody levels after vaccination may be affected by suppression of the immune system due to cancer therapy. Children with cancer have a high risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We aimed to assess the pretreatment immunization status against HBV infection and the rate of continuity of immunization after therapy in children with cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective case review of patients treated from 2004 to 2008. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients treated in the departments of pediatric hematology and oncology and collected data on immunization history and hepatitis B serology. Anti-HBs antibody titers were compared before and after treatment. RESULTS: This study included 159 (99 males, 60 females) children who had a serologic examination. Antineoplastic therapy had been given for acute leukemia (n=66), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=27), Hodgkin lymphoma (n=20), and solid tumors (n=46). Fifty-one patients had not been immunized against HBV prior to the therapy; HBV serology was negative in 49 of these patients and HBsAg was positive in 2 patients. Anti-HBs antibody positivity was present in 99 of 108 patients with an immunization history, whereas no vaccination response was present in 9 patients. The titer of anti-HBs antibody was decreased below the protection level in 33 (33%) patients with positive anti-HBs antibody, whereas the protection level was found to be maintained in 66 (67%) patients. The most significant decrease (63.6%) was observed in leukemia patients. Posttreatment HBsAg and HBV DNA positivity was detected in two of the patients with negative pretreatment serology, whereas no HBV infection developed in the group with positive anti-HBs antibody.

Nanosized Fe(2)O(3) was first immobilized on the surface of a carbon paste electrode (CPE). Then poly-xanthurenic acid (PXa), a new electroactive material, was electrogenerated by using the pulse potentiostatic method on the Fe(2)O(3) substrate to form a unique and uniform nanorhombus structure. Due to the unique binding ability of xanthurenic acid (Xa) with Fe(2)O(3), Xa monomers tended to be adsorbed around nanosized Fe(2)O(3), and the electropolymerization efficiency was greatly improved. Owing to the presence of abundant carboxyl groups, the capture probe was covalently attached on the carboxyl-terminated PXa/Fe(2)O(3) nanorhombus membranes through the free amines of DNA sequences based on the 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydrosulfosuccinimide cross-linking reaction. The covalently immobilized capture probe could selectively hybridize with its target DNA to form double-stranded DNA on the PXa/Fe(2)O(3)/CPE surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was adopted for indicator-free monitoring of the hybridization reaction on the probe-captured electrode. As a result, the efficient probe immobilization platform, coupled with the ultrasensitive indicator-free impedance measurement, gave rise to a detection limit of 2.8 fmol/L and a dynamic range spanning 8 orders of magnitude. The excellent analytical properties of the proposed biosensor developed here holds great promise for ultrasensitive detection of other biorecognition events and diagnosis of diseases in practice.","['Zhang, Wei', 'Yang, Tao', 'Jiao, Kui']","['Zhang W', 'Yang T', 'Jiao K']","['State Key Laboratory Base of Eco-chemical Engineering, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266042, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,England,Biosens Bioelectron,Biosensors & bioelectronics,9001289,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Biosensing Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Conductometry/instrumentation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/instrumentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/*genetics', 'Electroplating/methods', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Ferric Compounds/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', '*Membranes, Artificial', 'Nanotechnology/instrumentation', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*instrumentation', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Xanthurenates/chemistry']",,2011/11/04 06:00,2012/04/27 06:00,['2011/11/04 06:00'],"['2011/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0956-5663(11)00683-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bios.2011.10.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosens Bioelectron. 2012 Jan 15;31(1):182-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bios.2011.10.015.

Some of these compounds (4h-k, 4n, and 5e) have exhibited potent cytotoxicity specifically against human leukemia HL-60 cell lines with IC(50) values in the range of 0.08-0.70 muM. All these compounds were tested for their effects on the cell cycle perturbations and induction of apoptosis. Morphological evidences of apoptosis, including fragmentation of nuclei and inter nucleosomal DNA laddering formation were clearly observed after 24h exposure to compound 4i. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that compound 4i showed drastic cell cycle perturbations due to concentration dependant increase in the sub-G0 region which comprises of both the apoptotic and debris fraction, thus implying the extent of cell death. These compounds trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway that results in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential through activation of multiple caspases followed by activation of caspase-3, and finally cleavage of PARP. Further the mechanism of cell death was analysed by fluorescent microscopic analysis and also by scanning electron microscopy. The cytotoxicity of 4i correlated with induction of apoptosis, caspases activation and DNA damage and thus indicating the apoptotic pathway of anticancer effect of these compounds.","['Kamal, Ahmed', 'Srikanth, Y V V', 'Naseer Ahmed Khan, M', 'Ashraf, Md', 'Kashi Reddy, M', 'Sultana, Farheen', 'Kaur, Tandeep', 'Chashoo, Gousia', 'Suri, Nitasha', 'Sehar, Irum', 'Wani, Zahoor A', 'Saxena, Arpita', 'Sharma, Parduman R', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Mondhe, Dilip M', 'Saxena, Ajit K']","['Kamal A', 'Srikanth YV', 'Naseer Ahmed Khan M', 'Ashraf M', 'Kashi Reddy M', 'Sultana F', 'Kaur T', 'Chashoo G', 'Suri N', 'Sehar I', 'Wani ZA', 'Saxena A', 'Sharma PR', 'Bhushan S', 'Mondhe DM', 'Saxena AK']","['Division of Organic Chemistry, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Tarnaka, Hyderabad 500607, India. ahmedkamal@iict.res.in']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111013,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzothiadiazines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Nicotine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']",,2011/11/04 06:00,2012/05/24 06:00,['2011/11/04 06:00'],"['2011/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(11)00795-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2011.09.060 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2011 Dec 1;19(23):7136-50. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2011.09.060.

We evaluated the relationship between 25(OH)D serum levels and time to first treatment (TFT), a disease-specific end point, in 130 previously untreated Binet stage A chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Measurement of 25(OH)D was performed by means of a direct, competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay using the DiaSorin LIAISON 25(OH)D TOTAL assay (DiaSorin, Inc., Stillwater, Minnesota). Overall, 41 patients (31.5%) had severe vitamin D insufficiency (<10 ng/mL), 66 (50.7%) had mild to moderate insufficiency (10-24 ng/mL), and 23 (17.6%) had 25(OH)D levels within the optimal range (25-80 ng/mL), with no relationship with between the season of sample collection and 25(OH)D level (P=0.188). A patient stratification according to these 3 groups led to significant difference in terms of TFT, with vitamin D insufficient patients having the shortest TFT (P=0.02). With respect to continuous 25(OH)D levels and clinical outcome, TFT was shorter as 25(OH)D decreased until a value of 13.5 ng/mL at which point the association of 25(OH)D and TFT remained constant. As a matter of fact, the 25(OH)D value of 13.5 ng/mL identified two patients subsets with different TFT risk (HR=1.91; 95% CI=1.06-3.44; P=0.03). In multivariate analysis the variable entering the model at a significant level were mutational status of IgVH (P<0.0001), serum thymidine kinase (P=0.02) and absolute lymphocyte count (P=0.03). Thus confirming the Mayo clinic experience, our data provide further evidence that 25(OH)D levels may be an important host factor influencing TFT of Binet stage A patients. Whether normalizing vitamin D levels may delay disease-progression of patients with early disease will require testing in future trials.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Digiesi, Giovanna', 'Antenucci, Anna', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Sperduti, Isabella', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Conti, Laura']","['Molica S', 'Digiesi G', 'Antenucci A', 'Levato L', 'Mirabelli R', 'Molica M', 'Gentile M', 'Giannarelli D', 'Sperduti I', 'Morabito F', 'Conti L']","['Dipartimento di Emato-oncologia, Azienda Ospedaliera di Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111101,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Vitamin D/*blood', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/complications/*epidemiology']",,2011/11/04 06:00,2012/04/12 06:00,['2011/11/04 06:00'],"['2011/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00476-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Apr;36(4):443-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.10.004.

We devised an inducible T-cell safety switch that is based on the fusion of human caspase 9 to a modified human FK-binding protein, allowing conditional dimerization. When exposed to a synthetic dimerizing drug, the inducible caspase 9 (iCasp9) becomes activated and leads to the rapid death of cells expressing this construct. METHODS: We tested the activity of our safety switch by introducing the gene into donor T cells given to enhance immune reconstitution in recipients of haploidentical stem-cell transplants. Patients received AP1903, an otherwise bioinert small-molecule dimerizing drug, if graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed. We measured the effects of AP1903 on GVHD and on the function and persistence of the cells containing the iCasp9 safety switch. RESULTS: Five patients between the ages of 3 and 17 years who had undergone stem-cell transplantation for relapsed acute leukemia were treated with the genetically modified T cells. The cells were detected in peripheral blood from all five patients and increased in number over time, despite their constitutive transgene expression. A single dose of dimerizing drug, given to four patients in whom GVHD developed, eliminated more than 90% of the modified T cells within 30 minutes after administration and ended the GVHD without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The iCasp9 cell-suicide system may increase the safety of cellular therapies and expand their clinical applications.

It is well tolerated with mild adverse effects. Gynecomastia development during the course of treatment has been rarely reported. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients with advanced or recurrent GIST were treated with imatinib mesylate. Among the fifty-seven male patients six developed gynecomastia during the treatment. The lesions were confirmed by sonography. Sex hormone levels were determined in six patients with and without the presence of gynecomastia respectively. The patients with gynecomatia were treated with tamoxifene and the sex hormones were assayed before and after tamoxifene treatment. RESULTS: In patients with gynecomastia the lump underneath the bilateral nipples was 2.5 to 5 centimeters in diameter. Their serum free testosterone levels ranged between 356.61 and 574.60 ng/dl with a mean +/- SD of 408.64 +/- 82.06 ng/dl (95% CI 343.03~474.25 ng/dl), which is within the normal range. The level of serum estradiol was 42.89 +/- 16.54 pg/ml (95% CI 29.66~56.12 pg/ml). Three patients had higher levels (43.79~71.21 pg/ml) and the others' were within normal range of 27.00~34.91 pg/ml. Six patients without the development of gynecomastia had normal free testosterone. One patient died because of large tumor burden. The sex hormones had no significant changes before and after tamoxifene treatment.(P > 0.05) CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone levels were not decreased in the six GIST patients with gynecomastia. Three patients had increased serum estradiol level which suggests that imbalance of sex hormones may be the cause of gynecomastia during treatment with imatinib mesylate.","['Liu, HeLi', 'Liao, GuoQing', 'Yan, ZhongShu']","['Liu H', 'Liao G', 'Yan Z']","['Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111102,England,BMC Gastroenterol,BMC gastroenterology,100968547,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Estrogen Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/blood/*drug therapy', 'Gynecomastia/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Tamoxifen/therapeutic use', 'Testosterone/blood']",PMC3217900,2011/11/04 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/11/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-230X-11-116 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-230X-11-116 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Gastroenterol. 2011 Nov 2;11:116. doi: 10.1186/1471-230X-11-116.,,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, expression of the p53, Human homolog of murine Double Minute 2 (HDM2), p14Alternating Reading Frame (ARF), Zinc Finger and BTB domain containing 7A (ZBTB7A), and B-Cell Lymphoma 6 (BCL6) genes was quantitatively investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and healthy controls. Plasma fibronectin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of the p53, p14, and HDM2 genes were significantly higher in the patients. However, ZBTB7A and BCL6 gene expression was not detectable in both groups. A positive correlation between p14ARF and HDM2 expression and a negative correlation between p53 and p14ARF expression was observed. Expression of the p14ARF and HDM2 genes were inversely correlated in the control group. Neither HDM2 nor p14ARF gene expression was correlated with p53 expression. The p53 gene was also analyzed for the presence of mutations. A splice-site mutation was found in a single patient. Our findings indicate that expression of the p53, p14ARF, and HDM2 genes are associated with CLL.

HDACs are best known for their repressive influence on gene transcription through histone deacetylation. Mapping of nonhistone acetylated proteins and acetylation-modifying enzymes involved in various cellular pathways has shown protein acetylation/deacetylation also plays key roles in a variety of cellular processes including RNA splicing, nuclear transport, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Studies of HDACs have accelerated due to the availability of small molecule HDAC inhibitors, most of which contain a canonical hydroxamic acid or benzamide that chelates the metal catalytic site. To increase the pool of unique and novel HDAC inhibitor pharmacophores, a pharmacological active compound screen was performed. Several unique HDAC inhibitor pharmacophores were identified in vitro. One class of novel HDAC inhibitors, with a central naphthoquinone structure, displayed a selective inhibition profile against HDAC6. Here we present the results of a unique class of HDAC6 inhibitors identified using this compound library screen. In addition, we demonstrated that treatment of human acute myeloid leukemia cell line MV4-11 with the selective HDAC6 inhibitors decreases levels of mutant FLT-3 and constitutively active STAT5 and attenuates Erk phosphorylation, all of which are associated with the inhibitor's selective toxicity against leukemia.","['Inks, Elizabeth S', 'Josey, Benjamin J', 'Jesinkey, Sean R', 'Chou, C James']","['Inks ES', 'Josey BJ', 'Jesinkey SR', 'Chou CJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, United States.']",['eng'],"['UL1 RR029882-04/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000062/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR024485-01A2/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR029882/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR024485/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1RR029882/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111111,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Histone Deacetylase 6', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",PMC3288198,2011/11/04 06:00,2012/06/06 06:00,['2011/11/04 06:00'],"['2011/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb200134p [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2012 Feb 17;7(2):331-9. doi: 10.1021/cb200134p.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: We conducted a prospective study on 30 patients with acute leukemia diagnosed in the interval September 2009 - September 2010 at the Iasi Hemato-Oncology Unit of Saint Mary Hospital for Children. RESULTS: We found t(9:22)p190 in two patients, t(4:11) in two patients and t(12:21) in one patient. From the total of 30 patients, 7 were considered at high-risk, 3 were diagnosed with AML, and 20 were considered at standard-risk.

Importantly, their gain or loss of function often results in malignant development in humans, supporting conserved roles for these transcription factors. B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common cause of pediatric cancer, and it is characterized by unpaired early B cell development resulting from genetic lesions in these critical signaling pathways and transcription factors.

However, the interconnected network of molecules involved in regulating such processes remains elusive. hPaf1/PD2, a subunit of the human PAF-complex, involved in the regulation of transcriptional elongation has oncogenic potential. Our study explores the possibility that regulation of histone methylation by hPaf1 can contribute towards alteration in gene expression by nucleosomal rearrangement. Here, we show that knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 leads to decreased di- and tri-methylation at histone H3 lysine 4 residues in pancreatic cancer cells. Interestingly, hPaf1/PD2 colocalizes with MLL1 (Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1), a histone methyltransferase that methylates H3K4 residues. Also, a reduction in hPaf1 level resulted in reduced MLL1 expression and a corresponding decrease in the level of CHD1 (Chromohelicase DNA-binding protein 1), an ATPase dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme that specifically binds to H3K4 di and trimethyl marks. hPaf1/PD2 was also found to interact and colocalize with CHD1 in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of pancreatic cancer cells. Further, reduced level of CHD1 localization in the nucleus in hPaf1/PD2 Knockdown cells could be rescued by ectopic expression of hPaf1/PD2. Micrococcal nuclease digestion showed an altered chromatin structure in hPaf1/PD2-KD cells. Overall, our results suggest that hPaf1/PD2 in association with MLL1 regulates methylation of H3K4 residues, as well as interacts and regulates nuclear shuttling of chromatin remodeling protein CHD1, facilitating its function in pancreatic cancer cells.","['Dey, Parama', 'Ponnusamy, Moorthy P', 'Deb, Shonali', 'Batra, Surinder K']","['Dey P', 'Ponnusamy MP', 'Deb S', 'Batra SK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['U01 CA111294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA133774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA127297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'BC073541/BC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA127297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA131944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA131944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA111294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111027,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/*metabolism/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3203178,2011/11/03 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/03 06:00'],"['2011/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0026926 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-17484 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26926. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026926.

These structures were readily discerned in paraffin sections of human testis tissue during immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses and thus represented robust morphological markers for our study.

Estimators of the regression parameters in the marginal model are developed under an independence working assumption where the correlation across individuals within a cluster is completely unspecified.

The cytological hallmark of this process is the accumulation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear protein at telomeric DNA to form ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). Here, the de novo formation of a telomeric PML nuclear subcompartment was investigated by recruiting APB protein components. We show that functionally distinct proteins were able to initiate the formation of bona fide APBs with high efficiency in a self-organizing and self-propagating manner. These included: (1) PML and Sp100 as the constituting components of PML nuclear bodies, (2) telomere repeat binding factors 1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2, respectively), (3) the DNA repair protein NBS1 and (4) the SUMO E3 ligase MMS21, as well as the isolated SUMO1 domain, through an interacting domain of another protein factor. By contrast, the repair factors Rad9, Rad17 and Rad51 were less efficient in APB nucleation but were recruited to preassembled APBs. The artificially created APBs induced telomeric extension through a DNA repair mechanism, as inferred from their colocalization with sites of non-replicative DNA synthesis and histone H2A.X phosphorylation, and an increase of the telomere repeat length. These activities were absent after recruitment of the APB factors to a pericentric locus and establish APBs as functional intermediates of the ALT pathway.","['Chung, Inn', 'Leonhardt, Heinrich', 'Rippe, Karsten']","['Chung I', 'Leonhardt H', 'Rippe K']","['German Cancer Research Center & BioQuant, Research Group Genome Organization & Function, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111101,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Intranuclear Space/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/11/03 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/03 06:00'],"['2011/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.084681 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.084681 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2011 Nov 1;124(Pt 21):3603-18. doi: 10.1242/jcs.084681.

There is growing evidence that some solid tumors may also exhibit a differentiation program similar to the normal tissue of origin. Many excellent reviews on the topic of cancer stem cells (CSCs) document the recent explosion of information in the field, particularly highlighting the phenotypic and functional characteristics of these putative cells in vitro. Accordingly, here we only briefly discuss these concepts, and instead primarily examine the potential clinical relevance of CSCs, arguably the major unresolved issue in the field. Although it is generally accepted that CSCs are resistant to chemotherapy in vitro, only recently have data surfaced that suggest a role for these cells in disease relapse. Importantly, cancer cells with a stem cell phenotype have been found to be enriched in minimal residual disease of several malignancies. If the role of CSCs in relapse is confirmed, targeting these cells would hold substantial potential for improving the outcome of cancer patients.","['Ghiaur, Gabriel', 'Gerber, Jonathan', 'Jones, Richard J']","['Ghiaur G', 'Gerber J', 'Jones RJ']","['Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 HL007525/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA70790-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA15396-26/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32HL007525-27/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA015396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*etiology', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/classification/cytology/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC4685474,2011/11/03 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/11/03 06:00'],"['2011/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.769 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Jan;30(1):89-93. doi: 10.1002/stem.769.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],,,['NIHMS739576'],,,,,,,,,,

Adequately powered clinical phase III trials are essential to estimate the true therapeutic impact of these expensive compounds, with appropriate selection of clinically relevant endpoints and sufficient follow-up.

In mammals the ORC remains bound except during mitosis, thus the localization of ORC complexes allows localization of origins. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes human ORC1 was used to localize ORC complexes in populations of human MOLT-4 cells separated by cell cycle position using centrifugal elutriation. ORC1 staining in cells in early G1 is diffuse and primarily peripheral. As the cells traverse G1, ORC1 accumulates and becomes more localized towards the center of the nucleus, however around the G1/S boundary the staining pattern changes and ORC1 appears peripheral. By mid to late S phase ORC1 immunofluorescence is again concentrated at the nuclear center. During anaphase, ORC1 staining is localized mainly in the pericentriolar regions. These findings suggest that concerted movements of origin DNA sequences in addition to the previously documented assembly and disassembly of protein complexes are an important aspect of replication initiation loci in eukaryotes.","['Coffman, Frederick D', 'Reyes, Mai-Ling', 'Brown, Monique', 'Lambert, W Clark', 'Cohen, Stanley']","['Coffman FD', 'Reyes ML', 'Brown M', 'Lambert WC', 'Cohen S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ - New Jersey Medical School, Newark, USA. coffmafd@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Anal Cell Pathol (Amst),Analytical cellular pathology (Amsterdam),101541993,IM,"['*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Centrifugation', 'Centrioles/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'G1 Phase', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Origin Recognition Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'S Phase']",PMC4605756,2011/11/03 06:00,2012/08/09 06:00,['2011/11/03 06:00'],"['2011/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['C1605405X2W82U76 [pii]', '10.3233/ACP-2011-0041 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Cell Pathol (Amst). 2011;34(6):355-61. doi: 10.3233/ACP-2011-0041.,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (ORC1 protein, human)', '0 (Origin Recognition Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The approach was based on molecular hybridization of a thioxanthone scaffold, present in known antitumor drugs, and an amine, described as an important pharmacophoric feature for P-gp inhibition. A rational approach using homology modeling and docking was used, to select the molecules to be synthesized by conventional or microwave-assisted Ullmann C-N cross-coupling reaction. The obtained aminated thioxanthones were highly effective at inhibiting P-gp and/or causing growth inhibition in a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562. Six of the aminated thioxanthones had GI(50) values in the K562 cell line below 10 muM and 1-{[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]amino}-4-propoxy-9H-thioxanthen-9-one (37) had a GI(50) concentration (1.90 muM) 6-fold lower than doxorubicin (11.89 muM) in the K562Dox cell line. The best P-gp inhibitor found was 1-[2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)ethanamine]-4-propoxy-9H-thioxanthen-9-one (45), which caused an accumulation rate of rhodamine-123 similar to that caused by verapamil in the K562Dox resistant cell line, and a decrease in ATP consumption by P-gp. At a concentration of 10 muM, compound 45 caused a decrease of 12.5-fold in the GI(50) value of doxorubicin in the K562Dox cell line, being 2-fold more potent than verapamil. From the overall results, the aminated thioxanthones represent a new class of P-gp inhibitors with improved efficacy in sensitizing a resistant P-gp overexpressing cell line (K562Dox) to doxorubicin.","['Palmeira, Andreia', 'Vasconcelos, M Helena', 'Paiva, Ana', 'Fernandes, Miguel X', 'Pinto, Madalena', 'Sousa, Emilia']","['Palmeira A', 'Vasconcelos MH', 'Paiva A', 'Fernandes MX', 'Pinto M', 'Sousa E']","['Departamento de Quimica, Laboratorio de Quimica Organica e Farmaceutica, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade do Porto, Portugal. apalmeira@ff.up.pt']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111022,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Discovery/*trends', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Thioxanthenes/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Xanthones/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",,2011/11/03 06:00,2012/01/21 06:00,['2011/11/03 06:00'],"['2011/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00752-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Jan 1;83(1):57-68. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.10.004.

Nonetheless, apart from allogeneic stem cell transplantation, no curative treatment is available. One possible explanation for the lack of cure in CLL could be a defective immune anti-tumour response. As the result of abnormal HLA class I molecule expression, CLL cells escape from specific T-lymphocyte immunity but should be the target for the innate natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immune response. Defective NK cytotoxicity as the result of decreased expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKp30/NCR3, NKp44/NCR2 and NKp46/NCR1 has been described in haematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukaemia. This prompted us to focus our attention on NCR expression on NK cells from patients with CLL. Although we failed to detect any difference between CLL patients and healthy age-matched controls, a precise analysis of clinical data showed a correlation between decreased NCR expression and poor prognosis factors such as low haemoglobin level, high (>30x10(9) per litre) lymphocyte count or elevated C-reactive protein. Together, these observations support the rationale for restoration of normal NK cell functions in patients with CLL, putatively through the use of immune therapy protocols that already have demonstrated some benefit in acute myeloid leukaemia such as interleukin-2 plus histamine dihydrochloride.","['Costello, Regis T', 'Knoblauch, Benjamin', 'Sanchez, Carole', 'Mercier, Delphine', 'Le Treut, Therese', 'Sebahoun, Gerard']","['Costello RT', 'Knoblauch B', 'Sanchez C', 'Mercier D', 'Le Treut T', 'Sebahoun G']","[""APHM, Hopital Nord, Laboratoire d'Hematologie Aix-Marseille Universite, TAGC/unite INSERM U928 APHM, Hopital La Conception, Service d'Hematologie, Marseille, France. costello@free.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell/*biosynthesis/immunology']",PMC3277717,2011/11/03 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/11/03 06:00'],"['2011/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2567.2011.03521.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 2012 Feb;135(2):151-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2011.03521.x.,,,"['0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",,['(c) 2011 The Authors.

It was confirmed that expression of the ABCB5 gene is highly increased in B-precursor ALL and French-American-British (FAB) M1 and M2 types of AML and lymphoma. The ABCB5 gene is expressed more highly in patients with relapsed or refractory disease than in patients with drug sensitive acute leukemia. Furthermore, there was an evident positive correlation between ABCB5 mRNA expression and MDR1 mRNA expression, but no correlation with MRP mRNA expression or BCRP mRNA expression. Quantification of the ABCB5 gene by real-time PCR offers particular promise as a prognostic marker and a marker for drug resistance in acute leukemia.

We focused upon the indolocarbazole class of chemical inhibitors, which includes S27888, an inhibitor we previously identified. We used biochemical and cell-based assays to identify small molecule inhibitors of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), a serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated when cancer cells are treated with genotoxic agents. These compounds show a promising inhibitory profile on Chk1. Furthermore, these compounds are active against FLT3, which is a tyrosine kinase that is frequently activated in human leukaemias. These data suggest that this chemical class may provide a source of therapeutic compounds for a broad range of human cancers.","['Perron-Sierra, Francoise M', 'Kucharkzyk, Nathalie', 'Boucley, Celine', 'Guyard-Daumas, Christel', 'Sciberras, Sophie', 'Fouache, Christine', 'Plantier, Sabine', 'Studeny, Aurelie', 'Bossard, Celine', 'Casara, Patrick J', 'Golsteyn, Roy M']","['Perron-Sierra FM', 'Kucharkzyk N', 'Boucley C', 'Guyard-Daumas C', 'Sciberras S', 'Fouache C', 'Plantier S', 'Studeny A', 'Bossard C', 'Casara PJ', 'Golsteyn RM']","['Institut de Recherches Servier, Medicinal Chemistry, Surenses, France. francoise.perronsierra@fr.netgrs.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,"['Carbazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', '*DNA Damage/drug effects', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyran Copolymer/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2011/11/03 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2011/11/03 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/ACAMC/E-Pub/00259 [pii]', '10.2174/187152012800228823 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2012 Mar;12(3):194-201. doi: 10.2174/187152012800228823.,,,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '27100-68-1 (Pyran Copolymer)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival in aggressive subtypes remains poor, and treatment resistance is frequent. Use of zidovudine (ZDV) and interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) has been associated with improved response rates in small studies and prolonged overall survival in leukemic ATLL subtypes in a recent meta-analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment, and outcome of 73 patients with aggressive ATLL (acute ATLL, 29; lymphoma ATLL, 44) diagnosed and treated in England between 1999 and 2009. The impact of ZDV/IFN-alpha on treatment response and survival was assessed. RESULTS: The overall response rate ranged from 49% with chemotherapy alone to 81% with combined first-line therapy (chemotherapy with concurrent/sequential ZDV/IFN-alpha). Median overall survival (OS) was 9 months: 7.5 months for acute ATLL and 10 months for lymphoma ATLL. Use of ZDV/IFN-alpha at any time prolonged survival in acute (P < .001) and lymphoma ATLL (P < .001) and was the sole factor associated with reduction in risk of death in aggressive ATLL (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.60; P = .002). Combined first-line therapy prolonged median OS in acute (P = .0081) and lymphoma ATLL (P = .001) compared with chemotherapy alone. CONCLUSION: These data support the use of low-dose ZDV/IFN-alpha with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of acute and lymphoma ATLL.","['Hodson, Andrew', 'Crichton, Siobhan', 'Montoto, Silvia', 'Mir, Naheed', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Cwynarski, Kate', 'Kumaran, Thurai', 'Ardeshna, Kirit M', 'Pagliuca, Antonio', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Fields, Paul A']","['Hodson A', 'Crichton S', 'Montoto S', 'Mir N', 'Matutes E', 'Cwynarski K', 'Kumaran T', 'Ardeshna KM', 'Pagliuca A', 'Taylor GP', 'Fields PA']","[""National Centre for Human Retrovirology, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111031,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.35.5578 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.35.5578 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Dec 10;29(35):4696-701. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.5578.

Further, changes in materials used in the construction of buildings, furnishings, and tools either leak or encourage the production of VOCs. Whether these enclosed areas are residences, hospitals or workplaces (specifically composting facilities or closed farm buildings for raising livestock), VOCs can rise to levels that threaten people's health. VOCs can either originate from phenolic and benzene-like compounds in building materials and office furniture or from molds (fungi) growing inside improperly ventilated or sealed buildings. Regardless of the source, exposure to VOCs could lead to significant health concerns from sick-building syndrome, 'leukemia houses,' in-hospital fungemia cases or occupation-associated cancer epidemics due to aflatoxicosis. Innovative 21st-century building materials could offer solutions to these challenges. We propose that volcanic materials, clays and minerals (volcanic tuff, modified clay montmorillonite and mineral clinoptilolite), in their original or chemically modified form, could act like synthetic lungs in building walls, breathing and filtering VOCs, and thus limiting human exposure to disease.","['Gedikoglu, Yaman', 'Gedikoglu, Gunduz', 'Berkin, Genco', 'Ceyhan, Taskin', 'Altinoz, Meric A']","['Gedikoglu Y', 'Gedikoglu G', 'Berkin G', 'Ceyhan T', 'Altinoz MA']","['Halic University, Department of Sports Education, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111031,England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,IM,"['Air Pollution, Indoor/*prevention & control', 'Anti-Infective Agents/chemistry', 'Bentonite/chemistry', '*Construction Materials', 'Ventilation/methods', 'Volatile Organic Compounds/*chemistry', '*Volcanic Eruptions', 'Zeolites/chemistry']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2013/02/22 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0748233711422727 [pii]', '10.1177/0748233711422727 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 2012 Sep;28(8):708-19. doi: 10.1177/0748233711422727.

The use of an RD/1AG-MM-GVH donor was significantly associated with a higher overall mortality rate than the use of an 8/8-MUD in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.49; P < .001), and this impact was statistically significant only in patients with standard-risk diseases (P = .001). Among patients with standard-risk diseases who received transplantation from an RD/1AG-MM-GVH donor, the presence of an HLA-B Ag mismatch was significantly associated with a lower overall survival rate than an HLA-DR Ag mismatch because of an increased risk of treatment-related mortality. The HLA-C Ag mismatch or multiple allelic mismatches were frequently observed in the HLA-B Ag-mismatched group, and were possibly associated with the poor outcome. In conclusion, an 8/8-MUD should be prioritized over an RD/1AG-MM-GVH donor during donor selection. In particular, an HLA-B Ag mismatch in the GVH direction has an adverse effect on overall survival and treatment-related mortality in patients with standard-risk diseases.","['Kanda, Junya', 'Saji, Hiroh', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Kobayashi, Takeshi', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Iwato, Koji', 'Yoshida, Takashi', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Kawa, Keisei', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu']","['Kanda J', 'Saji H', 'Fukuda T', 'Kobayashi T', 'Miyamura K', 'Eto T', 'Kurokawa M', 'Kanamori H', 'Mori T', 'Hidaka M', 'Iwato K', 'Yoshida T', 'Sakamaki H', 'Tanaka J', 'Kawa K', 'Morishima Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kanda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111031,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-C Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', '*Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45989-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-372573 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Mar 8;119(10):2409-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-372573.

Data on antifungal prophylaxis (AFP) in children are limited by retrospective design, small sample size, and variability of chemotherapy phases having different risk of IFI. There are no data comparing voriconazole versus amphotericin B (AmB) as AFP in either adult/pediatric AL. The objectives of this study were to compare efficacy and toxicity of AmB and voriconazole as AFP in pediatric AL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a pilot study, total 100 children (</=15 y) with denovo acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia were randomized to either oral voriconazole or low dose intravenous AmB as AFP during induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Failure of prophylaxis occurred in 14/50 patients in voriconazole arm (1 proven mucormycosis, 1 possible IFI, 11 empirical antifungal therapy, and 1 withdrawal owing to hepatotoxicity) and 17/50 patients in AmB arm (3 possible IFI, 13 empirical antifungal therapy, and 1 withdrawal owing to difficult venous access) (P=0.66). Of the 29 patients who had failure of prophylaxis unrelated to drug toxicity, computed tomography of the chest showed infiltrates in 10 patients with 3/12 in voriconazole arm and 7/16 in AmB arm (P=0.43). Drug-related serious adverse events were 6% versus 30% in voriconazole and AmB arms, respectively (P<0.01). Further, total number of toxicities per patient in AmB arm were significantly higher as compared with voriconazole arm (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: This is the first randomized study comparing voriconazole with AmB in pediatric AL patients as AFP during induction chemotherapy; our results showed that oral voriconazole seems to be comparable with AmB with less toxicity and more convenience.

To develop variants of the enzyme with reduced Glutaminase activity, in silico mutagenesis was done by replacing amino acids in the vicinity of the ligand binding site. It was identified that replacement of enzyme's active site amino acid Asp96 with Alanine decreased the Glutaminase activity by 30% and also increased the Asparaginase activity by 40%. Docking studies were carried out by Autodock 4.0 and binding energy for native enzyme when docked with glutamine was found to be -8.08 Kcal/mole, whereas for mutated protein it was found to be -5.97 Kcal/mole. It was also observed that replacement of active site with amino acids other than alanine did not show considerable change in both Asparaginase and Glutaminase activities. The designed enzyme model with reduced Glutaminase side activity may help to develop a variant of enzyme drug through protein engineering by site-directed mutagenesis and thus to produce a drug with reduced side effect for treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children.","['Ln, Ramya', 'Doble, Mukesh', 'Rekha, V P B', 'Pulicherla, K K']","['Ln R', 'Doble M', 'Rekha VP', 'Pulicherla KK']","['Department of Biotechnology, Acharya Nagarjuna University, Nagarjuna Nagar.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Asparaginase/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Asparagine/chemistry', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Child', '*Computer Simulation', '*Drug Design', 'Glutaminase/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Glutamine/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Engineering/*methods']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31822aa4ec [doi]', '00043426-201112000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Dec;33(8):617-21. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31822aa4ec.,,,"['0 (Ligands)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome this problem, native Escherichia coli L-asparaginase was conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) to formulate PEG-L-asparaginase, a preparation with decreased immunogenicity and increased circulating half-life. In early trials, PEG-L-asparaginase was tolerated by patients known to be hypersensitive to the native E. coli product. METHODS: The Pediatric Oncology Group conducted a phase II, randomized trial to compare the efficacy and toxicity of PEG-L-asparaginase compared with native E. coli asparaginase in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second bone marrow relapse. All patients (n=76) received standard doses of vincristine and prednisone. Nonhypersensitive patients (n=34) were randomized to receive either PEG-L-asparaginase of 2500 IU/m/dose intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 (treatment I) or native E. coli asparaginase of 10,000 IU/m/dose intramuscularly on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26 (treatment II). Patients with a clinical history of an allergic reaction to unmodified asparaginase were directly assigned to treatment with PEG-L-asparaginase (n=42). Asparaginase levels and anti-asparaginase antibody titers were monitored in all patients. Response and toxicity were scored using conventional criteria. RESULTS: The complete response rate for the total study population was 41%. There was no difference in complete response between patients randomized to PEG (47%) and native asparaginase (41%). PEG was well tolerated even in patients with prior allergic reactions to native asparaginase. PEG half-life was shorter in patients with prior allergy. CONCLUSIONS: PEG asparaginase is a useful agent in patients with allergic reactions to native asparaginase.","['Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Asselin, Barbara', 'Bernstein, Mark', 'Buchanan, George R', 'Pollock, Brad H', 'Camitta, Bruce M']","['Kurtzberg J', 'Asselin B', 'Bernstein M', 'Buchanan GR', 'Pollock BH', 'Camitta BM']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['U10 CA032053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/immunology', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/etiology/immunology', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",PMC3557823,2011/11/02 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31822d4d4e [doi]', '00043426-201112000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Dec;33(8):610-6. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31822d4d4e.,,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,['NIHMS421382'],,,,,,,,,,

MDSC are now also gaining interest in the context of transplantation. Suppressive CD11b(+) myeloid progenitor cells have been reported to expand endogenously during BM chimerism induction in mice; in particular, in irradiated MHC-matched BM chimeras and in parent-in-F1 BM chimeras. Myeloid cell expansion coincided with a time frame where donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) therapy-mediated GVL effects without GVHD. Hypothesizing that regulatory myeloid cells may have a role in regulating post-transplant T-cell alloreactivity, we performed a detailed phenotypic and functional characterization of these cells in the parent-in-F1 C57BL/6 --> [C57BL/6xDBA2] model. We found that transiently expanding CD11b(+) myeloid progenitor cells comprise the two phenotypically and functionally distinct mononuclear and polymorphonuclear MDSC subsets that were recently described in tumor-bearing mice. Both MDSC subsets suppressed in vitro and in vivo alloreactive T-cell proliferation. Also, both the subsets mediated enhanced in vitro suppression when harvested from chimeras, given a prior in vivo challenge with non-tolerant donor T cells, indicating that allo-activated T cells can activate MDSC in vivo. This study provides the basis to investigate the-potentially beneficial-role of expanding MDSC in influencing the risk of GVHD during chimerism induction.","['Luyckx, A', 'Schouppe, E', 'Rutgeerts, O', 'Lenaerts, C', 'Koks, C', 'Fevery, S', 'Devos, T', 'Dierickx, D', 'Waer, M', 'Van Ginderachter, J A', 'Billiau, A D']","['Luyckx A', 'Schouppe E', 'Rutgeerts O', 'Lenaerts C', 'Koks C', 'Fevery S', 'Devos T', 'Dierickx D', 'Waer M', 'Van Ginderachter JA', 'Billiau AD']","['Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111031,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Transplantation Chimera/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2011207 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2011.207 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jul;47(7):985-92. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2011.207.

A total of 111 parents of patients diagnosed mainly with leukemia completed standardized measures of depression and anxiety symptoms as indicators of psychological distress, 85 at 1 year pre-SCT and 81 at 2 years post SCT. Parents' age and gender, child's age, diagnosis, radiation history, behavior and physical health were examined as potential related factors. Linear mixed models for repeated measures with appropriate covariance structure were used in the analysis. Depression and anxiety scores significantly decreased by 2 years for mothers and fathers. Mothers reported significantly more depression symptoms than did fathers, but reported comparable symptoms of anxiety. Pre-SCT depression and anxiety scores, mother's age (younger), child's behavior problems, radiation history and diagnosis of neuroblastoma predicted maternal distress 2 years post SCT; pre-SCT depression and anxiety scores, father's age (older) and child's diagnosis predicted father's distress. This study highlights differences and similarities in mothers' and fathers' psychological distress and identifies related risk factors.

Clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene was verified by two PCR techniques and direct DNA sequencing, confirming that the cases were neoplastic and therefore classifiable as T-LGL leukaemia. In the allogeneic HSCT cases, T-LGL leukaemia was derived from donor T cells in three patients, as shown by DNA chimerism analysis, and recipient T cells in one patient who had graft failure previously. None of the patients showed cytopenia, autoimmune phenomenon or organ infiltration, which were features typical of de novo T-LGL leukaemia. Six patients had remained asymptomatic with stable large granular lymphocyte counts. One patient died from cerebral relapse of the original lymphoma. T-LGL leukaemias occurring post-HSCT are distinct from de novo T-LGL leukaemia and may have a different pathogenesis and clinical course.

METHODS: BTCC cell line T24 cells were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, adding different doses of YC-1. The protein expression of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1alpha-mediated genes was detected by Western blotting. RT-PCR was used to detect HIF-1alpha mRNA expression. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration activity were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry and transwell migration assay. The cells were pretreated by two ERK/p38 MAPK pathway-specific inhibitors, PD98059 or SB203580, and then incubated with YC-1 treatment under hypoxic condition. HIF-1alpha protein expression was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Hypoxic T24 cells expressed a higher level of HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinases-2, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 protein and HIF-1alpha mRNA compared with normoxic controls, in which the above-mentioned expression was downregulated by YC-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Cell proliferation and migration activity were inhibited while apoptosis was induced by YC-1 under hypoxic condition. Moreover, YC-1-downregulated HIF-1alpha expression was reversed by PD98059 and SB203580, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: YC-1 inhibits HIF-1alpha and HIF-1alpha-mediated gene expression, cell proliferation and migration activity and induces apoptosis in hypoxic BTCC. The ERK/p38 MAPK pathway may be involved in YC-1-mediated inhibition of HIF-1alpha.","['Li, Yangle', 'Zhao, Xiaokun', 'Tang, Huiting', 'Zhong, Zhaohui', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Xu, Ran', 'Li, Songchao', 'Wang, Yi']","['Li Y', 'Zhao X', 'Tang H', 'Zhong Z', 'Zhang L', 'Xu R', 'Li S', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Urology, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111025,Switzerland,Urol Int,Urologia internationalis,0417373,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Indazoles/*pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['000331881 [pii]', '10.1159/000331881 [doi]']",ppublish,Urol Int. 2012;88(1):95-101. doi: 10.1159/000331881.

METHODS: Analysis were carried out based on the records of 1464 patients following allo-HSCT hospitalized in Peking University People's Hospital from January 1996 to April 2009, so as to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of NS. A total of 1464 patients whose survival time was longer than 100 d were enrolled. Eight patients (0.6%) had NS following allo-HSCT. Using the nested case-controlled study, 56 cases who received transplantation within the same period were selected as control group for risk factors analysis. RESULTS: The median time of NS was 488 (54 - 1185) d after allo-HSCT. Lower extremities' edema and heavy proteinuria were present in all the patients. Two patients were accompanied with impaired renal function. Six patients suffered from chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Three patients with NS were accompanied with other symptoms of GVHD. Renal biopsy examination showed typical features of minimal change diseases in 3 patients and membranous nephropathy in 1 patient. All cases achieved complete remission (CR) after taking combined immunosuppressant agents. One patient relapsed soon after all the immunosuppressant agents were stopped. Six patients were still surviving with disease free. One patient died of the relapse of leukemia and another patient died of early discharge from hospital after allo-HSCT. The possible factors correlated with the occurrence of NS were analyzed, and the occurrence of chronic GVHD was identified as an independent factor of NS. CONCLUSIONS: NS should be carefully taken into consideration when edema and proteinuria are present in patients following allo-HSCT. The occurrence of NS is probably related with chronic GVHD.

This review summarizes the latest research results of APL as follows: (1) there probably are two APL stem/progenitor cell populations within APL, and self-renewal and survival of APL stem/progenitor cells highly depend on PML-RARalpha expression, cell cycle inhibitor p21, self-renewal associated molecules and chemokines; and (2) ATRA and ATO eradicate APL stem/progenitor cells mainly by PML-RARalpha degradation, FOXO3A activation and the inhibition of self-renewal-associated signaling pathway of sonic hedgehog.

The complete remission (CR) rate, especially after one course, the overall survival (OS) rate and relapse free survival (RFS) rate were estimated. The outcomes were compared between different prognostic groups according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification, genetics and initial WBC count. Safety was evaluated using standard WHO criteria. The results showed that 26 patients (84%) achieved CR after 1 course of induction. The CR rate for the patients with favorable, intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics was 90%, 88% and 60% respectively. All 7 patients with a high initial WBC count (>/= 100x10(9)/L) obtained CR, while 19 out of 24 without a high initial WBC count obtained CR. With a median follow-up of 15(range 2-56) months, the estimated 3-year OS rate for all patients and the patients with CR was 44% and 52% respectively. The 3-year RFS rate was 51%. The patients receiving induction chemotherapy died of the chemotherapy. Profound myelosuppression was seen in all patients after the HAI induction with the median duration of neutropenia (ANC < 0.2x10(9)/L) of 16 (6 - 24) days.

Univariate analysis showed an influence on achievement of CR1 for age (< 30 years) but not for WBC count and tumor mass. According to WHO (2008) classification of tumors of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, 87 patients with confirmed subtype included 27 cases of Pro-T-ALL (31.0%), 31 cases of Pre-T-ALL (35.6%), 23 cases of cortical-T-ALL (26.4%), 6 cases of medullary-T-ALL (6.9%). CD34 expression in Pro-T-ALL was significantly higher than that of Pre-T-ALL (p = 0.001). After the first chemotherapy, the complete remission rate in Pro-T-ALL was statistically lower than that of Pre-T-ALL. Besides, the complete remission rate of immature T-ALL (including Pro-T-ALL and Pre-T-ALL) was also significantly lower than that in mature T-ALL (including cortical-T-ALL and medullary-T-ALL). Myeloid antigen (CD13, CD33) expression was associated with T-ALL subtype and treatment effect. While 66.7% of CD13(+) patients belonged to Pre-T-ALL, most (60.0%) of CD33(+) patients were classified into Pro-T-ALL; CD13 expression had no effect on CR1 rate whereas CD33(+) patients had worse treatment effect compared with CD33(-) groups (p = 0.001). Notably, the expression of CD117 reached up to 26.7% and the positive cases were primarily distributed in pro-T-TAll and pre-T-ALL. It is found that CD117 expression in CD34(-) group was homogeneous and CD117 expression level was less than 10% in 73.2% patients, but CD117 expression level in CD34(+) group was not homogenous, in which group the CD117 expression levels < 10%, 10% - 20% and > 20% were 44.2%, 17.3% and 38.5% respectively. As compared with CD34(-) group, the proportion of patients with CD117 expression levels < 10%, > 20% in CD34(+) group was higher, and there was significant difference between these 2 group. It is concluded that immunophenotype has great value in T-ALL diagnosis, classification as well as treatment. Flow cytometry provides access to find valuable immunologic markers for T-ALL biological research.","['Yuan, Ting-Ting', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Chang, Yan', 'Hao, Le', 'Wang, Ya-Zhe', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Yuan TT', 'Liu YR', 'Chang Y', 'Hao L', 'Wang YZ', 'Jiang B', 'Huang XJ']","['Institute of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD13 Antigens/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*immunology/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)05-1134-07 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Oct;19(5):1134-40.,,,"['0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of P38 MAPK protein and the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK protein in NB4, MR2 and K562 cells were detected by Western blot. The results showed that pre-incubation with 5 microg/ml WM-15 blocked the enhancement effect of bestatin on differentiation of NB4 cells induced by ATRA. 5 microg/ml CD13 antibody WM-15 partly blocked the inhibition of bestatin on the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK in NB4 cells. 100 microg/ml bestatin inhibited the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK in NB4 cells and MR2 cells in a time-dependent manner. 100 microg/ml bestatin had no effect on the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK in K562 cells with low level of CD13. Bestatin could not restore the sensitivity to ATRA in ATRA-resistant primary APL blasts and MR2 cells. It is concluded that aminopeptidase N/CD13 inhibitor bestatin may enhance the differentiation-inducing activity of ATRA through inhibiting the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK in NB4 cells mediated by the cell surface APN/CD13.","['Qian, Xi-Jun', 'Lin, Mao-Fang']","['Qian XJ', 'Lin MF']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese People Armed Police Force, Anhui Province, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'CD13 Antigens/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leucine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tretinoin', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)05-1125-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Oct;19(5):1125-8.,,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) are often being readmitted. Our study identified the risk factors for 30-day readmission among 618 adult recipients of myeloablative allo-HCT from 1990 to 2009. Two hundred forty-two (39%) of 618 patients (median age = 42 years [range: 18-66]) were readmitted a median of 10 days (range: 1-30) from their hospital discharge. Median duration of readmission was 8 days (range: 0-103). Infections (n = 68), fever with or without identified source of infection (n = 63), gastrointestinal complications (n = 44), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (n = 38), and other reasons (n = 29) accounted for 28%, 26%, 18%, 16%, and 12% of readmissions, respectively. During their index admission, patients who were subsequently readmitted had more documented infections (P < .001), higher hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) (P < .01), total body irridiation (TBI)-based conditioning (P < .001), unrelated donor (P < .001), and peripheral stem cell (P = .014) transplantation.

We compared outcomes among children (<15 years), AYAs (15-40 years) and older adults (>40 years) receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our cohort consisted of 900 children, 2,708 AYA, and 2,728 older adult recipients of HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor (URD) transplantation using myeloablative or reduced-intensity/nonmyeloablative conditioning. Outcomes were assessed over three time periods (1980-1988, 1989-1997, 1998-2005) for siblings and two time periods (1989-1997, 1998-2005) for URD HCT. Analyses were stratified by donor type. Results showed overall survival for AYAs using either siblings or URD improved over time. Although children had better and older adults had worse survival compared with AYAs, improvements in survival for AYAs did not lag behind those for children and older adults. After sibling donor HCT, 5-year adjusted survival for the three time periods was 40%, 48%, and 53% for children, 35%, 41%, and 42% for AYAs, and 22%, 30%, and 34% for older adults. Among URD HCT recipients, 5-year adjusted survival for the two time periods was 38% and 37% for children, 24% and 28% for AYAs, and 19% and 23% for older adults. Improvements in survival occurred because of a reduction in risk of treatment-related mortality. The risk of relapse did not change over time. Improvements in survival among AYAs undergoing allogeneic HCT for AML have paralleled those among children and older adults.","['Majhail, Navneet S', 'Brazauskas, Ruta', 'Hassebroek, Anna', 'Bredeson, Christopher N', 'Hahn, Theresa', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Wood, William A', 'Parsons, Susan K', 'Joffe, Steven', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Hayes-Lattin, Brandon M']","['Majhail NS', 'Brazauskas R', 'Hassebroek A', 'Bredeson CN', 'Hahn T', 'Hale GA', 'Horowitz MM', 'Lazarus HM', 'Maziarz RT', 'Wood WA', 'Parsons SK', 'Joffe S', 'Rizzo JD', 'Lee SJ', 'Hayes-Lattin BM']","['National Marrow Donor Program and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN 55413, USA. nmajhail@nmdp.org']",['eng'],"['5U01HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069294-10/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111029,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Siblings', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3288160,2011/11/02 06:00,2013/05/04 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00456-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jun;18(6):861-73. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.031.

To elucidate the presence of this family on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as well as its relationship with the leukemia-initiating potential, we analyzed the expression pattern of this family members on human ALL progenitor cells, combined with serial xenotransplantation assay. METHODS: Expression analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. We combined the expression pattern of human CD(150), CD(244) and CD(48) with serial xenotransplantation of B-ALL progenitor cells to indicate their relationship. RESULTS: CD(48) and CD(244) were expressed on most B-ALL progenitor cells, the percentage being (93.08 +/- 6.46)% and (63.37 +/- 29.31)%, respectively. Interestingly, the proportion of CD(150)(+) cells declined obviously in engrafted cases ((24.94 +/- 7.32)%) compared with non-engrafted cases ((77.54 +/- 5.93)%, P < 0.01), which indicated that only blast cells with low percentage of CD(150)(+) population were able to reconstitute leukemia into primary, secondary and tertiary NOD/SCID mice. CONCLUSIONS: SLAM family members are present on B-ALL progenitor cells and the leukemia-initiating potential of leukemic blasts is correlated negatively with the proportion of CD(150)(+) cells, the percentage of which can serve as a useful predictor for engraftment success of B-ALL to immune deficient mice.","['Wang, Na', 'Xiao, Fei', 'Liu, Jin-Ping', 'Wang, Di', 'Geng, Zhe', 'Wang, Jin', 'Ma, Shu-Yan', 'Shu, Li-Li', 'Chen, Tai-Ping', 'Zhou, Jian-Feng', 'Huang, Liang']","['Wang N', 'Xiao F', 'Liu JP', 'Wang D', 'Geng Z', 'Wang J', 'Ma SY', 'Shu LL', 'Chen TP', 'Zhou JF', 'Huang L']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'CD48 Antigen', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2011 Oct;124(19):3074-9.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD244 protein, human)', '0 (CD48 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)', '169535-43-7 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to ara-C occurs and impacts negatively on survival. To combat this, an elaidic acid ester of ara-C, called elacytarabine, has been developed. This novel agent is highly efficacious in cells with demonstrable resistance to the parent agent, including in solid tumor xenografts. AREAS COVERED: The mechanisms that account for the increased clinical activity of elacytarabine are discussed, including its ability to bypass the specialized transmembrane nucleoside transport system on which ara-C depends, its prolonged retention within the cell and its alternative effect on the cell cycle. The development and synthesis and pharmacokinetics are outlined, with emphasis on lipid vector technology. Ten clinical trials involving elacytarabine, either as monotherapy or part of a combination regimen, have been carried out in both solid tumor and hematologic malignancies. The efficacy and side effect profile results are summarized. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials in patients with hematological malignancies are reporting very encouraging efficacy results with an acceptable side effect profile. Elacytarabine has the potential to play an important role in the treatment of multiple malignancies in the future and results from an ongoing Phase III clinical trial are eagerly awaited.","['Burke, Aine Carol', 'Giles, Frank James']","['Burke AC', 'Giles FJ']","[""Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, Dublin 24, Ireland. draineburke@gmail.com""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111101,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Discovery', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2011.625009 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2011 Dec;20(12):1707-15. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2011.625009.

Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of diverse alpha/beta-peptide homologues of the Bim BH3 domain in terms of their ability to bind to the BH3-recognition sites on two partner proteins, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. These proteins are members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, and both bind tightly to the Bim BH3 domain itself. All alpha/beta-peptide homologues retain the side-chain sequence of the Bim BH3 domain, but each homologue contains periodic alpha-residue --> beta(3)-residue substitutions. Previous work has shown that the alphaalphabetaalphaalphaalphabeta pattern, which aligns the beta(3)-residues in a 'stripe' along one side of the helix, can support functional alpha-helix mimicry, and the results reported here strengthen this conclusion. The present study provides the first evaluation of functional mimicry by alphaalphabeta and alphaalphaalphabeta patterns, which cause the beta(3)-residues to spiral around the helix periphery. We find that the alphaalphaalphabeta pattern can support effective mimicry of the Bim BH3 domain, as manifested by the crystal structure of an alpha/beta-peptide bound to Bcl-x(L), affinity for a variety of Bcl-2 family proteins, and induction of apoptotic signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblast extracts. The best alphaalphaalphabeta homologue shows substantial protection from proteolytic degradation relative to the Bim BH3 alpha-peptide.","['Boersma, Melissa D', 'Haase, Holly S', 'Peterson-Kaufman, Kimberly J', 'Lee, Erinna F', 'Clarke, Oliver B', 'Colman, Peter M', 'Smith, Brian J', 'Horne, W Seth', 'Fairlie, W Douglas', 'Gellman, Samuel H']","['Boersma MD', 'Haase HS', 'Peterson-Kaufman KJ', 'Lee EF', 'Clarke OB', 'Colman PM', 'Smith BJ', 'Horne WS', 'Fairlie WD', 'Gellman SH']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM-056414/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-05/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008505/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA119875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-13/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-12A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA119875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-15/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-11/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-08/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-11S1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-14/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM061238./GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056414-10/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM008505/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111208,United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3364022,2011/11/02 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja207148m [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2012 Jan 11;134(1):315-23. doi: 10.1021/ja207148m.

Because the mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of PCL are not fully understood, immunophenotyping, genetic evaluation (conventional karyotype, FISH, GEP and array-CGH), and immunohistochemistry are very important tools to investigate why plasma cells escape from bone marrow and become highly aggressive.

A double-blind and placebo-controlled study.,e26358,10.1371/journal.pone.0026358 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disease of unknown aetiology. Major CFS symptom relief during cancer chemotherapy in a patient with synchronous CFS and lymphoma spurred a pilot study of B-lymphocyte depletion using the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, which demonstrated significant clinical response in three CFS patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study (NCT00848692), 30 CFS patients were randomised to either Rituximab 500 mg/m(2) or saline, given twice two weeks apart, with follow-up for 12 months. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) was not detected in any of the patients. The responses generally affected all CFS symptoms. Major or moderate overall response, defined as lasting improvements in self-reported Fatigue score during follow-up, was seen in 10 out of 15 patients (67%) in the Rituximab group and in two out of 15 patients (13%) in the Placebo group (p = 0.003). Mean response duration within the follow-up period for the 10 responders to Rituximab was 25 weeks (range 8-44). Four Rituximab patients had clinical response durations past the study period. General linear models for repeated measures of Fatigue scores during follow-up showed a significant interaction between time and intervention group (p = 0.018 for self-reported, and p = 0.024 for physician-assessed), with differences between the Rituximab and Placebo groups between 6-10 months after intervention. The primary end-point, defined as effect on self-reported Fatigue score 3 months after intervention, was negative. There were no serious adverse events. Two patients in the Rituximab group with pre-existing psoriasis experienced moderate psoriasis worsening. CONCLUSION: The delayed responses starting from 2-7 months after Rituximab treatment, in spite of rapid B-cell depletion, suggests that CFS is an autoimmune disease and may be consistent with the gradual elimination of autoantibodies preceding clinical responses. The present findings will impact future research efforts in CFS.

Adhesion molecules like P-selectin (encoded by the Selp gene) are essential to hematopoiesis, and their dysregulation has been linked to leukemogenesis. Like HSCs, leukemic stem cells (LSCs) depend upon their microenvironments for survival and propagation. P-selectin plays a crucial role in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this paper, we show that cells deficient in P-selectin expression can repopulate the marrow more efficiently than wild type controls. This results from an increase in HSC self-renewal rather than alternative possibilities like increased homing velocity or cell cycle defects. We also show that P-selectin expression on LT-HSCs, but not ST-HSCs and MPPs, increases with aging. In the absence of P-selectin expression, mice at 6 months of age possess increased levels of short-term HSCs and multipotent progenitors. By 11 months of age, there is a shift towards increased levels of long-term HSCs. Recipients of BCR-ABL-transduced bone marrow cells from P-selectin-deficient donors develop a more aggressive CML, with increased percentages of LSCs and progenitors. Taken together, our data reveal that P-selectin expression on HSCs and LSCs has important functional ramifications for both hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, which is most likely attributable to an intrinsic effect on stem cell self-renewal.","['Sullivan, Con', 'Chen, Yaoyu', 'Shan, Yi', 'Hu, Yiguo', 'Peng, Cong', 'Zhang, Haojian', 'Kong, Linghong', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Sullivan C', 'Chen Y', 'Shan Y', 'Hu Y', 'Peng C', 'Zhang H', 'Kong L', 'Li S']","['Maine Institute for Human Genetics and Health, Bangor, Maine, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA122142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA122142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111024,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Cycle', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/surgery', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'P-Selectin/*metabolism']",PMC3200313,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0026246 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-01922 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26246. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026246.

The MYC oncogene, which produces the Myc transcription factor, is frequently altered in human cancer and is a major regulatory hub for many cancers. In this regard, we sought to unravel the primordial signature of Myc function by using high-throughput genomic approaches to identify the cell-type independent core Myc target gene signature. Using a model of human B lymphoma cells bearing inducible MYC, we identified a stringent set of direct Myc target genes via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), global nuclear run-on assay, and changes in mRNA levels. We also identified direct Myc targets in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We further document that a Myc core signature (MCS) set of target genes is shared in mouse and human ESCs as well as in four other human cancer cell types. Remarkably, the expression of the MCS correlates with MYC expression in a cell-type independent manner across 8,129 microarray samples, which include 312 cell and tissue types. Furthermore, the expression of the MCS is elevated in vivo in Emu-Myc transgenic murine lymphoma cells as compared with premalignant or normal B lymphocytes. Expression of the MCS in human B cell lymphomas, acute leukemia, lung cancers or Ewing sarcomas has the highest correlation with MYC expression. Annotation of this gene signature reveals Myc's primordial function in RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis and biomass accumulation as its key roles in cancer and stem cells.","['Ji, Hongkai', 'Wu, George', 'Zhan, Xiangcan', 'Nolan, Alexandra', 'Koh, Cheryl', 'De Marzo, Angelo', 'Doan, Hoang Mai', 'Fan, Jinshui', 'Cheadle, Christopher', 'Fallahi, Mohammad', 'Cleveland, John L', 'Dang, Chi V', 'Zeller, Karen I']","['Ji H', 'Wu G', 'Zhan X', 'Nolan A', 'Koh C', 'De Marzo A', 'Doan HM', 'Fan J', 'Cheadle C', 'Fallahi M', 'Cleveland JL', 'Dang CV', 'Zeller KI']","['Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America. hji@jhsph.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 DK044158/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA076379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA57341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HG005220/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG005220/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44158/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111019,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', '*Biomass', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",PMC3198433,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0026057 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-17263 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26057. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026057.

Since long-term treatment is painful and invasive, preventing the side effects and their influence on quality of life is an important issue which introduces consideration for self-care. Consequently, the present study was conducted in 2007-2008 about the effects of self-care on the lives of children suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia, referring to treatment centers in Isfahan City. METHODS: The present study was a two-staged, two-group clinical trial. 48 children aging 5-18 and suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia were selected through convenient sampling method and the training program was administered before them and afterwards, they were divided randomly into two groups of experiment (n = 24) and control (n = 24). The General Scale and Cancer Scale Quality of Life Identification Questionnaires were used to define the quality of life of the children. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were in turn defined by content validity method and Cronbach's alpha test. The experiment group received the self-care checklist after training and was controlled and examined for 3 months. The pre-and-post self care Quality of Life Questionnaire were both filled out in both groups and accordingly, the SPSS software, independent t test, chi-square and paired t tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The findings of the study showed that both groups were homogeneous by virtue of influential factors on quality of life, like age, gender, type, stage and duration of treatment (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the experiment and control groups' quality of life average scores before administering the self-care training program. The results of paired-t test in the experiment group after administering the self-care program showed a significant difference in General and Cancer Scale Questionnaires Quality of Life with that before administering the program, while no significant difference was observed in the control group. Also, the independent t-test showed a significant difference in the average of quality of life score shift after administering the self care between the experiment and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life improved after administering self-care training program in the experiment group while it did not improve in the control group and even the increase in average score of quality of life in Cancer Scale in this group was an indicator of an increase in problems related to disease, treatment and care. The results of this study showed the positive effects of administering self-care on the quality of life of children suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Golchin, Mehri', 'Sharifi, Najmeh', 'Ziaee, Shohreh', 'Taheri, Parvin']","['Golchin M', 'Sharifi N', 'Ziaee S', 'Taheri P']","['Department of Pediatric Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res,Iranian journal of nursing and midwifery research,101558775,,,PMC3203302,2011/11/01 06:00,2011/11/01 06:01,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res. 2011 Winter;16(1):71-8.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'child', 'quality of life', 'self care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells responsible for the immunoelimination express Fas ligand and strongly rely on the induction of Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis for their action. Although cancer cells are removed successfully by graft-versus-leukemia reactions in myeloid malignancies, their efficiency is low in T cell leukemias. This may be partially because of the ability of malignant T cells to escape apoptosis. Our work shows that Eph family receptor EphB3 is consistently expressed by malignant T lymphocytes, most frequently in combination with EphB6, and that stimulation with their common ligands, ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2, strongly suppresses Fas-induced apoptosis in these cells. This effect is associated with Akt activation and with the inhibition of the Fas receptor-initiated caspase proteolytic cascade. Akt proved to be crucial for the prosurvival response, because inhibition of Akt, but not of other molecules central to T cell biology, including Src kinases, MEK1 and MEK2, blocked the antiapoptotic effect. Overall, this demonstrates a new role for EphB receptors in the protection of malignant T cells from Fas-induced apoptosis through Akt engagement and prevention of caspase activation. Because Fas-triggered apoptosis is actively involved in the graft-versus-leukemia response and cytotoxic T cells express ephrin-Bs, our observations suggest that EphB receptors are likely to support immunoevasivenes of T cell malignancies and may represent promising targets for therapies, aiming to enhance immunoelimination of cancerous T cells.","['Maddigan, Alison', 'Truitt, Luke', 'Arsenault, Ryan', 'Freywald, Tanya', 'Allonby, Odette', 'Dean, Jonathan', 'Narendran, Aru', 'Xiang, Jim', 'Weng, Andrew', 'Napper, Scott', 'Freywald, Andrew']","['Maddigan A', 'Truitt L', 'Arsenault R', 'Freywald T', 'Allonby O', 'Dean J', 'Narendran A', 'Xiang J', 'Weng A', 'Napper S', 'Freywald A']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Regina, Regina, Saskatchewan S4S 0A2, Canada.']",['eng'],"['COP-107969/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP-737726/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111028,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Eph Family/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Escape/physiology', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1003482 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1003482 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Dec 1;187(11):5983-94. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1003482.

We recently reported that c-Myb, GATA-3, and Menin form a core transcription complex that regulates GATA-3 expression and ultimately Th2 cell development in human peripheral blood T cells. However, c-Myb roles for Th2 cytokine expression were not demonstrated. In this article, we report that c-Myb and GATA-3 cooperatively play an essential role in IL-13 expression though direct binding to a conserved GATA-3 response element (CGRE), an enhancer for IL-13 expression. c-Myb and GATA-3 were shown to activate the CGRE-IL-13 promoter by approximately 160-fold, and mutation of the canonical Myb binding site completely abrogated CGRE enhancer activity. In contrast, mutation of the GATA binding site partially decreased CGRE enhancer activity. GATA-3 did not bind to CGRE when c-myb expression was silenced. c-Myb, GATA-3, Menin, and mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) bound to CGRE in human primary CD4(+) effector/memory cells. Moreover, c-myb silencing significantly decreased both methylation of histone H3K4 and acetylation of histone H3K9 at the IL-13 locus in CD4(+) effector/memory cells. Therefore, in addition to the strong enhancer effect for the transcription of IL-13, the c-Myb/GATA-3 complex recruits MLL to the CGRE for histone modification of the IL-13 locus during the differentiation of memory Th2 cells.","['Kozuka, Teruhiko', 'Sugita, Mayumi', 'Shetzline, Susan', 'Gewirtz, Alan M', 'Nakata, Yuji']","['Kozuka T', 'Sugita M', 'Shetzline S', 'Gewirtz AM', 'Nakata Y']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA101859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101859-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101859-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA101859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111028,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics/immunology', 'Histones/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-13/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/cytology/immunology']",PMC3221810,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1100550 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1100550 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Dec 1;187(11):5974-82. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1100550.

Moreover, pretreatment prognostic parameters, especially chromosome and gene abnormalities, may fail in predicting individual patient outcome. Measurement of minimal residual disease (MRD) is nowadays recognized as a potential critical tool to assess the quality of response after chemotherapy and to plan postremission strategies that are, therefore, driven by the individual risk of relapse. PCR and multiparametric flow cytometry have become the most popular methods to investigate MRD because they have been established as sensitive and specific enough to allow MRD to be studied serially. In the present review, we examine the evidence supporting the appropriateness of incorporating MRD detection into the AML risk assessment process. A comprehensive prognostic algorithm, generated by combining pretreatment cytogenetics/genetics and posttreatment MRD determination, should promote advances in development of personalized therapeutic approaches.","['Buccisano, Francesco', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Sconocchia, Giuseppe', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Arcese, William', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Buccisano F', 'Maurillo L', 'Del Principe MI', 'Del Poeta G', 'Sconocchia G', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Arcese W', 'Amadori S', 'Venditti A']","['Hematology, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111028,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Prognosis']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38618-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-363291 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 12;119(2):332-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-363291.

In the present study, we assessed the risk of both types of malignancies after an ET, PV, or CML diagnosis. We linked 2 population-based nationwide registries, the Danish National Registry of Patients, covering all Danish hospitals and the Danish Cancer Registry, and assessed subsequent cancer risk in a cohort of all 7229 patients diagnosed with a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm during 1977-2008. We compared the incidence of subsequent cancer in this cohort with that expected on the basis of cancer incidence in the general population (standardized incidence ratio). Overall, ET, PV, and CML patients were at increased risk of developing both new hematologic and nonhematologic cancers. The standardized incidence ratio for developing a nonhematologic cancer was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]): 1.0-1.4) for patients with ET, 1.4 (95% CI: 1.3-1.5) for patients with PV, and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3-2.0) for patients with CML.

The impact of additional cytogenetic findings at diagnosis on time to complete cytogenetic (CCR) and major molecular remission (MMR) and progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed using data from 1151 Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) CML patients randomized to the German CML Study IV. At diagnosis, 1003 of 1151 patients (87%) had standard t(9;22)(q34;q11) only, 69 patients (6.0%) had variant t(v;22), and 79 (6.9%) additional cytogenetic aberrations (ACAs). Of these, 38 patients (3.3%) lacked the Y chromosome (-Y) and 41 patients (3.6%) had ACAs except -Y; 16 of these (1.4%) were major route (second Philadelphia [Ph] chromosome, trisomy 8, isochromosome 17q, or trisomy 19) and 25 minor route (all other) ACAs. After a median observation time of 5.3 years for patients with t(9;22), t(v;22), -Y, minor- and major-route ACAs, the 5-year PFS was 90%, 81%, 88%, 96%, and 50%, and the 5-year OS was 92%, 87%, 91%, 96%, and 53%, respectively. In patients with major-route ACAs, the times to CCR and MMR were longer and PFS and OS were shorter (P < .001) than in patients with standard t(9;22). We conclude that major-route ACAs at diagnosis are associated with a negative impact on survival and signify progression to the accelerated phase and blast crisis.","['Fabarius, Alice', 'Leitner, Armin', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Hanfstein, Benjamin', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Jotterand, Martine', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Jung-Munkwitz, Susanne', 'Proetel, Ulrike', 'Schwaab, Juliana', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Schubert, Jorg', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Falge, Christiane', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Stegelmann, Frank', 'Pfreundschuh, Michael', 'Waller, Cornelius F', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Baerlocher, Gabriela M', 'Lauseker, Michael', 'Pfirrmann, Markus', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger']","['Fabarius A', 'Leitner A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Muller MC', 'Hanfstein B', 'Haferlach C', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Jotterand M', 'Reiter A', 'Jung-Munkwitz S', 'Proetel U', 'Schwaab J', 'Hofmann WK', 'Schubert J', 'Einsele H', 'Ho AD', 'Falge C', 'Kanz L', 'Neubauer A', 'Kneba M', 'Stegelmann F', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Waller CF', 'Spiekermann K', 'Baerlocher GM', 'Lauseker M', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Hasford J', 'Saussele S', 'Hehlmann R']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111028,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trisomy', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40231-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-373902 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 22;118(26):6760-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-373902.

In very limited studies, the poor clinical outcome of this aggressive variant of multiple myeloma seemed to be ameliorated by the use of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Aiming to provide more consolidated data, this multicenter retrospective survey focused on unselected and previously untreated PPCL patients who had received bortezomib as frontline therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with PPCL were collected. Bortezomib was given at standard doses and schedules, in various combinations with dexamethasone, thalidomide, doxorubicin, melphalan, prednisone, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: An overall response rate of 79% was observed, with 38% of at least very good partial remission. Grade 3-4 hematological, neurological, infectious, and renal toxic effects occurred in 20%, 21%, 16%, and 4% of patients, respectively. After a median follow-up of 24 months, 16 patients were alive (55%), 12 of whom were in remission phase and 4 relapsed. The best long-term results were achieved in patients who received stem-cell transplantation after bortezomib induction. CONCLUSION: Bortezomib, used as initial therapy, is able to increase the percentage and the quality of responses in PPCL patients, producing a significant improvement of survival.","[""D'Arena, G"", 'Valentini, C G', 'Pietrantuono, G', 'Guariglia, R', 'Martorelli, M C', 'Mansueto, G', 'Villani, O', 'Onofrillo, D', 'Falcone, A', 'Specchia, G', 'Semenzato, G', 'Di Renzo, N', 'Mastrullo, L', 'Venditti, A', 'Ferrara, F', 'Palumbo, A', 'Pagano, L', 'Musto, P']","[""D'Arena G"", 'Valentini CG', 'Pietrantuono G', 'Guariglia R', 'Martorelli MC', 'Mansueto G', 'Villani O', 'Onofrillo D', 'Falcone A', 'Specchia G', 'Semenzato G', 'Di Renzo N', 'Mastrullo L', 'Venditti A', 'Ferrara F', 'Palumbo A', 'Pagano L', 'Musto P']","['Onco-Hematology Department, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a carattere Scientifico, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico della Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111029,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)38715-0 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdr480 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2012 Jun;23(6):1499-502. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdr480.

In this study, the efficacy of SN-38 conjugates prepared with epratuzumab (rapidly internalizing) and veltuzumab (slowly internalizing), humanized anti-CD22 and anti-CD20 IgG, respectively, was examined for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Both antibody-drug conjugates had similar nanomolar activity against a variety of human lymphoma/leukemia cell lines, but slow release of SN-38 compromised potency discrimination in vitro even against an irrelevant conjugate. When SN-38 was stably linked to the anti-CD22 conjugate, its potency was reduced 40- to 55-fold. Therefore, further studies were conducted only with the less stable, slowly dissociating linker. In vivo, similar antitumor activity was found between CD22 and CD20 antibody-drug conjugate in mice-bearing Ramos xenografts, even though Ramos expressed 15-fold more CD20 than CD22, suggesting that the internalization of the epratuzumab-SN-38 conjugate (Emab-SN-38) enhanced its activity. Emab-SN-38 was more efficacious than a nonbinding, irrelevant IgG-SN-38 conjugate in vivo, eliminating a majority of well-established Ramos xenografts at nontoxic doses. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Emab-SN-38 could be combined with unconjugated veltuzumab for a more effective treatment. Thus, Emab-SN-38 is active in lymphoma and leukemia at doses well below toxic levels and therefore represents a new promising agent with therapeutic potential alone or combined with anti-CD20 antibody therapy.","['Sharkey, Robert M', 'Govindan, Serengulam V', 'Cardillo, Thomas M', 'Goldenberg, David M']","['Sharkey RM', 'Govindan SV', 'Cardillo TM', 'Goldenberg DM']","['Garden State Cancer Center, 300 American Road, Morris Plains, New Jersey 07950, USA. rmsharkey@gscancer.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111028,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacology', 'Irinotecan', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0632 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0632 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Jan;11(1):224-34. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0632.

However, the critical role of IL-17-producing CD8(+) T (Tc17)-cell subsets in tumor immunity remains unclear. Tc17 cells differentiated from naive CD8(+) T cells did not possess cytotoxic molecules and exhibited no strong cytotoxicity. However, when Tc17 effector cells were further cultured with IL-12, they converted into IFN-gamma-producing Tc17 cells, which mainly consisted of IL-17/IFN-gamma double-producing cells (Tc17/IFN-gamma). IL-12-converted Tc17 cells also acquired cytotoxic function in addition to IFN-gamma producibility. Moreover, they showed strong anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo as well as Tc1 cells. Among four distinct subsets in IL-12-converted Tc17 cell populations, the isolated Tc17/IFN-gamma cells exhibited cytotoxicity as well as IFN-gamma-producing Tc1-like cells.

Further, patients treated with As(2)O(3) rarely incurred agranulocytosis (1.4%, P < 0.001), or severe infection (0.7%, P < 0.001). It is still very well tolerated compared to HiDAC. We confirmed that As(2)O(3) as a first-line consolidation regimen provided significant benefits of OS to patients with APL. The As(2)O(3) regimen made low-risk patients gain more EFS benefits than high-risk group. The high-risk cohort receiving As(2)O(3) overcame the negative impact, yielding OS similar to that for with the low-risk patients treated with As(2)O(3).","['Huang, Bin-Tao', 'Zeng, Qing-Chun', 'Gurung, Arati', 'Zhao, Wei-Hong', 'Xiao, Zhen', 'Li, Bing-Sheng']","['Huang BT', 'Zeng QC', 'Gurung A', 'Zhao WH', 'Xiao Z', 'Li BS']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical College, 1 TongDao Avenue North, Hohhot 010059, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111030,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0099-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):2088-94. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0099-2.

Among recently reported BCR-ABL splice variants, exon 7 deletion (Deltaexon7) was characterized in this study. The frequency of Deltaexon7 was investigated in 30 healthy controls and in 76 CML patients at different time points of the disease course by four different molecular genetic methods (direct sequencing, fragment analysis, allele-specific and quantitative PCR). The functionality and viability of the variant protein was tested by bioinformatic prediction. The Deltaexon7 was abundantly detected with similar frequency in healthy controls, in imatinib naive and resistant CML patients on BCR-ABL and also on the nontranslocated ABL. The detection rate of Deltaexon7 (varying between 17 and 100%) was highly dependent on the expression levels of BCR-ABL or ABL and the sensitivity of detection method. According to secondary structure prediction by bioinformatic methods, the exon 7 deleted mRNA is a target for nonsense-mediated decay, and the translated protein is likely to be nonfunctional and unstable. Taken together all the above observations, we concluded that Deltaexon7 is a common splice variant not associating with imatinib resistance.","['Meggyesi, Nora', 'Kalmar, Lajos', 'Fekete, Sandor', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Tordai, Attila', 'Andrikovics, Hajnalka']","['Meggyesi N', 'Kalmar L', 'Fekete S', 'Masszi T', 'Tordai A', 'Andrikovics H']","['Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, Karolina str 19-21, Budapest 1113, Hungary. nora.meggyesi@kkk.org.hu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111030,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Computational Biology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/chemistry/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Sequence Deletion']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0092-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):2136-42. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0092-9.

De novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with isochromosome 17q has rarely been reported. The frequency of genetic mutations is unknown. METHODS: The authors assessed clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic features of 22 myeloid neoplasms with isolated isochromosome 17q. RESULTS: Fourteen patients presented as MDS/MPN; 8 as de novo AML. Most presented with leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly. Morphologically, all showed myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features, including pseudo-Pelger-Huet-like neutrophils, micromegakaryocytic hyperplasia, hypercellularity, fibrosis, and osteosclerosis. Blasts were increased (median, 40% in de novo AML; 9% in MDS/MPN). Immunohistochemical assessment of proliferation and apoptosis rates in AML were similar to a matched group without isochromosome 17q. In most patients, isochromosome 17q occurred at time of blast transformation or disease progression. DNA sequencing revealed no mutation in the uninvolved TP53 allele. Mutational analyses showed rare mutations in NRAS (3 of 10), FLT3 (2 of 16), and JAK2 (1 of 18), and no mutations in NPM1 (0 of 15), KIT (0 of 4), and CEBPA (0 of 4). The median overall survival was 14.5 months for de novo AML, and 11.0 months for MDS/MPN. With a median follow-up of 8.5 months (range, 1.5-107 months), 15 died of disease, 6 had persistent disease, and 1 was in remission after bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that myeloid neoplasms with isolated isochromosome 17q represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity with myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features, high risk of leukemic transformation, and wild-type TP53.","['Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Barkoh, Bedia', 'Lu, Gary', 'Wang, Sa', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Vadhan-Raj, Saroj', 'Hoehn, Daniela', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Yin, C Cameron']","['Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Barkoh B', 'Lu G', 'Wang S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Vadhan-Raj S', 'Hoehn D', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Yin CC']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111028,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Isochromosomes', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/07/28 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26537 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jun 1;118(11):2879-88. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26537.

However, 25% to 30% of imatinib-treated patients develop drug resistance or intolerance, increasing the risk of disease progression and poor prognosis. In 2006, the European LeukemiaNet proposed criteria to identify patients with a suboptimal response to, or failure associated with, imatinib; these recommendations were updated in 2009. Suboptimal responders represent a unique treatment challenge. Although they may respond to continued imatinib therapy, their long-term outcomes may not be as favorable as those for optimally responding patients. Validation studies demonstrated that suboptimal responders are a heterogeneous group, and that the prognostic implications of suboptimal response vary by time point. There are few data derived from clinical trials to guide therapeutic decisions for these patients. Clinical trials are currently underway to assess the efficacy of newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this setting. Identification of suboptimal responders or patients failing treatment using hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular techniques allows physicians to alter therapy earlier in the treatment course to improve long-term outcomes.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Saglio G', 'Hughes TP', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. ejabbour@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111028,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Medical Oncology/*methods/trends', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Patient Compliance', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3412948,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/05/01 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26391 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Mar 1;118(5):1181-91. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26391.

Patients received antithymocyte globulin followed by cyclosporine A (CsA) or CsA alone for at least 3 months. Seventy-one cases were analyzed. The total response rate was 77.5% (55/71 cases) with 11 complete responses. The response rate was positively correlated with the number of recruitment criteria met. Patients with an abnormal CD8, an abnormal CD4, or both had similar response rates. Patients who responded to treatment had significantly lower Th1 and Tc1 levels after treatment (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively), and six of eight patients with abnormal chromosomes did not show obviously abnormal clonal expansion when reassessed after IST.

At the median observation of 24 months, 35 of 55 responders (63.6%) maintained a hematological response, and 60 of 71 patients (84.5%) were still alive. The strictly selective use of IST may yield high response rates and can avoid treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia transformation.

Microarray technology gives new possibilities for the analysis of the biology of leukemias. We hypothesize that drug sensitivity in pediatric ALL is driven by specific molecular mechanisms that correlate with gene expression profiles assessed by microarray analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the ex vivo resistance profiles of 20 antileukemic drugs and gene expression profiles, with relation to response to initial therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lymphoblasts were analyzed after bone marrow biopsy was obtained from 56 patients. The profile of in vitro resistance to drugs was determined in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay. High-quality total RNA was prepared and hybridized to oligonucleotide arrays HG-U133A 2.0 Chip (Affymetrix). The expression of selected genes was tested by qualitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The exposure of leukemic blasts to drugs initiates a complex cellular response, which reflects global changes in gene expression. Changes in the expression of several genes are highly correlated with drug resistance.","['Szczepanek, Joanna', 'Jarzab, Michal', 'Oczko-Wojciechowska, Malgorzata', 'Kowalska, Malgorzata', 'Tretyn, Andrzej', 'Haus, Olga', 'Pogorzala, Monika', 'Wysocki, Mariusz', 'Jarzab, Barbara', 'Styczynski, Jan']","['Szczepanek J', 'Jarzab M', 'Oczko-Wojciechowska M', 'Kowalska M', 'Tretyn A', 'Haus O', 'Pogorzala M', 'Wysocki M', 'Jarzab B', 'Styczynski J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland. szczepanekjoanna@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111027,England,J Appl Genet,Journal of applied genetics,9514582,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/drug effects', 'Child', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetrazolium Salts/chemistry', 'Thiazoles/chemistry']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13353-011-0073-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Genet. 2012 Feb;53(1):83-91. doi: 10.1007/s13353-011-0073-x.

In this study, TMTP1 was assessed for its ability to specifically target the malignant hematopoietic cells and metastatic lesions of hematological malignancies. FITC-TMTP1 was chemically synthesized. Immunofluorescence assay and competitive test were carried out to determine the specific binding capacity of TMTPl to hematological malignant cell lines, including HL60, k562, SHI-1, Jurkat, Raji, El-4 and umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow of healthy subjects and patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Then the cells were co-cultured with TMTP1 or scrambled peptides and the binding and affinity of TMTP1 peptide to the primary cells of hematological malignancies were flow cytometrically analyzed. The binding specificity of TMTP1 to target hematological malignancies was measured in vivo by intravenous injection of FITC-conjugated TMTP1 into El-4 lymphoma-bearing mice. The results showed that TMTP1 specifically bound to the cells of a series of hematological malignancies, including HL60, k562, Jurkat, Raji, El-4 and chronic myeloid leukemia primary cells but not to bone marrow mononuclear cells from healthy subjects. By contrast, TMTP1 could bind to the metastatic foci of lymphoma originating from the EL-4 cell line while the scrambled peptide failed to do so. Moreover, the occult metastases could be identified, with high specificity, by detecting FITC-TMTP1. We are led to conclude that TMTP1, as a novel tumor-homing peptide, can serve as a marker for primary malignant and metastatic lesions for the early diagnosis of hematological malignances and a carrier of anticancer drugs for cancer treatment.","['Xiao, Min', 'Hong, Zhenya', 'Sun, Lishi', 'Wu, Ying', 'Zhang, Na', 'Liu, Yanan', 'Luo, Danfeng', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Li, Chunrui']","['Xiao M', 'Hong Z', 'Sun L', 'Wu Y', 'Zhang N', 'Liu Y', 'Luo D', 'Zhou J', 'Li C']","['Department of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Affiliated to Medical College, Qingdao University, Qindao, 266003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. lfxm2000@126.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111025,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

METHODS: The subjects were the Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivor groups (0-14 years of age in 1945) reported in life span study report 12 (follow-up years were from 1950 to 1990), and a control group consisting of the JPCG. We estimated the expected number of deaths due to all causes and cancers of various causes among the exposed survivors who died in the follow-up interval, if they had died with the same mortality as the JPCG (0-14 years of age in 1945). We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of A-bomb survivors in comparison with the JPCG. RESULTS: SMRs were significantly higher in exposed boys overall for all deaths, all cancers, leukemia, and liver cancer, and for exposed girls overall for all cancers, solid cancers, liver cancer, and breast cancer. In boys, SMRs were significantly higher for all deaths and liver cancer even in those exposed to very low doses, and for all cancers, solid cancers, and liver cancer in those exposed to low doses. In girls, SMRs were significantly higher for liver cancer and uterine cancer in those exposed to low doses, and for leukemia, solid cancers, stomach cancer, and breast cancer in those exposed to high doses. CONCLUSIONS: We calculated the SMRs for the A-bomb survivors versus JPCG in childhood and compared them with a true non-exposed group. A notable result was that SMRs in boys exposed to low doses were significantly higher for solid cancer.","['Goto, Hitomi', 'Watanabe, Tomoyuki', 'Miyao, Masaru', 'Fukuda, Hiromi', 'Sato, Yuzo', 'Oshida, Yoshiharu']","['Goto H', 'Watanabe T', 'Miyao M', 'Fukuda H', 'Sato Y', 'Oshida Y']","['Department of School Health Sciences, Aichi University of Education, Kariya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111025,England,Environ Health Prev Med,Environmental health and preventive medicine,9609642,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Weapons', 'Sex Distribution', '*Survivors', 'World War II', 'Young Adult']",PMC3348246,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12199-011-0246-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Prev Med. 2012 May;17(3):228-34. doi: 10.1007/s12199-011-0246-6.

The aim of this study was an in vitro evaluation of the anti-cancer activity of a new synthesized aminothiadiazole derivative 2-(3-chlorophenyloamino)-5-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)- -1,3,4-thiadiazole 4ClABT. The effect on tumor cell proliferation, motility and morphology, DNA synthesis as well as the influence on normal cells was assessed. The antiproliferative activity of 4ClABT in tumor cells derived from peripheral cancers including breast carcinoma (T47D), colon carcinoma (HT-29), thyroid carcinoma (FTC-238), teratoma (P19), and T-cell leukemia (Jurkat E6.1), as well as cancers of the nervous system including rhabdomyosarcoma/medulloblastoma (TE671), brain astrocytoma (MOGGCCM) and glioma (C6) was studied by means of MTT assay. DNA synthesis level was determined in BrdU ELISA test. Wound assay model was applied for tumor cell motility assessment. Morphological changes induced by 4ClABT in cancer and normal cells were analyzed in HE staining specimens. Moreover, the influence of 4ClABT on normal cells including skin fibroblasts (HSF), hepatocytes (Fao), astroglia and neurons was studied by means of LDH assay. The tested compound inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells in dose-dependent fashion. The anti-cancer effect was attributed to decreased DNA synthesis, prominent changes in tumor cell morphology as well as reduced cell motility. In antiproliferative concentrations, 4ClABT was not toxic to normal cells. Our study showed prominent anti-cancer effects of the tested aminothiadiazole derivative in the absence of toxicity in normal cells. The obtained results confirmed the promising anti-cancer profile of previously tested 2-(monohalogenphenylamino)- -5-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives (ClABT - chlorophenyl derivative, FABT and 3FABT - fluorophenyl derivatives and 4BrABT - bromophenyl derivative).

Its association with leukemia, however, has not been fully investigated. Our study revealed, for the first time, that mPGES-1 is over-expressed in human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Cytotoxicity assays and flow cytometry showed that MK886, an inhibitor of mPGES-1, inhibits proliferation of HL-60 cells and induces apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which may result from down-regulation of mPGES-1 expression and PGE2 synthesis. Evaluation of mediators of apoptotic signaling revealed up-regulation of BAX expression and caspase-3 activity, as well as significant decreases in Bcl2 and P-Akt.

A successful approach, monitoring EBV-DNA load in peripheral blood (PB) accompanied by preemptive rituximab therapy, has recently been reported. Here, we describe a 29-year-old woman who developed isolated central nervous system (CNS) PTLD. She received HSCT against acute myelogenous leukemia from a related human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical donor, following a conditioning regimen that included antithymocyte globulin. Tacrolimus and methylprednisolone were given as prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease. On day +172, the patient's consciousness deteriorated.

Although the tissue selectivity of tumors in specific endocrine organs is the very essence of MEN1, the mechanisms underlying the tissue-selectivity of tumors remain unknown. The product of the Men1 gene, menin, and mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) have been found to cooperatively regulate p27(Kip1)/CDKN1B (p27) and p18(Ink4C)/CDKN2C (p18) genes. However, there are no reports on the tissue distribution of these MEN1-related genes. We investigated the expression of these genes in the endocrine and non-endocrine organs of wild-type, Men1 knockout and MLL knockout mice. Men1 mRNA was expressed at a similar level in endocrine and non-endocrine organs. However, MLL, p27 and p18 mRNAs were predominantly expressed in the endocrine organs. Notably, p27 and MLL mRNAs were expressed in the pituitary gland at levels approximately 12- and 17-fold higher than those in the liver. The heterozygotes of Men1 knockout mice the levels of MLL, p27 and p18 mRNAs did not differ from those in the wild-type mice. In contrast, heterozygotes of MLL knockout mice showed significant reductions in p27 mRNA as well as protein levels in the pituitary and p27 and p18 in the pancreatic islets, but not in the liver. This study demonstrated for the first time the predominant expression MEN1-related genes, particularly MLL and p27, in the endocrine organs, and a tissue-specific haploinsuffiency of MLL, but not menin, may lead to a decrease in levels of p27 and p18 mRNAs in endocrine organs. These findings may provide basic information for understanding the mechanisms of tissue selectivity of the tumorigenesis in patients with MEN1.","['Taguchi, Ryo', 'Yamada, Masanobu', 'Horiguchi, Kazuhiko', 'Tomaru, Takuya', 'Ozawa, Atsushi', 'Shibusawa, Nobuyuki', 'Hashimoto, Koshi', 'Okada, Shuichi', 'Satoh, Tetsurou', 'Mori, Masatomo']","['Taguchi R', 'Yamada M', 'Horiguchi K', 'Tomaru T', 'Ozawa A', 'Shibusawa N', 'Hashimoto K', 'Okada S', 'Satoh T', 'Mori M']","['Department of Medicine and Molecular Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111021,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Adrenal Glands/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Haploinsufficiency', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Islets of Langerhans/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Pituitary Gland/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Testis/metabolism']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/01/19 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)01889-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.077 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Nov 18;415(2):378-83. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.077.

An oxidized phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PazPC), was chosen to fabricate micelles via both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions for delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and idarubicin (IDA). The formation of ion-pair complexes between PazPC and DOX was first investigated under different pH conditions. Drug-loaded PazPC micelles at a 5:1 molar ratio of lipid/drug at pH 7.0 were then prepared by the solvent evaporation method. The empty and drug-loaded PazPC micelles exhibited a small particle size ( approximately 10 nm) and high encapsulation efficiency. In vitro stability and release profile indicated that the micelles were stable at physiological conditions, but exhibited pH-sensitive behavior with accelerated release of DOX or IDA in an acidic endosome environment. Finally, in vitro uptake and cytotoxicity were evaluated for leukemia P388 and its resistant subline P388/ADR. The drug-loaded PazPC micelles enhanced drug uptake and exhibited higher cytotoxicity in both leukemia cells in comparison to free drugs. In conclusion, we developed a novel pH sensitive oxidized phospholipid-based micellar formulation which could potentially be useful in delivering anthracycline anti-cancer drugs and provide a novel strategy for increasing the therapeutic index while overcoming multidrug resistance for leukemia treatment.","['Wang, Yongzhong', 'Chen, Li', 'Ding, Yunfei', 'Yan, Weili']","['Wang Y', 'Chen L', 'Ding Y', 'Yan W']","['Department of Pharmacal Sciences, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111020,Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Drug Carriers', 'Drug Compounding', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Stability', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Idarubicin/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Micelles', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Particle Size', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Solubility', 'Solvents/chemistry', 'Technology, Pharmaceutical/methods']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/04/28 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-5173(11)00968-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2012 Jan 17;422(1-2):409-17. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.029.

The E2 ubiquitin conjugase UBCH8 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme [human] 8) cooperates with the E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH1 and SIAH2 (seven in absentia homolog 1/2) to mediate the proteasomal degradation of oncoproteins. One such protein is the leukemia fusion protein PML-RARalpha (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptoralpha) that is associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. A limited number of UBCH8 interaction partners that participate in the UBCH8-dependent depletion of cancer-relevant proteins are known. We report here that TRIAD1 (two RING fingers and DRIL [double RING finger linked] 1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase relevant for the clonogenic growth of myloid progenitors, binds UBCH8 as well as PML-RARalpha. Moreover, there is concurrent induction of TRIAD1 and UBCH8 upon combinatorial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells with the pro-apoptotic epigenetic modulator valproic acid and the differentiation inducing agent all-trans retinoic acid. However, in sharp contrast to SIAH1/SIAH2 and UBCH8, TRIAD1 binding to PML-RARalpha has no effect on its turnover. In summary, our data exclude TRIAD1 as crucial regulator of the leukemic determinant PML-RARalpha, but highlight the prominence of the UBCH8/SIAH axis in PML-RARalpha degradation.","['Pietschmann, Kristin', 'Buchwald, Marc', 'Muller, Sylvia', 'Knauer, Shirley K', 'Kogl, Manfred', 'Heinzel, Thorsten', 'Kramer, Oliver H']","['Pietschmann K', 'Buchwald M', 'Muller S', 'Knauer SK', 'Kogl M', 'Heinzel T', 'Kramer OH']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Center for Molecular Biomedicine (CMB), Department of Biochemistry, University of Jena, Jena, Germany. kristin.pietschmann@googlemail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111022,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,IM,"['Cell Line', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(11)00281-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2011.10.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2012 Jan;44(1):132-8. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2011.10.008.

While effects on hematopoietic stem cells have been characterized, less is known about the DNA damage response in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in the bone marrow stroma, progenitors of osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes. To elucidate the response of undifferentiated hMSCs to gamma-irradiation and cisplatin, key DNA damage responses have been characterised in hMSCs from normal adult donors. Cisplatin and gamma-irradiation activated the DNA damage response in hMSCs, including induction of p53 and p21, and activation of PI3 kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK)-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139, and replication protein A2 on serine4/serine8. Chemical inhibition of ATM or DNA-PK reduced DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of H2AX, indicating a role for both PIKKs in the response of hMSCs to DNA damage. Consistent with repair of DNA strand breaks, gamma-H2AX staining decreased by 24 hours following gamma-irradiation. gamma-Irradiation arrested hMSCs in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, while cisplatin induced S-phase arrest, mediated in part by the ATR/Chk1 checkpoint pathway. In hMSCs isolated from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient, p53 and p21 were induced by cisplatin and gamma-irradiation, while RPA2 was phosphorylated on serine4/8 in particular following cisplatin. Compared to peripheral blood lymphocytes or the leukemia cell line K562, both normal hMSCs and CLL-derived hMSCs were more resistant to cisplatin and gamma-irradiation. These results provide insights into key pathways mediating the response of bone marrow-derived hMSCs to DNA damaging agents used in cancer treatment.","['Prendergast, Aine M', 'Cruet-Hennequart, Severine', 'Shaw, Georgina', 'Barry, Frank P', 'Carty, Michael P']","['Prendergast AM', 'Cruet-Hennequart S', 'Shaw G', 'Barry FP', 'Carty MP']","['DNA Damage Response Laboratory, Centre for Chromosome Biology, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111101,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Breaks/radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Gamma Rays', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/metabolism']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['17972 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.21.17972 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Nov 1;10(21):3768-77. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.21.17972.

The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) from a reciprocal translocation, t(9;22) (q34;q11) causes a fusion gene, BCR-ABL, that encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. Treatment of CML by imatinib is effective to control the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the protein related to the cell signaling. BCR-ABL mRNA is overexpressed in the minimal residual disease (MRD), known as an early sign of relapse. Between December 2005 and June 2008, we measured BCR-ABL mRNA levels in the bone marrow (BM) from patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital. Eighty-six samples from 26 patients were collected. Among the 26 CML patients, 11 patients (42%) were in the pretreatment group. Seven (64%) of the 11 patients achieved complete molecular response (CMR). In the post-treatment group consisting of the remaining 15 patients, 9 (60%) patients achieved CMR. The patients receiving imatinib at a dose over 300 mg per day required 13 (6-77) months [median (range)] to achieve CMR. On the other hand, the patients receiving a dose below 300 mg per day required 29.5 (11-84) months [median (range)]. When BCR-ABL mRNA was detected during the treatment course of patients with CMR, careful observation of BCR-ABL mRNA was useful for tracking the clinical course of patients. In conclusion, the BCR-ABL mRNA level was useful for monitoring the clinical course in 26 patients with CML.","['Sakamoto, Yuichi', 'Mariya, Yasushi', 'Oshikiri, Toshiyuki', 'Sasaki, Sumiko', 'Segawa, Megumi', 'Teshiromori, Ryuichi', 'Ogura, Kazuto', 'Akagi, Tomoaki', 'Kaimori, Mitsuomi', 'Kubo, Kohmei']","['Sakamoto Y', 'Mariya Y', 'Oshikiri T', 'Sasaki S', 'Segawa M', 'Teshiromori R', 'Ogura K', 'Akagi T', 'Kaimori M', 'Kubo K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Japan. 97036ys@jichi.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Acta Med Okayama,Acta medica Okayama,0417611,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.18926/AMO/47016 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Med Okayama. 2011 Oct;65(5):335-42. doi: 10.18926/AMO/47016.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efflux of drugs by functional P-gp, MRP1 and elevated GSH level can confer resistance to apoptosis induced by a range of different stimuli. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new cell death inducers with relatively lower toxicity toward non-malignant cells that can overcome MDR by induction of apoptotic or non-apoptotic cell death pathways. Herein we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a GSH depleting, redox active Schiff's base, viz., potassium-N-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde)-alaninate (PHMBA). Cytotoxic potential of PHMBA has been studied in doxorubicin-resistant and -sensitive T lymphoblastic leukemia cells and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells. PHMBA kills both the cell types irrespective of their drug-resistance phenotype following apoptotic/necrotic pathways. Moreover, PHMBA-induced cell death is associated with oxidative stress mediated mitochondrial pathway as the H(2)O(2) inhibitor PEG-Catalase abrogated PHMBA-induced apoptosis/necrosis. PHMBA induces anti-tumor activity in both doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant EAC-tumor-bearing Swiss albino mice. The non-toxicity of PHMBA was also confirmed through cytotoxicity studies on normal cell lines like PBMC, NIH3T3 and Chang Liver. To summarise, our data provide compelling rationale for future clinical use of this redox active Schiff's base in treatment of cancer patients irrespective of their drug-resistance status.","['Basu, Soumya', 'Ganguly, Avishek', 'Chakraborty, Paramita', 'Sen, Rupashree', 'Banerjee, Kaushik', 'Chatterjee, Mitali', 'Efferth, Thomas', 'Choudhuri, Soumitra Kumar']","['Basu S', 'Ganguly A', 'Chakraborty P', 'Sen R', 'Banerjee K', 'Chatterjee M', 'Efferth T', 'Choudhuri SK']","['Department of In vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, 37, S.P.

Since the disease was discovered in 1969, the etiology remains unknown. A retroviral etiology has been suggested based on the detection of reverse transcriptase activity and electron microscopic observation of retroviral-like particles using negative staining. To date, however no virus isolate and no retroviral sequence from HN has been obtained. Moreover, transmission of the disease by cell-free filtrate from affected clams has not been reproduced. In the current study, we reinvestigated the association of HN with a putative retrovirus. Sucrose gradient centrifugation followed by assessment of reverse transcriptase activity, electrophoretic analysis of protein and RNA, and electron microscopic examinations of fractions corresponding to retroviral density were employed. Detection of retroviral pol sequences using degenerate RT-PCR approaches was also attempted. Our results showed visible bands at the expected density of retrovirus in HN-positive and HN-negative clam tissues and both with reverse transcriptase activity. Electron microscopy, RNA analysis, protein analysis, and PCR systems targeting the pol gene of retroviruses did not however provide clear evidence supporting presence of a retrovirus. We point out that the retrovirus etiology of HN of Mya arenaria proposed some 25 years ago should be reconsidered in the absence of a virus isolate or virus sequences.","['AboElkhair, M', 'Iwamoto, T', 'Clark, K F', 'McKenna, P', 'Siah, A', 'Greenwood, S J', 'Berthe, F C J', 'Casey, J W', 'Cepica, A']","['AboElkhair M', 'Iwamoto T', 'Clark KF', 'McKenna P', 'Siah A', 'Greenwood SJ', 'Berthe FC', 'Casey JW', 'Cepica A']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Atlantic Veterinary College, Charlottetown, PE, Canada C1A 4P3. maboelkhair2004@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111021,United States,J Invertebr Pathol,Journal of invertebrate pathology,0014067,IM,"['Animals', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Hemocytes/ultrastructure/virology', 'Mya/*virology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/enzymology/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/diagnosis/*veterinary/virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2011(11)00232-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jip.2011.10.008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invertebr Pathol. 2012 Jan;109(1):97-104. doi: 10.1016/j.jip.2011.10.008.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that the mechanism of this action of triclosan is, in part, due to effects on mast cell function. Mast cells play important roles in allergy, asthma, parasite defense, and carcinogenesis. In response to various stimuli, mast cells degranulate, releasing allergic mediators such as histamine. In order to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory effect of triclosan on mast cells, we monitored the level of degranulation in a mast cell model, rat basophilic leukemia cells, clone 2H3. Having functional homology to human mast cells, as well as a very well defined signaling pathway leading to degranulation, this cell line has been widely used to gain insight into mast-cell driven allergic disorders in humans. Using a fluorescent microplate assay, we determined that triclosan strongly dampened the release of granules from activated rat mast cells starting at 2 muM treatment, with dose-responsive suppression through 30 muM. These concentrations were found to be non-cytotoxic. The inhibition was found to persist when early signaling events (such as IgE receptor aggregation and tyrosine phosphorylation) were bypassed by using calcium ionophore stimulation, indicating that the target for triclosan in this pathway is likely downstream of the calcium signaling event. Triclosan also strongly suppressed F-actin remodeling and cell membrane ruffling, a physiological process that accompanies degranulation. Our finding that triclosan inhibits mast cell function may explain the clinical data mentioned above and supports the use of triclosan or a mechanistically similar compound as a topical treatment for allergic skin disease, such as eczema.","['Palmer, Rachel K', 'Hutchinson, Lee M', 'Burpee, Benjamin T', 'Tupper, Emily J', 'Pelletier, Jonathan H', 'Kormendy, Zsolt', 'Hopke, Alex R', 'Malay, Ethan T', 'Evans, Brieana L', 'Velez, Alejandro', 'Gosse, Julie A']","['Palmer RK', 'Hutchinson LM', 'Burpee BT', 'Tupper EJ', 'Pelletier JH', 'Kormendy Z', 'Hopke AR', 'Malay ET', 'Evans BL', 'Velez A', 'Gosse JA']","['Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469, USA. rachel.palmer@maine.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111020,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/physiology', 'Triclosan/*pharmacology']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(11)00404-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2011.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2012 Jan 1;258(1):99-108. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2011.10.012.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report 29 cases of invasive aspergillosis diagnosed in the Sousse Farhat Hached hospital Hematology unit, Tunisia, between 2002 and 2010. RESULTS: The most frequent disease (65.5%) was acute myeloid leukemia. All patients were severely neutropenic (<500/mm(3), mean duration=27 days). Pulmonary invasive aspergillosis was suggested in 28 (96.5%) cases. The most frequent respiratory signs were cough (64.3%), chest pain (53.6%), and hemoptysis (50%). The chest X-ray showed suggestive lesions in 60.7% of cases. CT scans revealed nodules with cavitation in 65% of cases, a halo sign in 20% of cases, and nodules in 15% of cases. Galactomannan antigenemia was positive in 88%, mycological examination positive in 51.6%, and seroconversion was noted in 35.7% of the cases. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was classified, according to EORTC/MSG criteria, as probable in 26 cases, possible in one case, and proven in one case. Aspergillus flavus was the dominant species in pulmonary invasive aspergillosis accounting for 73.7% of isolates. Extrapulmonary involvement was suggested in 39.3% of cases, the most frequent were sinusitis and brain abscess. Primary cutaneous aspergillosis was observed in one case. The overall mortality rate was 64.2%; the 12-week survival rate was 71.4%. CONCLUSION: Our results are correlated to published data. A. flavus was the most frequent species in our region.","['Saghrouni, F', 'Ben Youssef, Y', 'Gheith, S', 'Bouabid, Z', 'Ben Abdeljelil, J', 'Khammari, I', 'Fathallah, A', 'Khlif, A', 'Ben Said, M']","['Saghrouni F', 'Ben Youssef Y', 'Gheith S', 'Bouabid Z', 'Ben Abdeljelil J', 'Khammari I', 'Fathallah A', 'Khlif A', 'Ben Said M']","['Laboratoire de parasitologie-mycologie, hopital Farhat Hached, CHU Farhat Hached, Tunisia. saghrounifatma@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111028,France,Med Mal Infect,Medecine et maladies infectieuses,0311416,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Fungal/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/epidemiology/etiology/microbiology', 'Aspergillus/classification/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Brain Abscess/epidemiology/etiology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dermatomycoses/epidemiology/etiology/microbiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fungemia/epidemiology/etiology/microbiology', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Mannans/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroaspergillosis/epidemiology/etiology/microbiology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Sinusitis/epidemiology/etiology/microbiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Tunisia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0399-077X(11)00289-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.medmal.2011.09.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Mal Infect. 2011 Dec;41(12):657-62. doi: 10.1016/j.medmal.2011.09.011.

The success of imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as initial therapy has changed the treatment paradigm for this disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic transplants are now reserved for patients whose disease does not respond optimally to TKI treatment. Patients whose disease does not have an optimal response to imatinib may respond to a second-generation TKI, dasatinib or nilotinib, and many achieve major or complete molecular and cytogenetic responses. The indication for allogeneic HSCT versus continued second-line therapy is not well-defined and is the subject of ongoing study. There has been continued progress in reducing the toxicity and risks of HSCT with development of reduced-intensity regimens; transplants can be routinely performed in patients up to the age of 75 years who are in fair general medical condition. Transplantation results from unrelated donors have improved, with survival rates similar that achieved with matched siblings. Results with haploidentical and cord blood transplants have markedly improved, and should be considered for patients lacking a matched donor. Allogeneic hematopoietic transplants have the best chance to be curative in patients with chronic phase that is under hematologic control with 80% disease-free survival; patients progressing to the accelerated phase or blast crisis have a much poorer prognosis. Thus, HSCT should be considered for patients with imatinib failure. Patients receiving second-line TKI therapy must be closely monitored and referred for transplantation if a complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response is not achieved. HSCT should be performed if feasible in patients without a continued response to TKI treatment.","['Champlin, Richard', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Anderlini, Paolo', 'Andersson, Borje', 'de Lima, Marcos']","['Champlin R', 'Jabbour E', 'Kebriaei P', 'Anderlini P', 'Andersson B', 'de Lima M']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and Leukemia, University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. rchampli@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20110428,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/surgery/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC3226776,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00042-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Jun;11 Suppl 1:S96-100. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.028.

A recent report, of a long-term follow-up of that study now reveals that a significant increase in the overall survival time of the patients who, originally, were randomized to fludarabine arm started to become manifest only after about 6 years had passed from the time of first treatment on this study.

Current research is focusing on the identification of new cellular targets amenable to specific inhibitors, designing the best strategies for combining these novel agents with traditional chemotherapy regimens, and determining prognostic indicators that may allow us to better stratify therapy.","['Ravandi, Farhad']",['Ravandi F'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. fravandi@mdandesron.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20110430,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Prognosis']",PMC4096137,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00028-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Jun;11 Suppl 1:S60-4. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.02.004.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) that do not contain the BCR-ABL1 mutation include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). JAK2V617F is the best characterized mutation in BCR-ABL1-negative neoplasms, with an estimated prevalence of more than 95% in PV, 50% in ET, and 50% in PMF. Current diagnostic strategies are increasingly reliant on molecular markers, and their prognostic value continues to be investigated. The use of aspirin, hydroxyurea, and phlebotomy for PV and ET, and the use of androgens, steroids, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for PMF continues to be the mainstay of therapy. The only potentially curative therapy is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but treatment-related mortality remains high. There have been promising results from clinical trials that involve the JAK tyrosine kinase inhibitors TG101384 and INCB018424, but their role in future therapy is yet to be established.

We summarized data from 4 UK randomized CLL trials over the past 30 years in which chlorambucil, as a single agent, was one of the study arms. Overall response rates (ORR) ranged from 57% to 75% when using doses of 60-70 mg/m(2) per 28-day cycle. This compares favorably with an ORR of 31% to 55% in other studies that used lower doses. Response rates improved when patients received 6 or more courses. Studies that used chlorambucil as a comparator, at lower doses or with fewer courses, resulted in consistently lower ORR. Comparisons with single-agent fludarabine in 2 randomized trials (LRF CLL4 and German CLL5) showed similar progression-free survival. Chlorambucil compares favorably with fludarabine and bendamustine with respect to myelotoxicity, neutropenia, and fever, even at 70 mg/m(2) per cycle and in the elderly. Resistance to chlorambucil does not preclude a good response to newer treatments used as second-line treatment, which explains the good survival after progression observed in patients randomized to chlorambucil in LRF CLL4. Chlorambucil is currently being combined with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in several phase II and III trials. It remains a useful drug for patients unfit to receive more intensive combinations.

Recent studies using genomic arrays have shown recurrent gains of the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p) in a subset of CLL. We evaluated 178 CLL cases for 2p gains using custom-designed oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). A high frequency of 2p gains was observed in 53 of 178 (30%) cases, which ranged from a small 29-kb region to large segments involving the entire short arm. Besides several common chromosomal aberrations associated with 2p gain, we demonstrated a novel observation that gain of the telomeric region 2p25.3 harboring the ACP1 gene is common in CLL (25%, 44 of 178 cases). The ACP1 gene has been previously shown to regulate T-cell receptor signaling through ZAP-70, and both genes are unfavorable clinical markers for CLL. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmed the presence of 3-6 copies of ACP1 in 35 of 40 (88%) of these cases. Interestingly, none of the aCGH diploid CLL cases showed gain of ACP1. Assessment of 73 healthy individuals by qPCR revealed ACP1 copy number gain in only two cases (2.7%). Gain of 2p25.3 was associated with ZAP-70 expression (P < .002) and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene mutation (P < .0001). A high frequency of MYCN co-amplication with ACP1 was observed (14 of 40 cases, 35%). The frequent 2p25.3 gain involving the ACP1 and MYCN genes may help define the critical region of 2p that contributes to pathogenesis of CLL together with other chromosomal abnormalities.","['Ma, Deqin', 'Chen, Zhao', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Mishra, Bal M', 'Yao, Hui', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Wierda, William', 'Keating, Michael', 'Sargent, Rachel', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi']","['Ma D', 'Chen Z', 'Patel KP', 'Mishra BM', 'Yao H', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wierda W', 'Keating M', 'Sargent R', 'Luthra R']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20110505,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics']",PMC4845643,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00046-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Jun;11 Suppl 1:S17-24. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.031.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with a multitude of auto-immune paraneoplastic syndromes. Data on LCV in association with CLL is restricted to isolated case reports,(3,4) none of which had systemic LCV. We present a unique case of fatal paraneoplastic, systemic LCV as an initial presentation of CLL in an elderly male with multiple co-morbidities. CASE: A 71-year-old man presented with a palpable, symmetric, purpuric rash on the lower extremities and an absolute lymphocytosis (white blood cell count 26.9; 23% lymphocytes). His co-morbidities included coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and new critical aortic stenosis. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood demonstrated an abnormal population of B-cells, positive for CD5, CD19, and CD23, consistent with CLL. The skin biopsy specimen revealed neutrophilic inflammation in vessel walls indicative of LCV. Acute renal failure (creatinine 2 mg/dL), urinary red cell casts, and hypocomplementemia were concerning for a systemic vasculitis. The antinuclear antibody, cryoglobulin titer, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, serum protein electrophoresis, viral serologies were negative. On hospital day 6, he developed acute hepatocellular injury and acute respiratory failure. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis was begun for worsening acidemia and hyperkalemia. Two days later he became obtunded on hospital day 8 and had an elevated lactic acid level with generalized abdominal tenderness worrisome for bowel ischemia. The same day he needed intubation with cardiopulmonary resuscitation for a brief episode of asystole. Despite aggressive treatment with high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis, he suffered worsening renal failure and shock. His family sought withdrawal of care on hospital day 11. Autopsy revealed diffuse LCV of the stomach, distal ileum, integument and alveoli with petechial hemorrhages, fibrin thrombi, and gangrenous patchy necrosis. CONCLUSION: Paraneoplastic LCV is a rare syndrome and seldom occurs in association with CLL. This is the first reported case of fatal systemic paraneoplastic LCV from B-cell CLL. Dermatologic involvement is universal with LCV, and may portend systemic disease. More data on its pathogenesis in CLL is warranted.","['Lulla, Premal', 'Bandeali, Salman', 'Baker, Kelty']","['Lulla P', 'Bandeali S', 'Baker K']","['Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77054, USA. lulla@bcm.tmc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20110429,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Vasculitis, Leukocytoclastic, Cutaneous/diagnosis/*pathology']",,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00044-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Jun;11 Suppl 1:S14-6. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.03.030.

This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective pilot project compared races and leukemia subtypes among patients in the ASP, ESP, and PSP. METHODS: Fifty-five adult patients from our National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center were individually interviewed. Subjects were asked about multiple areas of survivorship including their social support system, distress level, and quality of life. RESULTS: Demographics of the 55 patients are acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 10; acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), 9; chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 23; and chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), 13. There were 23 females and 32 males, 30 Hispanics, 20 Caucasians, and 5 African-Americans. Twenty-two patients were in the ASP, 21 in the ESP, and 12 in the PSP. AML patients experienced the most physical, family, emotional, and spiritual problems (78%, 33%, 56%, and 22%, respectively). AML patients also had the highest distress level with a mean score of 5.8 (SD 1.7), compared to ALL (1.8), CLL (3.2), and CML (5.1) (P value < .001). Among all the phases of survivorship, the ASP had the highest distress level (mean, 4.8) and the worst quality of life (mean, 2.3). The ASP patients had the most treatment for depression (38%). When comparing races, African Americans and Hispanics (40% and 37%, respectively) were unable to cope with finances, compared to Caucasians (5%), (P value .016). Fear of recurrence was higher in Hispanics (67%), compared to African Americans (40%) and Caucasians (30%) (P value .031). Hispanics (40%) experienced more problems with housing, insurance, and work, as compared to African Americans (20%) and Caucasians (10%) (P value .047). CONCLUSION: This study addresses the perceptions and beliefs of leukemia survivors and found that AML and minority patients need further investigation on various aspects of quality of life.","['Pandya, Devesh M', 'Patel, Sukeshi', 'Ketchum, Norma S', 'Pollock, Brad H', 'Padmanabhan, Swaminathan']","['Pandya DM', 'Patel S', 'Ketchum NS', 'Pollock BH', 'Padmanabhan S']","['University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, San Antonio, TX 78229-3900, USA. pandyad21@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,IM,"['African Americans', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*ethnology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Whites']",,2011/11/09 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00118-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.05.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Jun;11 Suppl 1:S114-8. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.05.036.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011.

For patients whose CML does not respond to standard-dose imatinib therapy, increasing the imatinib dose is a second-line option. However, high-dose imatinib is not an appropriate approach for patients experiencing drug toxicity, and there remain questions concerning the durability of responses achieved with this strategy. Alternative second-line options include the newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as dasatinib and nilotinib. A substantial amount of long-term data for these agents is available. Although both are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCR-ABL mutational status. The superiority of second-generation TKIs over imatinib in newly diagnosed disease has been recognized as well. They induce high and rapid rates of cytogenetic and molecular response, with less progression to advanced forms of disease in comparison with imatinib. Several investigational agents specific for those patients with the T315I mutation remain under evaluation. The future of CML therapy may include early use of these potent agents to help more patients achieve molecular remission and potentially be a path to a CML cure.","['Cornelison, A Megan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Cornelison AM', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J', 'Jabbour E']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Differences at the genetic level and potentially associated changes in the expression and/or function of specific drug metabolizing enzymes appear to play an important role in this inter-individual susceptibility. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be easily assessed in order to further investigate and explain inter-individual differences as to Ara-C associated toxicity and response to treatment. In this retrospective study we correlated five SNPs within the NME1 promoter with drug-induced toxicity, disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) in 360 Caucasian patients suffering from AML. A significant correlation between SNPs and disease-free survival or overall survival was not found. For the NME1 promoter SNP - 835 C/T (rs2302254) we identified a significant correlation between low platelet counts and better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (grade 3/4). An increased risk of neurotoxicity was identified for the NME1 promoter SNP - 835 C/T (rs2302254) genotype T_T. Multivariate analyses also showed that these variables were independent risk factors. Ara-C causes neuronal cell death by introduction of apoptosis with reactive oxygen species, causing oxidative DNA damage and initiating the p53-dependent apoptotic program. Recent data show that oral administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine for 14 days is able to prevent Ara-C induced behavioral deficits and cellular alterations of the adult cerebellum in a rat model.","['Braunagel, Dominic', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Dransfeld, Christian-Lars', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Mahlknecht, Ulrich']","['Braunagel D', 'Schaich M', 'Kramer M', 'Dransfeld CL', 'Ehninger G', 'Mahlknecht U']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Saarland University Medical Center, Homburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111207,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases/*genetics', 'Neurons/pathology', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*etiology', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.635862 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 May;53(5):952-7. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.635862.

We found a high frequency of SR in our group of patients (18/35 patients, 51%), mostly related to febrile neutropenia and concomitant treatment with penicillins/trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ). The lymphocyte count was low in all patients with SR. We conclude that patients with HCL treated with cladribine have an increased rate of drug hypersensitivity, possibly due to T-cell imbalance induced by cladribine.

Interestingly, the RT of the long terminal repeat retrotransposon Tf1 has an NTA activity that is substantially higher than that of HIV-1 or murine leukemia virus RTs. By performing steady state kinetics, we found that the differences between the NTA activities of Tf1 and HIV-1 RTs can be explained by the substantially lower K(M) value for the incoming dNTP of Tf1 RT (while the differences between the apparent k(cat) values of these two RTs are relatively small). Furthermore, the K(M) values, calculated for both RTs with the same dNTP, are much lower for the template-dependent synthesis (TDS) than those of NTA. However, TDS of HIV-1 RT is higher than that of Tf1 RT. The overall relative order of the apparent k(cat)/K(M) values for dATP is: HIV-1 RT (TDS) > Tf1 RT (TDS) >> Tf1 RT (NTA) > HIV-1 RT (NTA). Under the employed conditions, Tf1 RT can add up to seven nucleotides to the blunt-ended substrate, while the other RTs add mostly a single nucleotide. The NTA activity of Tf1 RT is restricted to DNA primers. Furthermore, the NTA activity of Tf1 and HIV-1 RTs is suppressed by ATP, as it competes with the incoming dATP (although ATP is not incorporated by the NTA activity of the RTs). The unusually high NTA activity of Tf1 RT can explain why, after completing cDNA synthesis, the in vivo generated Tf1 cDNA has relatively long extra sequences beyond the highly conserved CA at its 3'-ends.","['Oz-Gleenberg, Iris', 'Herzig, Eytan', 'Hizi, Amnon']","['Oz-Gleenberg I', 'Herzig E', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111125,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'DNA Primers', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics']",,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08406.x [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2012 Jan;279(1):142-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08406.x.

Three VDR gene polymorphisms (BsmI G>A, ApaI G>T, and TaqI T>C) were genotyped in 147 patients who underwent HLA-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT. Frequencies of infection, graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared according to genotypes and haplotypes. Infection and acute GVHD had trends to be less frequent in patients with ApaI TT genotype than non-TT genotypes (p = 0.061 and p = 0.059, respectively). For TaqI genotypes, there were no statistical differences in frequency of infection and acute GVHD (p = 0.84 and p = 0.30, respectively), but TC genotype was associated with longer OS and DFS than TT genotype (p = 0.022 and p = 0.038, respectively). In the ApaI-TaqI haplotype analysis, patients with TC haplotype had significantly longer OS and DFS than those without TC haplotype (p = 0.022 and p = 0.038, respectively). In multivariable analysis, TaqI genotype and ApaI-TaqI haplotype of recipients were independent prognostic factors for both OS and DFS.

Although low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are necessary for the maintenance of stem cells, increased ROS levels initiate differentiation and cell damage. We and others have previously demonstrated that heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a stress response protein with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, plays critical protective functions in cardiovascular and other diseases. However, the functions of HO-1 in ESCs remain to be elucidated. Our goal was to investigate the roles of HO-1 in ESC survival and differentiation. Due to the lack of HO-1-deficient ESCs, we used Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 retroviruses to reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of different HO-1 genotypes. These iPS-HO-1 cells exhibited characteristics of mouse ESCs (mESCs) and formed teratomas that were composed of cell types of all 3 germ layers after injected into severe combined immunodeficiency mice. In response to oxidant stress, iPS-HO-1(-/-) cells accumulated higher levels of intracellular ROS compared with D3 mESCs or iPS-HO-1(+/+) cells and were more prone to oxidant-induced cell death. Spontaneous differentiation experiments revealed that Oct4 levels were significantly lower in iPS-HO-1(-/-) cells after leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal and removal of feeders. Further, during the course of spontaneous differentiation, iPS-HO-1(-/-) cells had enhanced Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which has been linked to ESC differentiation. By the loss-of-function approach using iPS-HO-1(-/-) cells, our results demonstrate that a lack of HO-1 renders iPS cells more prone to oxidative stress-induced cell death and differentiation.","['Lin, Chen-Yu', 'Peng, Chiu-Ying', 'Huang, Tzu-Ting', 'Wu, Meng-Ling', 'Lai, Yan-Liang', 'Peng, David H', 'Chen, Pei-Feng', 'Chen, Hsin-Fu', 'Yen, Betty Linju', 'Wu, Kenneth K', 'Yet, Shaw-Fang']","['Lin CY', 'Peng CY', 'Huang TT', 'Wu ML', 'Lai YL', 'Peng DH', 'Chen PF', 'Chen HF', 'Yen BL', 'Wu KK', 'Yet SF']","['Institute of Cellular and System Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Miaoli County, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111216,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*deficiency/genetics', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/enzymology/*physiology/transplantation', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/enzymology/pathology', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Teratoma/enzymology/pathology']",PMC3376464,2011/11/01 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2011/11/01 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2011.0304 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2012 Jul 1;21(10):1675-87. doi: 10.1089/scd.2011.0304.

During the 1996-2010 period, eleven patients were treated at our institution with splenic irradiation. They received 16 courses of fractionated radiotherapy. There were six patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, four with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and one patient with myelofibrosis. The median of the dose received was 7 Gy, while the median of dose received per fraction was 1 Gy. Both parallel opposed anterior-posterior fields and tangential fields were used. Due to the clinical target volume shrinkage, the treatment field was reduced in 44% of courses. Of the courses initiated for symptom control, 71% resulted in effective palliation, whereas of the courses started to treat hematologic sequels of hypersplenism 50% produced desirable effects.

BA-activated FXR induces hepatic expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP), which in turn suppresses expression of BA synthesis genes, Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1. Thus, MLL3(Delta/Delta) mice that express a catalytically inactive mutant form of MLL3 display increased BA levels. Recently, we have discovered a distinct regulatory pathway for BA homeostasis, in which p53 independently up-regulates SHP expression in the liver. Here, we show that the MLL3 complex is also essential for p53 transactivation of SHP. Although activated p53 signaling in MLL3(+/+) mice results in decreased BA levels through hepatic up-regulation of SHP, these changes are abolished in MLL3(Delta/Delta) mice. For both HepG2 cells and mouse liver, we also demonstrate that p53 directs the recruitment of different components of the MLL3 complex to the p53-response elements of SHP and that p53-dependent H3-lysine-4-trimethylation of SHP requires MLL3. From these results, we conclude that both FXR- and p53-dependent regulatory pathways for SHP expression in BA homeostasis require the MLL3 complex; thus, the MLL3 complex is likely a master regulator of BA homeostasis. Using a common coregulator complex for multiple transcription factors, which independently control expression of the same gene, might be a prevalent theme in gene regulation and may also play critical roles in assigning a specific biological function to a coregulator complex.","['Kim, Dae-Hwan', 'Kim, Juhee', 'Lee, Jae W']","['Kim DH', 'Kim J', 'Lee JW']","['Neuroscience Section, Pape Family Pediatric Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239-3098, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK064678/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK064678/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111027,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,IM,"['Animals', 'Bile Acids and Salts/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin', 'Gene Expression', 'Hep G2 Cells', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Steroid 12-alpha-Hydroxylase/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC3231838,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2011-1198 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2011-1198 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2011 Dec;25(12):2076-83. doi: 10.1210/me.2011-1198.

Erythroid cells expressing SFFV gp55 proliferate in the absence of their normal regulator, erythropoietin, because of the interaction among the viral envelope protein, the erythropoietin receptor, and a short form of the receptor tyrosine kinase Stk (sf-Stk). This leads to constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways. Our previous studies showed that sf-Stk interacts with SFFV gp55, forming disulfide-linked complexes. This covalent interaction, along with other noncovalent interactions with SFFV-gp55, results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of sf-Stk and rodent fibroblast transformation. Here, we determined the precise amino acid region within sf-Stk that contributes to fibroblast transformation by the polycythemia-inducing (SFFV-P) and the anemia-inducing (SFFV-A) strains of SFFV. Sf-Stk deletion mutants showed different transforming abilities in fibroblasts infected with SFFV-P and SFFV-A, although the N-terminal extracellular domain of sf-Stk was essential for fibroblast transformation by both viruses. Point mutations of sf-Stk indicated that cysteine 19 was critical for fibroblast transformation by SFFV-P, although all four cysteines (8, 19, 37 and 42) appeared to be important for fibroblast transformation by both SFFV-P and SFFV-A. Mutation of sf-Stk cysteine 19 abolished its ability to form dimers with SFFV-P and SFFV-A gp55. These results suggest that the interaction between sf-Stk and the envelope proteins of the polycythemia- and anemia-inducing variants of SFFV is architecturally different.","['Umehara, Daigo', 'Kawamura, Maki', 'Odahara, Yuka', 'Watanabe, Shinya', 'Hanson, Charlotte', 'Ruscetti, Sandra', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Umehara D', 'Kawamura M', 'Odahara Y', 'Watanabe S', 'Hanson C', 'Ruscetti S', 'Nishigaki K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yoshida, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],['ZIA BC005657/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111205,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Polycythemia/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6993179,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.27330 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Sep 1;131(5):1083-94. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27330.

PML is an essential component of sub-nuclear structures called PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, Pin1, binds and targets PML for degradation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying Pin1-mediated PML degradation, we aimed to identify one or more factors that promote PML phosphorylation. Here we show that treatment with U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK2 upstream kinases MEK1/2, leads to an increase in PML protein accumulation and an inhibition of the interaction between Pin1 and PML in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Consistent with this observation, phosphorylated ERK2 partially co-localized with PML NBs. Although U0126 up-regulated exogenous wild-type PML levels, it did not have an effect on the steady-state level of a mutant form of PML that is defective in binding Pin1. In addition, exogenous wild-type, but not Pin1 binding-defective PML protein expression levels were decreased by overexpression of ERK2. In contrast, knockdown of ERK2 by siRNA resulted in an increase in PML protein levels and an increase in the formation of PML NBs. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we identified Ser-403 and Ser-505 as the ERK2 targets that promote Pin1-mediated PML degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that EGF induced activation of ERK and interaction between PML and phosphorylated ERK resulting in a decrease in PML protein levels. Taken together, our results support a model in which Pin1 promotes PML degradation in an ERK2-dependent manner.","['Lim, Jun Hee', 'Liu, Yu', 'Reineke, Erin', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Lim JH', 'Liu Y', 'Reineke E', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4935, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK078965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL093269/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL093269/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111027,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*Proteolysis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3248013,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)65491-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.289512 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Dec 30;286(52):44403-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.289512.

However, antigens implicated in the immune responses have not yet been sufficiently identified. Therefore, in this report, we compiled and characterized a list of 165 antigens associated with CML (CML-Ag165) and analyzed the expression of the corresponding genes in CML phases, subpopulations of leukemic cells, and CML-derived cell lines using available datasets from microarray transcriptional-profiling studies. From the CML-Ag165 list, we selected antigens most suitable for vaccine development and evaluated their appropriate characteristics.","['Smahel, Michal']",['Smahel M'],"['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Department of Experimental Virology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, Prague 2, Czech Republic. smahel@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111028,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-1126-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Dec;60(12):1655-68. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-1126-z.

We used BH3 profiling to measure priming in tumor cells from patients with multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemia, and ovarian cancer. This assay measures mitochondrial response to peptides derived from proapoptotic BH3 domains of proteins critical for death signaling to mitochondria.

However, little is known about the molecular effect of azacitidine in low-risk MDS or the functional mechanisms linked with azacitidine effect on PI-PLCbeta1 promoter. In the present study, we further investigated the role of epigenetic regulation of PI-PLCbeta1, mainly focusing on the structure of the PI-PLCbeta1 promoter. We first examined the effect of azacitidine on PI-PLCbeta1 promoter methylation and gene expression in low-risk MDS. Moreover, we studied the expression of key molecules associated with the nuclear inositide signaling pathways, such as cyclin D3. By applying a chromatin immunoprecipitation method, we also studied the correlation between the demethylating effect of azacitidine and the degree of recruitment to PI-PLCbeta1 promoter of some transcription factors implicated in hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as of the methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins, which specifically interact with methylated DNA. Taken together, our results hint at a specific involvement of PI-PLCbeta1 in epigenetic mechanisms, and are particularly consistent with the hypothesis of a role for PI-PLCbeta1 in azacitidine-induced myeloid differentiation.","['Follo, M Y', 'Russo, D', 'Finelli, C', 'Mongiorgi, S', 'Clissa, C', 'Fili, C', 'Colombi, C', 'Gobbi, M', 'Manzoli, L', 'Piazzi, M', 'Martelli, A M', 'Cocco, L']","['Follo MY', 'Russo D', 'Finelli C', 'Mongiorgi S', 'Clissa C', 'Fili C', 'Colombi C', 'Gobbi M', 'Manzoli L', 'Piazzi M', 'Martelli AM', 'Cocco L']","['Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111028,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase C beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Signal Transduction']",,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011300 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.300 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):943-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.300.

The relative activity of Bcr-Abl and the expression levels of antiapoptotic proteins in proliferating and quiescent CD34(+) BC CML progenitor cells and the effects of targeting antiapoptotic proteins in these cells are unknown. Here we report higher levels of p-CrkL in quiescent than in proliferating CD34(+) progenitor cells and comparable expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP in the two populations in BC CML. Inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL by ABT-737 in cells from patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant BC CML promoted apoptosis in quiescent CD34(+) progenitor cells with an efficacy similar to that in proliferating cells. Combination of ABT-737 with imatinib (which decreases Mcl-1 levels) or triptolide (which decreases Mcl-1 and XIAP) synergistically induced death of both proliferating and quiescent CD34(+) progenitor cells obtained from TKI-resistant BC CML patients.

Because the drug-resistance of leukemia cells is partly dependent on cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche, EVI1 may be involved in cell cycle regulation in leukemia cells. As a candidate regulator of the cell cycle in leukemia cells with high EVI1 expression (EVI1(high)), we analyzed angiopoietin1 (Ang1), which is a down-regulated gene in EVI1-deficient mice and is involved in the quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells. The results of real-time PCR analyses showed that Ang1 is highly expressed in leukemia cell lines and primary AML cells with EVI1(high) expression. Introduction of shRNA against EVI1 into EVI1(high) leukemia cells down-regulated Ang1 expression. Moreover, knockdown of Ang1 in EVI1(high) leukemia cells promoted cell cycle progression and down-regulated the CDK inhibitor p18 (INK4c). Treatment with a decoy Tie2/Fc protein also down-regulated the expression of p18. These results suggest that Ang1/Tie2 signaling may suppress cell cycle progression via maintenance of G0/G1 phase through up-regulation of p18 expression. This mechanism may help to maintain EVI1(high) leukemia cells in the bone marrow niche and promote resistance to anti-cancer drugs.","['Ichihara, Emi', 'Kaneda, Kazuko', 'Saito, Yusuke', 'Yamakawa, Norio', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Ichihara E', 'Kaneda K', 'Saito Y', 'Yamakawa N', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Angiopoietin-1/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)01858-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.061 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Dec 16;416(3-4):239-45. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.061.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of opioid receptors would enhance the survival of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) upon exposure to an injury stimulus. METHODS AND RESULTS: MSCs were obtained from rat bone marrow and cultured in basal DMEM cell culture medium. Delta-opioid receptor (DOR) was present in MSCs as examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunochemistry. Activation of DOR with 5micromol/L SNC80 (DOR agonist) for 24h significantly enhanced MSC viability upon exposure to 5microg/ml actinomycin D as determined by TUNEL and MTT assays. The cytoprotection was abolished with 20micromol/L naltrindole hydrochloride (a DOR antagonist). Treatment of the cells with 1.5micromol/L chelerythrine (protein kinase C inhibitor) and 1.25micromol/L WP1066 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor) blocked SNC80-induced cytoprotection. Furthermore, treatment of the cells with chelerythrine also blocked STAT3-phosphorylation and Mcl-1 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results indicate that DOR plays a critical role in MSC survival upon exposure to actinomycin D through activation of protein kinase C and its downstream signaling molecules STAT3 and Mcl-1. DOR may be a novel therapeutic target for stem cell survival during cell-based therapy.","['Higuchi, Sayaka', 'Ii, Masaaki', 'Zhu, Ping', 'Ashraf, Muhammad']","['Higuchi S', 'Ii M', 'Zhu P', 'Ashraf M']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.']",['eng'],"['HL087246/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL093575/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37HL074272/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111028,Japan,Circ J,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,101137683,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Models, Animal', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Naltrexone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Receptors, Opioid, delta/drug effects/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/07/04 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-11-0309 [pii]', '10.1253/circj.cj-11-0309 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ J. 2012;76(1):204-12. doi: 10.1253/circj.cj-11-0309.

METHODS: Rates estimated from smooth function age-period-cohort modelling of cancer incidence data from Great Britain 1975 to 2007 are extrapolated to 2030 and applied to UK population projections. Prostate and breast cancer projections take into account the effect of screening. RESULTS: Overall rates of cancer are projected to be stable over the next 20 years, but this masks individual changes. In both sexes, age-standardised rates of cancers of the stomach, larynx, bladder and leukaemia are projected to fall by >/=1% per year, whereas cancers of the lip, mouth and pharynx (ICD-10 C00-C14) and melanoma are projected to increase by >/=1% per year. The growing and aging populations will have a substantial impact: numbers of cancers in men and women are projected to increase by 55% (from 149,169 to 231,026) and 35% (from 148,716 to 200,929), respectively, between 2007 and 2030.

CONCLUSION: Without new initiatives for smoking and obesity reduction, the number of cancers in the United Kingdom will increase substantially reflecting the growing and aging populations.","['Mistry, M', 'Parkin, D M', 'Ahmad, A S', 'Sasieni, P']","['Mistry M', 'Parkin DM', 'Ahmad AS', 'Sasieni P']","['Centre for Cancer Prevention, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts & The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['C569/10404/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C8162/A10406/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111027,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3242594,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2011430 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.430 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2011 Nov 22;105(11):1795-803. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.430.

This work presents new evidence on how sonoporation may lead to antiproliferation effects including cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis through disrupting various cell signaling pathways. Our findings were obtained from sonoporation experiments conducted on HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells (with 1% v/v microbubbles; 1 MHz ultrasound; 0.3 or 0.5MPa peak negative pressure; 10% duty cycle; 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency; 1 min exposure period). Membrane resealing in these sonoporated cells was first verified using scanning electron microscopy. Time-lapse flow cytometry analysis of cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contents was then performed at four post-sonoporation time points (4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h). Results indicate that an increasing trend in the apoptotic cell population can be observed for at least 12 h after sonoporation, whilst viable sonoporated cells are found to temporarily accumulate in the G(2)/M (gap-2/mitosis) phase of the cell cycle. Further analysis using western blotting reveals that sonoporation-induced apoptosis involves cleavage of poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) proteins: a pro-apoptotic hallmark related to loss of DNA repair functionality. Also, mitochondrial signaling seems to have taken part in triggering this cellular event as the expression of two complementary regulators for mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic molecules, Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) and Bax (Bcl-2-associated X), are seen to be imbalanced in sonoporated cells. Furthermore, sonoporation is found to induce cell-cycle arrest through perturbing the expression of various cyclin and Cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase) checkpoint proteins that play an enabling role in cell-cycle progression. These bioeffects should be taken into account when using sonoporation for therapeutic purposes.","['Zhong, Wenjing', 'Sit, Wai Hung', 'Wan, Jennifer M F', 'Yu, Alfred C H']","['Zhong W', 'Sit WH', 'Wan JM', 'Yu AC']","['Medical Engineering Program, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111026,England,Ultrasound Med Biol,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,0410553,IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electroporation/*methods', '*High-Energy Shock Waves', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Sonication']",,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-5629(11)01366-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Ultrasound Med Biol. 2011 Dec;37(12):2149-59. doi: 10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.09.012.

Interestingly, the cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor p53 has been reported to support reproduction in mice by regulating the expression of the leukemia inhibitory factor gene in the maternal endometrium. However, in humans the hormonal system orchestrating successful pregnancy is considerably different from rodents. Particularly, the primate-specific dimeric glycoprotein hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is essential for blastocyst implantation and maintenance of early human pregnancy. Here we provide evidence that p53 selectively induces expression of the hCGbeta7 (CGB7) gene. None of the other CGB genes was found to be regulated by p53. We show that expression of the CGB7 gene is upregulated upon p53 induction in human HFF, HCT116 and DLD1 cells as well as in cell preparations enriched in human primary first-trimester trophoblasts. The increase in CGB7 levels upon doxorubicin treatment is lost after siRNA-directed knockdown of p53. Furthermore, we describe CGB7 as a direct transcriptional target gene of p53 by identifying a p53-responsive element in the CGB7 promoter using reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitations. With these results we provide a new link between p53 transcriptional activity and human reproduction.","['Sohr, Sindy', 'Engeland, Kurt']","['Sohr S', 'Engeland K']","['Molecular Oncology, Medical School, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111101,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human/*genetics/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA Interference', 'Response Elements', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Trophoblasts/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC3266010,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['17946 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.21.17946 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Nov 1;10(21):3758-67. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.21.17946.

Characteristic genomic alterations in HL60RG cells were identified including uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 1, and hemizygous deletion in 10p and 11p. However, no such defects were observed in HL60 cells. Changes in gene expression in HL60RG cells were determined using expression arrays (Affymetrix GeneChip, HU133A). Candidate genes associated with the rapid growth of HL60RG cells were identified. Two tumor necrosis factor receptors, TNFRSF1B (type II tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor) and TNFRSF8 (also known as a tumor marker CD30), which are adjacently located on chromosome 1 showed opposing changes in gene expression in HL60RG cells-over-expression of TNFRSF8 and repression of TNFRSF1B. Differences in the DNA methylation status in the transcriptional regulatory regions of both genes between HL60 and HL60RG was detected by a methylation-specific PCR assay.

Little literature is available on Asian patients. AIMS: The aim of this study is to report a single institution experience of Asian patients who developed acute leukaemia after being diagnosed and treated for Ph chromosome-negative MPDs, and to compare the findings of this series with similar studies from the literature. METHODS: Patients were recruited from the MPD registry of Singapore General Hospital, Department of Hematology. Clinical data including treatment modalities and duration of use in myeloproliferative phase, latency to LT, characteristics of leukaemia, chemotherapy administered and survival after LT were examined. RESULTS: Over a 29-year period from 1980 to 2009, there were 22 Asian patients with LT of Ph chromosome-negative MPD of which four had polycythaemia vera (PV), nine had essential thrombocythaemia (ET), seven had myelofibrosis (MF) and two had unspecified MPD at diagnosis. Primary treatment modality was Hydroxyurea (HU) during MPD phase. Median latency to LT was 14 years for PV, 10 years for ET and 1 year for MF. Median age at LT diagnosis was 67.5 years. Nine patients had complex cytogenetics, with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7 being common. Overall, median survival was 2 months after LT. Eight patients who received induction chemotherapy had a median survival of 2.5 months. Survival was independent of MPD type and treatment administered. None received stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: LT of Ph chromosome-negative MPD is rare and uniformly fatal. Despite chemotherapy, survival was poor, and patients succumbed to refractory disease and infections. Asian patients did not have a more favourable outcome. It remains to be investigated whether upfront stem cell transplant may be a treatment option.","['Cherian, R', 'Wong, G C']","['Cherian R', 'Wong GC']","['Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore. robinjipmer@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,IM,"['Aged', 'Asians/*ethnology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*ethnology/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries']",,2011/10/29 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02629.x [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2012 May;42(5):513-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02629.x.,,,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

The rearrangements t(8;21) and inv(16) involve the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 ( AML1-ETO ) and CBFB/MYH11 genes, respectively. These 2 subtypes are categorized as AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, and hence the cytogenetic fusion transcripts are considered diagnostic of acute leukemia even when the marrow blast count is less than 20%. The t(8;21) and inv(16) subtypes of AML have been usually grouped and reported together in clinical studies; however, recent studies have demonstrated genetic, clinical, and prognostic differences, supporting the notion that they represent 2 distinct biologic and clinical entities.

However, it is necessary to identify ideal adult stem cells for transplantation and explore mechanisms of the transplanted cells in improving cardiac functions after MI. In this study, a population of embryonic-like stem cells (ELSCs) was isolated from rat bone marrow. The cells express pluripotent stem cell transcriptional factors and present high proliferative activity on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder. ELSCs retain clonal expansion and may form embryoid-like bodies in soft agarose containing leukemia inhibitory factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The cells of the embryoid-like bodies can differentiate into the cells from 3 germ layers. Under induction, the cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. In MI models of female rats, the transplantation of preinduced ELSCs of male rats reduce scar area and improve cardiac function significantly. Comparing with marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and ELSCs without induction, effects of the preinduced ELSCs on myocardial repair and improvement of cardiac function are greater. Survival of the transplanted cells in the peri-infarcted and infarcted regions was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Y chromosome-positive cells may differentiate toward cardiomyocytes and express cTnT and Cx43. Cx43 expression was observed at conjunction of Y chromosome-positive cells and recipient cardiomyocytes. Some Y chromosome-positive cells express CD31 and incorporate into the microvessels in the infarcted tissue. These results suggest that a population of ELSCs resides in rat bone marrow and display similar biological characteristics of ESCs. ELSCs can differentiate into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and contribute to cardiomyogenesis and angiogenesis in vivo. Cardiac function after MI may be significantly improved with transplantation of the preinduced ELSCs. Therefore, ELSCs are novel seed cells for stem cell transplantation in regenerative medicine.","['Wu, Jin-Hong', 'Wang, Hai-Jie', 'Tan, Yu-Zhen', 'Li, Zhi-Hua']","['Wu JH', 'Wang HJ', 'Tan YZ', 'Li ZH']","['Department of Anatomy, Histology, and Embryology, Shanghai Medical School of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111027,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*transplantation/ultrastructure', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Feeder Cells/cytology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Germ Layers/metabolism', 'Heart Function Tests', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myocardial Infarction/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Myocardium/*pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Ventricular Function, Left', '*Wound Healing']",,2011/10/29 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2011/10/29 06:00'],"['2011/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2011.0280 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2012 May 20;21(8):1367-79. doi: 10.1089/scd.2011.0280.

Scattered collections of fungal organisms were noted near the eccrine glands. The periodic acid Schiff with diastase stain showed the presence of variable sized spores and hyphae with some acute angle branching.

We characterized the potency and breadth of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in 64 subjects chronically infected with HIV-2 against three primary HIV-2 strains: HIV-2(7312A), HIV-2(ST), and HIV-2(UC1). Surprisingly, we observed in a single-cycle JC53bl-13/TZM-bl virus entry assay median reciprocal 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) NAb titers of 1.7 x 10(5), 2.8 x 10(4), and 3.3 x 10(4), respectively. A subset of 5 patient plasma samples tested against a larger panel of 17 HIV-2 strains where the extracellular gp160 domain was substituted into the HIV-2(7312A) proviral backbone showed potent neutralization of all but 4 viruses. The specificity of antibody neutralization was confirmed using IgG purified from patient plasma, HIV-2 Envs cloned by single-genome amplification, viruses grown in human CD4(+) T cells and tested for neutralization sensitivity on human CD4(+) T target cells, and, as negative controls, env-minus viruses pseudotyped with HIV-1, vesicular stomatitis virus, or murine leukemia virus Env glycoproteins. Human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for HIV-2 V3 (6.10F), V4 (1.7A), CD4 binding site (CD4bs; 6.10B), CD4 induced (CD4i; 1.4H), and membrane-proximal external region (MPER; 4E10) epitopes potently neutralized the majority of 32 HIV-2 strains bearing Envs from 13 subjects. Patient antibodies competed with V3, V4, and CD4bs MAbs for binding to monomeric HIV-2 gp120 at titers that correlated significantly with NAb titers. HIV-2 MPER antibodies did not contribute to neutralization breadth or potency. These findings indicate that HIV-2 Env is highly immunogenic in natural infection, that high-titer broadly neutralizing antibodies are commonly elicited, and that unlike HIV-1, native HIV-2 Env trimers expose multiple broadly cross-reactive epitopes readily accessible to NAbs.","['Kong, Rui', 'Li, Hui', 'Bibollet-Ruche, Frederic', 'Decker, Julie M', 'Zheng, Natalie N', 'Gottlieb, Geoffrey S', 'Kiviat, Nancy B', 'Sow, Papa Salif', 'Georgiev, Ivelin', 'Hahn, Beatrice H', 'Kwong, Peter D', 'Robinson, James E', 'Shaw, George M']","['Kong R', 'Li H', 'Bibollet-Ruche F', 'Decker JM', 'Zheng NN', 'Gottlieb GS', 'Kiviat NB', 'Sow PS', 'Georgiev I', 'Hahn BH', 'Kwong PD', 'Robinson JE', 'Shaw GM']","['Departments of Microbiology and Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI094604/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 AI087383/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI067854/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI060466/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI88564/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI87383/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI067854/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI087383/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI088564/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI67854/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111026,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*immunology', 'Antibody Formation', 'Cell Line', 'HIV Antibodies/*immunology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp160/genetics/immunology', 'HIV Infections/*immunology/virology', 'HIV-1/classification/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'HIV-2/classification/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Alignment']",PMC3255805,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/02/23 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06155-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06155-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Jan;86(2):947-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06155-11.

Our groups recently showed that XMRV was created through recombination between two endogenous murine retroviruses, PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2, during the passaging of a prostate tumor xenograft in nude mice. Here, multiple approaches that led to the identification of PreXMRV-2, as well as the distribution of both parental proviruses among different mouse species, are described. The chromosomal loci of both proviruses were determined in the mouse genome, and integration site information was used to analyze the distribution of both proviruses in 48 laboratory mouse strains and 46 wild-derived strains. The strain distributions of PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 are quite different, the former being found predominantly in Asian mice and the latter in European mice, making it unlikely that the two XMRV ancestors could have recombined independently in the wild to generate an infectious virus. XMRV was not present in any of the mouse strains tested, and among the wild-derived mouse strains analyzed, not a single mouse carried both parental proviruses. Interestingly, PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 were found together in three laboratory strains, Hsd nude, NU/NU, and C57BR/cd, consistent with previous data that the recombination event that led to the generation of XMRV could have occurred only in the laboratory. The three laboratory strains carried the Xpr1(n) receptor variant nonpermissive to XMRV and xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV) infection, suggesting that the xenografted human tumor cells were required for the resulting XMRV recombinant to infect and propagate.","['Cingoz, Oya', 'Paprotka, Tobias', 'Delviks-Frankenberry, Krista A', 'Wildt, Sheryl', 'Hu, Wei-Shau', 'Pathak, Vinay K', 'Coffin, John M']","['Cingoz O', 'Paprotka T', 'Delviks-Frankenberry KA', 'Wildt S', 'Hu WS', 'Pathak VK', 'Coffin JM']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Genetics Program, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['R37 CA089441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA 089441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20111026,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice/genetics/*virology', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/*genetics/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Virus Integration', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*genetics/isolation & purification/physiology']",PMC3255884,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.06022-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.06022-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Jan;86(1):328-38. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06022-11.

Here, we provide a strategy for deriving virus-specific T cells from CD45RA(-)CD62L(+)CD8(+) central memory T (T(CM)) cells purified from donor blood with clinical grade reagents, and redirect their specificity to the B-cell lineage marker CD19 through lentiviral transfer of a gene encoding a CD19-chimeric Ag receptor (CAR). Virus-specific T(CM) were selectively transduced by exposure to the CD19 CAR lentivirus after peptide stimulation, and bi-specific cells were subsequently enriched to high purity using MHC streptamers. Activation of bi-specific T cells through the CAR or the virus-specific TCR elicited phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules with similar kinetics, and induced comparable cytokine secretion, proliferation, and lytic activity. These studies identify a strategy for tumor-specific therapy with CAR-modified T cells after allo-HSCT, and for comparative studies of CAR and TCR signaling.","['Terakura, Seitaro', 'Yamamoto, Tori N', 'Gardner, Rebecca A', 'Turtle, Cameron J', 'Jensen, Michael C', 'Riddell, Stanley R']","['Terakura S', 'Yamamoto TN', 'Gardner RA', 'Turtle CJ', 'Jensen MC', 'Riddell SR']","['Program in Immunology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA136551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 CA154608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA107399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA107399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111026,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lentivirus/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3251238,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38539-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-366419 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 5;119(1):72-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-366419.

Among older patients, ASXL1 mutations associated with wild-type NPM1 (P < .001), absence of FLT3-internal tandem duplications (P = .002), mutated CEBPA (P = .01), and with inferior complete remission (CR) rate (P = .04), disease-free survival (DFS; P = .03), overall survival (OS; P = .006), and event-free survival (EFS; P = .002). Within the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) genetic categories of older CN-AML, ASXL1 mutations associated with inferior CR rate (P = .02), OS (P < .001), and EFS (P < .001) among ELN Favorable, but not among ELN Intermediate-I patients. Multivariable analyses confirmed associations of ASXL1 mutations with unfavorable CR rate (P = .03), DFS (P < .001), OS (P < .001), and EFS (P < .001) among ELN Favorable patients. We identified an ASXL1 mutation-associated gene-expression signature, but no microRNA-expression signature. This first study of ASXL1 mutations in primary CN-AML demonstrates that ASXL1-mutated older patients, particularly within the ELN Favorable group, have unfavorable outcomes and may be candidates for experimental treatment approaches.","['Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Carter, Thomas H', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Metzeler KH', 'Becker H', 'Maharry K', 'Radmacher MD', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Mrozek K', 'Nicolet D', 'Whitman SP', 'Wu YZ', 'Schwind S', 'Powell BL', 'Carter TH', 'Wetzler M', 'Moore JO', 'Kolitz JE', 'Baer MR', 'Carroll AJ', 'Larson RA', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA129657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111026,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3245212,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40248-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-368225 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 22;118(26):6920-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-368225.

Here, we show, for the first time, that the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) is expressed in platelets and megakaryocytes. SOCE and agonist-induced [Ca2+](i) increase are significantly blunted in platelets from SGK1 knockout mice (sgk1(-/-)). Similarly, Ca2+ -dependent degranulation, integrin alpha(IIb)beta3 activation, phosphatidylserine exposure, aggregation, and in vitro thrombus formation were significantly impaired in sgk1(-/-) platelets, whereas tail bleeding time was not significantly enhanced. Platelet and megakaryocyte Orai1 transcript levels and membrane protein abundance were significantly reduced in sgk1(-/-) mice. In human megakaryoblastic cells (MEG-01), transfection with constitutively active (S422D)SGK1 but not with inactive (K127N)SGK1 significantly enhanced Orai1 expression and SOCE, while effects reversed by the SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394 (1muM). Transfection of MEG-01 cells with (S422D)SGK1 significantly increased phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase alpha/beta and IkappaBalpha resulting in nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB subunit p65. Treatment of (S422D)SGK1-transfected MEG-01 cells with the IkappaB kinase inhibitor BMS-345541 (10muM) abolished SGK1-induced increase of Orai1 expression and SOCE.

Epigenetic deregulation of Wnt modulators leading to aberrant signaling has been reported in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its occurrence in childhood patients with AML and the role of individual modulators are unclear. In this study, we examined SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, and SFRP5 promoter methylation in 83 patients with AML (59 children and 24 adults) and found preferential SFRP1 methylation and mRNA down-regulation in the prognostically favorable subgroup of AML with t(8;21) translocation. Among the 4 genes, SFRP1 methylation independently predicted prolonged event-free and relapse-free survivals in childhood patients with nonacute promyelocytic leukemia with nonadverse cytogenetics. Mechanistically, we further demonstrated that RUNX1-ETO, the t(8;21) fusion product, specifically bound the SFRP1 promoter and repressed its transcription via a consensus RUNX binding site. In t(8;21)-leukemia cells, SFRP1 selectively inhibited canonical Wnt signaling and cellular proliferation that were associated with concomitant down-regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes, including CCND1 and MYC. Taken together, we identified SFRP1 as a transcriptional repression target of the t(8;21) fusion protein and demonstrated a novel mechanism of Wnt activation in a specific subtype of AML.","['Cheng, Chi Keung', 'Li, Libby', 'Cheng, Suk Hang', 'Ng, Kitty', 'Chan, Natalie P H', 'Ip, Rosalina K L', 'Wong, Raymond S M', 'Shing, Matthew M K', 'Li, Chi Kong', 'Ng, Margaret H L']","['Cheng CK', 'Li L', 'Cheng SH', 'Ng K', 'Chan NP', 'Ip RK', 'Wong RS', 'Shing MM', 'Li CK', 'Ng MH']","['Departments of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111026,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'U937 Cells', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40295-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-05-354712 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 15;118(25):6638-48. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-05-354712.

However, flow cytometric detection of ZAP-70 in CLL shows considerable variability and may be of questionable significance because most laboratories cannot correlate their results to clinical outcome or VH mutational data. METHODS: Seventy cases of CLL were evaluated for ZAP-70 using a previously optimized staining procedure and two different methods to eliminate nonspecific background staining. One method, not previously reported, used isotypic control antibodies, where the concentrations were adjusted/optimized so that normal B-cells stained negatively for ZAP-70. The other used ZAP-70 stained peripheral blood B-cells from normal donors. The percentages of ZAP-70 stained CLL cells above the two thresholds were compared. RESULTS: Concentrations of isotypic control antibodies had to be increased from manufacture's recommendations to insure normal B-cells were ZAP-70 negative. ZAP-70 levels among the CLL cases formed a bimodal distribution using the optimized isotypic control threshold, with 30 having low values (0-32% positive) and 40 high values (60-99% positive). In contrast, a continuous distribution was obtained with the ZAP-70 stained B-cell threshold. VH mutational status strongly correlated with the optimized control values as 29/30 low ZAP-70 cases had mutated VH genes and 37/40 high ZAP-70 cases used unmutated VH genes. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an optimized isotypic control threshold could increase the reliability of flow based ZAP-70 detection and correlates well with VH mutational status.","['Preobrazhensky, Sergey N', 'Szankasi, Philippe', 'Bahler, David W']","['Preobrazhensky SN', 'Szankasi P', 'Bahler DW']","['ARUP (Associated Regional and University Pathologists) Institute of Clinical and Experimental Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.']",['eng'],['5R21DE017136/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111026,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

However, the search continues for an optimal reagent set that can identify leukemic blasts with specificity, reproducibility, and sensitivity, at any point during the course of the disease and in every specimen type. METHODS: This study evaluated the diagnostic utility of detecting the intracytoplasmic antigens zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) and Bcl-2 in the distinction between the leukemic blasts of B-LL and hematogones. RESULTS: In comparison with hematogones in reference specimens, significantly higher levels of Bcl-2 were identified in 21 of 23 (91%) B-LL. In particular, Bcl-2 expression was consistently higher in leukemic blasts with bright intensity CD10 expression than the equivalent most immature (CD10 bright intensity) hematogones. As previously reported, Bcl-2 expression was lower in B-LL with BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement, but the fluorescence intensity of this group of specimens was still significantly higher than that seen for hematogones. In contrast, ZAP-70 was expressed at significantly higher levels in only 7 of 23 (30%) B-LL and demonstrated other findings that might limit clinical utility, including differences in the level of ZAP-70 expression during therapy and between blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 over-expression provides a useful tool for the distinction between B-LL and hematogones. In contrast, although further optimization of the ZAP-70 assay might increase the sensitivity of detection, over-expression of ZAP-70 was identified in only a minority of B-LL.","['Craig, Fiona E', 'Monaghan, Sara A', 'Surti, Urvashi', 'Swerdlow, Steven H']","['Craig FE', 'Monaghan SA', 'Surti U', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA. craigfe@upmc.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111026,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Based on our previous studies, we have developed a combined one-tube technology with multiple internal controls to optimize ZAP-70 assessment. METHODS: Forty-eight untreated CLL cases were examined for ZAP-70 expression using a modified 7-color one-tube assay. Normal donor (ND) whole blood is stained with CD3 APC-Cy7 and CD19 APC. In a second tube, patient whole blood is stained with CD5 PE-Cy7, CD19 PerCP-Cy5.5, and CD20 eFluor450. After surface staining and fixation, these two tubes are combined. After saponin permeabilization, the cells were stained with two anti-ZAP-70 clones (1E7.2/AF488 and SBZAP/PE). The results obtained from this modified tube were compared with those obtained concurrently using the non-mixed single sample tubes. Five different methods of ZAP-70 expression analysis were evaluated: percentage positive cells using ND T-cells as a reference; the internal patient T-cell/clone ratio; ND T-cell/clone ratio; clone/ND B-cell ratio; and modified Z-index. RESULT: Overall, the combined patient and ND mix tube performed better than the non-mixed single sample tube. The strongest correlations between ZAP-70 expression and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) mutational status were seen with percentage positive ND T-cell, ND T-cell/clone ratio, and clone/ND B-cell ratio for both 1E7.2 and SBZAP clone (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The modified one tube method combining the ND and patient sample provides highly reliable results that correlate with the IGHV mutational status. This method should be considered as part of the next step in standardization of the ZAP-70 assay in CLL.","['Degheidy, Heba A', 'Venzon, David J', 'Farooqui, Mohammed Z H', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M A', 'Marti, Gerald E']","['Degheidy HA', 'Venzon DJ', 'Farooqui MZ', 'Abbasi F', 'Arthur DC', 'Wilson WH', 'Wiestner A', 'Stetler-Stevenson MA', 'Marti GE']","['Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['ZIA HL002346-06/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20111026,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

It is often assumed that cancer during pregnancy necessitates sacrificing the well-being of the fetus but in most cases appropriate treatment can be offered to the mother without placing the fetus at serious risk. The care of a pregnant woman with cancer involves evaluation of competing maternal and fetal risks and benefits. Although it is rare to administer chemotherapy during pregnancy, the risks depend on the drugs used and the gestational age of the fetus. During the period of organogenesis (4 to 13 wk), administration of cytotoxic drugs carries an increased risk of fetal malformations and fetal loss. Chemotherapy in the second or third trimester is associated with intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, and low birth weight and bone marrow toxicity in many exposed infants.","['Brewer, Molly', 'Kueck, Angela', 'Runowicz, Carolyn D']","['Brewer M', 'Kueck A', 'Runowicz CD']","['Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut, USA. mbrewer@uchc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Obstet Gynecol,Clinical obstetrics and gynecology,0070014,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Breast Feeding', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Fetal Development/*drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters/drug effects']",,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/03/30 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/GRF.0b013e318236e9f9 [doi]', '00003081-201112000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Obstet Gynecol. 2011 Dec;54(4):602-18. doi: 10.1097/GRF.0b013e318236e9f9.,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was made of publications as well as a meta-analysis of the pertinent literature considering proviruses per chromosome and structural and functional characteristics of flanking chromatin regions as variables. The concordance of experts' study was evaluated by Spearman Rho correlation. Publication bias was analysed by funnel plot and the Egger statisgrapher. A fixed effects model was applied according to heterogeneity evaluation to combine the results of integration occurring in coding sequences as well as coding sequences according to their molecular function. RESULTS: The expert concepts' Kappa index was 0.7 and no publication bias was observed. The meta-analysis result was homogeneous (p>0.05). HTLV-1 integration was directed towards several chromosomes' telomeric and subtelomeric regions. The combination of published results in the articles which were analysed supported the hypothesis of integration events being site-directed towards coding regions of the human genome (p<0.05). Moreover, the groups of genes having enzymatic and receptor functions was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results led to concluding that HTLV-I integration in the ATLL cases analysed here was not random but was directed towards regulatory regions. Such results could help to explain the role of some processes involved in leukemogenesis.","['Salcedo-Cifuentes, Mercedes', 'Restrepo, Oscar', 'Garcia-Vallejo, Felipe']","['Salcedo-Cifuentes M', 'Restrepo O', 'Garcia-Vallejo F']","['Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular y Patogenesis, Departamento de Ciencias Fisiologicas, Escuela de Bacteriologia y Laboratorio Clinico, Escuela de Ciencias Basicas, Facultad de Salud, Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia. mercysal2003@yahoo.com']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Colombia,Rev Salud Publica (Bogota),"Revista de salud publica (Bogota, Colombia)",100936348,IM,"['Adult', 'Computational Biology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/genetics/*virology', '*Virus Integration']",,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2010/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0124-00642011000100011 [pii]', '10.1590/s0124-00642011000100011 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Salud Publica (Bogota). 2011 Feb;13(1):129-40. doi: 10.1590/s0124-00642011000100011.,,,,Epidemiologia y bioinformatica en el estudio de la Leucemia Linfoma de Celulas T del Adulto asociada a la infeccion con VLHT-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, using Tax-specific CTL lines with high- and low-functional avidity developed from HLA-A2-transgenic mice, we showed that higher avidity CTLs specific for Tax expressing larger numbers of TCRs and better binding strength to the antigen-HLA-A2 complex are much more efficient at eliminating HTLV-1 infected cells and, in particular, ATL tumor cells with the ability of recognizing a latent level of Tax product detected only with a real-time PCR.

However, the exact role of GJIC in the hematopoietic microenvironment in leukemic cell death and proliferation is not clear. We show here that following transfection with the Cx43 gene, GJIC function was increased between leukemic BMSCs. Furthermore, compared with leukemic cells alone, the proliferation and apoptosis of leukemic cells co-cultured with BMSCs were inhibited, the percentage of G0-phase cells was higher; and expression of p53 increased and bax decreased. However, after co-culturing leukemic cells with Cx43-modified BMSCs, the number of proliferative and spontaneously apoptotic Jurkat cells increased; the percentage of G0-phase cells decreased; the expression of p53 decreased; and bax increased. Compared with Jurkat cells co-cultured with BMSCs and Jurkat cells alone, the sensitivity of leukemic cells co-cultured with Cx43-modified BMSCs to chemotherapeutics increased. Our data suggests that GJIC between leukemia BMSCs is one of the impact factor to the proliferation, apoptosis and drug sensitivity of co-cultured leukemic cells.

The utility of current bioinformatics workflow environments can be significantly increased by offering advanced data mining services as workflow components. Such services can support, for instance, knowledge discovery from diverse distributed data and knowledge sources (such as GO, KEGG, PubMed, and experimental databases). Specifically, cutting-edge data analysis approaches, such as semantic data mining, link discovery, and visualization, have not yet been made available to researchers investigating complex biological datasets. RESULTS: We present a new methodology, SegMine, for semantic analysis of microarray data by exploiting general biological knowledge, and a new workflow environment, Orange4WS, with integrated support for web services in which the SegMine methodology is implemented. The SegMine methodology consists of two main steps. First, the semantic subgroup discovery algorithm is used to construct elaborate rules that identify enriched gene sets. Then, a link discovery service is used for the creation and visualization of new biological hypotheses. The utility of SegMine, implemented as a set of workflows in Orange4WS, is demonstrated in two microarray data analysis applications. In the analysis of senescence in human stem cells, the use of SegMine resulted in three novel research hypotheses that could improve understanding of the underlying mechanisms of senescence and identification of candidate marker genes. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the available data analysis systems, SegMine offers improved hypothesis generation and data interpretation for bioinformatics in an easy-to-use integrated workflow environment.","['Podpecan, Vid', 'Lavrac, Nada', 'Mozetic, Igor', 'Novak, Petra Kralj', 'Trajkovski, Igor', 'Langohr, Laura', 'Kulovesi, Kimmo', 'Toivonen, Hannu', 'Petek, Marko', 'Motaln, Helena', 'Gruden, Kristina']","['Podpecan V', 'Lavrac N', 'Mozetic I', 'Novak PK', 'Trajkovski I', 'Langohr L', 'Kulovesi K', 'Toivonen H', 'Petek M', 'Motaln H', 'Gruden K']","['JoZef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia. vid.podpecan@ijs.si']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111026,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/pathology', '*Algorithms', 'Autophagy', 'Cellular Senescence', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Software', 'Stem Cells/pathology', 'Workflow']",PMC3216973,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-12-416 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-12-416 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2011 Oct 26;12:416. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-12-416.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 15 types of fusion transcripts have been described to date. Among the rarer types, e19a2 was described for the first time in 1990 by Saglio et al. (1). Here, we report on a new case of CML with the e19a2 transcript. METHODS: A 38 year-old male patient was referred for genetic investigations with a clinical diagnosis of CML. Karyotyping and molecular genetics investigations (reverse-transcription and sequencing) were performed. RESULTS: t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) was found in 100% of metaphases and the patient's BCR-ABL1 fusion gene showed the rare variant transcript e19a3 with no sequence alterations. CONCLUSIONS: CML with e19a2 fusion transcript is a rare disease with a large variety of clinical manifestations and unclear biological significance.

We developed a sensitive, reliable and rapid real-time PCR method based on sequence polymorphism systems to quantitatively assess the hematopoietic chimerism after HSCT. METHODS: A panel of 29 selected sequence polymorphism (SP) markers was screened by real-time PCR in 101 HSCT patients with leukemia and other hematological diseases. The chimerism kinetics of bone marrow samples of 8 HSCT patients in remission and relapse situations were followed longitudinally. RESULTS: Recipient genotype discrimination was possible in 97.0% (98 of 101) with a mean number of 2.5 (1-7) informative markers per recipient/donor pair. Using serial dilutions of plasmids containing specific SP markers, the linear correlation (r) of 0.99, the slope between -3.2 and -3.7 and the sensitivity of 0.1% were proved reproducible. By this method, it was possible to very accurately detect autologous signals in the range from 0.1% to 30%. The accuracy of the method in the very important range of autologous signals below 5% was extraordinarily high (standard deviation <1.85%), which might significantly improve detection accuracy of changes in autologous signals early in the post-transplantation course of follow-up. The main advantage of the real-time PCR method over short tandem repeat PCR chimerism assays is the absence of PCR competition and plateau biases, with demonstrated greater sensitivity and linearity. Finally, we prospectively analyzed bone marrow samples of 8 patients who received allografts and presented the chimerism kinetics of remission and relapse situations that illustrated the sensitivity level and the promising clinical application of this method. CONCLUSION: This SP-based real-time PCR assay provides a rapid, sensitive, and accurate quantitative assessment of mixed chimerism that can be useful in predicting graft rejection and early relapse.","['Qin, Xiao-ying', 'Li, Guo-xuan', 'Qin, Ya-zhen', 'Wang, Yu', 'Wang, Feng-rong', 'Liu, Dai-hong', 'Xu, Lan-ping', 'Chen, Huan', 'Han, Wei', 'Wang, Jing-zhi', 'Zhang, Xiao-hui', 'Li, Jin-lan', 'Li, Ling-di', 'Liu, Kai-yan', 'Huang, Xiao-jun']","['Qin XY', 'Li GX', 'Qin YZ', 'Wang Y', 'Wang FR', 'Liu DH', 'Xu LP', 'Chen H', 'Han W', 'Wang JZ', 'Zhang XH', 'Li JL', 'Li LD', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genotype', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/28 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/10/28 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2011 Aug;124(15):2301-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frequent loss of large chromosomal regions marks haplo-insufficiency as one of the major mechanisms contributing to leukemogenesis. However, which haplo-insufficient genes (HIGs) are involved in leukemogenesis is largely unknown and powerful experimental strategies aimed at their identification are currently lacking. Here, we present a new approach to discover HIGs, using retroviral integration mutagenesis in mice in which methylated viral integration sites and neighbouring genes were identified. In total we mapped 6 genes which are flanked by methylated viral integration sites (mVIS). Three of these, i.e., Lrmp, Hcls1 and Prkrir, were up regulated and one, i.e., Ptp4a3, was down regulated in the affected tumor. Next, we investigated the role of PTP4A3 in human AML and we show that PTP4A3 expression is a negative prognostic indicator, independent of other prognostic parameters. In conclusion, our novel strategy has identified PTP4A3 to potentially have a role in AML, on one hand as a candidate HIG contributing to leukemogenesis in mice and on the other hand as a prognostic indicator in human AML.","['Beekman, Renee', 'Valkhof, Marijke', 'Erkeland, Stefan J', 'Taskesen, Erdogan', 'Rockova, Veronika', 'Peeters, Justine K', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Touw, Ivo P']","['Beekman R', 'Valkhof M', 'Erkeland SJ', 'Taskesen E', 'Rockova V', 'Peeters JK', 'Valk PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw IP']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111020,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Haploinsufficiency/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",PMC3197662,2011/10/27 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0026537 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-02784 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26537. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026537.

To address this issue we performed a shRNA-mediated knock-down (KD) of the E/R fusion gene and investigated the ensuing consequences on genome-wide gene expression patterns and deducible regulatory functions in two E/R-positive leukemic cell lines. FINDINGS: Microarray analyses identified 777 genes whose expression was substantially altered. Although approximately equal proportions were either up- (KD-UP) or down-regulated (KD-DOWN), the effects on biological processes and pathways differed considerably. The E/R KD-UP set was significantly enriched for genes included in the ""cell activation"", ""immune response"", ""apoptosis"", ""signal transduction"" and ""development and differentiation"" categories, whereas in the E/R KD-DOWN set only the ""PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling"" and ""hematopoietic stem cells"" categories became evident. Comparable expression signatures obtained from primary E/R-positive ALL samples underline the relevance of these pathways and molecular functions. We also validated six differentially expressed genes representing the categories ""stem cell properties"", ""B-cell differentiation"", ""immune response"", ""cell adhesion"" and ""DNA damage"" with RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: Our analyses provide the first preliminary evidence that the continuous expression of the E/R fusion gene interferes with key regulatory functions that shape the biology of this leukemia subtype. E/R may thus indeed constitute the essential driving force for the propagation and maintenance of the leukemic process irrespective of potential consequences of associated secondary changes. Finally, these findings may also provide a valuable source of potentially attractive therapeutic targets.","['Fuka, Gerhard', 'Kauer, Maximilian', 'Kofler, Reinhard', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate']","['Fuka G', 'Kauer M', 'Kofler R', 'Haas OA', 'Panzer-Grumayer R']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111020,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Gene Fusion/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*deficiency/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transcriptome/genetics']",PMC3197637,2011/10/27 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0026348 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-12259 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26348. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026348.

Thus, it is necessary to develop novel therapies that have different antileukemic mechanisms. Recent advances in immunology and identification of promising leukemia-associated antigens open the possibilities for eradicating minimal residual diseases by antigen-specific immunotherapy after chemotherapy. Several methods have been pursued as immunotherapies for AML: peptide vaccines, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting tumor vaccines, dendritic cell vaccines, and adoptive T cell therapy. Whereas immunogenicity and clinical outcomes are improving in these trials, severe adverse events were observed in highly avid engineered T cell therapies, indicating the importance of the balance between effectiveness and side effects in advanced immunotherapy.

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Smac mimetic primes apoptosis-resistant, FADD- or caspase-8-deficient leukemia cells for TNFalpha-induced necroptosis in a synergistic manner. In contrast to TNFalpha, Smac mimetic significantly enhances CD95-induced apoptosis in wild-type but not in FADD-deficient cells. Interestingly, Smac mimetic- and TNFalpha-mediated cell death occurs without characteristic features of apoptosis (i.e., caspase activation, DNA fragmentation) in FADD-deficient cells. By comparison, Smac mimetic and TNFalpha trigger activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 and DNA fragmentation in wild-type cells. Consistently, the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk fails to block Smac mimetic- and TNFalpha-triggered cell death in FADD- or caspase-8-deficient cells, while it confers protection in wild-type cells. By comparison, necrostatin-1, an RIP1 kinase inhibitor, abolishes Smac mimetic- and TNFalpha-induced cell death in FADD- or caspase-8-deficient. Thus, Smac mimetic enhances TNFalpha-induced cell death in leukemia cells via two distinct pathways in a context-dependent manner: it primes apoptosis-resistant cells lacking FADD or caspase-8 to TNFalpha-induced, RIP1-dependent and caspase-independent necroptosis, whereas it sensitizes apoptosis-proficient cells to TNFalpha-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis. These findings have important implications for the therapeutic exploitation of necroptosis as an alternative cell death program to overcome apoptosis resistance.","['Laukens, Bram', 'Jennewein, Claudia', 'Schenk, Barbara', 'Vanlangenakker, Nele', 'Schier, Alexander', 'Cristofanon, Silvia', 'Zobel, Kerry', 'Deshayes, Kurt', 'Vucic, Domagoj', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Bertrand, Mathieu J M', 'Vandenabeele, Peter', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Laukens B', 'Jennewein C', 'Schenk B', 'Vanlangenakker N', 'Schier A', 'Cristofanon S', 'Zobel K', 'Deshayes K', 'Vucic D', 'Jeremias I', 'Bertrand MJ', 'Vandenabeele P', 'Fulda S']","[""University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Biomimetic Materials/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",PMC3201573,2011/10/27 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.11610 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2011 Oct;13(10):971-9. doi: 10.1593/neo.11610.,,,"['0 (AGFG1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (necrostatin-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that miR-130a is differentially expressed during granulopoiesis and targets Smad4 mRNA. The transcript for Smad4 is present throughout neutrophil maturation, but Smad4 protein is undetectable in the most immature cells, where miR-130a is highly expressed. Two miR-130a binding sites were identified in the 3'-untranslated region of the Smad4 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-130a in HEK293, A549, and 32Dcl3 cells repressed synthesis of Smad4 protein without affecting Smad4 mRNA level. Repression of Smad4 synthesis in a granulocytic cell line by miR-130a reduced its sensitivity to TGF-beta1-induced growth inhibition. This effect was reversed by inhibiting the activity of miR-130a with an antisense probe or by expressing a Smad4 mRNA lacking miR-130a binding sites. High endogenous miR-130a and Smad4 mRNA levels and low expression of Smad4 protein were found in the t(8;21)(q22;q22) acute myelogenous leukemia-derived cell line Kasumi-1. When miR-130a was inhibited by an antisense RNA, the amount of Smad4 protein increased in Kasumi-1 cells and rendered it susceptible for TGF-beta1-mediated cell growth inhibition. Our data indicate that miR-130a is involved in cell cycle regulation of granulocytic cells through engagement of Smad4 in the TGF-beta pathway.","['Hager, Mattias', 'Pedersen, Corinna Cavan', 'Larsen, Maria Torp', 'Andersen, Mette Klarskov', 'Hother, Christoffer', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten', 'Jarmer, Hanne', 'Borregaard, Niels', 'Cowland, Jack Bernard']","['Hager M', 'Pedersen CC', 'Larsen MT', 'Andersen MK', 'Hother C', 'Gronbaek K', 'Jarmer H', 'Borregaard N', 'Cowland JB']","['Granulocyte Research Laboratory, Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej 9, Copenhagen, Denmark']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111025,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Smad4 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*pharmacology']",,2011/10/27 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40296-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-03-339978 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 15;118(25):6649-59. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-03-339978.

In this study, we describe a new, simple, and inexpensive test for genetics-based diagnosis of HCL in whole-blood samples that detects BRAF-V600E through a sensitive allele-specific PCR qualitative assay followed by agarose-gel electrophoresis. This approach detected BRAF-V600E in all 123 leukemic HCL samples investigated containing as few as 0.1% leukemic cells. BRAF-V600E was detected at different time points during the disease course, even after therapy, pointing to its pivotal role in HCL pathogenesis and maintenance of the leukemic clone.

FCRL proteins, including FCRL5, were shown to modulate early BCR signaling, although the subsequent, functional consequences of receptor engagement are poorly understood. We found that FCRL5 surface protein itself was induced temporarily upon BCR stimulation of human, naive B cells, indicating precise control over timing of FCRL5 engagement. Cross-linking of FCRL5 on cells induced to express FCRL5 enhanced B cell proliferation significantly. This enhancement required costimulation of the BCR and TLR9, two signals required for optimal proliferation of naive B cells, whereas T cell help in the form of anti-CD40 and IL-2 was dispensable. In addition, we found that FCRL5 stimulation generated a high proportion of cells displaying surface IgG and IgA. Optimal development of cells expressing switched isotypes required T cell help, in addition to stimuli found necessary for enhanced proliferation. Surprisingly, cells that developed upon FCRL5 stimulation simultaneously displayed surface IgM, IgG, and IgA. Cells expressing multiple Ig isotypes were described in hairy cell leukemia, a disease in which FCRL5 is overexpressed. Enhanced proliferation and downstream isotype expression upon FCRL5 stimulation could reflect a physiological role for FCRL5 in the expansion and development of antigen-primed B cells. In addition, FCRL5 may promote growth of malignant cells in hairy cell leukemia and other FCRL5-expressing tumors.","['Dement-Brown, Jessica', 'Newton, Christopher S', 'Ise, Tomoko', 'Damdinsuren, Bazarragchaa', 'Nagata, Satoshi', 'Tolnay, Mate']","['Dement-Brown J', 'Newton CS', 'Ise T', 'Damdinsuren B', 'Nagata S', 'Tolnay M']","['Division of Monoclonal Antibodies, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland 20993, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20111025,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Antigen Presentation/physiology', 'Antigenic Variation/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Fc', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",,2011/10/27 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0211096 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0211096 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2012 Jan;91(1):59-67. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0211096.

Establishment of pluripotency is crucially dependent on the homeodomain-containing transcription factor Nanog. Compared with other pluripotency-associated genes, however, Nanog shows relatively low sequence conservation. Here, we investigated whether Nanog orthologs have the capacity to orchestrate establishment of pluripotency in Nanog(-/-) somatic cells. Mammalian, avian and teleost orthologs of Nanog enabled efficient reprogramming to full pluripotency, despite sharing as little as 13% sequence identity with mouse Nanog. Nanog orthologs supported self-renewal of pluripotent cells in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor, and directly regulated mouse Nanog target genes. Related homeodomain transcription factors showed no reprogramming activity. Nanog is distinguished by the presence of two unique residues in the DNA recognition helix of its homeodomain, and mutations in these positions impaired reprogramming. On the basis of genome analysis and homeodomain identity, we propose that Nanog is a vertebrate innovation, which shared an ancestor with the Bsx gene family prior to the vertebrate radiation. However, cephalochordate Bsx did not have the capacity to replace mouse Nanog in reprogramming. Surprisingly, the Nanog homeodomain, a short sequence that contains the only recognizable conservation between Nanog orthologs, was sufficient to induce naive pluripotency in Nanog(-/-) somatic cells. This shows that control of the pluripotent state resides within a unique DNA-binding domain, which appeared at least 450 million years ago in a common ancestor of vertebrates. Our results support the hypothesis that naive pluripotency is a generic feature of vertebrate development.","['Theunissen, Thorold W', 'Costa, Yael', 'Radzisheuskaya, Aliaksandra', 'van Oosten, Anouk L', 'Lavial, Fabrice', 'Pain, Bertrand', 'Castro, L Filipe C', 'Silva, Jose C R']","['Theunissen TW', 'Costa Y', 'Radzisheuskaya A', 'van Oosten AL', 'Lavial F', 'Pain B', 'Castro LF', 'Silva JC']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research and Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.']",['eng'],"['G0800784/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT086692MA/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT079249/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*genetics', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Homeobox/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Vertebrates/*genetics']",PMC3201656,2011/10/27 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['138/22/4853 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.068775 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2011 Nov;138(22):4853-65. doi: 10.1242/dev.068775.,,,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examined records from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours for evidence of this association in England and Wales during 1976-2005. All eligible leukaemia registrations (N=11940) were grouped by year of diagnosis in decades centred on census years 1981, 1991 and 2001 (N=3748, 3922, 4270, respectively). Using data from the census appropriate to the decade, SES for each case was measured by the child-population-weighted quintile of the Carstairs deprivation index of the census ward containing the address at diagnosis. RESULTS: In each decade, the age-standardised leukaemia rate in the poorest quintile was approximately 90% of the rate in the most affluent. Using Poisson regression, the age-adjusted rate ratio per quintile decrease in SES was 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.94-0.98; P<0.001 for trend) in 1976-1985, 0.97 (0.95-0.99; P=0.008) in 1986-1995 and 0.97 (0.95-0.99; P=0.009) in 1996-2005. Similar association was evident for lymphoid leukaemia, the major subgroup (N=9588 in total), but not for acute myeloid (N=1868) or other/unspecified leukaemia (N=484). CONCLUSION: Reported childhood leukaemia incidence in England and Wales continues to be higher in relatively affluent communities. Possible explanations include under-diagnosis of leukaemia in children from poorer communities, and/or association of higher SES with hypothesised risk factors, such as population mixing and delayed exposure to infection.","['Kroll, M E', 'Stiller, C A', 'Murphy, M F G', 'Carpenter, L M']","['Kroll ME', 'Stiller CA', 'Murphy MF', 'Carpenter LM']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, Richards Building, Oxford, UK. mary.kroll@ceu.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111025,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/economics/*epidemiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Registries', 'Residence Characteristics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Class', 'Wales/epidemiology']",PMC3242592,2011/10/27 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2011415 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.415 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2011 Nov 22;105(11):1783-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.415.

Stabilized palifosfamide overcomes limitations of IFOS because of patient-to-patient variability in response resulting from variable prodrug activation, resistance and toxicities of metabolic byproducts, acrolein and chloroacetaldehyde. Palifosfamide represents an effective alternative to IFOS and other DNA-alkylating prodrugs. The antitumor activities of stabilized palifosfamide were investigated in vivo. Dose response, route and schedule of administration, and interaction with docetaxel or doxorubicin were investigated in NCr-nu/nu mice bearing established orthotopic mammary MX-1 tumor xenografts. Oral activity was investigated in P388-1 leukemia in CD2F1 mice. Oral and intraperitoneal bioavailabilities were compared in Sprague-Dawley rats. Stabilized palifosfamide administered by optimized regimens suppressed MX-1 tumor growth (P<0.05) by greater than 80% with 17% complete antitumor responses and up to three-fold increase in time to three tumor doublings over controls. Median survival in the P388-1 (P<0.001) model was increased by 9 days over controls. Oral bioavailability in rats was 48-73% of parenteral administration, and antitumor activity in mice was equivalent by both routes. Treatment with palifosfamide-tris combined with docetaxel or doxorubicin at optimal regimens resulted in complete tumor regression in 62-75% of mice. These studies support investigation of stabilized palifosfamide in human cancers by parenteral or oral administration as a single agent and in combination with other approved drugs. The potential for clinical translation of the cooperative interaction of palifosfamide-tris with doxorubicin by intravenous administration is supported by results from a recent randomized Phase-II study in unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma.","['Jones, Barry', 'Komarnitsky, Philip', 'Miller, Glenn T', 'Amedio, John', 'Wallner, Barbara P']","['Jones B', 'Komarnitsky P', 'Miller GT', 'Amedio J', 'Wallner BP']","['ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc., Boston, Massachusetts 02129, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Docetaxel', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Lysine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2011/10/27 06:00,2012/06/01 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32834d73a6 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2012 Feb;23(2):173-84. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32834d73a6.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (palifosfamide lysine)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '6A4U6NN813 (isophosphamide mustard)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell toxicity of 1,4-BQ was evaluated by cell viability test, real-time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression levels, and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) was used to look into the methylation patterns. The cell viability test indicates that 1,4-BQ exhibited a dose-dependent toxicity to mouse bone marrow cells. After a 24-h exposure to 1,4-BQ at final concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 mumol/L, the mRNA expression of p15 and p16 decreased with the increase in 1,4-BQ concentration. The BSP results gathered from the exposure and the control groups were the same.

In this study we present cyclohexyl-[6-methyl-2-(4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl]-amin e (EP6), a novel imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine based compound and its characterization in several in vitro assays. EP6 suppresses 5-LO activity in intact polymorphonuclear leukocytes with an IC(50) value of 0.16muM and exhibits full inhibitory potency in cell free assays (IC(50) value of 0.05muM for purified 5-LO). The efficacy of EP6 was not affected by the redox tone or the concentration of exogenous AA, characteristic drawbacks known for the class of nonredox-type 5-LO inhibitors. Furthermore, EP6 suppressed 5-LO activity independently of the cell stimulus or the activation pathway of 5-LO contrary to what is known for some nonredox-type inhibitors. Using molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies, we were able to derive a feasible binding region within the C2-like domain of 5-LO that can serve as a new starting point for optimization and development of new 5-LO inhibitors targeting this site. EP6 has promising effects on cell viability of tumor cells without mutagenic activity. Hence the drug may possess potential for intervention with inflammatory and allergic diseases and certain types of cancer including leukemia.","['Wisniewska, Joanna M', 'Rodl, Carmen B', 'Kahnt, Astrid S', 'Buscato, Estel la', 'Ulrich, Sandra', 'Tanrikulu, Yusuf', 'Achenbach, Janosch', 'Rorsch, Florian', 'Grosch, Sabine', 'Schneider, Gisbert', 'Cinatl, Jindrich Jr', 'Proschak, Ewgenij', 'Steinhilber, Dieter', 'Hofmann, Bettina']","['Wisniewska JM', 'Rodl CB', 'Kahnt AS', 'Buscato El', 'Ulrich S', 'Tanrikulu Y', 'Achenbach J', 'Rorsch F', 'Grosch S', 'Schneider G', 'Cinatl J Jr', 'Proschak E', 'Steinhilber D', 'Hofmann B']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, ZAFES/LiFF, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, D-60438 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Allosteric Regulation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/metabolism', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pyridines/*chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sheep', 'U937 Cells']",,2011/10/27 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00760-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Jan 15;83(2):228-40. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.10.012.

Consequently, effective management is necessary to prevent adverse outcomes. Prevention of menorrhagia, defined as heavy regular menstrual cycles with more than 80 ml of blood loss/cycle or a cycle duration longer than 7 days, in this patient population is the goal of therapy. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (e.g., leuprolide) are promising therapies that have been shown to decrease vaginal bleeding during periods of thrombocytopenia and to have minimal adverse effects other than those associated with gonadal inhibition. In patients who experience menorrhagia despite preventive therapies, or in patients who have thrombocytopenia and menorrhagia at diagnosis, treatment is indicated. For these women, treatment options may include platelet transfusions, antifibrinolytic therapy (e.g., tranexamic acid), continuous high-dose oral contraceptives, cyclic progestins, or other therapies for more refractory patients such as danazol, desmopressin, and recombinant factor VIIa. Hormonal therapies are often the mainstay of therapy in women with menorrhagia secondary to thrombocytopenia, but data for these agents are sparse. The most robust data for the treatment of menorrhagia are for tranexamic acid. Most women receiving tranexamic acid in randomized trials experienced meaningful reductions in menstrual bleeding, and this translated into improved quality of life; however, these trials were not performed in patients with cancer. Further clinical trials are warranted to evaluate both preventive and therapeutic agents for menorrhagia in premenopausal women with cancer who are receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.","['Bates, Jill S', 'Buie, Larry W', 'Woodis, C Brock']","['Bates JS', 'Buie LW', 'Woodis CB']","['North Carolina Cancer Hospital, University of North Carolina Hospitals and Clinics, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,IM,"['Animals', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Menorrhagia/chemically induced/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Tranexamic Acid/therapeutic use']",,2011/10/27 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/10/27 06:00'],"['2011/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1592/phco.31.11.1092 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2011 Nov;31(11):1092-110. doi: 10.1592/phco.31.11.1092.,,,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6T84R30KC1 (Tranexamic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although tetherin expression causes the retention of retrovirus particles on the surface of infected cells, it is not known whether tetherin inhibits retroviral replication or pathogenesis in vivo. Mutation of tetherin antagonists often has little effect on retroviral replication in vitro, and, although tetherin can reduce the yield of extracellular viral particles, some studies suggest that tetherin actually enhances direct cell-to-cell viral transmission. We generated tetherin-deficient mice to determine the effect of this protein on murine retrovirus replication and pathogenesis. We find that tetherin markedly inhibits the replication of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) and is required for the antiretroviral activity of IFNalpha to be fully manifested in vitro. Surprisingly, Mo-MLV replication and disease progression was not significantly different in WT and tetherin-deficient mice, but this finding was explained by the fact that Mo-MLV infection did not induce detectable tetherin expression on candidate target cells in vivo. Indeed, IFNalpha induction was required to reveal the anti-Mo-MLV activity of tetherin in vivo. Moreover, LP-BM5, an MLV strain that has been demonstrated to induce immune activation and IFNalpha expression, achieved higher levels of viremia and induced exaggerated pathology in tetherin-deficient mice.

The results revealed the effects of AAV8-IL24 in MLL/AF4-positive ALL both in vitro and in vivo. With regard to the mechanism of therapy using AAV8-IL24 in MLL/AF4-positive ALL, we demonstrated the antiangiogenicity and effects on the ER stress pathway and unreported pathways through inhibition of S100A6 and HOXA9, which is specific to MLL/AF4-positive ALL. Inhibition of S100A6 by IL24 was dependent on TNF-alpha and induced acetylation of p53 followed by activation of the caspase 8-caspase 3 apoptotic pathway. Inhibition of HOXA9 by IL24, which was independent of TNF-alpha, induced MEIS1 activation followed by activation of the caspase 8-caspase 3 apoptotic pathway. Thus, gene therapy using AAV8-IL24 is a promising treatment for MLL/AF4-positive ALL.","['Tamai, Hayato', 'Miyake, Koichi', 'Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Takatori, Miyuki', 'Dan, Kazuo', 'Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Shimada, Takashi']","['Tamai H', 'Miyake K', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Takatori M', 'Dan K', 'Inokuchi K', 'Shimada T']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Division of Gene Therapy Research Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Sendagi 1-1-5, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo113-8603, Japan. s6056@nms.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111024,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interleukins/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Myoblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'S100 Calcium Binding Protein A6', 'S100 Proteins/metabolism']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38538-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-05-354050 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 5;119(1):64-71. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-05-354050.

By inhibition of host cell apoptosis, chlamydiae have evolved a strategy to maintain the intracellular environment for replication and persistence. Both antiapoptotic host cell-derived factors and the chlamydial protease-like activity factor (CPAF) are involved in Chlamydia-mediated apoptosis resistance. Here, we show that in HeLa cells infected with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-induced persistent C. trachomatis serovar D, the expression of CPAF is downregulated, and proapoptotic protease substrates are not cleaved. Persistent infection protected HeLa cells from apoptosis when they were exposed to staurosporine. Small-interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) protein upregulation sensitized persistently infected cells for apoptosis. The inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (IAP-2) seems not to be relevant in this context because IAP-2 protein was not induced in response to IFN-gamma treatment. Although apoptosis was inhibited, persistent infection caused cell membrane disintegration, as measured by the increased release of cytokeratin 18 from HeLa cells. Moreover, persistently infected cells released significantly increased amounts of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein which represents a proinflammatory damage-associated pattern molecule. The data of this study suggest that cells infected with persistent C. trachomatis are protected from apoptosis independently of CPAF but may promote chronic inflammation through HMGB1 release.","['Rodel, Jurgen', 'Grosse, Christina', 'Yu, Hangxing', 'Wolf, Katharina', 'Otto, Gordon P', 'Liebler-Tenorio, Elisabeth', 'Forsbach-Birk, Vera', 'Straube, Eberhard']","['Rodel J', 'Grosse C', 'Yu H', 'Wolf K', 'Otto GP', 'Liebler-Tenorio E', 'Forsbach-Birk V', 'Straube E']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology, Clinic for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Jena, Germany. juergen.roedel@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111024,United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Chlamydia trachomatis/enzymology/*pathogenicity', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*microbiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'HMGB1 Protein/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Keratin-18/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/toxicity', 'Virulence Factors/*metabolism']",PMC3255666,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['IAI.05619-11 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.05619-11 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 2012 Jan;80(1):195-205. doi: 10.1128/IAI.05619-11.

Cytology, long considered the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis, has low sensitivity because of both the paucity of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and morphological similarities between benign and malignant cells. A comprehensive review of the literature from 2005 through 2011 was performed that focused on diagnostic modalities for lymphomatous meningitis. Several studies demonstrated the sensitivity of flow cytometry to be several-fold higher than that of cytology for the detection of CSF leukemia/lymphoma. Patients with negative cytology but positive flow cytometry results are often asymptomatic and have lower CSF cell counts and neoplastic B-cell percentages compared with patients with positive cytology findings. Flow cytometry is a highly sensitive technique capable of accurately detecting malignant cells, even in samples with very low cell counts. Flow cytometry allows for the earlier detection of NM before the onset of clinical symptoms and CSF pleocytosis and therefore may enable more effective treatment. Future consensus regarding standardized flow cytometric antibody panels, with uniform definitions of positivity, is likely to further advance the early detection of NM by flow cytometry and permit broader clinical applicability.","['Ahluwalia, Manmeet S', 'Wallace, Paul K', 'Peereboom, David M']","['Ahluwalia MS', 'Wallace PK', 'Peereboom DM']","['Rose Ella Burkhardt Brain Tumor and Neuro-Oncology Center, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 441959, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111024,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Cytodiagnosis', 'Early Detection of Cancer', '*Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Meningeal Carcinomatosis/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis', 'Meningitis/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26335 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Apr 1;118(7):1747-53. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26335.

RUNX1 was originally identified as a gene fusion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and thus has garnered heavy attention as a tumor suppressor in hematopoietic malignancies. However, RUNX1 is also strongly expressed in breast epithelia and may be misregulated during tumorigenesis. Here, I discuss our recent work implicating RUNX1 in proliferation control during breast epithelial-acinar morphogenesis. My goal is to place these findings in the context of a handful of other reports, which together argue that RUNX1 could act as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer. Testing this hypothesis requires focused in vivo studies, because the major commercial platform for global mRNA expression profiling does not reliably reflect RUNX1 levels. Our in vitro results indicate that hyperproliferation in RUNX1-deficient breast epithelia relies on another family of transcription factors, the Forkhead box O (FOXO) proteins. FOXOs could, therefore, represent a synthetic-lethal target for RUNX1-deficient tumors if the hypothesized link to breast cancer is correct.","['Janes, Kevin A']",['Janes KA'],"['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. kjanes@virginia.edu']",['eng'],"['DP2 OD006464/OD/NIH HHS/United States', '1-DP2-OD006464/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111015,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Acinar Cells/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3266176,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['18029 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.20.18029 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Oct 15;10(20):3461-5. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.20.18029.

Using a genetically engineered mouse model of myeloid leukemia (histiocytic sarcomas, HS) based on the genetic inactivation of the tumor suppressor Ink4a/Arf locus, we have recently unraveled an unsuspected function of E4F1 in the survival of leukemic cells. In vivo, genetic ablation of E4F1 in established myeloid tumors results in tumor regression. E4F1 inactivation results in a cascade of alterations originating from dysfunctional mitochondria that induce increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and ends in massive autophagic cell death in HS transformed, but not normal myeloid cells. E4F1 depletion also induces cell death in various human myeloid leukemic cell lines, including acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cell lines. Interestingly, the E4F1 protein is overexpressed in a large proportion of human AML samples. These data provide new insights into E4F1-associated survival functions implicated in tumorigenesis and could open the path for new therapeutic strategies.","['Hatchi, Elodie', 'Rodier, Genevieve', 'Sardet, Claude', 'Le Cam, Laurent']","['Hatchi E', 'Rodier G', 'Sardet C', 'Le Cam L']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, Universite de Montpellier, IFR122, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,IM,"['Animals', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC3288034,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['17991 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.7.12.17991 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2011 Dec;7(12):1566-7. doi: 10.4161/auto.7.12.17991.,,,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,,,,['HALMS646349'],,,,,,,,['NLM: HALMS646349'],,

Notwithstanding that, the actual immunopathogenetical mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. As in other B-cell lymphomas, insight into this issue, especially with regard to potential selecting ligands, could be provided by analysis of the immunoglobulin (IG) receptors of the malignant clones. To this end, we studied the molecular features of IGs in 44 patients with OAMZL (40% Cp-positive), identifying features suggestive of a pathogenic mechanism of autoreactivity. Herein, we show that lymphoma cells express a distinctive IG repertoire, with electropositive antigen (Ag)-binding sites, reminiscent of autoantibodies (auto-Abs) recognizing DNA. Additionally, five (11%) cases of OAMZL expressed IGs homologous with autoreactive Abs or IGs of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disease known for the expression of autoreactive IGs by neoplastic cells. In contrast, no similarity with known anti-Chlamydophila Abs was found. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that OAMZL may originate from B cells selected for their capability to bind Ags and, in particular, auto-Ags. In OAMZL associated with Cp infection, the pathogen likely acts indirectly on the malignant B cells, promoting the development of an inflammatory milieu, where auto-Ags could be exposed and presented, driving proliferation and expansion of self-reactive B cells.","['Dagklis, A', 'Ponzoni, M', 'Govi, S', 'Cangi, M G', 'Pasini, E', 'Charlotte, F', 'Vino, A', 'Doglioni, C', 'Davi, F', 'Lossos, I S', 'Ntountas, I', 'Papadaki, T', 'Dolcetti, R', 'Ferreri, A J M', 'Stamatopoulos, K', 'Ghia, P']","['Dagklis A', 'Ponzoni M', 'Govi S', 'Cangi MG', 'Pasini E', 'Charlotte F', 'Vino A', 'Doglioni C', 'Davi F', 'Lossos IS', 'Ntountas I', 'Papadaki T', 'Dolcetti R', 'Ferreri AJ', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Ghia P']","['Laboratory of B-cell Neoplasia, Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111025,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Eye Neoplasms/etiology/*immunology', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/etiology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psittacosis/complications']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011276 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.276 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):814-21. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.276.

In the present study, we evaluated the morphological and functional features of endothelial cells (ECs) derived from bone marrow (BM) of patients affected by MM (MMECs). We found that MMECs compared with normal BM ECs (BMECs) showed increased expression of syndecan-1. Silencing of syndecan-1 expression by RNA interference technique decreased in vitro EC survival, proliferation and organization in capillary-like structures. In vivo, in severe combined immunodeficient mice, syndecan-1 silencing inhibited MMEC organization into patent vessels. When overexpressed in human umbilical vein ECs and BMECs, syndecan-1 induced in vitro and in vivo angiogenic effects. Flow-cytometric analysis of MMECs silenced for syndecan-1 expression indicated a decreased membrane expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Immunoprecipitation and confocal analysis showed colocalization of VEGFR-2 with syndecan-1. Absence of nuclear translocation of VEGFR-2 in syndecan-1-knockdown cells together with the shift from perinuclear localization to recycling compartments suggest a role of syndecan-1 in modulation of VEGFR-2 localization. This correlated with an in vitro decreased VEGF-induced invasion and motility. These results suggest that syndecan-1 may contribute to the highly angiogenic phenotype of MMECs by promoting EC proliferation, survival and modulating VEGF-VEGFR-2 signalling.","['Lamorte, S', 'Ferrero, S', 'Aschero, S', 'Monitillo, L', 'Bussolati, B', 'Omede, P', 'Ladetto, M', 'Camussi, G']","['Lamorte S', 'Ferrero S', 'Aschero S', 'Monitillo L', 'Bussolati B', 'Omede P', 'Ladetto M', 'Camussi G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Research Center for Experimental Medicine (CeRMS), University of Torino, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111025,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood supply/*pathology', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndecan-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism']",PMC3356559,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011290 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.290 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):1081-90. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.290.

It is now possible to aim for deep disease responses in a greater number of patients in an attempt to prolong remission duration and survival. Initially introduced in the relapsed setting, the novel agents, namely thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide, are now being increasingly incorporated into upfront treatment strategies, raising questions about the feasibility of 'retreatment' with such agents. Also, in a disease that is characterized by multiple relapses, the 'sequencing' of the different effective options is an important question. In the frontline setting, the first remission is likely to be the period during which patients will enjoy the best quality of life. Thus, the goal should be to achieve a first remission that is the longest possible by using the most effective treatment upfront. At relapse, the challenge is to select the optimal treatment for each patient while balancing efficacy and toxicity. The decision will depend on both disease- and patient-related factors. This review aimed to assess the available research data addressing 'retreatment' approaches, drug 'sequencing' and the long-term impact of upfront therapy with novel drugs.","['Mohty, B', 'El-Cheikh, J', 'Yakoub-Agha, I', 'Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Moreau, P', 'Mohty, M']","['Mohty B', 'El-Cheikh J', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Moreau P', 'Mohty M']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Universitaire de Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111025,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011310 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.310 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jan;26(1):73-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.310.

Although considered a tumor of uncertain malignant potential, information about its biological behavior is still limited. In this study, we present the clinicopathologic features of 26 cases of WDPM of the female peritoneum seen in our institution over a 20-year period (1990 to 2010). Clinical information and pathology material were reviewed in all cases. Patients ranged in age from 23 to 75 years (median, 47 y; mean, 48.6 y). There was no history of asbestos exposure in any of our cases. Ten patients had undergone surgery previously, and 6 had a history of endometriosis. In 24 patients, the WDPM was an incidental finding during surgery for a benign or malignant lesion. Only 2 patients presented with symptoms: 1 with an acute abdomen and the other with chronic pelvic pain. The former had developed a small hemoperitoneum because of bleeding of 1 of the lesions of WDPM, whereas the latter had a 2-cm WDPM involving the distal fallopian tube. The lesions were single or multiple (13 cases each) and ranged in size from 0.1 cm to 2 cm. The following sites were involved: abdominal or pelvic peritoneum not otherwise specified (10 cases), omentum (7 cases), cul-de-sac (6 cases), colonic serosa (4 cases), small bowel mesentery (2 cases), uterine serosa (2 cases), stomach serosa (1 case), large bowel mesentery (1 case), fallopian tube (1 case), ovary (1 case), and inguinal hernia (1 case). In all cases the lesions were excised. Microscopically, all of our cases had the typical features described for WDPM (ie, a papillary architecture that may be accompanied by glandular/tubular patterns, nests of cells and individual cells, bland mesothelial cells, absent or rare mitotic figures). The initial diagnosis in our cases was variable, including WDPM, mesothelial hyperplasia, malignant mesothelioma, serous tumor of low malignant potential of the peritoneum, papillary endosalpingiosis, and chronic xanthogranulomatous salpingiosis. Follow-up was obtained for 25 patients, and it ranged from 4 to 192 months (mean, 47.5 mo; median, 32 mo); 22 patients are alive with no evidence of WDPM after a follow-up that ranged from 5 to 144 months. One of these patients experienced recurrence of WDPM 46.5 months after initial diagnosis. In this patient, WDPM was an incidental finding during a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for serous cystadenofibroma. The recurrence was also an incidental finding during a colectomy for colonic adenocarcinoma. This patient is alive with no other recurrences 73 months after initial diagnosis and 36 months after diagnosis of the recurrence. Three patients died of other causes: pancreatic cancer at 4 months and 12 months and leukemia at 192 months. Recognition of the histologic features of WDPM and proper clinical correlation allow for the correct diagnosis of this entity. If necessary, immunohistochemical studies such as calretinin and keratin 5/6 facilitate the recognition of the mesothelial nature of this neoplasm. Although no patient died of disease in this series, follow-up of patients with this diagnosis is warranted on the basis of possible recurrences or misdiagnosis of an undersampled malignant mesothelioma.","['Malpica, Anais', ""Sant'Ambrogio, Sara"", 'Deavers, Michael T', 'Silva, Elvio G']","['Malpica A', ""Sant'Ambrogio S"", 'Deavers MT', 'Silva EG']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. amalpica@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Calbindin 2', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratin-5/analysis', 'Keratin-6/analysis', 'Mesothelioma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'S100 Calcium Binding Protein G/analysis', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e3182354a79 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2012 Jan;36(1):117-27. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e3182354a79.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CALB2 protein, human)', '0 (Calbindin 2)', '0 (Keratin-5)', '0 (Keratin-6)', '0 (S100 Calcium Binding Protein G)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of children with acute leukemia and typhlitis between 2006 and 2009 were reviewed for demographics and symptoms, and for microbiological and imaging findings. RESULTS: In the 75 children with acute leukemia--54 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 21 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)--there were 10 episodes of typhlitis (4.5%) that developed during 221 periods of severe neutropenia. The cumulative risk of typhlitis was 7.4% in patients with ALL and 28.5% in patients with AML. Frequent symptoms were: abdominal pain and tenderness (100% each); fever and nausea (90% each); emesis (80%); diarrhea (50%), and hypotension, peritonitis and abdominal distension (10% each). The median duration of symptoms was 6 days (range: 2-11 days), and that of neutropenia 14 days (range: 3-25 days). All patients were treated medically and none surgically. Two patients died because of typhlitis and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the rate of typhlitis among leukemic children was 4.5%; however, the mortality rate was 20%. Thus, rapid identification and timely, aggressive medical intervention are necessary to reduce the morbidity and mortality from typhlitis.","['Altinel, Esma', 'Yarali, Nese', 'Isik, Pamir', 'Bay, Ali', 'Kara, Abdurrahman', 'Tunc, Bahattin']","['Altinel E', 'Yarali N', 'Isik P', 'Bay A', 'Kara A', 'Tunc B']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Dr. Sami Ulus Children's Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111020,Switzerland,Med Princ Pract,"Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",8901334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Typhlitis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/04/18 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2010/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['000331587 [pii]', '10.1159/000331587 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Princ Pract. 2012;21(1):36-9. doi: 10.1159/000331587.

FA displays bone marrow failure, acute myeloid leukemia, and head and neck cancers, whereas BS is characterized by growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and a wide spectrum of cancers. The BLM gene mutated in BS encodes a DNA helicase that functions in a protein complex to suppress sister-chromatid exchange. Of the 15 FA genetic complementation groups implicated in interstrand crosslink repair, FANCJ encodes a DNA helicase involved in recombinational repair and replication stress response. Based on evidence that BLM and FANCJ interact we suggest that crosstalk between BLM and FA pathways is more complex than previously thought. We propose testable models for how FANCJ and BLM coordinate to help cells deal with stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks (DSB). Understanding how BLM and FANCJ cooperate will help to elucidate an important pathway for maintaining genomic stability.","['Suhasini, Avvaru N', 'Brosh, Robert M Jr']","['Suhasini AN', 'Brosh RM Jr']","['Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],['Z01 AG000753-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111023,England,Trends Genet,Trends in genetics : TIG,8507085,IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bloom Syndrome/*enzymology/genetics', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Fanconi Anemia/*enzymology/genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'RecQ Helicases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3249464,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-9525(11)00157-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tig.2011.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Genet. 2012 Jan;28(1):7-13. doi: 10.1016/j.tig.2011.09.003.

In this study we investigated the role of Mcl-1 in mitotic arrest-induced apoptosis. Vinblastine treatment of KB-3 cells initially resulted in a phosphatase-sensitive mobility shift in Mcl-1 and then subsequent loss of Mcl-1 protein expression which was prevented by MG132, suggesting that phosphorylation triggered proteosome-mediated degradation. Mcl-1 phosphorylation/degradation was a specific response to microtubule inhibition and did not occur in response to lethal concentrations of DNA damaging agents. Vinblastine treatment caused degradation of Mcl-1 in cells in which apoptosis was blocked by Bcl-xL overexpression, indicating that Mcl-1 degradation was not a consequence of apoptosis. A partial reversible phosphorylation of Mcl-1 was observed in synchronized cells traversing mitosis, whereas more extensive phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Mcl-1 was observed if synchronized cells were treated with vinblastine. Mcl-1 phosphorylation closely paralleled cyclin B expression, and specific cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors blocked vinblastine-induced Mcl-1 phosphorylation, its subsequent degradation, and improved cell viability after mitotic arrest. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that Mcl-1 was complexed with Bak, but not Bax or Noxa, in untreated cells, and that Bak became activated in concert with loss of Mcl-1 expression. These results suggest that Cdk1/cyclin B plays a key role in mitotic arrest-induced apoptosis via Mcl-1 phosphorylation, promoting its degradation and subsequently releasing Bak from sequestration.","['Chu, Rong', 'Terrano, David T', 'Chambers, Timothy C']","['Chu R', 'Terrano DT', 'Chambers TC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA109821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109821-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-109821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin B/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3242896,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00756-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.10.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Jan 15;83(2):199-206. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.10.008.

We have previously demonstrated the leukemia-initiating activity of ALDH(bright) cells in xenograft transplantation models, as well as in vitro. Applying single-cell long-term culture-initiating cell assays, we have correlated the functional properties of individual cells within this LSCC population and the respective phenotypes. To define their biologic significance, we also analyzed the relationship between LSCC at diagnosis to long-term clinical outcomes. The median percentage of ALDH(bright) cells among 101 acute myeloid leukemia patients was 0.51% (range, 0.01-12.90%). Single-cell long-term culture-initiating cell assays, followed by genetic analysis of the progeny cells, showed that the leukemia-initiating activity was found in the ALDH(bright)/CD34(high) subset and, to a lesser extent, in ALDH(bright)/CD34(low) or ALDH(bright)/CD34(-) subsets. Nevertheless, the frequency of ALDH(bright) cells at diagnosis correlated significantly with the persistence of leukemia after induction chemotherapy (n = 84, Spearman R = 0.3261; p < 0.0025). In the multivariate model, frequency of ALDH(bright) cells was the strongest prognostic marker (p = 0.0095) affecting overall survival (hazard ratio = 9.107). LSCC are heterogeneous and best reflected by ALDH activity. The frequency of ALDH(bright) cells at diagnosis is a significant prognostic marker for acute myeloid leukemia.","['Ran, Dan', 'Schubert, Mario', 'Taubert, Isabel', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Bellos, Frauke', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Chen, Hui', 'Bruckner, Thomas', 'Saffrich, Rainer', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Ran D', 'Schubert M', 'Taubert I', 'Eckstein V', 'Bellos F', 'Jauch A', 'Chen H', 'Bruckner T', 'Saffrich R', 'Wuchter P', 'Ho AD']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20111021,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00502-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Feb;40(2):155-65.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.10.005.

Using single particle tracking techniques, we examined how binding of insulin, depletion of membrane cholesterol and disruption of actin filaments affect the lateral diffusion of individual quantum dot-labeled native IR on live rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells. We also examined the effects of similar treatments on IR clustering and multivalent insulin binding on these cells using both photon counting histogram analysis and polarization-based fluorescence resonance energy homo-transfer imaging. Our analyses indicate that binding of insulin to IR on these cells is multivalent, involving at least two insulin molecules per IR as labeling concentrations approach 1muM. Insulin binding also reduces lateral diffusion of IR and the size of membrane compartments accessed by IR. For IR that have not bound insulin, lateral diffusion of IR and the size of membrane compartments accessed by IR increase after disrupting actin filaments or depleting membrane cholesterol. However, clustering of insulin-occupied IR is reduced only by disrupting actin filaments or by fixing cells with paraformaldehyde prior to exposure to insulin, but not by depleting membrane cholesterol. Thus, it appears that, although restriction of IR lateral diffusion on these cells is sensitive to both actin filament dynamics and membrane cholesterol content, clustering of insulin-occupied IR primarily involves an actin-dependent mechanism.","['Winter, Peter W', 'Van Orden, Alan K', 'Roess, Deborah A', 'Barisas, B George']","['Winter PW', 'Van Orden AK', 'Roess DA', 'Barisas BG']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111015,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence Polarization/methods', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Quantum Dots', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Insulin/*metabolism']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0005-2736(11)00356-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamem.2011.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2012 Mar;1818(3):467-73. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamem.2011.10.006.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is an association between cancer and first hospitalisation for CHD. METHODS: All individuals in Sweden with a diagnosis of cancer between 1st January 1987 and 31st December 2008 were followed for first hospitalisation for CHD. The reference population was the total population of Sweden without cancer. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for CHD were calculated. RESULTS: The overall CHD risk during the first 6 months after diagnosis of cancer was 1.70 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.66-1.75). For 26 of the 34 cancers studied, the risk of CHD was increased during the first 6 months after diagnosis of cancer. The overall CHD risk decreased rapidly, but remained slightly elevated, even 10+years after diagnosis of cancer (SIR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.11). The cancer sites/types for which risk of CHD was highest during the first 6 months were small intestine (SIR 2.88; 95% CI 2.02-3.99), leukaemia (SIR 2.84; 95% CI 2.37-3.37), kidney (SIR 2.65; 95% CI 2.30-3.04), lung (SIR 2.56; 95% CI 2.35-2.80) and liver (SIR 2.28; 95% CI 1.91-2.71). Metastases were associated with an increased risk of CHD (SIR 1.46; 95% CI 1.28-1.65). INTERPRETATION: Most cancers were associated with an increased risk of CHD during the first 6 months after diagnosis. CHD risk was related to the presence of metastates. Cancer patients may need a more aggressive treatment of classical CHD risk factors.","['Zoller, Bengt', 'Ji, Jianguang', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Sundquist, Kristina']","['Zoller B', 'Ji J', 'Sundquist J', 'Sundquist K']","['Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University/Region Skane, Clinical Research Centre, Floor 11, Building 28, Entrance 72, Skane University Hospital, 205 02 Malmo, Sweden. bengt.zoller@med.lu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111022,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Coronary Disease/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology/pathology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00726-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.09.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2012 Jan;48(1):121-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.09.015.

The hypothesis that malignant stem cells evolve from normal stem cells, is considered. Information is being accumulated on the possibility that certain cell populations that can be propagated as cell lines in vitro can produce cells with features of differentiated cells in addition to others that maintain the line and, in some cases may also initiate tumor formation in vivo. Up to the present time, there is evidence to show that cancer stem cells persist in many cell lines. Tyrosine kinase inhibition produces combinations of autophagy and apoptosis in the human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 hinting at a heterotypic aggregation of cells containing cancer stem cells. Finally, the mechanisms of cancer development, invasion and metastasis are operatively defined. The purpose of this paper is to review some of the salient features of cancer stem cells in support of the proposal that research in neoplasia be increased. Rather than presenting details of various studies, we have attempted to indicate general areas in which work has been done or is in progress.

The use of extensive immunophenotypic patterns or surface profiles as disease signatures for CLL subclassification, prognosis and patient management is discussed with a focus on triaging patients with CLL with progressive disease.","['Huang, Pauline Y', 'Best, O Giles', 'Belov, Larissa', 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Christopherson, Richard I']","['Huang PY', 'Best OG', 'Belov L', 'Mulligan SP', 'Christopherson RI']","['School of Molecular Bioscience, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120403,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/*genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Prognosis']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.631370 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jun;53(6):1046-56. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.631370.

Its success depends on effective pre-transplant conditioning regimens. We previously reported on the efficacy of DNA alkylating agent-nucleoside analog (NA) combinations for conditioning in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We hypothesized that a similar combinatory approach can be used for lymphomas. A combination of busulfan (Bu) with two NAs - clofarabine (Clo), fludarabine (Flu) or gemcitabine (Gem) - resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in lymphoma cell lines. We demonstrated that the [2 NAs + Bu] combination activates a DNA damage response through the ATM-CHK2 and ATM-CHK1 pathways, leading to cell cycle checkpoint activation and apoptosis. Histone modifications and KAP1 phosphorylation are indicative of chromatin relaxation mediated by the nucleoside analogs, which sequentially increase Bu alkylation. Addition of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) enhanced chromatin relaxation through increased histone acetylation and further augmented the cytotoxicity of [2 NAs + Bu]. Our results provide a preclinical basis for a clinical trial on using [2 NAs + Bu +/- SAHA] combinations as conditioning therapy for patients with chemotherapy-refractory lymphoma undergoing HSCT.","['Valdez, Benigno C', 'Murray, David', 'Nieto, Yago', 'Li, Yang', 'Wang, Guiyun', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Andersson, Borje S']","['Valdez BC', 'Murray D', 'Nieto Y', 'Li Y', 'Wang G', 'Champlin RE', 'Andersson BS']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.

Since protein kinase C-beta(II) (PKC-beta(II)) is a key element of BCR signaling, we evaluated the impact of enzastaurin on cell survival. Enzastaurin classically activates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta through inhibition of PKC-beta, Akt and target of rapamycin pathways in cancer cell lines. Here, we show that in primary CLL cells, enzastaurin activates protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) to mediate dephosphorylating events in responding patients. In patients' cells, both PP-2A activation and Bcl-2 dephosphorylation are statistically linked to enzastaurin-induced CLL death. Protein phosphatase-2A inhibition, through pharmacological agents or siRNA, significantly hampers cell death induced by the drug. Despite limited activity in in vitro culture, enzastaurin is able to sensitize CLL cells to fludarabine, even in patients refractory to either agent used alone. These results argue for the use of enzastaurin in combination therapy in patients with CLL.","['Liffraud, Cecile', 'Quillet-Mary, Anne', 'Fournie, Jean-Jacques', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Ysebaert, Loic']","['Liffraud C', 'Quillet-Mary A', 'Fournie JJ', 'Laurent G', 'Ysebaert L']","['Universite Toulouse 3-ERL CNRS, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111206,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.634041 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 May;53(5):966-72. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.634041.

The pathogenesis of de novo (dn-APL) remains unknown; but epidemiologic studies have consistently identified increased body mass index (BMI), younger age, and ethnicity as possible risk factors. We analyzed demographics, clinical features, and treatment responses in a contemporary series of 64 patients treated with all-trans-retinoic acid and anthracycline-based therapy to assess for differences in these two etiologically distinct patient groups. Compared with patients with t-APL (n = 11), those with dn-APL (n = 53) had a greater median BMI (31.33 vs. 28.48), incidence of obesity (60.4% vs. 27.3%) (P = 0.04), and history of hyperlipidemia (45.3% vs. 18.2%) (P = 0.01). Fewer t-APL than dn-APL patients achieved complete remission at 63.6% vs. 92.5% respectively (P = 0.008). This was the result of a higher induction mortality rate of 36.4% vs. 7.5% respectively (P = 0.008). No cases of leukemic resistance were seen in either group. Overall survival (OS) was inferior in t-APL compared with dn-APL at 51% vs. 84%, respectively (P < 0.005), primarily as a result of higher induction mortality. Relapse occurred in nine patients (16.1%) overall, but no relapses occurred in the t-APL cohort. Our observations provide further support for the hypothesis that abnormalities in lipid homeostasis may in some way be of pathogenic importance in dn-APL.

Aberrant expression of hepcidin was found in many diseases, however, there is scant information on hepcidin expression in acute leukemia (AL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 patients with AL which diagnosis according to FAB criteria were studied. Serum hepcidin levels, erythropoietin (EPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), hematological parameters, intracellular and extracellular iron store were evaluated. RESULTS: Hepcidin was elevated significantly with increased iron storage in patients at onset of AL when erythropoiesis was depressed by blast cells, then decreased significantly with AL remission, while soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentration was elevated. Negative correlations were found between serum hepcidin and erythropoietic markers including RBC, Hb, Ret and sTfR. Positive correlations were shown between hepcidin and ferritin, between hepcidin and ratio of sideroblasts, as well as between hepcidin and IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: Hepcidin production was regulated by iron stores, inflammation and erythropoietic activity in AL patients.

Although results have been conflicting, the potential of XMRV as an infectious human retrovirus has raised concerns about transfusion safety. To address this issue, normal and retrovirus-infected blood donors were screened for evidence of XMRV infection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma from 1000 US, 100 human immunodeficiency virus Type 1-infected Cameroonian, and 642 human T-lymphotropic virus Type I (HTLV-I)-infected or uninfected Japanese blood donors as well as 311 sexually transmitted disease diagnostic specimens were screened for antibodies to XMRV gp70 and p15E using chemiluminescent immunoassays (CMIAs). CMIA-reactive samples were evaluated by p30 CMIA, Western blot, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: XMRV seroreactivity was low (0%-0.6%) with the exception of the HTLV-I-infected donors (4.9%). Antibody was detected against only a single XMRV protein (p15E or gp70); none of the seroreactive samples had detectable XMRV pol or env sequences. The elevated seroreactivity in HTLV-I-infected donors was due to an increased p15E seroreactive rate (4.1%). Inspection of XMRV and HTLV sequences revealed a high level of conservation within the immunodominant region (IDR) of the transmembrane protein. In some cases, HTLV IDR peptide competitively reduced the XMRV p15E signal. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the low prevalence of seroreactivity, detection of antibody to only a single XMRV protein and the absence of XMRV sequences, this study finds no compelling evidence of XMRV in normal or retrovirus-infected blood donors. The increased p15E seroreactivity observed in HTLV infection is likely due to cross-reactive antibodies.","['Qiu, Xiaoxing', 'Swanson, Priscilla', 'Tang, Ning', 'Leckie, Gregor W', 'Devare, Sushil G', 'Schochetman, Gerald', 'Hackett, John Jr']","['Qiu X', 'Swanson P', 'Tang N', 'Leckie GW', 'Devare SG', 'Schochetman G', 'Hackett J Jr']","['Infectious Diseases R&D, Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064, USA. xiaoxing.qiu@abbott.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20111024,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Antibodies/blood', 'Blood Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Blood Safety', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/blood/epidemiology/virology', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Population', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/*blood/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral/blood/epidemiology/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03395.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2012 Feb;52(2):307-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03395.x.

CLL is an exclusive accumulative disorder marked by low proliferative activity and gradual accumulation of clonal B-lymphocytes blocked in the early (G0, G1) phases of the cell cycle. The heterogeneous clinical course indicates diverse in vivo biology of the leukemic cell and suggests that CLL represents diverse behavior. Understanding the molecular biology of the disease has provided insight into the mechanisms that promote tumorigenesis, specifically defective apoptotic signaling pathways. In this review we attempt to provide a comprehensive discussion of CLL including the origin of malignant lymphocytes, the apoptotic defects and the mechanisms leading to disease progression. We further discuss the therapeutic options, focusing mainly on targeted therapy using novel agents. Finally, we suggest future directions for treatment that utilize the understanding of the disease biology.","['Masood, Aisha', 'Shahshahan, Mohammad A', 'Jazirehi, Ali R']","['Masood A', 'Shahshahan MA', 'Jazirehi AR']","['The Tisch Cancer Institute, Bone Marrow Transplant, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NY, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],['1R21CA149938-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Deliv,Current drug delivery,101208455,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/07/07 06:00,['2011/10/26 06:00'],"['2011/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDD/E-Pub/00137 [pii]', '10.2174/156720112798376050 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Deliv. 2012 Jan;9(1):30-40. doi: 10.2174/156720112798376050.,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the tumor suppressor, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, is reduced or abolished in gastric carcinomas, in association with an increased level of lymphatic invasion, development of higher pTNM staging, and unfavorable prognosis. Herein, we investigated the relationship between the extent of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and the status of PML protein expression in advanced gastric carcinoma. We observed higher numbers of infiltrating T-cells in gastric carcinoma tissues in which PML expression was reduced or abolished, compared to tissues positive for PML. The extent of T-cell migration toward culture supernatants obtained from interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma-stimulated gastric carcinoma cell lines was additionally affected by expression of PML in vitro. Interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10) expression was increased in gastric carcinoma tissues displaying reduced PML levels. Moreover, both Pml knockout and knockdown cells displayed enhanced IP-10 mRNA and protein expression in the presence of IFN-gamma. PML knockdown increased IFN-gamma-mediated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-1 (STAT-1) binding to the IP-10 promoter, resulting in elevated transcription of the IP-10 gene. Conversely, PML IV protein expression suppressed IP-10 promoter activation. Based on these results, we propose that loss of PML protein expression in gastric cancer cells contributes to increased IP-10 transcription via enhancement of STAT-1 activity, which, in turn, promotes lymphocyte trafficking within tumor regions.","['Kim, Hee Ja', 'Song, Dong Eun', 'Lim, Seul Ye', 'Lee, Sung-Hee', 'Kang, Jihee Lee', 'Lee, Sun Jung', 'Benveniste, Etty N', 'Choi, Youn-Hee']","['Kim HJ', 'Song DE', 'Lim SY', 'Lee SH', 'Kang JL', 'Lee SJ', 'Benveniste EN', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS050665/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS50665/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/drug effects/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*deficiency/metabolism']",PMC3192173,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0026264 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-07115 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26264. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026264.

However, as previously shown, the endosome acidification inhibitors did not inhibit these viral infections in XC cells. It is generally accepted that the ecotropic MLV infection in XC cells occurs at the plasma membrane. Because cathepsin proteases are activated by low pH in acidic endosomes, the acidification inhibitors may inhibit the viral infections by suppressing cathepsin protease activation. The acidification inhibitors attenuated the activities of cathepsin proteases B and L in TE671 cells, but not in XC cells. Processing of cathepsin protease L was suppressed by the acidification inhibitor in NIH3T3 cells, but again not in XC cells. These results indicate that cathepsin proteases are activated without endosome acidification in XC cells. Treatment with an endocytosis inhibitor or knockdown of dynamin 2 expression by siRNAs suppressed MLV infections in all examined cells including XC cells. Furthermore, endosomal cathepsin proteases were required for these viral infections in XC cells as other susceptible cells.

We used complementary in vivo, cell-based and structural analyses to compare the abilities of activated Notch1-4 to support T cell development, induce T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL), and maintain T-ALL cell growth and survival. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We find that the activated intracellular domains of Notch1-4 (ICN1-4) all support T cell development in mice and thymic organ culture. However, unlike ICN1-3, ICN4 fails to induce T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) and is unable to rescue the growth of Notch1-dependent T-ALL cell lines. The ICN4 phenotype is mimicked by weak gain-of-function forms of Notch1, suggesting that it stems from a failure to transactivate one or more critical target genes above a necessary threshold. Experiments with chimeric receptors demonstrate that the Notch ankyrin repeat domains differ in their leukemogenic potential, and that this difference correlates with activation of Myc, a direct Notch target that has an important role in Notch-associated T-ALL. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that the leukemogenic potentials of Notch receptors vary, and that this functional difference stems in part from divergence among the highly conserved ankyrin repeats, which influence the transactivation of specific target genes involved in leukemogenesis.","['Aster, Jon C', 'Bodnar, Nick', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'Karnell, Fredrick', 'Milholland, John M', 'Maillard, Ivan', 'Histen, Gavin', 'Nam, Yunsun', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Aster JC', 'Bodnar N', 'Xu L', 'Karnell F', 'Milholland JM', 'Maillard I', 'Histen G', 'Nam Y', 'Blacklow SC', 'Pear WS']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America. jaster@rics.bwh.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007753/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111013,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Ankyrin Repeat', 'Biophysical Phenomena/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*pathology', '*Genetic Variation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Thymocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",PMC3192765,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025645 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-15229 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25645. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025645.
