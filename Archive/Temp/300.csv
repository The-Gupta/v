Two doubly-substituted, 2-fluoroadenine-containing analogs of MTA, 5'-deoxy-2-fluoroadenosine (5'-dFAdo) and 5'-deoxy-5'-iodo-2-fluoroadenosine (5'-IFAdo), were synthesized and studied as substrates of MTAPase: their reaction with this enzyme resulted in the liberation of the cytotoxic base, 2-fluoroadenine, as well as potentially cytotoxic analogs of 5-methylribose-1-phosphate. The activities of these MTA analogs were compared to that of the singly-substituted analog, 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthio-2-fluoroadenosine (5'-MTFAdo). The cytotoxic action of these MTA analogs depended primarily on their conversion to 2-fluoroadenine-containing nucleotides, as a cell line that contains both MTAPase and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) activity (HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia) readily converted these MTA analogs to 2-fluoroadenine-containing nucleotides (especially 2-fluoroadenosine triphosphate) and was highly sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of all three compounds (IC50 values in the 10(-8) M range), whereas cell lines lacking MTAPase (CCRF-CEM human T-cell leukemia) or APRT (HL-60/aprt1 cells) did not form analog nucleotides and were relatively insensitive to these compounds (IC50 values in the 10(-5) M range). The doubly-substituted analogs were not more growth inhibitory than 5'-MTFAdo in wild type HL-60 cells as the potent effects of 2-fluoroadenine may mask the activity of the 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate analogs generated in the reaction of these compounds with MTAPase. 5'-dFAdo and 5'-IFAdo also were irreversible inhibitors of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which may explain in part the weak but observable growth inhibitory action of these compounds against MTAPase-deficient cell lines.","['Savarese, T M', 'Cannistra, A J', 'Parks, R E Jr', 'Secrist, J A 3rd', 'Shortnacy, A T', 'Montgomery, J A']","['Savarese TM', 'Cannistra AJ', 'Parks RE Jr', 'Secrist JA 3rd', 'Shortnacy AT', 'Montgomery JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", ""64183-27-3 (2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine)"", 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'EC 2.4.2.7 (Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism', 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deoxyadenosines/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Pentosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thionucleosides/*metabolism/therapeutic use']",1987/06/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/06/15 00:00'],"['1987/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(87)90484-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(87)90484-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1987 Jun 15;36(12):1881-93. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(87)90484-9.,,"['CA 07340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of the inducer hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA), this accumulation of decarboxylated AdoMet was associated with a concomitant and proportional increase in DNA hypomethylation. In the presence of HMBA, DFMO, which stimulates the erythrodifferentiation of MEL cells, enhanced the differentiation-associated DNA hypomethylation. However, this differentiation-associated DNA hypomethylation was neither temporally nor quantitatively correlated with the accumulation of decarboxylated AdoMet in these cells.

Diagnosis may be difficult as blood and bone marrow haematology can remain normal, with no evidence of a serum paraprotein band or Bence-Jones proteinuria by routine electrophoresis. Using the technique of isoelectric focusing in agarose, followed by immunofixation, monoclonal free light chains can be found in the urine of 44% and 74% respectively of patients with NHL and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but not in normal individuals. Three patients, two with typical severe primary SS and the third with several features of SS including abnormal sialography and reduced tear secretion, developed B cell NHL of parotid and/or lung. Using the above method on concentrated urine specimens, monoclonal free light chains of the same class as that demonstrated on the tumour cells were found to be present in each patient's urine. In one patient the level of urinary free light chains was monitored and found to correlate with disease activity. Using similar techniques no monoclonal light chains could be found in the urine from a further 10 cases of primary SS and 18 cases of SS secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, all of whom had no clinical evidence of lymphoma. Screening of SS patients' urine by the method described for monoclonal urinary free light chains may provide an early diagnostic clue to the development of lymphoma and be a means of tumour monitoring.","['Walters, M T', 'Stevenson, F K', 'Herbert, A', 'Cawley, M I', 'Smith, J L']","['Walters MT', 'Stevenson FK', 'Herbert A', 'Cawley MI', 'Smith JL']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Norway,Scand J Rheumatol Suppl,Scandinavian journal of rheumatology.

The complement of this sequence, in the reverse orientation, is found at an identical location in light-chain variable-region genes. This sequence element is thought to be involved in the lymphoid-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes. Analysis of nuclear extracts from both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells in a gel migration inhibition assay, using an immunoglobulin promoter region fragment containing the octamer, reveals multiple migration-retarded species that represent specific DNA-protein complexes. The number and relative level of these complexes vary with cell type; some complexes are detected with all extracts, whereas one complex is lymphoid-specific and may represent an interaction involved in the lymphoid-restricted expression of immunoglobulin genes. Mitogenic stimulation of a B-lymphoid line can increase the level of the protein responsible for this lymphoid-specific complex. Analysis of the complexes detected in the gel migration inhibition assay by DNase I protection (""footprinting"") has revealed that all of these DNA-protein complexes involve contact of the protein with the nucleotides of the octamer. One complex, present in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells, displays an additional DNA-protein contact adjacent to the octamer.

The major mRNA that encodes the bovine beta 2 subunit is 1.7 kilobases in length. It is expressed at lower levels than beta 1 subunit mRNA in all tissues examined. The beta 1 and beta 2 messages are expressed in cloned human cell lines. Hybridization of cDNA probes to bovine DNA showed that beta 1 and beta 2 are encoded by separate genes. The amino acid sequences for the bovine and human beta 2 subunit are identical, as are the amino acid sequences for the bovine and human beta 1 subunit.

The effect of the factors could be neutralized by antibodies to P15E, one of the structural envelope proteins of Murine Leukemia Viruses (MuLV). This indicates that these low molecular weight factors derived from the tumors are related to P15E. In this study, 35 biopsy specimens of head and neck carcinomas were subjected to an indirect immunoperoxidase assay, in order for P15E-like material to be detected morphologically. All head and neck carcinomas gave positive results. Sixty-three percent of other carcinomas (used as controls) were positive as well. P15E-like material was also expressed in epithelia-overlaying inflammatory responses. Healthy epithelia were not positive. This report thus supports the view that P15E-like molecules can be easily detected in cancerous disease--not only by way of biologic isolation, but also by use of immunohistochemical techniques. Since the factor is not specific for the malignant state, it cannot be used as a tumor marker. Possibly involved in the pathogenesis of cancerous disease, its relationship to growth factors, oncogenes, and the immune system needs further clarification.","['Tan, I B', 'Drexhage, H A', 'Mullink, R', 'Hensen-Logmans, S', 'De Haan-Meulman, M', 'Snow, G B', 'Balm, A J']","['Tan IB', 'Drexhage HA', 'Mullink R', 'Hensen-Logmans S', 'De Haan-Meulman M', 'Snow GB', 'Balm AJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,8508176,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (virus structural protein p15)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biopsy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Products, gag', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*analysis', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/019459988709600304 [doi]'],ppublish,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1987 Mar;96(3):251-5. doi: 10.1177/019459988709600304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suggested that the two species of plasminogen activator secreted by leukemic cells might be produced by normal cells at distinct stages of differentiation.

Lysis of both the NK-sensitive K562 erythroleukemia line and the relatively insensitive renal carcinoma line Cur by nonadherent peripheral blood lymphocytes was significantly enhanced as a result of an 18-hr preincubation with either rTNF alpha or recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL 2). When cells were preincubated with rTNF alpha and low doses of rIL 2 (1 to 10 U/ml), marked additional augmentation of lysis of both targets was noted which was greater than that caused by either cytokine alone. Similar results were observed when responses of CD16+ large granular lymphocytes selected with the fluorescence-activated cell sorter after staining with the NK-specific monoclonal antibody Leu-11 were examined, indicating that the action of the cytokines was directly on the cytotoxic cells. Augmentation of tumor cell lysis could not be ascribed to a cytolytic activity of rTNF alpha on the targets, because no combination of rIL 2, rTNF alpha, or interferon-gamma caused lysis of K562 or Cur. By flow cytometric analysis, it was found that expression of IL 2 receptors was induced on purified CD16+ large granular lymphocytes by rTNF alpha alone and to an even greater degree by the combination of rTNF alpha and rIL 2. Additional analysis of the expression of surface antigens and blocking studies with monoclonal antibodies showed that enhanced tumor cell lysis was not caused by the augmentation of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1-mediated effector/target interactions. These data indicate that rTNF alpha alone, or in combination with rIL 2, directly augments NK cytotoxic activity.","['Ostensen, M E', 'Thiele, D L', 'Lipsky, P E']","['Ostensen ME', 'Thiele DL', 'Lipsky PE']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Renal Cell/pathology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/pathology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",1987/06/15 00:00,1987/06/15 00:01,['1987/06/15 00:00'],"['1987/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Jun 15;138(12):4185-91.,,['AM01251/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

GPIIb is a two-chain protein containing disulfide-linked alpha and beta subunits. GPIIIa is a single chain protein. These proteins are synthesized in the bone marrow by megakaryocytes, but the study of their synthesis has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining enriched population of megakaryocytes in large numbers. To examine the biosynthesis and processing of GPIIb-IIIa, purified human megakaryocytes were isolated from liquid cultures of cryopreserved leukocytes stem cell concentrates from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine pulse-chase-labeled cell extracts by antibodies specific for the alpha or beta subunits of GPIIb indicated that GPIIb was derived from a precursor of Mr 130,000 that contains the alpha and beta subunits. This precursor was converted to GPIIb with a half-life of 4-5 h. No precursor form of GPIIIa was detected.

As a result, a saturable process of not only influx but also efflux of vincristine was observed for the first time with both cell lines, suggesting the existence of a carrier-mediated system for influx and efflux. With increasing extracellular drug concentrations, the contribution of the mediated transport to the total flux was decreased and that of the unsaturable process, that is, simple diffusion, was increased. It should be particularly noted that the Km and Vmax values of efflux in the resistant cells were significantly less and greater, respectively, than those of the sensitive cells, providing a biochemical basis for enhanced efflux as a mechanism of multidrug-resistance.

While the uptake rate of induced cells is 26 atoms of iron per one transferrin receptor per hour, in non-induced cells, the rate is only 15 atoms of iron. Induced cells retain all iron, with endocytosis and transferrin release occurring at the same rate. By contrast, the rate of iron release from non-induced cells is slower and part of the iron bound to transferrin returns from the cell. Haem inhibits iron uptake in induced cells and has no effect on non-induced cells. Its regulatory role is apparently confined to the erythroid cell with massive haemoglobin synthesis.

To determine whether current BMT recipients require TPN during the early recovery period, we conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing TPN and an individualized enteral feeding program (counseling, high protein snacks and/or tube feeding). Nutritional assessment included measurement of serum proteins, anthropometry, and body composition analysis. For the latter, total body water and extracellular fluid were measured by standard radioisotope dilution techniques and used to quantitate body cell mass and body fat plus extracellular solids (FAT + ECS). In 27 TPN patients, body composition 28 days after BMT, expressed as a percentage of baseline, was body cell mass, 100%, extracellular fluid, 108%, FAT + ECS, 108%, and in 30 enteral feeding program patients, was body cell mass, 93%, extracellular fluid, 104%, and FAT + ECS, 94%. Only the difference in FAT + ECS was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Compared to the enteral feeding program, TPN was associated with more days of diuretic use, more frequent hyperglycemia, and more frequent catheter removal (prompted by catheter-related complications), but less frequent hypomagnesemia. There were no significant differences in the rate of hematopoietic recovery, length of hospitalization, or survival, but nutrition-related costs were 2.3 times greater in the TPN group. We conclude that TPN is not clearly superior to individualized enteral feeding and recommend that TPN be reserved for BMT patients who demonstrate intolerance to enteral feeding.","['Szeluga, D J', 'Stuart, R K', 'Brookmeyer, R', 'Utermohlen, V', 'Santos, G W']","['Szeluga DJ', 'Stuart RK', 'Brookmeyer R', 'Utermohlen V', 'Santos GW']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Diuretics)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Water/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Diuretics/therapeutic use', '*Enteral Nutrition', 'Extracellular Space/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Prospective Studies']",1987/06/15 00:00,1987/06/15 00:01,['1987/06/15 00:00'],"['1987/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jun 15;47(12):3309-16.,,['CA06973-H/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using radiolabeled IL2 and monoclonal antibodies reactive with IL2 membrane receptors we show that CLL cells, after their activation in vitro, express IL2 receptors of a high- as well as a low-affinity type, exactly as has been reported for normal T and B blasts. In three of the four reported cases, CLL proliferation (measured with 3H-thymidine incorporation) depended on the addition of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) to activate the cells and IL2 (optimal concentration, 10 to 100 U IL2/mL). In contrast, the cells of the fourth case of CLL (CLL-4) proliferated in an autonomous fashion, ie, without a need for PHA and IL2 in culture. Specific blocking of the IL2-binding sites with anti-IL2 receptor monoclonal antibodies almost completely inhibited the proliferation of these cells, which indicated that functional IL2 receptors were required for the autonomous proliferation. The demonstration of low concentrations of IL2 activity in the culture medium conditioned by the cells suggests that endogenous IL2 had been responsible for the spontaneous 3H-thymidine uptake by the CLL cells of patient 4. However, we were unable to extract IL2 mRNA from the cells (neither fresh nor after various in vitro incubations) in quantities detectable by Northern blot analysis that would prove that the CLL cells of patient 4 were actively synthesizing IL2 during culture. Thus, individual cases of B CLL are subject to variable growth regulation involving functional IL2 receptors on the cell surface: after activation with PHA the cells respond to exogenous IL2 in a fashion similar to normal B lymphocytes, or the cells are stimulated by endogenous IL2 (or an IL2-like activity) and do not require activation with PHA.","['Touw, I', 'Dorssers, L', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Touw I', 'Dorssers L', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78544-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jun;69(6):1667-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biochemical evidence in conjunction with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/thermospray mass spectrometry analyses indicates that the product is 12-keto-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (KHT). Both KHT and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) were produced when arachidonic acid was incubated with cell lysates obtained from differentiated HL-60 granulocytes. Indomethacin and the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor UK-38485 inhibited the production of both metabolites, whereas ethacrynic acid inhibited only the production of KHT. In 100,000 g supernatant fractions, obtained from either untreated or differentiated cells, KHT was produced when HHT was used as substrate. The addition of exogenous NAD, but not NADP, to incubations caused a significant increase in the production of KHT coincident with a decrease in the level of HHT. These data suggest that, in both differentiated and undifferentiated HL-60 cells, an NAD-dependent enzyme, apparently 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), is expressed and catalyzes the conversion of HHT to KHT. In differentiated HL-60 cells, this metabolite is produced from arachidonic acid through a multi-enzymatic process involving the activities of cyclooxygenase, thromboxane synthetase and 15-PGDH. The production of KHT from arachidonic acid in undifferentiated HL-60 cells is probably limited, therefore, by the virtual absence of cyclooxygenase activity in these cells.","['Agins, A P', 'Thomas, M J', 'Edmonds, C G', 'McCloskey, J A']","['Agins AP', 'Thomas MJ', 'Edmonds CG', 'McCloskey JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '103374-38-5 (12-keto-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(87)90241-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(87)90241-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1987 Jun 1;36(11):1799-805. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(87)90241-3.,,"['CA-13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-33532/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML, furthermore, patients who achieved CR had a higher number of CFU-F than patients without CR, suggesting that the CFU-F level at diagnosis may contribute to the prediction of the likelihood of remission induction in patients with AML.","['Katsuno, M', 'Hirata, J', 'Kaneko, S', 'Nishimura, J', 'Motomura, S', 'Ibayashi, H']","['Katsuno M', 'Hirata J', 'Kaneko S', 'Nishimura J', 'Motomura S', 'Ibayashi H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000206053 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1986;76(4):185-91. doi: 10.1159/000206053.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This antibody, prepared against the rheumatoid factor (RF) paraprotein Sie, recognizes a crossreactive idiotype on 48% of human IgM RF paraproteins, but does not react with IgM paraproteins without RF activity or substantially with normal pooled immunoglobulin. The 17.109-reactive idiotype is a marker for a kappa III variable-region gene, designated V kappa RF, that is conserved in outbred human populations. In a limited study of 31 CLL patients, the leukemic cells from 5 of 20 patients with kappa light chain-expressing CLL were recognized by the 17.109 monoclonal antibody. Despite having malignant cells specifically reactive with this antibody, patients with 17.109-positive CLL did not have elevated serum levels of circulating antibody bearing 17.109-reactive determinants. Total RNAs isolated from the CLL B lymphocytes, or from hybridomas produced by fusing the CLL cells with the WI-L2-729-HF2 cell line, were fractionated electrophoretically and examined by blot hybridization. Under stringent hybridization conditions capable of discerning a single base-pair mismatch, RNA from the 17.109-idiotype-positive CLL cells hybridized to synthetic oligonucleotide probes corresponding to framework and complementary-determining regions in the V kappa RF gene. The high frequency of the 17.109-associated idiotype and the V kappa RF gene in CLL suggests that the disease may arise from B lymphocytes that express a restricted set of inherited immunoglobulin variable-region genes with little or no somatic mutation.","['Kipps, T J', 'Fong, S', 'Tomhave, E', 'Chen, P P', 'Goldfien, R D', 'Carson, D A']","['Kipps TJ', 'Fong S', 'Tomhave E', 'Chen PP', 'Goldfien RD', 'Carson DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*immunology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.84.9.2916 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(9):2916-20. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.9.2916.,PMC304771,"['AG00279/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR25443/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR38475/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal induction of sister-chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations by mutagens in an ionizing radiation-sensitive mutant (M10) and an alkylating agent-sensitive mutant (MS1).,107-16,"To determine the mutual relationships between cell survival and induction of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) as well as chromosomal aberrations (CAs), mutagen-induced SCEs and CAs were analyzed in an ionizing radiation-sensitive mutant (M10) and an alkylating agent-sensitive mutant (MS 1) isolated from mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. The levels of CA induction in both mutants strictly corresponded to the sensitivity to lethal effects of mutagens, except that caffeine-induced CAs in M10 are considerably lower than those in L5178Y. The results clearly indicate that except for caffeine-induced CAs in M10, mutagen-induced lethal lesions are responsible for CA induction. In contrast, SCE induction in mutants was complicated. In M10, hypersensitive to killing by gamma-rays, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), but not sensitive to UV or caffeine, the frequency of SCEs induced by gamma-rays was barely higher than that in L5178Y, and the frequencies of MMS- and UV-induced SCEs were similar to those in L5178Y, but 4NQO- and caffeine-induced SCEs were markedly lower than those in L5178Y. MS 1, which is hypersensitive to MMS and caffeine, but not sensitive to UV or 4NQO, responded to caffeine with an enhanced frequency of SCEs and had a normal frequency of MMS-induced SCEs, but a reduced frequency of UV- and 4NQO-induced SCEs. Thus, susceptibility to SCE induction by mutagens is not necessarily correlated with sensitivity of mutants to cell killing and/or CA induction by mutagens. Furthermore, the spontaneous levels of SCEs are lower in M10 and higher in MS 1 than that in L5178Y (Tsuji et al., 1987). Based on these results, we speculate that M10 may be partially defective in the processes for the formation of SCEs caused by mutagens. On the other hand, MS 1 may modify SCE formation-related lesions induced by UV and 4NQO to some repair intermediates that do not cause SCE formation. In addition, MMS-induced lethal lesions in MS 1 may not be responsible for SCE induction whereas caffeine-induced lethal lesions are closely correlated with SCE induction. Thus, the lesions or mechanisms involved in SCE production are in part different from those responsible for cell lethality or CA production.","['Tsuji, H', 'Takahashi, E', 'Tsuji, S', 'Tobari, I', 'Shiomi, T', 'Sato, K']","['Tsuji H', 'Takahashi E', 'Tsuji S', 'Tobari I', 'Shiomi T', 'Sato K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '56-57-5 (4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide)', 'AT5C31J09G (Methyl Methanesulfonate)']",IM,"['4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Methyl Methanesulfonate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/*drug effects/*radiation effects']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0027-5107(87)90092-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(87)90092-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1987 May;178(1):107-16. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(87)90092-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This abnormality was only present in the leukemia cells of the patient and correlated with the clinical course of the disease. The breakpoint on chromosome 8 occurred within c-myc intron 1, between 790 and 638 base pairs upstream of c-myc exon 2. This breakpoint position was the nearest to the c-myc exon 2 so far described in Burkitt's type lymphoma-leukemias, and it mapped very near to the location of a major cryptic promoter used by truncated c-myc genes. In spite of what was detected in a human lymphoma cell line (Manca) carrying a similar rearrangement, in this case the amount of c-myc transcript was not increased compared to an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed normal lymphoblastoid cell line obtained from the same patient. This may in part be due to the breakpoint position and to the fact that the efficiency of the major cryptic promoter present within the first intron could have been affected by the translocation event. Finally, as previously suggested by others, the phenotype expressed by the leukemia cells supported the notion that this particular type of rearrangement (linking together the c-myc gene and the Ig heavy-chain gene enhancer element) may be associated with a subgroup of B-ALLs showing an immunologic phenotype relatively more immature than that of classical B-ALL.","['Guerrasio, A', 'Avanzi, G C', 'Pegoraro, L', 'Estivill, X', 'Serra, A', 'Giubellino, M C', 'Fierro, M T', 'Novarino, A', 'Foa, R', 'Saglio, G']","['Guerrasio A', 'Avanzi GC', 'Pegoraro L', 'Estivill X', 'Serra A', 'Giubellino MC', 'Fierro MT', 'Novarino A', 'Foa R', 'Saglio G']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 May;78(5):845-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD1c antigen recognized by the M241 monoclonal antibody was detected on the circulating mononuclear cells of three children with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). Two-color immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that M241 expression (43 to 95%) was limited to cells expressing the B cell-restricted antigens B4 (CD19), B1 (CD20), and surface immunoglobulin. To confirm M241 expression on normal cells of the B lineage rather than aberrant expression limited to SCID B cells, its expression was demonstrated serologically and biochemically on purified B cells from spleen, tonsil, and peripheral blood. Parallel analyses with monoclonal antibodies NA1/34 and 4A76 demonstrated that the CD1a and CD1b molecules were negative on all B cells that were studied.

This study suggests that a subset of CD1 antigens detected by M241 (CD1c) may represent a human analog of a murine Qa antigen due to its extended distribution on normal peripheral B cells.","['Small, T N', 'Knowles, R W', 'Keever, C', 'Kernan, N A', 'Collins, N', ""O'Reilly, R J"", 'Dupont, B', 'Flomenberg, N']","['Small TN', 'Knowles RW', 'Keever C', 'Kernan NA', 'Collins N', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Dupont B', 'Flomenberg N']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Q surface antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 May 1;138(9):2864-8.,,"['CA-22507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33050/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we show that CD5 monoclonal antibodies cause increased intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in T cells. An increase in [Ca2+]i occurred within 1 min in indo-1-loaded PBMC after the addition of CD5 monoclonal antibodies and cross-linking with a second step anti-mouse kappa light chain antibody. Cross-linking of CD5 was effective when done directly on the cell surface or by the administration of preformed soluble complexes that contained CD5 antibodies. Calcium mobilization induced by suboptimal concentrations of CD3 antibodies was specifically augmented and sustained by CD5 antibodies, although the enhancement was modest in magnitude. When cell surface phenotype was correlated with calcium mobilization, it was found that the CD5 response was restricted to CD5+/CD3+ cells, and that approximately 90% of CD5+ cells had responded. CD5-induced calcium mobilization was found to differ from CD3 stimulation in that EGTA entirely ablated the CD5 response, whereas the CD3 response was resistant to EGTA, indicating that the CD5-induced increased [Ca2+]i is derived primarily or entirely from extracellular calcium. CD5-stimulated calcium mobilization also differed from CD3 in that the CD5 response was inhibited by pretreatment with phorbol myristate acetate, whereas the CD3 response was not, suggesting that depletion of protein kinase C causes an uncoupling of signal transduction between CD5 and calcium channels. Finally, experiments were done with T cells after antigenic modulation of the CD3 or CD5 molecules. Unexpectedly, both the CD5 and the CD3 responses were ablated on CD3-modulated cells, whereas only the CD5 response was ablated on CD5-modulated cells. In addition, several Cd5+/CD3- T cell leukemia lines also failed to respond to CD5 stimulation, providing further evidence which indicates that the CD5 response depends on the cell surface expression of CD3 or a CD3-associated structure. These findings suggest that one mechanism for CD5-induced augmentation of mitogen-stimulated T cell proliferation involves increased [Ca2+]i which is distinct from but interdependent with that induced by stimulation of the CD3 molecule.","['June, C H', 'Rabinovitch, P S', 'Ledbetter, J A']","['June CH', 'Rabinovitch PS', 'Ledbetter JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Indoles)', 'N18RMK75W1 (indo-1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cytoplasm/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 May 1;138(9):2782-92.,,['AG 01751/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of IFN to culture resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of both normal and CML BFUe and CFUmix. The maximum dose-dependent suppression of CML BFUe (92% +/- 4%) and CML CFUmix (100%) exceeded the maximum suppression of normal BFUe (40% +/- 4%) and normal CFU mix (68% +/- 6%) (p less than 0.001 and p = 0.008). In parallel studies, CML BFUe and CFUmix were cultured with and without IFN, and cells recovered from culture were examined cytogenetically. Treatment of CML bone marrow cells (BMC) with IFN resulted in an increase in the proportion (p less than 0.001) of Ph1-negative metaphases when compared to control cells grown in the absence of IFN. Recombinant gamma interferon has a significant antiproliferative effect against CML bone marrow-derived stem cell progenitors in vitro, and the addition of this agent to culture increases our ability to identify a cell population derived from a Ph1-negative progenitor pool.

The antibiotic inhibited not only the growth of transplantable murine tumors and their metastases to the lung but also human mammary tumors inoculated into nude mice. KZM-A became immediately distributed to the main organs of mice, and a certain quantity of the antibiotic was inactivated by binding to high-molecular-weight substances such as albumin. A large quantity of KZM-A was carried to the liver and excreted into the bile, but was then reabsorbed by the small intestine. The growth of tumor metastases (L5178Y cells) in the liver was suppressed by KZM-A. The antibiotic induced severe diarrhea by causing necrosis and/or lysis of the mucous membrane of the small intestine. In contrast to this, the degree of myelotoxicity was relatively slight.

The six cases were selected from a series of 38 specimens diagnosed as LBL based on morphologic criteria and further subclassified by the use of an extensive panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Although the morphologic features in all six cases were similar to those previously reported for LBL, their expression of NK-associated antigens was unique. All cases were positive with anti-Leu 11b, an antibody which appears to define a specific subtype of lymphocytes considered to have NK function; and all cases expressed T11, a T-cell-restricted antigen. The most commonly encountered immunophenotype of our cases of LBL was: Leu 11b+, T11+, Leu7+, TdT+, Leu 3a+, Ia+, pre-B-, and B-. As compared with more classical LBL of T-cell type, LBL of NK-cell type in our series occurred primarily in females and non-whites. Whereas treatment of classical LBL by multi-agent chemotherapy may lead to long-term survival, only two of our six patients were long-term survivors. The data derived from this study raise the possibility that LBL with the antigenic phenotype of NK cells may represent a biologic subtype of LBL.","['Sheibani, K', 'Winberg, C D', 'Burke, J S', 'Nathwani, B N', 'Blayney, D W', 'Van de Velde, S', 'Swartz, W G', 'Rappaport, H']","['Sheibani K', 'Winberg CD', 'Burke JS', 'Nathwani BN', 'Blayney DW', 'Van de Velde S', 'Swartz WG', 'Rappaport H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology', 'Male']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90183-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(4):371-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90183-4.,,"['CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells have been found in reactive and neoplastic conditions. Three cases of PTC lymphomas have so far been reported. All of them were complicated by a myelomonocytic leukemia leading to the assumption of a functional relationship between PTC and the myeloid system. The immunologic phenotype of PTC, as revealed on frozen tumor tissue sections, comprised the expression of CD5 (T1), CD4 (T4), and HLA-DR, but not CD8 (T8) and CD2 (T11) and suggested an affiliation to the T cell system. Extending our previous report on one of these cases we here present the first study on the immunological marker profile of suspended PTC. The employment of unfractionated or PTC-enriched tumor cell suspensions rendered possible the application of a panel of monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) on both fixed and unfixed cells and enabled us to allocate various markers either to the intracytoplasmic or surface domain of this cell type. Our results suggest that PTC from our case rest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. They express the transferrin receptor, but not the Il-2 receptor (CD25) or the nuclear antigen Ki-67. No T cell antigen was demonstrated on the surface of unfixed suspended PTC. Under these conditions only HLA-DR and a predominantly monocytic antigen (CD36/moAb 5F1) were identified. Fixed cells, however, showed a weak cytoplasmic reactivity for CD5 and two myelomonocytic antigens (CD15/moAb 1G10 and CD14/moAb My4). Our findings do not sustain positive evidence for a T cell nature of PTC. Whether their phenotypical pattern indicates terminal differentiation with concomitant loss of T cell antigens or points to a cytogenetic relationship of PTC to the myeloid system, remains speculative. Until the cytogenesis of PTC is clarified we propose the noncommitted term ""plasmacytoid T-zone cells"" for this elusive cell type.","['Beiske, K', 'Munthe-Kaas, A', 'Davies, C D', 'Marton, P F', 'Godal, T']","['Beiske K', 'Munthe-Kaas A', 'Davies CD', 'Marton PF', 'Godal T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/ultrastructure', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma Cells/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/ultrastructure']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1987 Apr;56(4):381-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of inducible systems is facilitated by optimal growth conditions in order that whatever differentiation is observed may be attributed to a specific effect of the inducer, rather than to a nonspecific effect of adverse growth conditions. To investigate the role of CO2 supply in an inducible system, the K562 human leukemia cell line inducible for hemoglobin synthesis was studied at 10%, 5% and 1.5% CO2 concentrations. The lower the CO2 concentration, the higher the percentage of benzidine-positive cells but the slower the growth rate. This increase in benzidine positivity reflected hemoglobin synthesis as indicated by incorporation of 3H-leucine into globin chains. If, in addition to reducing CO2 concentration, the complete medium was replaced by a bicarbonate-free medium, the percentage of benzidine-positive cells was further increased and growth further slowed. However, if endogenously produced CO2 was retained by sealing the culture vessel, these effects were mitigated. Since addition of ribosides blocked these effects, the mechanism for these effects appears to be inhibition of riboside biosynthesis due to the depletion of CO2 as a substrate. The implication of this work is that, for reproducibility in studies of inducible systems in which reduction of proliferation may itself increase the probability of differentiation, the CO2 tension, the bicarbonate concentration in the medium and the rate of egress of endogenously produced CO2 must be kept constant.","['Farley, B A', 'Ohlsson-Wilhelm, B M', 'Rowley, P T']","['Farley BA', 'Ohlsson-Wilhelm BM', 'Rowley PT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)']",IM,"['Carbon Dioxide/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ribonucleosides/biosynthesis/pharmacology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530050104 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1987 Jan;5(1):27-34. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530050104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Administration of 2 X molar cysteine i.v. or i.p. to mafosfamide-treated animals was even more effective against its lethal toxicity (LD50 i.p. 1800 mg/kg and i.v. 1130 mg/kg). Bone marrow toxicity (severe leukocytopenia) was partially abolished by both thiols. Also the therapeutic efficacy of act. CP against L1210 leukemia in DBA2 mice was reduced by 50% in the presence of cysteine and of mesna. Compared with mesna the higher detoxification effect of cysteine is attributed to its longer half-life (t1/2 20 min vs 12 min of mesna) and presumably an accumulation of cysteine in some cell systems (distribution coefficient 1.20 ml/g vs 0.68 ml/g of mesna). Nevertheless, our study clearly demonstrates a distinct systemic deactivation of act. CP by mesna, which might be of clinical relevance.","['Wagner, T', 'Zink, M', 'Schwieder, G']","['Wagner T', 'Zink M', 'Schwieder G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'NR7O1405Q9 (Mesna)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Cysteine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mercaptoethanol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Mesna/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Platelet Count/drug effects', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/pharmacology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00391439 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1987;113(2):160-5. doi: 10.1007/BF00391439.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, we analyzed the configuration of both immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor beta-chain (T beta) gene in these 7 AUL cases. Three cases had no rearrangement of Ig or T beta genes which was suggestive of non-lymphoid origin of these cases. In contrast, 4 cases showed rearrangements of Ig and/or T beta genes. One of these 4 cases demonstrated T beta gene rearrangement with retention of the germline configuration of Ig genes. Two cases with both Ig and T beta gene rearrangements also showed kappa-chain gene rearrangements.

Among the female mice treated with quinoline there was a significant development of leukemia or lymphoma (P less than 0.05) which was not evident among the female mice in any of the other experimental groups. Benzo[h]quinoline and phenanthridine were not carcinogenic under these assay conditions. Benzo[f]quinoline did induce an increase in the incidence of hepatomas among male mice (19% as compared to 5.9% among controls). This increase, however, was not statistically significant.

One possible explanation was underestimation of doses to the red bone marrow due to the discharges at Dounreay relative to the dose from fallout, though investigation of ways in which this might have occurred did not suggest anything definite. Other possible explanations included a misconception of the site of origin of childhood leukaemia, outbreaks of an infectious disease, and exposure to some other, unidentified environmental agent. These findings weigh heavily against the hypothesis that the recent increase in childhood leukaemia near Dounreay might be accounted for by radioactive discharges from nuclear plants, unless the doses to the stem cells from which childhood leukaemia originates have been grossly underestimated.","['Darby, S C', 'Doll, R']","['Darby SC', 'Doll R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed),British medical journal (Clinical research ed.),8302911,"['0 (Radioactive Fallout)', '0 (Radioactive Waste)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioactive Fallout/*adverse effects', 'Radioactive Waste', 'Scotland']",1987/03/07 00:00,1987/03/07 00:01,['1987/03/07 00:00'],"['1987/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.294.6572.603 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1987 Mar 7;294(6572):603-7. doi: 10.1136/bmj.294.6572.603.,PMC1245645,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two nuclear establishments are located within the health authorities, and a third is situated nearby. Fifty of the 143 electoral wards in the two district health authorities lie wholly within, or have at least half their area lying within, a circle of radius 10 km around the establishments. In those 50 electoral wards 41 children aged 0-14 were registered with leukaemia, 28.6 registrations being expected on the basis of leukaemia registration rates in England and Wales (incidence ratio = 1.4, p less than 0.05). This excess was confined to children aged 0-4, among whom there were 29 registrations of leukaemia, 14.4 being expected (incidence ratio = 2.0, p less than 0.001). In the remaining 93 electoral wards there was a small and non-significant increase in the number of registrations of leukaemia at age 0-14 (48 observed, 40.8 expected; incidence ratio = 1.2). There was no obvious trend in the incidence of childhood leukaemia over the 14 years and the overall occurrence of the malignancy in the 143 electoral wards was consistent with a random distribution. In the surrounding Oxford and Wessex Regional Health Authorities the number of registrations of leukaemia at age 0-14 was virtually identical with that expected on the basis of registration rates in England and Wales (362 observed, 372.5 expected; incidence ratio = 1.0). These data indicate that in the two district health authorities studied there was an excess incidence of childhood leukaemia during 1972-85 in the vicinity of the nuclear establishments. In the West Berkshire and Basingstoke and North Hampshire District Health Authorities an average of 60,000 children aged 0-14 lived within a 10 km radius of a nuclear establishment each year. The normal expectation of leukaemia in these children was two cases a year, whereas the recorded incidence was three cases per year, representing one extra case of leukaemia each year among these 60,000 children.","['Roman, E', 'Beral, V', 'Carpenter, L', 'Watson, A', 'Barton, C', 'Ryder, H', 'Aston, D L']","['Roman E', 'Beral V', 'Carpenter L', 'Watson A', 'Barton C', 'Ryder H', 'Aston DL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed),British medical journal (Clinical research ed.),8302911,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Risk']",1987/03/07 00:00,1987/03/07 00:01,['1987/03/07 00:00'],"['1987/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.294.6572.597 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1987 Mar 7;294(6572):597-602. doi: 10.1136/bmj.294.6572.597.,PMC1245644,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow involvement was demonstrated by immunohistological examination in 121/160 patients (76%) with non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and 16/23 patients (70%) with plasma cell malignancies; the definite immunological diagnosis could be performed in 77% and 88%, respectively. Reactivity with the MoAb Ki-67 correlated with clinical parameters: in all cases exhibiting more than 5% positive cells an unfavourable course was seen, independent of the histological subtype. Another MoAb of potential prognostic relevance is KiM 4 b, which reacts with follicular dendritic cells (FDC). Besides the presence of FDC in germinal center tumors (CB/CC and CC-NHL) we found FDC in a minority of cases with B-CLL (5/44) and IC lymphoma (4/18). In the latter group 3/4 patients showed a favourable clinical course (vs 2/14 without FDC). The MoAb Tu 1 could discriminate between the lymphoplasmocytoid (11/12 positive) and the lymphoplasmocytic (0/6 positive) subtype of IC lymphoma and has proven of diagnostic importance. Expression of IL-2 receptors, detected by MoAb anti-Tac (CD 25), was demonstrated on leukemic cells from patients with hairy cell leukemia (100%), B-CLL (82%), IC (61%), CC (50%) and CB/CC lymphoma (50%). A considerable number of reactive T-lymphocytes (5%-60% of tissue cells) were identified among the neoplastic B cells with a predominance of CD4+ cells in most cases with NHL, whereas the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly lower in myelomas and non-infiltrated bone marrows. The potential meaning of these findings is discussed.

A cell suspension made from the tumor was cultured for seven days with or without phytohemagglutin (PHA) and/or phorbol myristic acetate (PMA). Ig secretion in vitro by patients' tumor cells varied. In 4 patients, no secretion in vitro occurred, 5 patients had low levels, and 5 patients had high levels of Ig secretion. In three patients, Ig secretion occurred only after stimulation with PHA, PMA, or both. Spontaneous or induced immunoglobulin secretion in vitro is related to the levels of tumor idiotype secretion that exist in vivo. Eight patients with serum idiotype levels greater than 100 micrograms/mL (mean 265 micrograms/mL), had a minimum of 1.0 microgram/10(6) cells of idiotype secretion in vitro. Nine patients with serum idiotype levels less than 30 micrograms/mL (mean 3.7 micrograms/mL), had less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/10(6) cells of idiotype secretion in vitro. In another assay, the levels of IgM kappa and IgM lambda in patients' sera were compared with those in normal serum.

Using an anti IL2 receptor monoclonal antibody (McAb aIL2r) in indirect immunofluorescence we found significant proportions (42.2% +/- 19.7 SD) of the CML cells (previously depleted of E rosetting T cells) to be IL2 receptor positive following incubation in suspension for 18 hours at 37 degrees C. Noninduced cells did not express IL2 receptors. After induction the aIL2r positive and negative cell subpopulations were sorted and analyzed separately for morphology, lineage specific cell surface markers, and clonogenic cell numbers. The IL2 receptor positive CML subpopulations mainly contained blast cells and monocytes and revealed reactivity with myeloid McAbs but not with T cell, B cell, platelet, or erythroid markers. Clonogenic cells (CFU-GEMM, BFUe, and CFU-GM) were selectively recovered from aIL2r positive CML cells and thus were IL2 receptor positive. The addition of recombinant IL2 (rIL2) to CFU-GM and BFUe cultures, in concentrations from 50 to 500 U/mL, did not influence the efficiency of colony formation. Binding of a radiolabeled IL2 preparation to the in vitro activated CML cells indicated the presence of low affinity receptors for IL2. In contrast to CML, normal human marrow cells were consistently aIL2r nonreactive.

Because a constant presence of CyIg in 20 subjects suffering from B-CLL has been reported recently, we reexamined 15 SmIg-negative and 10 SmIg-positive B-CLL patients by SmIg and CyIg determinations. We used a direct immunofluorescence method on peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the detection of SmIg and, after fixation, for CyIg. CyIg were detectable in 24 out of 25 cases, with a fluorescence intensity ranging from weak to moderate.

IL-2 upregulated both high and low affinity IL-2R expression on T-lymphoblasts. IL-2R bearing leukemic cells and T lymphoblasts released IL-2R when cultured in vitro. IL-2R release by T lymphoblasts was enhanced dramatically by IL-2. On the other hand, IL-2-receptor positive leukemic cells released receptors in an IL-2 independent manner. Release of receptors could also be detected in serum-free medium. At least a part of the released receptors could be specifically bound to immobilized pure recombinant IL-2 and to monoclonal anti-IL-2-receptor antibodies.

In 8 of the 10 TdT+ AML analyzed (classified as myeloid according to morphological and cytochemical criteria, and to the reactivity with one or more antimyeloid mAbs), a rearrangement of the Igh chain gene was found. In TdT- AML, evidence of an Igh gene reorganization was instead observed only in 2 of the 42 patients studied. Furthermore, evidence of TCR-beta and/or TRG-gamma gene rearrangement was observed in four AML, all of which belonged to the Igh-rearranged TdT+ group. In three cases (one TdT+ and two TdT-), the Ig kappa L chain gene was also in a rearranged position. These findings demonstrate a highly significant correlation between TdT expression and DNA rearrangements at the Igh and TCR chain gene regions and support the view that this enzyme plays an important role in the V-(D)-J recombination machinery. Overall, the genomic configuration, i.e., JH gene rearrangement sometimes coupled to a kappa L chain and TCR gene reorganization, similar to that found in non-T-ALL, suggests that in most cases of TdT+ AML, the neoplastic clone, despite the expression of myeloid-related features, is characterized by cells molecularly committed along the B cell lineage.","['Foa, R', 'Casorati, G', 'Giubellino, M C', 'Basso, G', 'Schiro, R', 'Pizzolo, G', 'Lauria, F', 'Lefranc, M P', 'Rabbitts, T H', 'Migone, N']","['Foa R', 'Casorati G', 'Giubellino MC', 'Basso G', 'Schiro R', 'Pizzolo G', 'Lauria F', 'Lefranc MP', 'Rabbitts TH', 'Migone N']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*genetics', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.165.3.879 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1987 Mar 1;165(3):879-90. doi: 10.1084/jem.165.3.879.,PMC2188294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional data suggest that LFA-3, a widely distributed cell surface glycoprotein, may be the biological ligand of CD2. We have purified LFA-3 from human erythrocytes and characterized the purified protein functionally. LFA-3 bound specifically to CD2+ cells, and this binding was inhibited by CD2 mAb. Conversely, purified LFA-3 inhibited binding of CD2 mAb to cells, and the concentration required for this effect suggests that LFA-3 half-saturated CD2 at 1-5 nM LFA-3.

In the present study, we monitored the relationship of c-myc, c-fos, c-fms, and c-sis expression to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced monocytic differentiation of human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 500 U/ml IFN-gamma arrested cell proliferation after 3 days. Appearance of the monocytic phenotype was manifested within 24 hr of IFN-gamma exposure by: increased nitroblue tetrazolium reduction; increased cell surface expression of the HLA-DR, Mo1, and MY4 antigens; and induction of transcripts for the second component of complement (C2) and tumor necrosis factor. In contrast, c-myc expression decreased as a later event after 72 hr of IFN-gamma exposure, and c-fos transcripts remained undetectable until 5 days of treatment. Furthermore, c-fms RNA and transcripts for the macrophage marker apolipoprotein E were induced only after 7 days. Finally, expression of the c-sis proto-oncogene at the RNA and protein levels remained undetectable after induction with IFN-gamma. These findings would thus suggest that declines in c-myc RNA, as well as induction of c-fos, c-fms, and c-sis expression, are not requisite events in the commitment of HL-60 cells to IFN-gamma-induced monocytic differentiation.

In this study, the role of TRF in the expression of mRNA for both IgM and IgG1 class was investigated. The TRF was purified from cellfree supernatants from a T cell hybridoma, B151K12. RNA was isolated from chronic B cell leukemia (BCL1) cells, DNP-KLH-primed B cells, or normal B cells cultured with or without LPS, and LPS plus TRF or LPS plus BSF-1. The steady state level of isotype-specific mRNA was assessed by Northern blot analysis with a mu-specific or a gamma 1-specific probe. It was demonstrated that BCL1 and purified B cells cocultured with TRF expresses increased levels (twofold and fourfold, respectively) of secreted forms of mu mRNA. Purified B cells from DNP-KLH-primed mice also expressed increased levels (twofold to fourfold) of mu as well as gamma 1 mRNA for secreted form by stimulation with TRF. Total expression of mu mRNA, however, was approximately threefold higher than that of gamma 1 mRNA. The stimulation of normal B cells with LPS plus TRF induced an increase in the levels of mu mRNA and gamma 1 mRNA expression, fourfold and threefold, respectively. However, the levels of gamma 1 mRNA expression was one-third of that induced in B cells stimulated with LPS plus BSF-1. These results indicate that TRF preferentially induces increased levels of secreted type of mu mRNA and induces less gamma 1 mRNA than BSF-1. The differential role of TRF from BSF-1 in the expression of Ig mRNA will be discussed.","['Matsumoto, M', 'Tominaga, A', 'Harada, N', 'Takatsu, K']","['Matsumoto M', 'Tominaga A', 'Harada N', 'Takatsu K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*genetics', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukin-5', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1987/03/15 00:00,1987/03/15 00:01,['1987/03/15 00:00'],"['1987/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Mar 15;138(6):1826-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A subset of these patients has recently been described with a chronic T cell leukemia of large granular lymphocytes (LGCL). To examine the spectrum of lymphocyte abnormalities in FS and LGCL, we examined phenotypic and genotypic properties of lymphocytes from eight FS patients. In two of these FS patients, we observed an elevated proportion of T cells with an unusual phenotype (CD3+/Leu-7+/Leu-8-/CR3+) (46 +/- 5% of mononuclear cells). The FS lymphocytes had large granular morphology on Wright-Giemsa stain and were active in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic activity. This phenotype, morphology, and activity was similar to LGCL patients except that the latter T cells additionally expressed the Fc-IgG receptor recognized by monoclonal antibody Leu-11 (CD 15). In the remaining six FS patients, the proportion of CD3+/Leu-7+/CR 3+ T cells was only 10 +/- 8%, which was not significantly different from age-matched normal subjects (6.6 +/- 2.2%). To determine the clonality of T lymphocytes in FS and LGCL, we examined DNA for rearrangements of the T cell antigen receptor beta-chain (Ti beta) and gamma-chain (Ti gamma) genes by using Southern blotting techniques. We found a clonal rearrangement of the Ti beta 1 and Ti gamma genes in both LGCL patients. In contrast, no clonal rearrangements of Ti beta or Ti gamma genes were detected in lymphocytes from the FS patients. These results indicate that FS patients are heterogeneous in their phenotype and that one subset exhibits polyclonal expansion of an unusual lymphocyte subset.","['Freimark, B', 'Lanier, L', 'Phillips, J', 'Quertermous, T', 'Fox, R']","['Freimark B', 'Lanier L', 'Phillips J', 'Quertermous T', 'Fox R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Felty Syndrome/*genetics/immunology', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics']",1987/03/15 00:00,1987/03/15 00:01,['1987/03/15 00:00'],"['1987/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Mar 15;138(6):1724-9.,,"['AM07144/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM33983/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietary vitamin E treatments offered no protection against adriamycin toxicity, because the serum tocopherol content reached only 4.39 micrograms/ml in mice given the vitamin E-sufficient feed in this study. The results suggested that an increase of the serum tocopherol level to about two to three times the untreated control would be required before the adriamycin treatment to reduce its toxicity.","['Tanigawa, N', 'Katoh, H', 'Kan, N', 'Mizuno, Y', 'Tanimura, H', 'Satomura, K', 'Hikasa, Y']","['Tanigawa N', 'Katoh H', 'Kan N', 'Mizuno Y', 'Tanimura H', 'Satomura K', 'Hikasa Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Vitamin E/blood/*pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1986 Dec;77(12):1249-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In sharp contrast to cell cultures of normal marrow, specimens from two patients with JCML yielded an excessive and rapid proliferation of monocyte-macrophage elements without growth factor in clonogenic assay and in liquid culture. Using IFN alpha 2 labeled with 125I, the characteristics of IFN binding to cultured JCML monocyte-macrophages and their receptor site numbers were determined. IFN binding to cells from both patients disclosed two components: a high-affinity of 120 and 430 sites/cell, and a lower affinity of 1230 and 2500 sites/cell, respectively. In control studies, normal blood mononuclear cells or tonsillar B-lymphocytes displayed only a high-affinity component. Brief exposure of JCML cells to IFN alpha 2 in vitro resulted in a sharp increase in the IFN-induced enzyme 2-5A synthetase, indicating the ability of JCML cells to respond metabolically. Dose-response studies performed in a clonogenic assay showed a dose-dependent growth inhibition of JCML monocyte-macrophage colonies using IFN alpha 2 at concentrations of 10(2)-10(5) U/ml. These studies provide new information on the biological characteristics of JCML malignant cells, and suggest that IFN may be useful for treatment of this disorder.","['Estrov, Z', 'Lau, A S', 'Williams, B R', 'Freedman, M H']","['Estrov Z', 'Lau AS', 'Williams BR', 'Freedman MH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/biosynthesis"", 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Drug/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/*therapeutic use']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Feb;15(2):127-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since FELC can be induced to differentiate along the erythrocytic pathway with a variety of inducing agents, the effects of aphidicolin were tested on proliferating FELC and cells which were induced to differentiate with the potent inducer, hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). Exposure of FELC to aphidicolin resulted in unbalanced growth within 24 h, as reflected by abnormally large cells, compared with untreated cells. In the presence of 10 or 50 microM aphidicolin, 75-90% of cells became differentiated (benzidine+ cells) within 48 h, although by 72 h cells treated with aphidicolin were non-viable as determined by trypan blue staining. A wider range of aphidicolin concentrations was tested in an effort to determine the optimal concentration of aphidicolin that maximally induced differentiation with minimal loss of cell viability. Continuous exposure of FELC from 24-96 h with doses of aphidicolin ranging from 0.5 to 50 microM was more effective for differentiation induction than was short-term exposure (1, 2, 4, 12 h) to the drug, although 1 h of exposure significantly (p less than 0.01) increased differentiation (28.1 +/- 7.8%) compared with untreated cells (2.7 +/- 1.0%). When cells were treated with HMBA (5 mM) and aphidicolin (1, 5, 10 microM), in combination, aphidicolin shifted the time of onset of differentiation from 72 to 48 h, but did not act synergistically or additively with HMBA; nor was the induction effect of aphidicolin changed by HMBA. In contrast, suboptimal doses of aphidicolin (0.5 microM) in combination with HMBA (2.5 mM) produced an additive effect on FELC differentiation. In addition, [3H]thymidine experiments demonstrated that aphidicolin reversibly blocked FELC in S phase and at G1-S interface of the cell cycle. These results indicate that aphidicolin can induce the differentiation of FELC, and that a complete round of replicative DNA synthesis is not required for differentiation to occur.","['Beckman, B S', 'Kopfler, W', 'Koury, P', 'Jeter, J R Jr']","['Beckman BS', 'Kopfler W', 'Koury P', 'Jeter JR Jr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Aphidicolin', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Polymerase II/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1987/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(87)90240-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(87)90240-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1987 Mar;169(1):223-32. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(87)90240-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The smaller fragment contains both N-linked oligosaccharides found in the intact receptor and is derived from the amino terminus of the molecule. The larger proteolytic fragment was metabolically labeled with 32PO4 and represents the carboxy terminus. The predicted cleavage sites of both enzymes lie in the region of the molecule encoded by exon 3. This pattern of limited proteolysis provides biochemical evidence that the extracellular region of the receptor is organized into two domains. This supports a structural model of the receptor in which the regions of internal homology encoded by exons 2 and 4 form independent disulfide-bonded domains connected by a hydrophilic segment. To determine the role of these domains in IL-2 binding, [125I]IL-2 was chemically cross-linked to the proteolytically cleaved receptor on the cell surface. The 125I-labeled complex obtained displayed N-linked oligosaccharides and had an Mr consistent with one molecule of IL-2 cross-linked to the smaller proteolytic fragment of the receptor. Thus, the amino-terminal domain of the IL-2 receptor appears to form an integral part of the IL-2 binding site.","['Shackelford, D A', 'Trowbridge, I S']","['Shackelford DA', 'Trowbridge IS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.20 (peptidyl-Lys metalloendopeptidase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Disulfides/analysis', 'Endopeptidases', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia', '*Metalloendopeptidases', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Trypsin']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1986 Dec 1;5(12):3275-80.,PMC1167322,"['CA 09370/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17733/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection of cultured cells showed that lacZ has no detectable deleterious effects on cell viability or growth, that the enzyme is stably expressed in the progeny of infected cells for many generations in the absence of selective pressure, and that the virus can induce lacZ in a variety of cell types. Following injection of the virus into mid-gestation mouse embryos, clones of lacZ-positive cells were detected in skin, skull, meninges, brain, visceral yolk sac, and amnion. We identified the cell types comprising a series of lacZ-positive clones in the visceral yolk sac and skin to learn the lineage relationships of the labelled cells.

Tracer dilution techniques were used to assess body fluid volumes and estimate body cell, lean body, and body fat masses. Body cell mass was lost (mean -1.62 kg, P less than 0.05) without significant changes in body fat or lean body masses. There was an expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment (mean +0.8 l, P less than 0.05) and a loss in the intracellular fluid compartment (mean -1.3 l, P less than 0.05) with little change in total body water volume. Changes in body weight correlated poorly with body cell mass or fluid volume changes. Change in arm muscle area correlated well with changes in body cell mass (r = 0.61, P less than 0.05) and lean body mass (r = 0.68, P less than 0.05), while that of arm fat area did not reflect its isotope dilution-derived counterpart.

We describe here a hybrid cell acute leukemia, in a 16-day-old infant, in whom leukemic cells coexpressed myeloid and lymphoid B cell antigens. Blast cells in the bone marrow showed L2 morphology according to the French American British (FAB) classification, with positive periodic-acid Schiff, and nonspecific esterase staining. Sudan black, and specific esterase were negative. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, was strongly positive in 5% of blasts, and faintly reactive with the rest. Karyotypic analysis demonstrated a translocation of t(11:17);(q23;p13). Immunoglobulin gene analysis revealed rearrangement of the heavy chain genes. The blasts' phenotype was HLA/DR+ B4+ My7+ My9+ common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) B1- T11-. Dual immunofluorescence staining using anti My7, and My9 fluorescein isothiocyanate, and anti B4 pycoerythrin conjugated monoclonal antibodies, and flow cytofluorometry, revealed a labeling pattern of 25% B4+; 10% to 15% My7+; 17% My9+; and 50% of cells coexpressing B4 My7, and My9 antigens.

We have noted that 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) in high doses is also capable of promoting monocytic differentiation of this cell line. To test the possibility that the latter activity is due to conversion of 25OHD3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 by HL-60, we exposed HL-60 cells to 25OHD3 and analyzed the products by HPLC and radioreceptor assay. When chromatographed in the traditional solvent system (isopropanol-hexane), a new peak appears which migrates with authentic 1,25(OH)2D3. However, in a solvent system containing dichloromethane, 90% of the peak migrates with another metabolite, 19-Nor-10-Keto-25OHD3 (19-Nor-25OHD3). Production of this metabolite is enhanced by living cells and is synthesized by both virgin HL-60 and those which have undergone differentiation. We next determined if authentic 19-Nor-25OHD3 also promotes differentiation of this cell. As assessed by appearance of the monocyte-specific surface antigen (63D3) and macrophage-specific esterase activity, we find that this metabolite does, in fact, induce monocytic differentiation of HL-60 with a potency of approximately 1/200 that of 1,25(OH)2D3 and similar to that of 25OHD3. In agreement with the effect upon cell maturation, 19-Nor-25OHD3 displaces 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 from its HL-60 receptor with an efficiency comparable to 25OHD3. Hence, HL-60 cells convert 25OHD3 to 19-Nor-25OHD3, and 19-Nor-25OHD3 induces monocytic differentiation of HL-60 with comparable efficiency to its precursor, 25OHD3.","['Bar-Shavit, Z', 'Horst, R L', 'Chappel, J C', 'Ross, F P', 'Gray, R W', 'Teitelbaum, S L']","['Bar-Shavit Z', 'Horst RL', 'Chappel JC', 'Ross FP', 'Gray RW', 'Teitelbaum SL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Calcif Tissue Int,Calcified tissue international,7905481,"['85925-90-2 (19-nor-10-keto-25-hydroxyvitamin D3)', 'P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)']",IM,"['Calcifediol/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/pathology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02555200 [doi]'],ppublish,Calcif Tissue Int. 1986 Nov;39(5):328-33. doi: 10.1007/BF02555200.,,"['AM22014/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM34401/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DE05413/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patterns of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) reactivity indicated that these cases were representative of the three recognized stages (I, II, III) of human thymocyte development. The T3 antigen, which becomes linked to the Ti to form a functional T cell receptor complex on mature thymocytes, was expressed on the cell surface in two cases (stage III). However, in the remaining three cases that were surface T3 negative (stages I and II), large amounts of T3 were identified in the cytoplasm by immunoperoxidase staining and flow cytometry. Leukemic blasts from all five patients showed rearranged genes encoding the beta-chain portion of the Ti heterodimer. RNA transcripts of Ti beta-chain genes were also evident in lymphoblasts from all five cases, but transcripts coding for the alpha-chain portion of Ti were found only in cases that expressed T3 on the cell surface. Thus the absence of surface T3 (and presumably Ti) coincides with the absence of Ti alpha-chain RNA, suggesting that transcription of alpha-chain genes is a critical regulatory event in the surface expression of the Ti-T3 complex. Leukemic T cells that rearrange and express Ti beta-chain genes but lack Ti alpha-chain messenger RNA (mRNA) may represent a stage of differentiation analogous to pre-B cells, where heavy-chain immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are rearranged and expressed but light-chain Ig genes are not expressed.","['Mirro, J Jr', 'Kitchingman, G', 'Behm, F G', 'Murphy, S B', 'Goorha, R M']","['Mirro J Jr', 'Kitchingman G', 'Behm FG', 'Murphy SB', 'Goorha RM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69837-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Mar;69(3):908-12.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

On immunoenzymatic analysis of cryostat tissue sections, these antibodies strongly label both mantle zone and germinal center B lymphoid cells in secondary lymphoid follicles (and also scattered extrafollicular lymphoid cells) but are unreactive with other cell types (with the exception of weak reactivity with some epithelioid histiocytes). These reactions differ from those of monoclonal antibodies B1 and B2 (anti-CD20 and CD21) but are similar to those of the pan-B antibody B4 (anti-CD19). One of the anti-CD22 antibodies (To15) has been tested extensively by immunoenzymatic labeling on greater than 350 neoplastic lymphoid and hematological samples. The CD22 antigen was found in tissue sections in most B cell-derived neoplasms, the major exceptions being myeloma (all cases negative) and a small proportion of high-grade lymphoma (6% of cases negative). In cell smears, the antigen could be found on neoplastic cells in most B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, including common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (90% positive) and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (89% positive). We conclude that anti-CD22 antibodies are of value for identification of human B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (especially when used in conjunction with anti-CD19 antibodies). Previous reports that the CD22 antigen is absent from many B cell neoplasms are probably due to its being expressed within the cytoplasm of immature B cells rather than on their surface.","['Mason, D Y', 'Stein, H', 'Gerdes, J', 'Pulford, K A', 'Ralfkiaer, E', 'Falini, B', 'Erber, W N', 'Micklem, K', 'Gatter, K C']","['Mason DY', 'Stein H', 'Gerdes J', 'Pulford KA', 'Ralfkiaer E', 'Falini B', 'Erber WN', 'Micklem K', 'Gatter KC']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*analysis']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69826-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Mar;69(3):836-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RA (10(-10)-2.5 X 10(-8) M) or A23187 (4 X 10(-7) M) alone produced 15-22% differentiated cells as assessed by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. Exposure of cells for 48 hr to the combination of 4 X 10(-7) M A23187 and 10(-10)-2.5 X 10(-8) M RA resulted in 20-86% of the cells capable of reducing nitroblue tetrazolium, but with no measurable level of nonspecific esterase activity. The combination of A23187 and either dimethyl sulfoxide, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, or immune interferon failed to produce a synergistic effect on differentiation. Addition of either the calmodulin antagonists, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloronaphthalenesulfonamide and trifluoperazine, or the protein kinase C inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, during treatment with A23187 and RA did not block differentiation. Membrane tyrosine kinase activity was measured in cells treated with A23187 and RA in a nondenaturing gel system using the exogenous substrate poly(Glu:Tyr). Membrane-bound tyrosine kinase activity was not present in untreated or RA-treated cells but was induced by A23187 treatment alone and was markedly increased in cells 48 hr after treatment with the combination of A23187 and RA. Significantly greater reduction in c-myc mRNA levels was also observed 24 hr after treatment with RA and A23187 in comparison to that observed with either agent alone. These results suggest that a Ca2+-mediated process sensitizes cells to the differentiating effect of RA and that this effect is associated with a significant reduction of c-myc expression and the induction of membrane tyrosine kinase activity in this cell line.","['Chapekar, M S', 'Hartman, K D', 'Knode, M C', 'Glazer, R I']","['Chapekar MS', 'Hartman KD', 'Knode MC', 'Glazer RI']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '65595-90-6 (W 7)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calmodulin/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Trifluoperazine/pharmacology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1987 Feb;31(2):140-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the CD4 molecule has been implicated as a receptor structure for HTLV-III/LAV (human T-cell leukemia virus/lymphadenopathy-associated virus), we asked whether LC from HTLV-III/LAV-seropositive individuals display signs of HTLV-III/LAV infection. In skin biopsies from 7/40 HTLV-III/LAV-infected persons (1 asymptomatic carrier, 2 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex and 4 patients with AIDS), LC were the only epidermal cells to react with a monoclonal antibody specific for the HTLV-III core protein p17. A varying percentage of p17+ LC were morphologically altered with blunt dendrites and poorly demarcated cellular contours. In one of these biopsies, the presence of LC-associated viral particles characteristic of HTLV-III/LAV as well as cytopathic changes in approximately one-third of the LC population were demonstrated by electron microscopy. These results strongly suggest that LC may harbor HTLV-III/LAV. The infection of LC with this retrovirus may have deleterious consequences for the immunologic functions of this cell system and may thus contribute to both the acquisition of immunodeficiency and the infectious and neoplastic complications of AIDS.","['Tschachler, E', 'Groh, V', 'Popovic, M', 'Mann, D L', 'Konrad, K', 'Safai, B', 'Eron, L', 'diMarzo Veronese, F', 'Wolff, K', 'Stingl, G']","['Tschachler E', 'Groh V', 'Popovic M', 'Mann DL', 'Konrad K', 'Safai B', 'Eron L', 'diMarzo Veronese F', 'Wolff K', 'Stingl G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*microbiology/pathology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Epidermis/*microbiology/pathology', 'HIV/*isolation & purification', 'HIV Antibodies', 'Humans', 'Langerhans Cells/analysis/*microbiology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(87)90151-5 [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12525402 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1987 Feb;88(2):233-7. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12525402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several molecular species of PAF ranging from C14:0 to C19:0 were detected in all of the cells studied. PAF produced by each cell type exhibited a unique pattern of molecular species distribution. Although C16:0 was the major PAF molecular species of rat PMN and RBL cells representing 96% and 85% of the total PAF, respectively, PAF from mice PMN contained 81% of C16:0, 10% of C18:1, and 6% of C18:0.

Analysis of immature T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) at DNA, RNA, and cell membrane level.",1260-9,"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) can be regarded as the malignant counterparts of cells in various T cell differentiation stages. To study the expression of the human T cell receptor (TcR)-CD3 complex during the early stages of T cell differentiation, we have analyzed 22 T-ALL at the cell membrane level and the DNA level and 12 of them at the RNA level. According to their immunologic phenotype, the T-ALL could be divided into three main groups: 10 immature T-ALL (CD1-/CD3-), seven common thymocytic T-ALL (CD1+/CD3-or+), and five mature T-ALL (CD1-/CD3+). Among the 10 immature T-ALL three appeared to express the immunologic phenotype of the putative prothymocyte (TdT+/HLA-DR+/CD7+/CD2+/CD5-/CD1-/CD3-), whereas the other seven T-ALL appeared to be immature thymocytic (TdT+/HLA-DR-/CD7+/CD2+/CD5+/CD1-/CD3-). Transcripts of the CD3-delta and CD3-epsilon genes were present in all CD3- and CD3+ T-ALL tested, including prothymocytic T-ALL. However, prothymocytic T-ALL had germline TcR-beta genes and were not rearranged to the characterized TcR-gamma joining regions. The presence of CD3 transcripts and absence of TcR gene rearrangements in prothymocytic T-ALL supports their immature T cell character. Two immature thymocytic T-ALL also had germline TcR-gamma genes and one of them had germline TcR-beta genes. In all other T-ALL the TcR-gamma and TcR-beta genes were rearranged. The presumptive functional 1.3-kilobase TcR-beta transcripts were detected in the majority of T-ALL with rearranged TcR-beta genes. Distinct levels of TcR-gamma transcripts appeared to be present only in some thymocytic T-ALL, i.e., some immature thymocytic T-ALL and common thymocytic T-ALL. TcR-alpha mRNA could only be detected in CD3+ mature T-ALL, but was absent in all CD3+ common thymocytic T-ALL tested. Our data indicate that CD3 gene transcription is one of the earliest events during T cell differentiation and already occurs in prothymocytes. The TcR-gamma and TcR-beta genes rearrange early during thymocytic differentiation and can subsequently be transcribed. High levels of TcR-gamma gene transcription may only occur in a part of the T cells during thymic differentiation, while TcR-beta gene transcription continues during further differentiation. TcR-alpha gene transcription may be the final step in the production of the complete set of TcR and CD3 proteins, resulting in the expression of the TcR alpha beta-CD3 complex at the cell surface of mature T cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['van Dongen, J J', 'Quertermous, T', 'Bartram, C R', 'Gold, D P', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Comans-Bitter, W M', 'Hooijkaas, H', 'Adriaansen, H J', 'de Klein, A', 'Raghavachar, A']","['van Dongen JJ', 'Quertermous T', 'Bartram CR', 'Gold DP', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Comans-Bitter WM', 'Hooijkaas H', 'Adriaansen HJ', 'de Klein A', 'Raghavachar A', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/analysis', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/genetics/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*cytology/immunology']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Feb 15;138(4):1260-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, an anti-peptide serum against CD3 delta-chain was made. The anti-alpha peptide serum reacted with all human TcR (from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cell clones, and the T cell leukemias: HPB-ALL, Jurkat, JA3, and JM), and the anti-beta peptide serum reacted with only human TcR of the C beta 2 isotype (from a cytotoxic T cell clone which had a C beta 2 transcript, HPB-ALL, and a proportion of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes, but not with Jurkat, JA3, and JM). A comparison of the detergents NP-40 and digitonin revealed that digitonin was more efficient at keeping the TcR/CD3 complex intact, but was less efficient at solubilizing the total amount of TcR or the total amount of CD3. With these reagents and the use of digitonin, it was shown that all of the alpha, beta, and CD3 moieties on the surface of a T cell leukemia HPB-ALL occur as a bound TcR/CD3 complex. The proportion of C beta 1 to C beta 2 isotype expressed on the surface of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes was 0.8, indicating approximately equal use of the two beta-chain isotypes.","['Lew, A M', 'Maloy, W L', 'Koning, F', 'Valas, R', 'Coligan, J E']","['Lew AM', 'Maloy WL', 'Koning F', 'Valas R', 'Coligan JE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/immunology', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/analysis/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis/immunology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Feb 1;138(3):807-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of human peripheral blood T cells preactivated by exposure to PHA was inhibited in a specific manner by anti-T3. Colony formation in soft agar by REX cells, a leukemic cell line of early T cell phenotype, was completely inhibited by anti-T3 or anti-Ti antibodies, whereas isotype-matched antibodies to a variety of other T cell markers had no effect. Growth of REX cells in suspension culture was not affected by anti-T3 or anti-Ti. A cell line, T3.N1, was established from an agar colony of anti-T3-resistant REX cells. T3.N1 was phenotypically identical to REX except for failure to express any detectable T3 or Ti surface antigen. T3.N1 colony formation in soft agar was not inhibited by anti-T3 or anti-Ti. There was no rise in [Ca2+]i of T3.N1 cells after anti-T3 or anti-Ti exposure.

This effect was significant at 5 microM H-7 without loss of cell viability. Such activity was not observed with N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA 1004), a potent inhibitor of cGMP- and cAMP-dependent kinases, and a weak inhibitor of Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). These findings suggest that protein kinase C is more closely associated with IL-2 receptor expression and IL-2 production of T cells than cGMP- or cAMP-dependent kinases. In addition, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), a calmodulin inhibitor, suppressed both IL-2 production and IL-2R expression. Cycrosporin A (Cy A), a potent immunosuppressive drug, markedly inhibited IL-2 production of Jurkat cells whereas it did not affect the IL-2R expression. Thus, the mechanism of action of Cy A appears to differ from that of the protein kinase inhibitor, H-7, and the calmodulin inhibitor, W-7.","['Koizumi, T', 'Nakao, Y', 'Matsui, T', 'Katakami, Y', 'Katakami, N', 'Fujita, T']","['Koizumi T', 'Nakao Y', 'Matsui T', 'Katakami Y', 'Katakami N', 'Fujita T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '65595-90-6 (W 7)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(86)90107-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(86)90107-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1986 Dec;103(2):469-75. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(86)90107-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell lines were cultured in the presence or absence of the new tumor promoter teleocidin, and control and teleocidin-treated derived supernatants were cocultured with purified B cells obtained from healthy donors and patients with B chronic lymphatic leukemia (B-CLL), in the presence of anti-mu. In attempt to delineate the role of other B-cell lymphokines in promoting proliferation of activated B cells, the supernatants were also studied for interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). The effect of B-cell-derived lymphokines on the proliferation of activated B cells obtained from the 14 donors was heterogeneous, and three types of response were observed: In four healthy donors there was induction of B-cell proliferation by B-cell lymphokines derived from both control cells and teleocidin-treated cells. In cells obtained from the other five healthy donors there was induction of B-cell proliferation by B-cell lymphokines derived from teleocidin-treated cells. In the five B-CLL patients, B-cell proliferative response to B-cell lymphokines derived from both control cells and teleocidin-activated cells was absent. Comparison of B-BCGF reactivity to T-BCGF reactivity demonstrated that B-CLL B lymphocytes did not respond to either B-BCGF or T-BCGF, whereas normal B cells responded to T-BCGF and may proliferate upon stimulation with B-cell-derived IL-2 and/or B-BCGF. These results suggest heterogeneity of B-BCGF receptor reactivity in B lymphocytes derived from healthy donors, and lack of both B-BCGF and T-BCGF receptor reactivities in B lymphocytes derived from B-CLL patients; B-cell-derived lymphokines influence normal B-cell response but not leukemic B cells; B-BCGF optimal effect is in large part due to other B-cell lymphokines, especially B-cell-derived IL-2; the possible existence of various B-BCGFs.","['Benjamin, D', 'Bazar, L S', 'Wallace, B', 'Jacobson, R J']","['Benjamin D', 'Bazar LS', 'Wallace B', 'Jacobson RJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-4', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(86)90099-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(86)90099-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1986 Dec;103(2):394-408. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(86)90099-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-eight patients were receiving recombinant alpha 2b-interferon (INF) therapy, and 33 patients were receiving no systemic therapy at the time of evaluation. Among 28 patients with stable HCL who were receiving no systemic therapy, elevated serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was observed in two patients, while serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was normal in all. Serum testosterone levels were below normal in seven of 28 patients on no systemic therapy. Hormone levels were followed prospectively for a median of 8 months in 11 patients receiving INF without prior chlorambucil therapy. FSH became elevated in only one of eight patients with normal pretreatment values, LH remained normal in all patients, and testosterone transiently fell in two of four patients with normal pretreatment values. In addition, 20 of 29 patients receiving INF who had normal FSH and LH levels when first examined continued to have normal levels during a median of 10 months of INF therapy. Patients receiving INF generally reported either no change or improvement in sexual function as therapy progressed. We conclude that most patients with stable HCL have normal testicular function and that INF therapy does not appear to produce significant gonadal toxicity.","['Schilsky, R L', 'Davidson, H S', 'Magid, D', 'Daiter, S', 'Golomb, H M']","['Schilsky RL', 'Davidson HS', 'Magid D', 'Daiter S', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['DNA, Recombinant', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', '*Sex/drug effects', 'Testis/drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Testosterone/blood']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1987 Feb;71(2):179-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microsomal mixed function oxidases activate cyclophosphamide to produce phosphoramide mustard and acrolein, while cytochrome reductase and xanthine oxidase are capable of transforming Adriamycin and forming free radicals. These reactive metabolites produce unwanted toxic side effects; however, their action may be partially ameliorated by the concomitant administration of thiols. In this study we evaluated the therapeutic activity of combinations of mesna (2-mercaptoethanesulfonate) with cyclophosphamide or Adriamycin in mice with a variety of transplantable tumors (L1210 and P-388 leukemia, Lewis lung and colon 26 carcinoma, B16 melanoma, and M5076 sarcoma). In all cases the administration of mesna prior to cyclophosphamide or Adriamycin treatment did not reduce the antitumor effectiveness of these agents and in some instances (C57BL/6 mice with B16 melanoma or M5076 sarcoma) small improvements were observed. Therefore, the addition of thiols, to reduce effectively the buildup of toxic metabolites of cyclophosphamide or Adriamycin may result in the improved therapeutic effectiveness for these agents in the treatment of cancer.","['Bernacki, R J', 'Bansal, S K', 'Gurtoo, H L']","['Bernacki RJ', 'Bansal SK', 'Gurtoo HL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'NR7O1405Q9 (Mesna)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mercaptoethanol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Mesna/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 1;47(3):799-802.,,"['CA-13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23634/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with a single dose of the liver mitogen and promoter of mouse hepatocarcinogenesis 1, 4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP), or with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), induced liver cell proliferation at days 2 and 3 after treatment. Both of these treatments led to a marked increase in Moloney murine leukemia virus-related 6 kilobase RNAs, which were most abundant at day 1 after TCPOBOP treatment and at day 2 after CCl4. Intracisternal A particle-related 6 kilobase RNAs were markedly increased at days 1 and 2 after TCPOBOP and at days 1, 2, and 3 after CCl4. VL30-related transcripts were slightly decreased after TCPOBOP, but they were markedly increased at days 1 and 2 following CCl4. The livers of 15-day-old untreated mice contained about a 3-fold higher level of Moloney murine leukemia virus-related RNAs than adult liver. Intracisternal A particle-related 6-kilobase transcripts were present at 3-fold higher abundance in 7-day-old than in 15-day-old or adult liver. RNAs homologous to VL30 were detected at about the same levels in infant as well as adult livers. Inhibition of protein synthesis by the administration of cycloheximide to adult mice caused a marked increase in the amount of Moloney murine leukemia virus-, intracisternal A particle-, and VL30-related RNAs in the livers of the treated mice, suggesting the existence of labile proteins that normally regulate the abundance of these transcripts.

These induced cells show marked increases in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-coated erythrocyte (EA) rosettes, nonspecific esterase, and 5'-nucleotidase activity. rIFN-gamma alone at concentrations of 10 to 1,000 U/mL has essentially no effect on morphological maturation, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, and immunophagocytosis. However, rIFN-gamma at these concentrations increases EA rosetting in a concentration-dependent manner that is not affected by 10 nmol/L RA. At a concentration of 1,000 U/ml, rIFN-gamma induces moderate increases in nonspecific esterase, 5'-nucleotidase, and ADCC. These parameters are markedly increased by the addition of 10 nM RA, a concentration which alone has no effect on these markers. Based on units of antiviral activity, rIFN-gamma is tenfold more active than rIFN-alpha D in inducing EA rosettes and 40-fold more active in inducing nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and immunophagocytosis.

A variety of calcium antagonists, including channel blockers and intracellular antagonists (verapamil, trifluoperazine, dantrolene, TMB-8, nitrendipine) or membrane acting drugs (lucensomycin), enhanced the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin in P388 and markedly in P388/dx subline.

The induction resulted in a rapid increase in the molar ratio of secreted/membrane-bound mu-chain mRNA. Immunoglobulin secretion was preceded by a transition of the cells from the G0 to G1 phase of the cell cycle, as indicated by an increase in RNA and protein synthesis, and an overall increase in cellular RNA. The cells, however, became blocked in G1 and did not enter S phase. The expression of MYC and FOS was rapidly induced by the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment. The induction of FOS preceded the shift in secreted/membrane-bound mu-chain mRNA molar ratio, while that of MYC occurred concomitantly with the shift, but prior to induction of total RNA synthesis and immunoglobulin secretion. MYC expression remained at a relatively high level during the whole differentiation process. It is thus concluded that a decline of MYC expression is not a prerequisite for differentiation of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. This suggests that MYC expression may play a different role during differentiation of nonproliferating B cells than in the myelomonocytic cell lines HL-60 and U-937, where MYC expression has been reported to decrease during induced differentiation. The results also show that the expression of the MYC and FOS genes does not result in the transition of these cells into the S phase of the cell cycle.","['Larsson, L G', 'Gray, H E', 'Totterman, T', 'Pettersson, U', 'Nilsson, K']","['Larsson LG', 'Gray HE', 'Totterman T', 'Pettersson U', 'Nilsson K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.84.1.223 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Jan;84(1):223-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.1.223.,PMC304175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of TPA + RA was accompanied by increased cell adherence and increased nonspecific esterase activity but not by a change in the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium.

Cells treated for 48 h with RA exhibited a 2-fold increase in PK-C activity while cells exposed to TPA for 48 h lost all PK-C activity. The changes in PK-C activity in TPA + RA-treated cells were accompanied by Ca2+/phospholipid(PL)-dependent phosphorylation in vitro of pp38 which is characteristic of treatment with RA alone, as well as the Ca2+/PL-independent phosphorylation in vitro of pp82 and pp130 (vinculin) which is prevalent in cells treated continuously with TPA alone and is absent in RA-treated cells.

This high proportion of T-ALL is most probably due to a deficiency in pre-B/common ALL. The T-ALL patients had significantly worse 4-yr survival compared to standard risk or non-T high risk patients. In view of these special epidemiologic and clinical features a study of the immunophenotype of all consecutive cases of T-ALL and T-non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) observed in our medical center was performed. Twenty-eight ALL and 3 NHL patients were studied and their cells characterized using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, TdT reactivity and E-rosette formation. Assays of the activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (NP) were also performed. Based on the surface antigen expression, the tumor cells could be classified into one of the three known developmental stages of T cells. It was found that the immunophenotype of the T-ALL cases in Israel was similar to that observed in other countries. Considerable heterogeneity of surface antigen expression was found and in a number of cases the phenotype analysis was not easily reconciled with models of T-cell ontogeny. The activities of ADA and NP were correlated with the developmental stage, as defined by the surface antigenic expression. Contrary to observations on normal T-cells, where ADA activity decreases and NP activity increases as T-cells mature and differentiate, this was not found in the malignant T cells. These findings as well as the existence of atypical immunophenotypes suggest that the leukemic T cell has an abnormal gene expression.","['Ben-Bassat, I', 'Biniaminov, M', 'Rosenthal, E', 'Ramot, B']","['Ben-Bassat I', 'Biniaminov M', 'Rosenthal E', 'Ramot B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90339-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(11):1313-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90339-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clones were isolated from this cell line that displayed solely this new IL-2-binding protein, and were found to be unreactive with anti-Tac, the mAb that competes with IL-2 for binding. Moreover, these same cloned cells did not express mRNA detectable by hybridization with radiolabeled cDNA encoding the Tac protein. In contrast, the original cell line and similar clones expressed low levels of Tac mRNA and cell surface Tac antigen, both of which could be augmented by exposure to medium conditioned by adult T leukemia cell lines. Particularly noteworthy, induction of Tac antigen expression was paralleled by an increase in the number of high-affinity IL-2-R detectable. Since the expression of the Tac antigen protein by itself makes only for low-affinity IL-2 binding, these data prompted a reevaluation of the structural composition of high-affinity IL-2-R. Analysis of the IL-2-binding proteins expressed by leukemic cell lines lacking high-affinity receptors revealed only a single protein, larger than the Tac antigen protein (Mr = 75,000 vs. 55,000). In contrast, clones induced to express high-affinity receptors had clearly both of these IL-2-binding proteins. Moreover, when IL-2 binding to normal T cells was performed under conditions that favored the proportion of high-affinity receptors occupied, two distinct proteins identical to those already identified on the leukemic cells could be crosslinked covalently to radiolabeled IL-2. The interpretations derived from these varied, assembled data, point to two IL-2-binding proteins, both of which are required for high-affinity IL-2 binding.","['Teshigawara, K', 'Wang, H M', 'Kato, K', 'Smith, K A']","['Teshigawara K', 'Wang HM', 'Kato K', 'Smith KA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.165.1.223 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1987 Jan 1;165(1):223-38. doi: 10.1084/jem.165.1.223.,PMC2188268,['CA-17643/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of cCD3a and cCD3c in the perinuclear and Golgi area of large, BrdU-incorporating, strongly TdT+ thymic blasts probably represents one of the earliest signs of T cell commitment, because these blast cells are CD1-, CD4-, CD8-, and mCD3-. The cCD3+, TdT+ cells are normally restricted to the thymus and are absent among the TdT+ cells of bone marrow. The anti-CD3b Ab used, T10B9, co-caps and co-modulates with the other anti-CD3 Ab and is a T cell-specific reagent at a membrane level but does not bind to perinuclear cCD3. Instead, this reagent cross-reacts with a filamentous cytoplasmic network in non-T cells in man and in primates S. oedipus and M. rhesus despite their T cell negativity for mCD3. The characteristics of all T-ALL cases studied: cCD3+, CD7+ along with nuclear TdT+ suggest lineage fidelity to early thymic blasts. As a marked contrast, cCD3 is absent in common ALL and in AML, including cases that concomitantly express CD7 and myeloid antigens. Thus, the cCD3, TdT combination provides a very sensitive assay for residual T-ALL blasts outside the normal thymus.","['Campana, D', 'Thompson, J S', 'Amlot, P', 'Brown, S', 'Janossy, G']","['Campana D', 'Thompson JS', 'Amlot P', 'Brown S', 'Janossy G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Primates/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology']",1987/01/15 00:00,1987/01/15 00:01,['1987/01/15 00:00'],"['1987/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Jan 15;138(2):648-55.,,"['5-R01-AI18008-06/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI-5288/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a primate model, conditioned exactly like leukemia patients, it was shown that residual host clonable T cells, as well as alloreactive cytotoxic precursors, were present in peripheral blood and spleen after completion of cytoreduction. We have now extended this study in a mouse model for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. C3H/HeJ mice were treated by 9 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), and 24 hr later their spleen cells were cultured in the presence of T cell growth factor and phytohemagglutinin according to the limit dilution procedure. After 7 days of culture the average frequency of clonable cells was 2.5 X 10(-3) compared with 37 X 10(-3) in the spleens of normal mice. The T cell derivation of the growing cells was ascertained by complement-mediated cytotoxicity with anti-Thy-1 as well as with anti-Lyt-2 and anti-Ly-3T4. In parallel, we found that the initial engraftment rate of bone marrow allograft in mice given 9 Gy TBI was lower than that found in recipients of syngeneic marrow. The initial engraftment rate was measured by the number of colony-forming units in the spleen and by splenic uptake of 125IUdR. A slight increase in TBI from 9 Gy to 11 Gy markedly reduced the difference in the number of spleen colony-forming units or the IUdR uptake between recipients of allogeneic and syngeneic bone marrow. This increase in TBI also coincided with eradication of detectable clonable T cells. Moreover, in mice transplanted with T cell-depleted bone marrow after 9 Gy TBI, we also demonstrate that cytotoxicity against donor-type target cells is present in the spleen 10 to 14 days posttransplantation, whereas in mice treated by 11 Gy TBI such alloreactivity could not be detected. These results suggest that resistance to T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow in irradiated mice closely correlates with the frequencies of residual host clonable T cells detectable by conventional immunologic assays.","['Schwartz, E', 'Lapidot, T', 'Gozes, D', 'Singer, T S', 'Reisner, Y']","['Schwartz E', 'Lapidot T', 'Gozes D', 'Singer TS', 'Reisner Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clone Cells/transplantation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Host vs Graft Reaction', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*radiation effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/radiation effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1987/01/15 00:00,1987/01/15 00:01,['1987/01/15 00:00'],"['1987/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Jan 15;138(2):460-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only three myelomonocytoid cell lines (HL-60, U937 and THP-1-0) were found to be sensitive, and HL-60 was the most sensitive. However, the sensitivity of HL-60 was found to be much influenced by both the batch and the concentration of fetal calf serum (FCS) used in the experiment. In the experiments using a certain FCS, GI-3 had a high antiproliferative activity against HL-60 at the optimal concentration (10(4)-10(5) U/ml), when assayed in medium containing 10% FCS. Both lower and higher concentrations of the interferon than 10(4)-10(5) U/ml resulted in decreased antiproliferative activity. When a high concentration (30%) of the FCS was employed in the assay, the antiproliferative activity of GI-3 was also much reduced. In the experiments using the other FCS, no antiproliferative activity of GI-3 against HL-60 was observed on assay in the medium containing 10% FCS, but significant antiproliferative activity was observed in the medium containing 30% FCS from the same source. Experiments using serum-free culture medium revealed that GI-3 itself had both a slight growth-inhibitory action at the optimal concentrations (at about 10(4) U/ml) and growth-enhancing activity at high (10(6) U/ml) concentration. The antiviral titer of GI-3 was stable during 72 hr of incubation in growth medium with or without cells.

The LGL leukemic cells had little or no NK activity (defined as MHC-nonrestricted cytotoxicity against K562 target cells); however, NK activity could be induced in leukemic LGL by in vitro treatment with as little as 0.05 microgram/mL of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. Cell sorting experiments demonstrated that NK activity was induced in CD3+ leukemic LGL (either CD3+, HNK-1+ or CD3+, FcR+) with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody but not in normal CD3+, FcR- T cells. Treatment with purified interleukin 2 (IL 2) also caused direct activation of some CD3+ leukemic LGL. Despite induction with anti-CD3 MAb or IL 2, activated leukemic LGL did not proliferate or express high density IL 2 receptors detectable by cell sorter analysis. Treatment with alpha interferon had minimal effect on NK activity of LGL leukemic cells.

MM4 did not react with marrow aspirates from control patients (3 cases), or with peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells from normal subjects, lymphocytic (12 cases) and myelogenous (8 cases) leukemia patients. In addition, MM4 was negative with polymorphonuclear leukocytes and RBCs from normal donors. By means of the immunoperoxidase technique, the MM4-reactive antigen was detected in paraffin-embedded, Zenker formalin-fixed bone marrow biopsies of MM (12 of 12 cases positive), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (2 of 2 cases positive), asymptomatic plasma cell dyscrasia (4 of 4 cases positive), and certain lymphomas (2 of 5 cases positive). Marrow biopsies from lymphocytic (5 cases) and myelogenous (5 cases) leukemias were uniformly negative. The MM4-reactive antigen also was expressed on plasma cells generated from pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-stimulated normal PBM cultures. The pattern of reactivity of MM4 with lymphocytes of B origin was similar to that of the plasma cell MoAb PCA-1. Competitive binding studies showed, however, that these two MoAbs recognized distinct antigenic determinants. These observations suggest that MM4 may be useful for the study of human plasma cell dyscrasias.","['Tong, A W', 'Lee, J C', 'Stone, M J']","['Tong AW', 'Lee JC', 'Stone MJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology', 'Paraproteinemias/immunology', 'Plasma Cells/*immunology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76571-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jan;69(1):238-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sequence of the DNA insert includes the 3'-untranslated region, the entire amino acid coding region for the mature PF4 protein, and a 5' region containing coding information for an additional 18 amino acids. In addition, supplemental genomic DNA sequencing shows that the full-length leader sequence is 30 amino acids long plus an initial methionine and codes for a hydrophobic signal-like sequence which is probably involved in transmembrane transport. A single species mRNA of approximately 800 nucleotides was detected on blots of HEL cell poly(A) + RNA using a labeled PF4 cDNA probe. The human PF4 leader sequence shares some DNA, but no amino acid, homology with the 15 amino acids at the N-terminus of mature bovine PF4, suggesting rapid divergence in this region of PF4 between these two species. Sequence comparison of the coding regions of mature PF4 and gamma IP-10, a protein induced in a variety of cells following treatment with gamma-interferon, shows a corrected divergence of 76%. The divergence of a common ancestor protein into PF4 and gamma IP-10 may have accompanied the development of sophisticated immune and coagulation systems in vertebrates. The availability of cDNA and genomic DNA information for these genes in other species will be useful in studying the evolution of the coagulation and immune systems.","['Poncz, M', 'Surrey, S', 'LaRocco, P', 'Weiss, M J', 'Rappaport, E F', 'Conway, T M', 'Schwartz, E']","['Poncz M', 'Surrey S', 'LaRocco P', 'Weiss MJ', 'Rappaport EF', 'Conway TM', 'Schwartz E']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Platelet Factor 4/*genetics', 'Protein Precursors/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76568-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jan;69(1):219-23.,,['AM 16691/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These MTAP- cell lines were K562, an undifferentiated leukemic line and CCRF-CEM, a leukemic line of T-cell origin. Another T-cell line, CCRF-HSB-2 was found to be deficient in activity. However, this line did not demonstrate elevated rates of purine synthesis. Purine metabolism in the above cell cultures was compared with MTAP+ human B-cell lines and two human T-cell lines (MOLT-3 and MOLT-4). In all the MTAP+ cell lines, the rate of de novo purine synthesis was inhibited by the presence of methylthioadenosine in the assay medium (10 microM concentration produced more than 90% inhibition). However, purine synthesis in the MTAP- cells was resistant to inhibition by methylthioadenosine. Adenine in the assay medium inhibited de novo purine synthesis in MTAP+ and MTAP- cells to a similar degree. This inhibition was dose dependent and was elicited by concentrations similar to those of methylthioadenosine. Growth of the cell lines in culture was not affected by either methylthioadenosine or adenine at the concentrations which produced inhibition of purine synthesis. These results suggest that purine synthesis in MTAP+ cells is inhibited by adenine formed from the phosphorolytic cleavage of methylthioadenosine by methylthioadenosine phosphorylase.","['Gordon, R B', 'Blackwell, K', 'Emmerson, B T']","['Gordon RB', 'Blackwell K', 'Emmerson BT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenine/pharmacology', 'Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pentosyltransferases/*deficiency', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*deficiency', 'Purines/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thionucleosides/pharmacology']",1987/01/19 00:00,1987/01/19 00:01,['1987/01/19 00:00'],"['1987/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(87)90059-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(87)90059-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Jan 19;927(1):1-7. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(87)90059-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although both UCHT1 and OKT3 recognize the T3 molecule, which is expressed in all normal T cells, UCHT1+ hairy cells (HCs) were consistently OKT3-. Spurious reactivity of UCHT1 antibodies with SIg+ HCs was excluded by showing that lymphocytes sensitized with an irrelevant mouse Mab did not stain with second layer antibodies and lymphocytes sensitized with second layer antibodies alone were always completely unreactive. Moreover, in 1 case the determinants demonstrable by both UCHT1 and anti-Ig were strongly re-expressed after capping and shedding, i.e. appeared to be endogenous. It is concluded that HCs with a hybrid T-B surface phenotype are more common than hitherto reported, that HCs may express T3 molecules as well as SIg but that determinants recognized by OKT3 may be cryptic or buried in the HC membrane.","['Haegert, D G', 'Furlong, M D', 'Smith, J L']","['Haegert DG', 'Furlong MD', 'Smith JL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cross Reactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis', 'Spleen/immunology']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1986.tb02297.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1986 Sep;37(3):196-202. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1986.tb02297.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigations have focused on corn oil gavage alternatives, vehicle type and volume, alteration of MTD, teratogenic effects, disposition of test compounds, and target tissues. Micoencapsulation will require considerable development research to make it a suitable alternative. Vehicle type and volume appear to have different effects on the apparent MTD, teratogenicity and disposition of very similar compounds. Only two tissue effects have been observed in the NTP oil gavage bioassay data. First, there is a sporadic and weak association with exocrine pancreatic acinar cell proliferative lesions; these lesions are highly correlated with overweight male Fischer 344/N rats. Second, leukemia is reduced about 50 percent in the male Fischer 344/N rats; this is a strong association which results in an 8-10 percent increase in survival. The protective effect of corn oil gavage is remarkable and there is no significant enhancement of tumor development. Corn oil gavage under the conditions of the NTP carcinogenesis bioassay does contribute to overnutrition and undesirable increased body weight, especially in male Fischer 344/N rats. The NTP and NCTR research programs include research plans to address critical oil gavage, diet composition feeding regimen, exercise and hormonal status questions. Results of these studies will point the way to improving long-term carcinogenesis and toxicity testing.","['Landers, R E', 'Norvell, M J', 'Bieber, M A']","['Landers RE', 'Norvell MJ', 'Bieber MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (Oils)', '7V31YC746X (Chloroform)', 'CL2T97X0V0 (Carbon Tetrachloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Carbon Tetrachloride/*toxicity', 'Chloroform/toxicity', '*Enteral Nutrition', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Methods', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced', '*Oils']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1986;222:357-74.,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncologic treatment and nutrition research and their application to the nutrition care of children with cancer are reviewed. Quality nutrition care is now possible because of an improved understanding of (a) the prevalence and significance of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) in high-risk groups, (b) the staging and assessment of nutritional status, and (c) the efficacy and limitations of nutrition support options. Nutrition staging, assessment, and support should be integrated into treatment protocols for children with neoplastic diseases. Common risk factors for the development of PEM have been identified from serial monitoring of newly diagnosed children with a variety of tumors. Certain tumor types and their treatment can be classified within either low or high nutritional risk groups. A comprehensive nutrition program (intense nutrition counseling, favorite nutritious foods) is preferred for low nutritional risk groups but is ineffective in preventing or reversing PEM in high-risk groups. For high-risk patients, central parenteral nutrition (CPN) is the method of choice as a relatively short-term but important support measure that allows children to withstand long intervals of intense treatment during periods of growth and development. Current data suggest that bone marrow suppression may be attenuated and treatment tolerance improved with the use of CPN in selected children with advanced cancer (e.g., acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or advanced neuroblastoma).","['Rickard, K A', 'Grosfeld, J L', 'Coates, T D', 'Weetman, R', 'Baehner, R L']","['Rickard KA', 'Grosfeld JL', 'Coates TD', 'Weetman R', 'Baehner RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Am Diet Assoc,Journal of the American Dietetic Association,7503061,,IM,"['Child', '*Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Enteral Nutrition', 'Food, Fortified', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Nutritional Status', 'Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Protein-Energy Malnutrition/prevention & control', 'Risk']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Am Diet Assoc. 1986 Dec;86(12):1666-76.,,"['R01-CA28005/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA28531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric characterization of My-10-positive progenitor cells in normal human bone marrow.,10-7,"We have previously shown [1] that the anti-My-10 murine monoclonal antibody detected an epitope of a 115-kDa glycoprotein expressed specifically on KG-1a leukemia cells and a small subset of normal human bone marrow cells. This My-10+ marrow cell subset was shown to contain a highly enriched population of morphologic blast cells and hematopoietic colony-forming cells [1]. In this report, My-10+ cells were characterized, by flow cytometry, as an approximately 1% subpopulation of normal human bone marrow cells. My-10+ cells were slightly larger than lymphocytes and agranular, as determined by their fluorescence-activating cell sorting (-er) (FACS) light-scattering properties. In two-color immunofluorescence experiments, My-10+ cells coexpressed the HLA-DR antigen. However, there was no detectable cellular coexpression of My-10 with either the Leu 1-5, 7, 9, 11, 15, M3, or My-18 antigens. There was an average of approximately 50,000 My-10 molecules per My-10+ marrow cell. This provides further evidence that the My-10 molecule is expressed, at relatively low levels, selectively on early human marrow cells but not on mature lymphohematopoietic cells.","['Civin, C I', 'Banquerigo, M L', 'Strauss, L C', 'Loken, M R']","['Civin CI', 'Banquerigo ML', 'Strauss LC', 'Loken MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Jan;15(1):10-7.,,"['CA 06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the populations resulting from treatment with either inducer have differing properties, suggesting that these agents do not have identical modes of action. In this study we have compared the effects of gamma interferon (IFN gamma) and calcitriol and examined the effect of exposing HL-60 cells to both compounds simultaneously. In addition, we have examined the effects of inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis on induction of cell surface antigens in order to gain insight into the mechanisms of action of these compounds. We found that combining IFN gamma and calcitriol resulted in greater monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells than did either compound alone. In addition, a monocyte-associated cell surface antigen, My23, and class-I HLA antigen were induced by both agents in at least an additive manner. In contrast, combined treatment with both compounds did not augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) any better than did IFN gamma alone, but it did cause a decrease in the density of receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin. In studies examining the effects of IFN gamma and calcitriol on the cloning potential of HL-60 cells, we found that incubation of cells with either compound alone significantly reduced the number of HL-60 colonies, and both compounds added together caused an almost total elimination of colony-forming cells. Inhibition of RNA synthesis with alpha amanitin had no effect on the action of IFN gamma on cell surface HLA, but did block the induction of My23 antigen, suggesting that the mechanism of HLA induction may involve posttranscriptional phenomena. RNA-synthesis blockade inhibited the ability of calcitriol to induce My23. These studies demonstrate that multiple and separable events accompany the monocytoid differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by different chemical mediators and that different intracellular pathways may be involved.","['Ball, E D', 'Howell, A L', 'Shen, L']","['Ball ED', 'Howell AL', 'Shen L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Dec;14(11):998-1005.,,"['CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The original 300-19 clonal isolate carried DHH rearrangements of both JH alleles, a molecular genotype characteristic of early pre-B cells. During propagation in culture, the 300-19 line frequently generates secondary rearrangements of its JH alleles including rearrangements which append VH segments to the pre-existing DJH complexes to form complete VHDJH variable region genes and secondary D to JH rearrangements which replace the pre-existing DJH rearrangement by joining an upstream D to a downstream JH. The two types of secondary rearrangement events occur at approximately equal frequency. Approximately 30% of the VH to DJH joins lead to the production of mu heavy chains providing support for a regulated model of allelic exclusion. Like pre-B cell lines from other origins, the 300-19 line preferentially utilized VH gene segments from the more JH-proximal (3') families to form VHDJH rearrangements. However, the VH segments preferentially employed by 300-19 were from a different family than those previously demonstrated to be utilized by pre-B lines of BALB/c origin; we relate these different utilization patterns to differences in the organization of the more 3' VH families between the two strains. The initial DJH rearrangements of the 300-19 line employed more 3' (JH-proximal) D segments; however, the DJH replacements preferentially employed the most 5' D segment. We discuss this phenomenon in the context of a mechanism which may target recombinase to regions of the chromosome more 5' to the D locus (VH-containing regions) once an initial DJH complex is formed.","['Reth, M G', 'Jackson, S', 'Alt, F W']","['Reth MG', 'Jackson S', 'Alt FW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Genes', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1986 Sep;5(9):2131-8.,PMC1167092,"['AI-20047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21112-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['GENBANK/X04348', 'GENBANK/X04838', 'GENBANK/X04840']",,,,,,,,,,,

There are limitations to the effective prophylaxis of infection in granulocytopenic patients, but practical measures include the management of the patient in a private hospital room, the requirement of all medical personnel and visitors to wash their hands carefully and to wear masks, restricting the patient to a low-bacteria diet devoid of fresh fruit, vegetables and salads, and the administration of oral antimicrobial agents for gastrointestinal decontamination. When fever develops, empirical therapy with a combination of an aminoglycoside plus an antipseudomonal beta-lactam should be started promptly. A double beta-lactam combination of cefoperazone or ceftazidime plus piperacillin can be substituted if nephrotoxicity is a concern. The addition of empirical intravenous amphotericin may be useful in patients who remain febrile and granulocytopenic on broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially if surveillance cultures indicate fungal colonization. Amphotericin is also the most reliable agent for the treatment of established fungal infections. Acyclovir is not recommended for prophylaxis in acute leukaemia patients but should be reserved for the treatment of well-documented and clinically significant herpes simplex viral infections. During periods of remission, most patients with AML remain free of infection except when they become granulocytopenic again during intensification or consolidation chemotherapy. On the other hand, children with ALL in remission may experience frequent infections unrelated to granulocytopenia as a consequence of their maintenance chemotherapy. Pneumocystis carinii, varicella zoster, and other viruses are common pathogens. Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole is effective prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with ALL, while intravenous acyclovir is the drug of choice for treatment of varicella zoster infection. Transfusion therapy in the acute leukaemia patient is guided by the patient's peripheral blood counts and degree of sensitization to blood products. Generally, packed red blood cells are given in order to maintain the haematocrit at greater than 30%, while random-donor platelets are administered to keep the platelet count at greater than 20 X 10(9)/l. If refractoriness to platelet transfusions develops, HLA-matched platelets from family members or selected unrelated donors can be used. Similarly, washed or filtered red blood cells may be given to patients with previous and recurrent non-haemolytic febrile reactions to red blood cell transfusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Ho, W G', 'Winston, D J']","['Ho WG', 'Winston DJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Infections/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/therapy']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1986 Aug;15(3):873-904.,,,215,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike DFMO, BES has no direct inhibitory effect on ODC activity. Rather the polyamine analogue is believed, from previous studies, to behave similarly to exogenous spermidine in its ability to suppress intracellular ODC activity but not in its ability to perform functions required for cell growth. The kinetics and extent of growth inhibition by 30 microM or 100 microM BES and 1 mM DFMO were nearly identical as were their effects on macromolecular precursor incorporation with leucine being the first and most significantly affected. By flow cytometry, neither BES nor DFMO induced obvious perturbations in the cell cycle. Both compounds effectively eliminated ODC activity in treated cells and depleted putrescine and spermidine pools with very similar kinetics of decline. These close similarities in drug effects between BES and DFMO, an established polyamine inhibitor, support previous indications that BES induces growth inhibition by depletion of cellular polyamines.

In cold target inhibition experiments IFN-treatment of K-562 cells led to a decrease in their capacity to act as competitors in the homologous NK assay, leaving their inhibitory capacity unaltered in the heterologous assay. In accordance with results observed using human NK targets, murine YAC-1 cells treated with mouse recombinant IFN-gamma did not lose their susceptibility to human NK cells. However, they were markedly less susceptible to lysis mediated by murine effectors. Butyrate, another compound causing decreased sensitivity of K-562 cells for human natural killing, also failed to reduce the susceptibility against murine NK cells. The results indicate that the NK-resistant tumor target phenotype caused by IFN or differentiation-inducing agents can only be detected by homologous but not by heterologous effector cells. This suggests that major differences exist between the inter- and intraspecies NK killing mechanisms.","['Laskay, T', 'Kiessling, R']","['Laskay T', 'Kiessling R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul,Natural immunity and cell growth regulation,8407979,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Asialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Asialoglycoproteins/immunology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul. 1986;5(4):211-20.,,['2R01 CA 26782-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this communication, proof of monoclonality is provided based on subcloning, karyotyping, and Southern blot analyses of lambda light chain immunoglobulin genes. The results reveal rearranged lambda genes in hybridoma subclones that produce both kappa (the WI-L2-729-HF2 isotype) and new lambda light chains. In contrast, the WI-L2-729-HF2 parental cell line and kappa-producing hybrids exhibit a germline configuration of lambda genes. The results provide evidence that stable, monoclonally derived hybridomas may be obtained upon initial plating of fused cells, without subsequent subcloning.

This study describes the appearance of malignant cells from long-term cultured C57BL/6 (B6) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Four out of five T cell lines (CTLL.1,3,4,5) representing distinct stages of development of T effector cells in vitro were repeatedly cloned and all five CTLL were tested for various cellular parameters. It is shown that transformation of H-Y-specific CTLL into malignant cells in vitro was accompanied by alterations in growth characteristics, successive loss of specificity and cytolytic function and by quantitative changes in the expression of cell surface markers. Whereas growth of the H-Y-specific CTLL (CTLL.1) was dependent on antigen and concanavalin A (Con A) supernatant (Con ASN) the CTLL variants could be either maintained in Con ASN alone (CTLL.3) or in the absence of both antigen and lymphokine sources (CTLL.4,5). CTLL.1 was cytolytic for male B6 target cells and lysed P815 tumor targets in the presence but not the absence of lectin. In contrast, CTLL.3 lost its original specificity but lysed P815 cells in the absence or presence of lectin. CTLL.2 representing an intermediary stage showed cytolytic activity on both male B6 and P815 target cells. In contrast, CTLL.4 and CTLL.5 lost the ability to lyse any of the indicated target cells. Although all CTLL expressed the surface markers Thy-1, Lyt-2, Kb, Db and interleukin 2 receptor (IL 2 R), Thy-1 and Lyt-2 markers were drastically reduced and Kb/Db and IL 2 R structures significantly increased on CTLL.4 and CTLL.5 compared to CTLL.1,2,3. In addition, multiple karyotypic alterations including the appearance of metacentric chromosomes were observed in long-term cultured CTLL. Investigations on the expression of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-chains of the T cell antigen receptor in CTLL.1-5 indicate that all three chains were expressed as mRNA irrespective of whether the lymphocytes expressed their original specificity and/or function. However, distinct beta variable chain genes were used by H-Y-specific CTLL and its long-term culture variants CTLL.2 and CTLL.3 suggesting that the expression of the new specificity was accompanied by the rearrangement of a new beta-chain gene in T effector cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Simon, M M', 'Ali, S', 'Tewari, R', 'Simon, H G', 'Muller-Hermelink, H K', 'Epplen, J T']","['Simon MM', 'Ali S', 'Tewari R', 'Simon HG', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Epplen JT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (H-Y Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'H-Y Antigen/immunology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*pathology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830161014 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1986 Oct;16(10):1269-76. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830161014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vital state of 96% of the workers was traced satisfactorily and 2277 were found to have died, 572 (25%) from cancer. On average the workers suffered a mortality from all causes that was 2% less than that of the general population of England and Wales and 9% less than that of the population of Cumberland (the area in which the plant is sited). Their mortality from cancers of all kinds was 5% less than that of England and Wales and 3% less than that of Cumberland. In the five years after their first employment Sellafield workers had an overall mortality that was 70% of that of England and Wales, probably due to healthier members of the population being selected for employment. Raised death rates from cancers of several specific sites were found, but only for those of ill defined and secondary sites was the excess statistically significant (30 observed, 19.7 expected). For cancers of the liver and gall bladder there was a significant deficit of deaths (four observed, 10.5 expected). Workers in areas of the plant where radiation exposure was likely were issued with dosimeters to measure their external exposure to ionising radiations. Personal dose records were maintained for workers who entered such areas other than infrequently. Workers with personal dose records (""radiation"" workers) had lower death rates from all causes combined than other workers but the death rates from cancer in the two groups were similar. Compared with the general population radiation workers had statistically significant deficits of liver and gall bladder cancer, lung cancer, and Hodgkin's disease. There were excesses of deaths from myeloma (seven observed, 4.2 expected) and prostatic cancer (19 observed, 15.8 expected) but these were not significant and there was no evidence of an excess of leukaemia (10 deaths observed, 12.2 expected) or cancer of the pancreas (15 observed, 17.8 expected). Non-radiation workers had a significant deficit of leukaemia (one death observed, 5.1 expected) and a significant excess of cancers of ill defined and secondary sites (13 deaths observed, 5.8 expected). For no type of cancer was the ratio of observed to expected deaths significantly different between radiation and non-radiation workers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Smith, P G', 'Douglas, A J']","['Smith PG', 'Douglas AJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed),British medical journal (Clinical research ed.),8302911,,IM,"['England', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lymphoma/mortality', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/mortality']",1986/10/04 00:00,1986/10/04 00:01,['1986/10/04 00:00'],"['1986/10/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/04 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.293.6551.845 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1986 Oct 4;293(6551):845-54. doi: 10.1136/bmj.293.6551.845.,PMC1341635,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferative response was correlated with the inducibility of receptors for IL 2 on the surface membrane of T-ALL and T-NHL cells by incubation with TPA or PHA for 18 hours. Leukemic T cell colonies, identified by immunophenotyping or cytogenetic analysis, appeared in vitro following TPA and IL 2 stimulation in all six cases. Accordingly, receptors for IL 2, initially absent from the cell surface, were found on high proportions of the T-ALL and T-NHL cells after in vitro exposure to TPA. In contrast, colony formation stimulated by PHA and the induction of IL 2 receptors by PHA were limited to the one case of T-NHL with the mature thymocyte immunophenotype. The cells from the other patients, expressing common or prothymocyte phenotypes, did not respond to PHA. No colonies were formed in any of these cases when PHA or TPA was withheld from the IL 2-containing cultures. Although colony growth depended absolutely on exogenous IL 2 in three cases (ALL), in the three other cases (one ALL, two NHL) some colonies grew also when no IL 2 had been added to the cultures. Upon further analysis of the cells of one of the latter patients, it was found that the cells produced IL 2 and proliferated in response to this endogenous IL 2. The results from this study indicate that the requirements of endogenous v exogenous IL 2 for cell proliferation in T-ALL and T-NHL and IL 2 receptor activation by PHA and TPA vary from patient to patient. In addition, they support the notion that T-ALL and T-NHL cells have not lost dependence on IL 2 and IL 2 receptor activation for in vitro growth.","['Touw, I', 'Delwel, R', 'van Zanen, G', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Touw I', 'Delwel R', 'van Zanen G', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79438-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Nov;68(5):1088-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these cells contain alpha-chain mRNA, they do not produce a normal-sized beta-chain mRNA. Most of them also lack gamma-chain mRNA. Each thymic leukemia was derived from a cell arrested at a different stage of development as defined by their expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and Thy-1 mRNA. The data presented here are consistent with a model in which thymocytes expressing Tpre, Tthy, Tind, or Tsu undergo somatic development parallel to the development of other T cells.

Serological and biochemical analyses indicate that at least three subsets exist, the first of which (HTA 1/T6) was initially identified by the monoclonal antibody NA1/34. Like TL, CD1 are expressed on cortical thymocytes as well as on some lymphoid neoplasias, and resemble in structure major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. However HTA 1/T6 is loosely associated with beta 2-microglobulin and is also found linked by a disulphide bridge to CD8(T8). A molecular genetic approach is needed to investigate the CD1 system, to clarify its relationship to TL antigens and to understand its regulation.

The requisite imidazole, methyl 2-(benzoylamino)-4-(methoxycarbonyl)-1H-imidazole-5-acetate (11), was prepared from the monoheterocyclic rearrangement of dimethyl 3-[(5-phenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)amino]-2-pentenedioate (10) by NaH/DMF.

It was a very weak inhibitor of T and B cell growth and did not enhance 2'-deoxyguanosine toxicity in the same cells. 8-Amino-3-deazaguanine mesylate was not significantly active in L1210 cells in vitro or L1210 leukemic mice.

After 5 d of culture in the presence of rTNF and LT, a significant proportion of the myeloid cell lines express monocyte differentiation antigens and ANAE activity, and become able to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and mediate low levels of ADCC against tumor target cells. These markers of differentiation, however, are maximally induced when rIFN-gamma, at concentrations as low as 4 U/ml, is present simultaneously with the cytotoxins, and the two classes of cytokines act synergistically to induce terminal differentiation. The appearance of monocytic antigens is accompanied by acquisition of morphology and other functional properties of mature monocytic cells, such as chemiluminescence and phagocytosis, and by expression of FcR for monomeric IgG. A decrease in cell proliferation accompanies induced differentiation, and is not due to the cytotoxic properties of TNF or LT, as indicated in simultaneous analysis of surface phenotype and cell cycle. The lack of cytotoxicity of TNF on the HL-60 cell line is also demonstrated by the enhancing effect of TNF on HL-60 cell growth and nucleoside uptake in the first 2 d of culture. These data show that the cytotoxins TNF and LT mediate complex effects on cells of the myelomonocytic lineage and, in synergy with IFN-gamma, can fully induce immature myeloid cells to differentiate into cells with phenotypic, functional, and proliferative characteristics of terminally differentiated myelomonocytic cells.","['Trinchieri, G', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Rosen, M', 'Loudon, R', 'Murphy, M', 'Perussia, B']","['Trinchieri G', 'Kobayashi M', 'Rosen M', 'Loudon R', 'Murphy M', 'Perussia B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Receptors, Transferrin/analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.164.4.1206 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1986 Oct 1;164(4):1206-25. doi: 10.1084/jem.164.4.1206.,PMC2188407,"['CA 10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was also found that intradermal immunization of the tumor cells induced stable and potent resistance to the transplantation of non-xenogenized tumor cells soon after immunization, and that irradiated non-xenogenized tumor cells were effective in supplying booster immunization. Active immunotherapy against KMT-17 cells pre-transplanted subcutaneously was carried out on the basis of the above findings with the results that the active anti-tumor immunization alone caused a complete regression in 30% of the tumor-burdened rats.

A log-linear increase was observed in ML, AML, CML, and CLL throughout the life-span, but only in childhood in ALL. Hodgkin's disease showed a steep increase until age 20-24, and then the increase became much more gradual. The cumulative incidence rates for males and females were parallel for ML and leukemias, but diverged for Hodgkin's disease (the rate for females had a lower slope than that for males after age 20-24). This difference was mainly caused by a lower frequency in females of mixed cellularity and lymphocyte predominance subtypes. The incidence curve of Hodgkin's disease was consistent with the two-stage model of carcinogenesis; it is likely that the proliferation of progenitor cells peaks at a young age and that the death rate of so-called intermediate cells is a primary influence during the subclinical stage. The cytogenesis of Hodgkin's disease and the histologic variation with special reference to the T-zone histiocytes suggest that a strong host defense mechanism against neoplastic change is involved, rather than different etiologic influences.","['Watanabe, S', 'Brown, C', 'Young, J']","['Watanabe S', 'Brown C', 'Young J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Sex Factors', 'United States']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1986 Aug;77(8):743-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, rearrangements were detected in Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed bone marrow cells and in spontaneous thymic lymphomas from C.B-17scid mice. Most of these rearrangements were abnormal: approximately 80% of Igh rearrangements deleted the entire Jh region, and approximately 60% of TCR beta rearrangements deleted the entire J beta 2 region. The deletions appeared to result from faulty D-to-J recombination. No such abnormal rearrangements were detected in transformed tissues from control mice.

In normal individuals, this antigenic molecule was present on tonsillar B-cells (60-80%) and on a fraction of peripheral blood B-cells (5-25%). BL4 (gp54) expression was investigated in 186 patients with a variety of hematological malignancies using indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis. Twenty-six of 37 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 18 of 33 cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were BL4 positive. Surface expression of BL4 on reactive cases of CLL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was brighter than those of B1, B2, and B4, BL4 positive CLL cases expressed a higher proportion of mouse rosette forming cells and Leu-1 positive cells than the BL4 negative subgroup and were not associated with elevated serum immunoglobulin levels. Four of 7 BL4 negative CLL cases were associated with increased serum levels of immunoglobulin M. Lymphoblasts from 14 of 14 cases of non-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 3 of 3 pre-B lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia were BL4 negative.

These products of the phosphorylytic cleavage of MTA are recycled to the nucleotide pool and methionine, respectively. Thus, supplemental MTA could theoretically be utilized by MTAase-containing cells as a source of methionine and adenine. In fact, in vitro experiments have shown that MTAase-containing cells proliferate normally in methionine-free medium if MTA is added to the cultures (M. K. Riscoe and A. J. Ferro, J. Biol. Chem., 259: 5465-5471, 1984). In contrast, MTAase-deficient malignant cell lines do not proliferate under these conditions. In light of these observations and the recent demonstration (N. Kamatani et al., Blood, 60: 1387-1391, 1982) that a proportion of acute lymphoblastic leukemias lack MTAase, we wished to determine if this enzyme deficiency occurs in a variety of human neoplasms. Accordingly, malignant cells from eight patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and ten patients with various solid tumors were assayed for MTAase activity. Samples from one of the eight acute nonlymphocytic leukemia patients and three of the 10 solid tumor patients (one with melanoma, one with squamous cell lung cancer, and one with adenocarcinoma of the rectum) had undetectable MTAase activity. In contrast, erythrocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes isolated from normal subjects and from patients with immunodeficiency syndromes or cancer all contained enzyme activity. In addition, the methods of preservation, storage, and cell disruption did not affect MTAase activity. These observations confirm and extend the findings of Kamatani et al. (Blood, 60: 1387-1391, 1982) by demonstrating that MTAase deficiency occurs in a variety of human malignancies including acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and solid tumors. This metabolic difference between normal and malignant cells may be therapeutically exploitable.","['Fitchen, J H', 'Riscoe, M K', 'Dana, B W', 'Lawrence, H J', 'Ferro, A J']","['Fitchen JH', 'Riscoe MK', 'Dana BW', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Ferro AJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)""]",IM,"['Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Pentosyltransferases/*deficiency', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/blood/*deficiency']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Oct;46(10):5409-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates whether these recipient NK cells spontaneously secrete lymphokines that modulate B cell function in a way analogous to that of in-vitro-activated NK cells from normal individuals. Large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) (which contain a high proportion of NK cells) have been prepared from the peripheral blood of 11 recipients of T-cell-depleted major-histocompatibility-complex-matched allografts. In the first 4-6 weeks after BMT these LGLs were found spontaneously to secrete interleukin 2, interferon gamma and B cell differentiation factor. While secretion of these factors declines by 20-24 weeks after BMT, the quantities are still greater than those seen from control donors. Patient LGLs are also able to activate autologous (donor) B cells, rendering them potentially responsive to the secreted factors. It appears likely that activated NK cells (or LGL) play a significant role in maintaining B cell function in vivo after T-cell-depleted BMT.","['Brenner, M K', 'Reittie, J E', 'Grob, J P', 'Wimperis, J Z', 'Stephens, S', 'Patterson, J', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Prentice, H G']","['Brenner MK', 'Reittie JE', 'Grob JP', 'Wimperis JZ', 'Stephens S', 'Patterson J', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Prentice HG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-198609000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1986 Sep;42(3):257-61. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198609000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell surface expression of T3 has been thought to depend upon association with Ti. In this study, we demonstrate that T3 can be expressed in the absence of an associated Ti molecule on a T-cell leukemic line, PEER. Instead, on this cell line, T3 appears to be expressed in association with a 55- to 60-kDa glycoprotein that has a peptide backbone of 29 kDa. PEER fails to express Ti alpha-chain transcripts but does express Ti beta- and gamma-chain transcripts. Using a monoclonal antibody that reacts with nonpolymorphic epitopes expressed on Ti, WT31, we demonstrate that PEER fails to react with this antibody but does react with three independently derived anti-T3 antibodies. Moreover, a small subpopulation of T3-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes, like PEER, fails to express the antigenic determinants recognized by WT31. These results suggest that, on these normal lymphocytes, T3 may likewise be associated with a non-Ti molecule. The possibility that the 55- to 60-kDa molecule expressed on PEER, termed ""Tp55-60,"" represents the protein product of the previously identified Ti gamma-chain gene is discussed.","['Weiss, A', 'Newton, M', 'Crommie, D']","['Weiss A', 'Newton M', 'Crommie D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Disulfides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.18.6998 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Sep;83(18):6998-7002. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.18.6998.,PMC386639,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of PRCA in our patients with CLL is about 6%. Eighty-seven percent of patients with PRCA had B-lymphocyte (B-cell) CLL and 13% had T-lymphocyte (T-cell) CLL. In 4 of 17 patients PRCA was the presenting feature, and in 13 of 17 it developed in patients previously diagnosed as having CLL. In the latter group, the average time from the diagnosis of CLL to the development of PRCA was 50.2 months (range, 1 to 96). The average age at presentation with PRCA was 61.6 years (range, 37 to 79), and the male to female ratio was 1.6 to 3:1. Eighty-one percent had splenomegaly and 65% had lymphadenopathy. The average hematocrit was 17 +/- 3.6% with zero reticulocyte count, and the lymphocyte count was 134 X 10(3)/microliter. Normoblasts were absent in the marrow and lymphocytes constituted 50 to 100% of the marrow cells. In patients with B-cell CLL and those with T-cell CLL, the T cells were found to inhibit the growth of the marrow erythroid progenitors in in vitro cultures. These abnormal T cells (Tr cells) possessed IgG Fc receptors on their surface, which may be responsible for induction of PRCA in these patients. Continued administration of cyclophosphamide and prednisone in moderate doses appears to induce remission from PRCA, but not until the leukemic mass and abnormal Tr cells are markedly reduced.

This toxin ADP-ribosylated a Mr approximately 40,000 protein, presumably the alpha subunit of Gi and/or Go, in the membranes. Reconstitution of the membranes ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin with Gi or Go purified from rat brain restored the fMLP-stimulated formation of the phosphorylated inositols. The efficiency of the rat brain Gi and Go in this capacity was roughly equal. The rat brain Gi or Go ADP-ribosylated beforehand by pertussis toxin was inactive in this reconstitution.

In the de novo pathway, synthesis of intermediates was analyzed with NaH[14C]O3 as a tracer. In the salvage pathway, the formation of nucleotides and free bases was studied with [3H]nucleosides (uridine, cytidine, thymidine, deoxyuridine, and deoxycytidine) tracers. Radioactivities of nucleotides were significantly lower in AL and CML-crisis cells than in CML and control cells in both pathways. These results suggest that the proliferative rate of cells was lower in the former cases than in the latter. Biosynthetic activities of nucleotides in the salvage pathway were about 100-300 times higher than those in the de novo pathway. It was calculated however, that as much as 70% of the amount of nucleic acids necessary for AL cells can be supplied by de novo biosynthesis, while in normal bone marrow cells the figure was about 30%.

Of special interest was the homeostasis of nitrogen, which was characterized by the loss of nitrogen and nitrogen balances. 10 patients with either transplantable panmyeolopathy or leukemia were investigated including a phase of immunsupressive treatment by total body radiation and cytostatic treatment. Parenteral nutrition was made with amino acids (1 g/kg/d), carbohydrates (6.5 g/kg/d) and fat (1 g/kg/d). During the preparatory phase nutrition was interrupted for two consecutive days because high amounts of electrolyte solution with up to 6 1/day were needed to protect the kidney. The period of investigation covered the complete period of treatment which endured up to three months. The essential result was the achievement of a constant body weight which decreased drastically under the conventional treatment without optimized nutrition.

IL-2 receptors are detectable in two different forms: as monomeric, surface expressed, and as dimeric, presumably non-surface expressed molecules. The dimeric form seems to be non-covalently bound to an as yet undefined 110 KD molecule. The functions of the monomeric versus the dimeric form, as well as that of the noncovalently bound molecule, and their relationship to high and low affinity IL-2 receptors are not yet clear and remain to be elucidated. Upon antigenic or mitogenic stimulation, IL-2 receptors became expressed at the surface of T-lymphocytes. Receptor expression is accompanied by the capacity of the cells to proliferate in response to IL-2. Resting T-cells do not proliferate in response to IL-2. IL-2 dependent proliferation of cells without external stimulation is either due to the presence of a small number of IL-2 receptor bearing cells in the respective population or due to a small number of IL-2 receptors present on the surface of cells. IL-2 itself does not induce IL-2 receptor expression on resting cells but has been shown to up-regulate its own receptor once expressed. In contrast to resting lymphocytes, some leukemic cells and early embryonic thymocytes in the species tested constitutively express IL-2 receptors. The role of such constitutively expressed receptors is not yet clear. As demonstrated in mice, the requirement(s) for induction of IL-2 receptor expression for the helper/inducer subset (Lyt-2+) are different from those of the cytotoxic/suppressor subset (L3T4+). In contrast to Lyt-2+ cells, the accessory cell requirement for L3T4+ cells could not be replaced by cytokines. Whether Lyt-2+ cells require an additional, not yet defined receptor inducing factor (RIF) besides IL-2 in order to become IL-2 receptor positive and to consequently proliferate in response to IL-2, is a matter of controversy. There is evidence that interleukin-1 and some functionally related factors produced by leukemic cells enhance expression and/or function of the IL-2 receptors. IL-2 receptors of the high and low affinity type expressed upon antigenic stimulation are cleared from the cell surface. As demonstrated in this report, the vast majority of them, probably those of low affinity type, are released from the cells continuously. The mechanism of their release and the possible immunoregulatory role of circulating receptors found in the serum of animals is not yet clear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Diamantstein, T', 'Osawa, H']","['Diamantstein T', 'Osawa H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Thymus Gland/embryology/immunology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1986.tb01491.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1986 Aug;92:5-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1986.tb01491.x.,,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel approach for improving both the specificity and the efficacy of experimental cancer chemotherapy is described in this review. The approach is based upon the use of L-histidinol in combination with conventional anticancer drugs. L-Histidinol, a structural analogue of the essential amino acid L-histidine, is a reversible inhibitor of protein biosynthesis which evokes disparate responses from non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic cells in culture. Whereas L-histidinol protects a wide variety of phenotypically normal cells from anticancer drug toxicity, it enhances the vulnerability of tumorigenic cells to the same agents. More importantly, these remarkable properties of L-histidinol are retained in tumour-bearing animals. Thus, L-histidinol diminishes the myelocytoxicity otherwise associated with the in vivo use of agents such as cytosine arabinoside and 5-fluorouracil. Simultaneously, L-histidinol increases the inherent capacities of these two antimetabolites to eradicate in situ tumour cells. More recently, it has been found that L-histidinol can increase both the specificity and the efficacy of a number of other antineoplastic agents. For example, alkylating agents such as BCNU, cyclophosphamide and cis-platinum, as well as the antitumour antibiotic daunomycin, can be combined with L-histidinol to provide curative treatment for tumour-bearing animals under conditions where these drugs, on their own, have little or no impact on survival. These results demonstrate that the L-histidinol/anticancer drug combination approach to chemotherapy is effective with a variety of clinically-relevant antineoplastic agents. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether this approach will prove applicable in, or effective for, human cancer chemotherapy.","['Warrington, R C']",['Warrington RC'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '501-28-0 (Histidinol)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Fluorouracil/toxicity', 'Histidinol/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Imidazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1986 May-Jun;6(3 Pt B):451-64.,,"['CA-14733/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",72,,,,,,,,,,,,

With unmodified regular bases, the first electrophilic addition always occurs on the 2'-oxygen of ribose (more slowly for pyrimidine than for purine); in a second step, cyclization of the reoxidized product leads to a spiro derivative: only one stereoisomer is detected with purine nucleoside; the other stereoisomer appears as a minor product (10-20%) with nucleotides and pyrimidine nucleosides. With modified bases, no change is observed except for bases exhibiting an additional strong nucleophilic center: oxidized elliptinium alkylates thioguanine and thioguanosine on the sulfur atom and in this last case not on the ribose moiety.

Profound lymphopenia was observed in four of five patients with decreased and qualitatively impaired helper/inducer (T4) cells and increased T suppressor/cytotoxic (T8) cells. Observed in all patients was impaired endogenous production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), expression of the IL-2 receptor combined with diminished responses to mitogens, mixed leukocytes reaction (MLR), and natural killer (NK) reactivity. In vitro supplement of exogenous IL-2 markedly augmented T and NK cell functions, as well as the expression of activation antigens on both T4 and T8 cell in four of five patients.

Incubation of the promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells and the two chemically induced differentiated cells with carbon 14-labeled arachidonic acid overnight resulted in the incorporation of label mainly into cellular phospholipids. Stimulation of the labeled cells with Ca2+ ionophore (A23187) resulted in the generation of lipoxygenase products in all the cells. Notably, the DMSO-induced differentiated granulocytic cells biosynthesized predominantly the peptidoeicosatetraenoic acids LTC4 and LTD4 compared with the dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid LTB4. On the other hand, the TPA-induced differentiated monocytic-macrophage cells biosynthesized predominantly LTB4 compared with LTC4 and LTD4. The undifferentiated promyelocytic cells lacked the capacity to biosynthesize LTB4, as evidenced in the chemically induced differentiated cells. The monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) 5-HETE, a metabolite of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, was a minor component in these cells, and 12-HETE and 15-HETE were barely detectable.

The expression of the Bac-1 antigen precedes that of IL 2 receptors (Tac-1). Peak expression of the Bac-1 antigen was observed on day 3 after activation, and decreased thereafter. The Bac-1 antigen was present on a minor subpopulation of relatively large B cells isolated from blood samples, and on ""preactivated"" B cells of heterogeneous size isolated from spleens and tonsils. It was not detected on bone marrow pre-B cells, blood small B cells, or plasma cells, nor was it expressed by resting or activated T cells or nonlymphoid cells. Certain B cell neoplasms and B lymphoblastoid cell lines were Bac-1+, but neoplastic cells of non-B lineage were Bac-1-. With immunoperoxidase staining, Bac-1+ cells were detected predominantly in the germinal centers of tonsil sections. The Bac-1 antigen on activated B cells was destroyed by protease treatment and was enhanced by neuraminidase treatment, suggesting that the Bac-1 antibody detects a cell surface molecule via an antigenic determinant which is partially obscured by neighboring sialic acid residues. The reactivity pattern of Bac-1 differs from the patterns of cellular reactivity reported for other monoclonal antibodies with specificity for activated human B cells.","['Suzuki, T', 'Sanders, S K', 'Butler, J L', 'Gartland, G L', 'Komiyama, K', 'Cooper, M D']","['Suzuki T', 'Sanders SK', 'Butler JL', 'Gartland GL', 'Komiyama K', 'Cooper MD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/immunology']",1986/08/15 00:00,1986/08/15 00:01,['1986/08/15 00:00'],"['1986/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Aug 15;137(4):1208-13.,,"['CA 13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to PNU for 42 days resulted in the appearance of potentially lymphomatous cells first in the thymus, and overt T-lymphomas subsequently appeared. Such cells seemed to be thymus-dependent, since intrathymic transfer of the thymus cells from 42-day PNU-treated rats induced T-lymphomas much more efficiently than intravenous transfer. Further, grafting of the thymus from 42-day PNU-treated rats into thymectomized rats resulted in T-lymphomas of donor origin without additional PNU treatment. Cells from the spleen or bone marrow from the same donors did not give rise to T-lymphomas irrespective of the route of cell transfer and sublethal irradiation of the recipients. Morphologically atypical cell foci were detected first on the 28th day in the thymus and were most pronounced during the 35th-42nd days.

However, in the present studies, neuraminidase treatment was associated with increased cell loss on filtration; trypsin treatment with small decreases in cell loss, and EGTA treatment with decreased loss. Consideration of the effects of these agents on cell deformability and membrane strength suggests that under the described experimental conditions, the latter appears more important for survival than the former. As proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes and calcium ions are involved in the release of cancer cells from tumors and invasive events, the effects described here may be relevant to the variability of cancer cells with respect to the metastatic process.","['Gabor, H', 'Weiss, L']","['Gabor H', 'Weiss L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Invasion Metastasis,Invasion & metastasis,8202435,"['526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Filtration', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invasion Metastasis. 1986;6(3):166-79.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GP-70 was expressed only in CLL patients whereas multiple myeloma patients, blood donors and patients with unexplained lymphocytosis were all negative to GP-70. SmIg was expressed in CLL patients and in some of the multiple myeloma patients. Subgrouping of CLL patients to ""early"", stable patients (10) and to more advanced CLL patients (15) revealed differential expression of GP-70 on CLL cells from patients with more advanced stage of disease rather than in the patients with the ""early"" stable clinical course of disease. SmIg, on the other hand, was expressed equally on both subgroups of CLL. Furthermore, in some cases (25%) where SmIg and the light chains of Ig were only weakly expressed or were absent, GP-70 was markedly expressed. These findings suggest that GP-70 can be used as a single laboratory determination to establish clonality of the B-lymphocyte proliferation in CLL.

Studies of the structure of TcR beta in hematologic malignancies have revealed rearrangement in almost all of the T cell malignancies and a small proportion of non-T cell malignancies. In addition, clonal involvement of T cells in diseases such as Hodgkin's disease, angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, and chronic T cell lymphocytosis have been observed. The study of the structure of the TcR beta gene is thus a useful tool for identifying clonal expansions of cells and in conjunction with studies of the immunoglobulin gene structure, and cell surface markers a useful tool for identifying cell lineage. At the present time the evaluation of the structure of the alpha chain genes has not been as fruitful. However, chromosome translocations involving the TcR alpha chain genes have been recognized and, in one case, this rearrangement has been in association with a known oncogene. With the isolation of more probes to the alpha chain region it should be possible to test its utility in identifying clonal populations and cell lineage. The recent isolation of the gamma gene of the T cell will also permit such studies.

The major cyclooxygenase product synthesized by the HL-60 cells after 3-4 days exposure to 1 alpha,25- dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (48 nM) was thromboxane B2 and its production was about 19-25-times higher than that of untreated HL-60 cells. The percent conversion of thromboxane B2 from [1-14C]arachidonic acid in the 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (48 nM, 3 day exposure)-treated HL-60 cells was about 4.4% as compared to that (about 0.3%) of the untreated cells, whereas the percent conversion of thromboxane B2 from [1-14C]prostaglandin H2 in the 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3-treated cell homogenate was about 22.4% as compared to that (about 13.6%) of the untreated cell homogenate. The stimulatory effect of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 on thromboxane B2 production from [1-14C]arachidonic acid and from [1-14C]prostaglandin H2 in HL-60 cells was inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml). However, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (48 nM) did not significantly stimulate the arachidonic acid release either in HL-60 cells or in 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3-induced cells. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 on the thromboxane production in HL-60 cells was not due to the activation of phospholipase A2 but due to the induction of fatty acid cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthetase activities.

The dGTP pool was most drastically affected, becoming totally depleted within 3 hours. The fall in all 4 dNTP pools was substantially prevented by 3-aminobenzamide, suggesting that the decrease in dNTPs following DNA damage is mediated by a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase dependent reaction.

These is also a need to clarify the risk in the case of radiotherapeutical exposure. In this study, therefore, cases of post-irradiated uterine carcinoma which was well cured and followed up over a long term were selected for statistical analysis of radiation-induced cancer in the medical division. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 19,384 patients with uterine carcinoma at seven institutions in Japan were registered on a computer system at the NIRS and were statistically analyzed. Of these, 6,655 patients were treated by surgical procedure alone, 4,310 were given a combined treatment modality of radiation and surgery, 8,419 were treated by radiation alone between 1960 and 1978. Radiation-induced cancer was defined according to the following categories: Secondary cancer was developed within the irradiated field. Time interval was over 5 years after the initial irradiation (leukemia was over 2 years). The cancer had a different histological type to the original one. A total of 43 patients with induced cancer were observed, namely: 14 with rectal cancer, 8 with leukemia, 6 with uterine corpus cancer, 4 with urinary bladder cancer, 3 with osteosarcoma or uterine sarcoma, 2 with sigmoid colon cancer or malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and 1 with ovarian cancer, respectively. RESULTS: Rectal cancer, leukemia and urinary bladder cancer were initially analyzed, because their expected values were easily estimated from the basic data. A total of 8,333 patients (43,418 person-years) from 7 institutions were considered. Their average follow-up period was 10.2 years after treatment. 1) Rectal cancer: Observed value (O) = 14, expected value (E) = 7.83, O/E = 1.79, 95% confidence interval of O/E ratio (CI) = 0.98-2.99, there was no significant difference. 2) Leukemia: O = 8, E = 3.78, O/E = 2.12, CI = 0.91-4.18, no significant difference. 3) Urinary bladder cancer: O = 4, E = 2.23, O/E = 1.79, CI = 0.49-4.55, no significant difference. In other words, no significant difference was observed in the risk of occurrence of secondary cancer among the total number of irradiated patients from the 7 institutions. Since these results, however, were influenced by the accuracy of patient follow-up, the O/E ratio of double cancer in each institution was observed to check the accuracy of the follow-up and 3 institutions were selected for further analysis comprising 2,686 patients (13,588 person-years) in all. Their average follow-up period was 10.1 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Arai, T', 'Fukuhisa, K', 'Takeda, E', 'Murata, M', 'Kasamatsu, T', 'Tsunematsu, R', 'Masubuchi, K', 'Fukuda, T', 'Noguchi, H', 'Chihara, T']","['Arai T', 'Fukuhisa K', 'Takeda E', 'Murata M', 'Kasamatsu T', 'Tsunematsu R', 'Masubuchi K', 'Fukuda T', 'Noguchi H', 'Chihara T', 'et al.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

When low concentrations (less than 10 antiviral units/ml) of interferons were used, and equal numbers of antiviral units of E. coli-derived IFN-gamma and E. coli-derived IFN-alpha A or IFN-alpha 2 were compared for their ability to augment NK, E. coli-derived IFN-gamma was found to be more active in augmenting NK against the K562 targets, than E. coli-derived IFN-alpha A or IFN-alpha 2. Antiviral units in these experiments were determined by the standard cytopathic effect assay using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-challenged human fibroblasts, trisomic for chromosome 21. However, when these interferons were compared on a weight basis (ng/ml) or on a molar basis, their ability to augment NK against the K562 targets was comparable. These differences in the relative abilities of these interferons (when their concentrations were expressed in antiviral units/ml) to augment NK, were due to an approximately 100-fold difference in their specific activities (antiviral units per mg of interferon). These were 1.8 X 10(6) units/mg for E. coli-derived IFN-gamma, 2.0 X 10(8) units/mg for E. coli-derived IFN-alpha A, and 1.8 X 10(8) units/mg for E. coli-derived IFN-alpha 2. At concentrations higher than 10 units/ml, all these interferons showed a similar ability to augment NK. Studies on the kinetics of the augmentation revealed that in vitro treatment with E. coli-derived IFN-gamma for several hours was necessary for augmentation of NK against targets from haemopoietic human tumour cell lines (K562, Daudi). In contrast, alpha interferons were able to augment NK after treatment in vitro for significantly shorter periods (30 min or less with certain donors). Augmentation of NK cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes by E. coli-derived IFN-gamma was not accompanied by the induction of interleukin 2 (IL-2) production, suggesting that IL-2 is not involved in the augmentation of NK by IFN-gamma. A monoclonal antibody specific for human IFN-gamma blocked augmentation of NK by E. coli-derived IFN-gamma and natural IFN-gamma, but not by E. coli-derived IFN-alpha A or staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Platsoucas, C D']",['Platsoucas CD'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Escherichia coli/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology/*pharmacology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1986.tb02073.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1986 Jul;24(1):93-108. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1986.tb02073.x.,,"['CA 32070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41699/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Scand J Immunol 1987 Jan;25(1):107'],,,,,,,,,

Both IgM and IgG1 share the same idiotype and use the same VDJ rearrangement. Here, a detailed Southern blot analysis of the entire constant region of the Ig heavy chain (Ig CH) locus of parental (BCL1.B1) and variants (BCL1.B2) DNA showed no detectable rearrangement. Similar analysis of the JH-C mu region led to the conclusion that two heavy chain alleles present in the IgM/IgG1-producing variants carried the same VDJ rearrangement but differed in their 3' flanking regions. One chromosome 12 did not carry any Ig CH genes, whereas, the other chromosome 12 carried one copy of CH genes. In BCL1.B1, however, each of the chromosome 12 alleles carried a full copy of CH genes. Karyotypic analysis confirmed the presence of two translocated t(12;16) chromosomes in both BCL1.2.58 and BCL1.B1 cells, with a break 5' to the VH locus at the distal region (12F2) of chromosome 12, and at the proximal region below the centromere (16B3) of chromosome 16. We conclude that double production of IgM and IgG1 in BCL1.B2 is accomplished by transcription of the corresponding CH genes in germline configuration using a single VDJ on the same chromosome 12.","['Chen, Y W', 'Word, C', 'Dev, V', 'Uhr, J W', 'Vitetta, E S', 'Tucker, P W']","['Chen YW', 'Word C', 'Dev V', 'Uhr JW', 'Vitetta ES', 'Tucker PW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Allotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Constant Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antibody Diversity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Immunoglobulin Allotypes/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Regions/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.164.2.562 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1986 Aug 1;164(2):562-79. doi: 10.1084/jem.164.2.562.,PMC2188233,"['AI-11851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we document that monoclonal antibody 9.3, which recognizes a 90,000 dalton homodimer expressed on human T cells, synergizes with ligands reacting with T3/Ti to activate purified T cells and Jurkat, a human T cell leukemic line. Unlike phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), 9.3 was able to synergize only with anti-T3 or anti-Ti if these antibodies were immobilized. Moreover, 9.3 failed to synergize with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. At high concentrations only, 9.3 could synergize with PMA in the activation of Jurkat and a T3/Ti negative mutant of Jurkat. At such high concentrations of 9.3, small transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium ((Ca++)i) were detected in quin 2-loaded Jurkat cells. This increase in (Ca++)i was the result of release of internal stores of calcium. 9.3 induced the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides, albeit the magnitude of inositol phosphates generated in response to 9.3 was substantially less than that observed with anti-Ti. No effect on pkC translocation was observed in Jurkat cells stimulated with 9.3. Although the small increase in (Ca++)i induced by 9.3 may account for its synergy with PMA, this effect is unlikely to account for the more potent synergistic effect observed with 9.3 and phytohemagglutinin or immobilized anti-T3 and anti-Ti antibodies.","['Weiss, A', 'Manger, B', 'Imboden, J']","['Weiss A', 'Manger B', 'Imboden J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mutation', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Aug 1;137(3):819-25.,,['AI14104/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, IFN-gamma treatment of the murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-induced AKR SL3 tumor, a cell line that normally expresses moderate levels of class I MHC antigens, resulted in a large increase in H-2Dk expression, but no change or a slight decrease in H-2Kk expression as measured by cytofluorography. Explanations of the selective enhancement of Dk expression based on increased Fc receptor display or differential kinetics of induction were ruled out. The phenomenon was observed over a wide range of doses of IFN-gamma and with two different monoclonal antibodies to Kk, the latter finding making it unlikely that an altered form of the Kk molecule was induced. The same differential induction of the Dk antigen was observed for the LBRM.5A4 tumor cell line. Because LBRM.5A4 is also MuLV+ but of congenic B10.BR (H-2k) origin, these results were consistent with the possibility that such differential induction was associated with the H-2k haplotype and/or MuLV. The implications of these results, as a possible mechanism of tumor cell escape from an immune surveillance system monitored by class I MHC-restricted T cells and as a useful model system to dissect the mechanism of IFN-gamma induction of class I MHC antigens, are discussed.","['Green, W R', 'Phillips, J D']","['Green WR', 'Phillips JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'H-2 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Aug 1;137(3):814-8.,,"['AI22023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Binding studies with 125I-labelled TNF-alpha indicated specific binding in 8/10 cell lines with approximately 10-fold differences in the quantity of TNF-alpha bound by these distinct cell lines. Scatchard analyses of TNF-binding revealed the existence of high-affinity membrane receptors (Kd 1.5 X 10(-10) M) and approximately 3,000 binding sites/cell on both U937 and K562, representing 2 cell lines with high and low TNF sensitivity, respectively. Disuccinimidyl-suberate cross-linking of receptor-bound 125I-TNF-alpha and SDS-PAGE of membrane preparations of either U937 or K562 cells suggest a single receptor protein with an apparent molecular weight of 76 kDa. Comparison of the TNF-alpha binding capacity versus in vitro growth inhibition provides evidence that sensitivity to TNF-alpha is determined both at the level of receptor expression and at a post-receptor level. IFN-gamma strongly enhanced the TNF-alpha-mediated growth inhibition of 3 sensitive cell lines, but had no effect on 7 other leukemic cell lines with little or no TNF sensitivity. No correlation was found between this enhancement of TNF sensitivity and the IFN-gamma-mediated increase in TNF-cell membrane receptors, suggesting that IFN-gamma predominantly exerts its synergistic effect distal to TNF-binding.","['Scheurich, P', 'Ucer, U', 'Kronke, M', 'Pfizenmaier, K']","['Scheurich P', 'Ucer U', 'Kronke M', 'Pfizenmaier K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Trypsin', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",1986/07/15 00:00,1986/07/15 00:01,['1986/07/15 00:00'],"['1986/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910380120 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1986 Jul 15;38(1):127-33. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910380120.,,,,,,['Int J Cancer 1986 Dec 15;38(6):929'],,,,,,,,,

They also exhibited three- to fourfold increases in spontaneous frequency of chromosome aberrations (CAs). To determine whether the high level of SCE frequency in AC 12 is caused by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) used for visualizing SCEs, the effect of BrdUrd incorporated into DNA on SCE induction was analyzed. The SCE frequencies in AC 12 remained constant at BrdUrd incorporation levels corresponding to 2-90% substitution for thymidine in DNA. In addition, the small amount of BrdUrd incorporated into both daughter and parenteral DNA strands in AC 12 had minimal effect on SCE induction. Furthermore, AC 12 and AC 41 were slightly resistant to BrdUrd with respect to the induction of CAs, the inhibition of cell-cycle progression and the decrease in mitotic activity. These findings suggest that the high incidence of SCEs in AC 12 and AC 41 is formed by their intrinsic defects, not by the effects of BrdUrd used. The analysis of SCE frequencies in hybrid cells between these mutants and the parental L5178Y revealed that the genetic defects in AC 12 and AC 41 appear to be recessive, and that these two mutants belong to the same complementation group. Furthermore, AC 12 belonged to a different complementation group from ES 4, which was isolated previously from L5178Y as an SCE mutant with a twofold higher frequency of spontaneous SCEs. This finding indicates that at least two different genetic defects participate in the formation of the high incidence of spontaneous SCEs in mouse cells. These SCE mutants would provide valuable cell materials for studying the molecular mechanism of SCE formation.","['Tsuji, H', 'Shiomi, T', 'Tsuji, S', 'Tobari, I', 'Ayusawa, D', 'Shimizu, K', 'Seno, T']","['Tsuji H', 'Shiomi T', 'Tsuji S', 'Tobari I', 'Ayusawa D', 'Shimizu K', 'Seno T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genetics,Genetics,0374636,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Aphidicolin', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*toxicity', 'Drug Resistance', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/*drug effects', 'Thioguanine/toxicity']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/genetics/113.2.433 [doi]'],ppublish,Genetics. 1986 Jun;113(2):433-47. doi: 10.1093/genetics/113.2.433.,PMC1202848,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells do not produce TCR alpha mRNA, but do contain T3 delta and T3 epsilon mRNA and accumulate T3 polypeptides, primarily in the perinuclear envelope. Equivalent normal T cells isolated from thymus have a predominantly germ-line configuration of TCR beta but contain intracellular T3 proteins.

Cells were arrested in early G1 by density inhibition in the absence of serum and in late G1 by addition of aphidicolin. Cells synchronized in early G1, when stimulated with G-CSF, showed enhanced expression of FcR and lysozyme activity. Eighty percent of the cells expressed FcR 18 hr after addition of G-CSF while, in exponentially growing cells, this percentage was reached 72 hr after addition of G-CSF.

Studies using X chromosome-linked DNA polymorphisms strongly suggested that leukemic blast cells in this form of leukemia can differentiate in vivo to form mature granulocytes. Common chromosomal changes seen in blast cells, such as the addition of a chromosome 8 or the loss of a chromosome 7, were found to be present in the mature granulocytes of patients with leukemia. In addition, rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene was detected in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes of one patient. Finally, we have observed the persistence of a single dominant hemopoietic clone in the granulocytes of 3 of 13 patients in complete remission.

Phospholipids such as phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl inositol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine, which are known to be activators of protein kinase C, enhanced the phosphorylation of the 36K-Da protein. In contrast, 1-(5-isoquinoline sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) which has been identified as a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C in vitro decreased incorporation of radioactive phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP into this protein. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of the 36K-Da protein of RBL-2H3 cell membranes is catalyzed by protein kinase C. H-7 also inhibited the release of serotonin from RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with an antigen or calcium ionophore A23187 and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Treatment of the antigen-stimulated cells with TPA caused a synergistic effect on the serotonin release.

To investigate the nature and the mode of action of this hemolytic activity, serum samples from 24 patients with AML were studied by incubation of normal human erythrocytes together with patient serum in the presence of sucrose at low ionic strength (inverse sucrose hemolysis test, ISHT). Fifty-five percent of the serum samples collected during the active stage of the disease gave a hemolysis rate of greater than 4%, whereas in remission only 15% of the samples lysed erythrocytes. Substitution of raffinose, lactose, or polyethylene glycol 400 for sucrose resulted in an almost complete failure of hemolysis under standard conditions, indicating a minor role of the low ionic strength in the ISHT. Heat inactivation, preincubation with inulin, and addition of EDTA, Mg2+-EGTA, or heparin completely abolished hemolytic activities of AML sera when the incubation was carried out for 30 minutes (standard conditions of the ISHT). A prolongation of the incubation time resulted in delayed hemolysis only with the Mg2+-EGTA-treated AML sera. The kinetics of this hemolysis by Mg2+-EGTA-treated AML sera were similar to those of normal human serum in the presence or absence of Mg2+-EGTA. Hemolysis was also obtained by performing the ISHT with normal sera and erythrocytes preincubated with AML sera.

The cell-associated 35S-labeled proteoglycans were extracted from the MMC-enriched cell preparation by the addition of detergent and 4 M guanidine HCl and were partially purified by density gradient centrifugation. The isolated proteoglycans were of approximately 150,000 m.w., were resistant to pronase degradation, and contained highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate side chains. Analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography of chondroitinase ABC-treated 35S-labeled proteoglycans from these rat MMC revealed that the chondroitin sulfate chains consisted predominantly of disaccharides with the disulfated di-B structure (IdUA-2SO4----GalNAc-4SO4) and disaccharides with the monosulfated A structure (G1cUA----GalNAc-4SO4). The ratio of disaccharides of the di-B to A structure ranged from 0.4 to 1.6 in three experiments.

They are homologous to the chondroitin sulfate-rich proteoglycans of the transformed rat basophilic leukemia-1 cell and the cultured interleukin 3-dependent mouse bone marrow-derived mast cell, in that these chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans as well as rat serosal mast cell heparin proteoglycans are all highly sulfated, protease-resistant proteoglycans.","['Stevens, R L', 'Lee, T D', 'Seldin, D C', 'Austen, K F', 'Befus, A D', 'Bienenstock, J']","['Stevens RL', 'Lee TD', 'Seldin DC', 'Austen KF', 'Befus AD', 'Bienenstock J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan)', '24967-94-0 (Dermatan Sulfate)', '9007-27-6 (Chondroitin)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Chondroitin Lyases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chondroitin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Chondroitin Lyases/metabolism', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/*analysis', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/analysis', 'Dermatan Sulfate/*analysis', 'Disaccharides/analysis', 'Glycosaminoglycans/analysis', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*analysis', 'Mast Cells/*analysis', 'Nematode Infections/*metabolism', 'Nippostrongylus', 'Peptide Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Proteoglycans/*analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jul 1;137(1):291-5.,,"['AI-22531/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-35984/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36110/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reagents were made by conjugating T101, which binds to the T cell antigen CD5, to either intact ricin or purified ricin A chain. We found that T101-A chain modulated CD5 more efficiently than T101-ricin, which modulated CD5 more efficiently than T101 alone. Kinetic studies showed that maximal modulation of IT was reached within 3 hr. When toxicity of the reagents was tested in protein synthesis inhibition assays, T101-ricin in the presence of lactose inhibited 99% of the protein synthesis of CEM cells. T101-A chain was less toxic, inhibiting protein synthesis only 23 to 43%. The addition of the potentiating agent monensin nearly doubled the toxicity of T101-A chain, but did not affect T101-A chain modulation. To determine the fate of bound IT, T101 and T101-ricin were labeled with 125I. Cells were incubated under modulating conditions in the presence of radiolabeled reagents. T101 and T101-ricin were internalized into CEM cells. In contrast, T101, but not T101-ricin, appeared to be shed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our findings show clearly that: 1) the presence of toxin on antibody does not inhibit--and may actually enhance--modulation; 2) T101-IT are internalized, not shed from the cell surface; 3) the lack of toxicity of T101-A chain is not attributed to inability to modulate; 4) there is no correlation between enhancement of T101-A chain toxicity by monensin and antigenic modulation by A chain reagents; and 5) modulation, which is undesirable in monoclonal antibody therapy, may be advantageous in the therapeutic use of IT.","['Manske, J M', 'Buchsbaum, D J', 'Azemove, S M', 'Hanna, D E', 'Vallera, D A']","['Manske JM', 'Buchsbaum DJ', 'Azemove SM', 'Hanna DE', 'Vallera DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/metabolism', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Ricin/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1986/06/15 00:00,1986/06/15 00:01,['1986/06/15 00:00'],"['1986/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jun 15;136(12):4721-8.,,"['CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF (LuKII) and recombinant TNF-alpha caused a similar dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation from CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM. Day 7 CFU-GM colonies were more sensitive than both day 14 CFU-GM colonies and day 7 CFU-GM clusters to inhibition by TNF. BFU-E colonies and CFU-GEMM colonies were least sensitive to inhibition with TNF. The suppressive effects of TNF (LuKII) and recombinant TNF-alpha were inactivated respectively with hetero-anti-human TNF (LuKII) and monoclonal anti-recombinant human TNF-alpha. The hetero-anti-TNF (LuKII) did not inactivate the suppressive effects of TNF-alpha and the monoclonal anti-recombinant TNF-alpha did not inactivate TNF (LuKII). The suppressive effects of TNF did not appear to be mediated via endogenous T lymphocytes and/or monocytes in the bone marrow preparation, and a pulse exposure of marrow cells with TNF for 60 min resulted in maximal or near maximal inhibition when compared with cells left with TNF for the full culture incubation period. A degree of species specificity was noted in that human TNF were more active against human marrow CFU-GM colonies than against mouse marrow CFU-GM colonies. Samples of bone marrow from patients with non-remission myeloid leukemia were set up in the CFU-GM assay and formed the characteristic abnormal growth pattern of large numbers of small sized clusters. These cluster-forming cells were more sensitive to inhibition by TNF than were the CFU-GM colonies and clusters grown from the bone marrow of normal donors. The sensitivity to TNF of colony formation by CFU-GM of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in partial or complete remission was comparable with that of normal donors. When combinations of TNF and HuIFN were evaluated together, it was noted that TNF (LuKII) or recombinant TNF synergized with natural or recombinant HuIFN-gamma, but not with HuIFN-alpha, to suppress colony formation of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM from bone marrow of normal donors at concentrations that had no suppressive effects when molecules were used alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Broxmeyer, H E', 'Williams, D E', 'Lu, L', 'Cooper, S', 'Anderson, S L', 'Beyer, G S', 'Hoffman, R', 'Rubin, B Y']","['Broxmeyer HE', 'Williams DE', 'Lu L', 'Cooper S', 'Anderson SL', 'Beyer GS', 'Hoffman R', 'Rubin BY']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",1986/06/15 00:00,1986/06/15 00:01,['1986/06/15 00:00'],"['1986/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Jun 15;136(12):4487-95.,,"['CA 36740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38661/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'IT32 AM 07519/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monoclonal antibody HD39 detects a two-chain glycoprotein with apparent molecular weights of 130,000 and 140,000. During B cell ontogeny, HD39 is first expressed in the cytoplasm of bone marrow derived pre-B cells, then appears on the cell surface of sIgM+ B cells, and finally on the majority of sIgM+ sIgD+ resting B cells. After activation in vitro, the expression of HD39 on the cell surface first increases, and then the antigen is lost as cells begin to differentiate. HD39 is weakly expressed on very few non-T cell ALL and B cell CLL, on approximately 50% of B cell lymphomas, and not on Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemias and myelomas. In contrast, it is strongly expressed on all hairy cell leukemias.

For this reason we investigated clinical data and endocrine parameters (FSH, LH, PRL, E2, progesterone) of 51 adolescent females. Our clinical data showed that intermittent pulse chemotherapy as administered to most patients with solid tumours leads to a more pronounced growth retardation than continuous low dose chemotherapy as given to patients with leukemia and lymphomas. Girls treated prior to menarche failed to start menstruation while on chemotherapy, but all had their menarche shortly after cessation of the treatment. Most of the girls treated post menarche developed amenorrhoea, whereas some had irregular cycles unless they were on a very mild drug regimen. From the endocrinous data we concluded that primary ovarian failure was rare and occurred in adolescent girls only after a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In girls with regular menstrual cycles after treatment a high incidence of anovulation or an inadequate luteal phase could be observed.

By this means, we demonstrate complex LBL phenotypic profiles, revealing 3 major immunologic subtypes: immature T cell, 7 cases; intermediate or mature T cell, 3 cases; immature B cell (pre-pre-B), 2 cases. This phenotypic diversity challenges the basic belief that all LBL are the same. Our immature T-cell cases with frequent simultaneous Leu 2/3/6/9/CALLA/Tdt expression correspond to cortical thymic phenotypes; our mature T-cell phenotypes with Leu 9/la expression and absent L6/Tdt correspond either to medullary thymocytes or post-thymic T cells; our pre-pre-B phenotypes with simultaneous Tdt/CALLA/B4 expression correspond to common acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) phenotypes. Mature T-LBL phenotypes are similar to ""novel"" peripheral T-cell lymphoma phenotypes. Scant or absent Tdt expression in mature LBL is not an isolated antigenic change but a complete phenotypic profile difference from immature T-LBL. The major T- and B-cell phenotypes of LBL might have therapeutic significance. Treatment among LBL phenotypes may need to vary as with acute lymphocytic leukemia phenotypes.

Patients receiving cis-platinum, however, experience very profound and long lasting gastrointestinal symptoms. The role of intestinal mucosal toxicity in the pathogenesis of these symptoms is unclear. In this study we have investigated the thiol-containing compound mesna (sodium-2-mercaptoethanesulfonate) as a potential antidote to cis-platinum-induced gastrointestinal tract damage. In mice, mesna caused a significant reduction in the gastrointestinal toxicity of cis-platinum assessed by electron microscopy, villus recovery rate, and by disaccharidase estimations. Mesna also significantly reduced serum creatinine levels following cis-platinum. Administration of mesna prior (or immediately following) a 67% lethal dose of cis-platinum protected 87-100% of the animals from the lethal effects. The antitumor efficacy of cis-platinum in L1210 leukemia bearing mice was not affected by coadministration of mesna indicating that the protective effect may be tissue specific. In addition this finding indicates that mesna has potential as an agent which may improve the therapeutic index of cis-platinum in clinical practice.","['Allan, S G', 'Smyth, J F', 'Hay, F G', 'Leonard, R C', 'Wolf, C R']","['Allan SG', 'Smyth JF', 'Hay FG', 'Leonard RC', 'Wolf CR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Disaccharidases)', 'NR7O1405Q9 (Mesna)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Disaccharidases/metabolism', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/pathology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptoethanol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Mesna/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jul;46(7):3569-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph') is the characteristic karyotypic abnormality seen in this disease, although the exact role of this clonal marker in the pathogenesis of CML is uncertain. At a molecular level, the Ph' has recently been shown to represent the translocation of c-abl to a limited (breakpoint cluster region, bcr) on chromosome 22. We have used probes for the bcr gene to obtain molecular evidence for the clonal origin of blast crisis in 2 patient with CML. In both cases, the first with myeloid and the second with lymphoid blast crisis, there was rearrangement of the bcr gene. The patterns of rearrangement varied between patients but were identical when comparing acute and chronic phases within the same individual. As the Ph' translocation is thought to represent a random recombination event these data not only provide further evidence for the clonal origin of blast crisis in CML, but also suggest that in the second patient this translocation event had already occurred at the pluripotent stem cell.","['Zalcberg, J R', 'Friedlander, M L', 'Minden, M D']","['Zalcberg JR', 'Friedlander ML', 'Minden MD']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Phenotype', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1986.73 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1986 Apr;53(4):459-64. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1986.73.,PMC2001434,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of ABA and retinoic acid on NBT dye reduction and appearance of mature neutrophils and bands was synergistic, whereas the effects of these agents on hexose monophosphate shunt activity were additive. The differentiation inducing capacity of ABA in the presence of retinoic acid was dose-related. The influence of ABA on TPA-induced markers of macrophage differentiation was assessed by determining the proportion of adherent cells produced after treatment and by measuring acid phosphatase activity in the adherent cell fraction. In the presence of ABA, the number of cells adhering to plastic declined after day 2 of exposure to TPA, and acid phosphatase activity in adherent cells was inhibited fourfold (p = 0.01). The influence of ABA on the phenotypic markers of granulocyte and macrophage differentiation was detectable at concentrations that were not cytotoxic. The influence of ABA on HL-60 differentiation is similar to that previously reported for human bone marrow CFU-GM.

None developed leukaemia. The tumours are B-cell neoplasms with a characteristic immunophenotype: leucocyte common antigen+, common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen-, B 1-antigen+, surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin-. Flow cytometry revealed DNA-diploidy in 7 cases and a moderately (3.2-3.8%) to extremely high (8.0-20.6%) S-phase component. The proliferation associated antigen Ki67 was detectable in 10-60% of the tumour cell nuclei, thus stressing the considerable or rapid growth. Histopathology is characterized by a diffuse growth pattern and a clearness and abundance of cytoplasm of the pleomorphic tumour cells, which vary in size and nuclear morphology from patient to patient. Apoptoses are more numerous than mitoses. Fibrosis and focal necrosis are common, sclerosis is present in 3 cases.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the T-lymphocyte receptor for antigen (Ti) and/or its associated structure, CD3, activate T cells. More recently, a second pathway of activation has been described which involves the sheep erythrocyte binding glycoprotein CD2, a surface molecule distinct from Ti-CD3. Lysates from surface-iodinated T-leukaemia cell lines were treated with lectin and affinity purified anti-lectin antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose. We have shown that eluates from Con A/anti-Con A or PHA/anti-PHA immunoprecipitates contained Ti, since a rabbit anti-T alpha serum, which recognizes the native and denatured forms of the constant region of the alpha chain, immunoprecipitated Ti from these eluates. Furthermore, Ti immunoprecipitated by anti-T alpha serum from lysates of surface iodinated E+ lymphocytes was binding to PHA after elution from the immunoprecipitate. When the purified Ti molecule was reduced and alkylated, allowing the permanent dissociation of its alpha and beta subunits, PHA interacted with both chains, whereas anti-T alpha serum immunoprecipitated the alpha chain only. Altogether, these results demonstrate that PHA interacts with both chains of the T cell receptor for antigen on human peripheral T lymphocytes. With the HPB-ALL tumour line, a similar approach showed that both alpha and beta chains of Ti bind to Con A and Ulex europaeus 1 but not Helix pomatia. Affinity chromatography on immobilized lectins and immunoprecipitation with lectin/anti-lectin antibodies were employed to test whether CD2 binds to PHA and Con A. The results show that CD2 from human peripheral T lymphocytes binds both lectins but with a lower affinity for PHA than Con A.","['Leca, G', 'Boumsell, L', 'Fabbi, M', 'Reinherz, E L', 'Kanellopoulos, J M']","['Leca G', 'Boumsell L', 'Fabbi M', 'Reinherz EL', 'Kanellopoulos JM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Concanavalin A/metabolism', 'Fabaceae', 'Humans', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phytohemagglutinins/*metabolism', 'Plant Lectins', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1986.tb01985.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1986 May;23(5):535-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1986.tb01985.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cultured T cells for therapy had been induced to grow in vitro for 62 d by intermittent stimulation with irradiated FBL-3. At the time of therapy, such antigen-driven long term-cultured T cells were greatly expanded in number, proliferated in vitro in response to FBL-3, and were specifically cytotoxic. Following adoptive transfer, donor T cells persisting in the host were identified and counted using donor and host mice congenic for the T cell marker Thy-1. The results show that antigen-driven long term-cultured T cells proliferated rapidly in vivo, distributed widely in host lymphoid organs, and were effective in tumor therapy. Moreover, the already rapid in vivo growth rate of donor T cells could be augmented by administration of exogenous IL-2. When cured mice were examined 120 d after therapy, donor L3T4+ T cells and donor Lyt-2+ T cells could be found in large numbers in host ascites, spleen, and mesenteric and axillary lymph nodes. The persisting donor T cells proliferated in vitro, and became specifically cytotoxic in response to FBL-3, demonstrating that antigen-driven long term-cultured T cells can persist long term in vivo and provide immunologic memory.","['Cheever, M A', 'Thompson, D B', 'Klarnet, J P', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Cheever MA', 'Thompson DB', 'Klarnet JP', 'Greenberg PD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Tissue Distribution']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.163.5.1100 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1986 May 1;163(5):1100-12. doi: 10.1084/jem.163.5.1100.,PMC2188098,"['CA 00721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have, however, recently described heterogeneity of tumor Id in some cases. We therefore sought a way to isolate, reliably and efficiently, different species of idiotype from a potentially heterogeneous population. In this report we demonstrate our success using a series of mouse X human heterohybridomas as fusion partners with human B cell tumors. Three lines (K6H6/B5, K6H9/G12, SBC/H20) demonstrated excellent fusion efficiency with 75%-85% of wells plated containing hybrids. Two cell lines, K6H9/G12 and SBC/H20 had a tendency to secrete a single Ig chain (heavy or light chain), whereas the K6H6/B5 cell line secreted whole immunoglobulin (Ig) in greater than 80% of the hybrids. This line secreted significant amounts of Ig (2.73 micrograms/ml/10(6) cells) and was relatively stable in culture. Since this line has such a high fusion efficiency the products of normal B cells admixed with tumor may be recovered, allowing the opportunity of isolating host anti-tumor antibodies. In order to prove that hybrids were derived from the tumor, Southern blot analysis of rearranged DNA was performed in selected cases. Fusions with this line provide the potential for recovering many different species of idiotype in a mixed population. This will facilitate the production of mouse monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies against many variants and against different idiotopes.","['Carroll, W L', 'Thielemans, K', 'Dilley, J', 'Levy, R']","['Carroll WL', 'Thielemans K', 'Dilley J', 'Levy R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/cytology/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(86)90032-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(86)90032-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1986 May 1;89(1):61-72. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(86)90032-3.,,"['CA 07457-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulated expression of phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase requires differentiation.,5824-31,"Human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cells can be induced to differentiate into mature granulocytes by exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide. The addition of N-formylMet-Leu-Phe or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 to these differentiated cells generated 15-30 pmol of platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkylacetyl-GPC)/10(6) cells as quantified by platelet aggregation assays. Under identical conditions, uninduced cells produced little alkylacetyl-GPC. Upon the addition of ionophore A23187, differentiated cells, and not uninduced ones, released [14C]arachidonate from prelabeled phospholipids including ether-linked phosphatidylcholines, formed both 3H-labeled 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkyllyso-GPC) and [3H]alkylacetyl-GPC from endogenous 3H-labeled 1-O-alkyl-2-(long chain) acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkylacyl-GPC), and incorporated exogenously added [3H]acetate or [3H]alkyllyso-GPC into alkylacetyl-GPC. These results are suggestive that both phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase activities are involved in alkylacetyl-GPC biosynthesis by HL60 cells and that these activities appear during differentiation. However, when measured in cell extracts, the activities of phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase of uninduced cells were virtually indistinguishable from those of differentiated cells. Uninduced cells exhibited enhanced incorporation of [3H]alkyllyso-GPC or [3H]alkylacetyl-GPC into alkylacyl-GPC and of [14C]arachidonate and [14C]oleate into various phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine. However, such enhanced expression of acylation reactions could not account for the lack of accumulation of arachidonate or of alkylacetyl-GPC by uninduced cells. Furthermore, analyses of phospholipid classes by phosphorus determination showed no significant alterations in phospholipid composition of HL60 cells during differentiation. Together these data are suggestive that mechanisms regulating the activation of phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase activities are defective in uninduced cells and that an increased concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+ alone is not a sufficient requirement for these mechanisms.","['Billah, M M', 'Eckel, S', 'Myers, R F', 'Siegel, M I']","['Billah MM', 'Eckel S', 'Myers RF', 'Siegel MI']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*metabolism']",1986/05/05 00:00,1986/05/05 00:01,['1986/05/05 00:00'],"['1986/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)38457-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 May 5;261(13):5824-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that in EBL cells, serine is an essential amino acid and that exogenous repletion of intracellular concentrations induces a positive pleiotypic response. We have previously shown that after incubation with serine for 15 min. EBL cells have greater numbers of plasmalemma insulin receptors. Regulation of cell surface receptors may therefore comprise another limb of the pleiotypic response.","['Galbraith, R A', 'Buse, M G']","['Galbraith RA', 'Buse MG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Horm Metab Res,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,0177722,"['0 (Amino Acids, Essential)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",IM,"['Amino Acids, Essential/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Insulin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-1012263 [doi]'],ppublish,Horm Metab Res. 1986 Mar;18(3):173-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1012263.,,"['1 R23 AM 29713/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-02001/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study of the mechanism involved, the activities of ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase (SAT), the rate-limiting enzymes of polyamine metabolism, as well as the cellular levels of polyamine were measured. ODC activity reached a peak 24 h after the addition of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 and then decreased, while SAT activity gradually increased as differentiation commenced. An increase in putrescine and decreases in spermidine and spermine were also observed. Addition of alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ODC, with or without methylglyoxalbis(guanylhydrazone), an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, caused no effect on 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced cell differentiation, although the cellular levels of putrescine and spermidine decreased markedly. Addition of alpha-difluoromethylornithine markedly suppressed cell proliferation; this effect was reversed by the addition of exogenous putrescine. Addition of exogenous spermidine or spermine to overcome activation of SAT also had no effect on 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced cell differentiation. These results suggest both that polyamine metabolism is not important in 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, but that it is intimately involved in the proliferation of these cells.","['Inaba, M', 'Otani, S', 'Matsui-Yuasa, I', 'Yukioka, K', 'Nishizawa, Y', 'Ishimura, E', 'Morisada, S', 'Yukioka, M', 'Morisawa, S', 'Morii, H']","['Inaba M', 'Otani S', 'Matsui-Yuasa I', 'Yukioka K', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Ishimura E', 'Morisada S', 'Yukioka M', 'Morisawa S', 'Morii H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.57 (diamine N-acetyltransferase)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Eflornithine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ornithine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spermine/metabolism/pharmacology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo-118-5-1849 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1986 May;118(5):1849-55. doi: 10.1210/endo-118-5-1849.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This variability might reflect differences in intrinsic functional characteristics of malignant B lymphocytes that determine susceptibility to anti-immunoglobulin-mediated regulation of growth. To characterize B-lymphocyte malignancies, tissue samples from 24 patients were studied during short-term culture in vitro. Malignant B lymphocytes were stimulated to proliferate by the T-independent mitogens lipopolysaccharide, cytochalasin B, and Staphylococcus aureus that bears protein A. The effects of monoclonal mouse anti-human IgM on mitogen-induced malignant lymphocyte proliferation were then assessed. Mitogen-induced responses of malignant lymphocytes from three patients were abrogated by 2 micrograms/ml monoclonal anti-human IgM. Proliferation was also abrogated by polyclonal goat anti-IgM antiserum but proliferative responses were not affected by control monoclonal antibody. Further study showed that anti-immunoglobulin-mediated inhibition of proliferation was not dependent on Fc-determined interactions, nor was it dependent on the presence of T lymphocytes.

Presence of an N-like amino acid transport system.,488-95,"The transport of L-threonine and L-glutamine into murine P388 leukemia cells has been characterized. Threonine appears to be a specific substrate for a Na+-dependent amino acid transport system similar to system ASC of the HTC hepatoma cell. Threonine transport is uninhibited by 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid and alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, shows a pattern of transport similar to that seen in HTC hepatoma cells over the pH range of 5.5-7.5, and is inhibited by L-serine and L-cysteine. Approximately two-thirds of glutamine transport into P388 cells also appears to enter P388 cells via this ASC-analogous system. However, based upon (a) inhibition studies with threonine (where the K1 of threonine inhibition of glutamine transport was 7-fold the Km of threonine transport), (b) inhibition analysis of glutamine transport with various amino acids and amino acid analogues, and (c) different patterns of transport between threonine and glutamine over the pH range of 5.5-7.5, approximately one-third of glutamine transport can be attributed to a second Na+-dependent amino acid transport system. This system appears to be similar to the system N of rat hepatocytes. Glutamine and threonine do not appear to enter P388 cells via systems A or L to any significant degree. P388 cells do not appear to exhibit 'adaptive regulation' of amino acid transport.

The study presented here was mainly concerned with the new cell surface antigens designated FT (FT-1, FT-2), which are expressed on fetal thymocytes of all mouse strains examined, but not on thymocytes or any other lymphoid cells of adult mice. One of the interesting features of FT antigens is the timing of their expression in connection with the ontogeny of thymic lymphocytes. A majority of fetal thymocytes at the 13th day of gestation express FT antigens, whereas no positive cells are found in fetal liver. Therefore, FT antigens seem to appear as soon as the stem cells have reached the thymus. The proportion of FT+ cells then declines sharply with increase in the time of gestation, while Thy-1+ cells increase in inverse proportion. All of these results seem to support the idea that the thymocytes expressing FT antigens are replaced with Thy-1+ thymocytes, although the possibility of the transition from FT+ to Thy-1+ cells cannot be excluded. It was also demonstrated that fetal thymocytes are heterogeneous with respect to the expression of FT-1 and FT-2 antigens. Especially, thymic lymphocytes at the earlier stages of ontogeny can be divided into at least three subpopulations, FT-1+2+, FT-1+2- and FT-1-2-. With the emergence of Lyt antigens, these subpopulations seem to differentiate and acquire far more complicated features. Such cellular heterogeneity probably reflects the complexed events like selection, deletion or amplification occurring in the embryonic thymus. Another interesting aspect of FT antigens is their reappearance on the surface of thymic leukemia cells. Biochemical studies have indicated that the molecular weight of FT-1 antigen on leukemia cells is about 100,000 by means of biosynthetic labeling with either [3H]-galactose or [35S]-methionine. FT-1 antigen on fetal thymocytes also appeared as a major band with m.w. 100,000. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that FT-1 antigenic determinants appear to reside on a family of glycoproteins with extensive charge heterogeneity. All of these results suggest that FT antigens, especially FT-1 antigen, will be useful markers for understanding the mechanism underlying the activation of normally silent genetic information in leukemia cells. In summary, further biochemical and genetic analysis of FT antigens will contribute to an understanding of the ontogenic development of T cells as well as the leukemogenesis of T cell leukemias.","['Kasai, M', 'Tokunaga, T']","['Kasai M', 'Tokunaga T']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Residents of Woburn were concerned over what they perceived to be a large number of childhood leukemia cases; at the same time there was extensive publicity about uncontrolled hazardous waste sites in Woburn, which resulted in its being placed on the Superfund list. Many believed that the elevated rate of childhood leukemia was related to these sites or to two city water wells that had been closed in 1979 when they were found to be contaminated by organic chemicals. An occurrence was defined as childhood leukemia when it was diagnosed in a Woburn resident less than 20 years old between 1969 and 1979 and confirmed by review of hospital and pathology records. This investigation confirmed an increase in incidence which was distributed uniformly over the 11-year period. Six of the persons with leukemia were located close to each other in one census tract, 7.5 times the expected number. Parents of the children and of two matched control groups were interviewed about medical history, mother's pregnancy history, school history, and environmental exposures. There were no significant differences between the leukemia victims and persons in the control groups. No leukemia sufferer had contact with a hazardous waste site.

Successful cell labeling requires a chelator. The traditional agent oxine, has proved to be toxic to the lymphoid lineage. Cellular uptake of 111In mediated by the chelator oxine was compared with that of a new chelator, tropolone. Oxine provided better labeling efficiency (48%) than tropolone (35%) for the labeling of normal lymphocytes. By contrast, lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had a nearly twofold greater labeling efficiency when tropolone was substituted for oxine. Further studies demonstrated that tropolone induced functional injury to lymphocytes when mitogenic response to concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, and phytohemagglutinin was assessed. Similar toxicity was found when tropolone was compared with oxine. In addition, tropolone produced damaging structural changes seen by both scanning and transmission electron microscopic examination. These changes were both variable and not predictable. Shortening of the incubation time of the chelator with the cell provided the least amount of cellular injury.

We have used a culture assay to promote the growth of one of its cellular components and characterize its properties. Freshly obtained bone marrow cells and cells derived from the adherent layer of LTBMC were grown in methylcellulose-clotted plasma in the presence of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-LCM), hydrocortisone (HC), and citrated normal human plasma. Both sources contained cells (CFU-RF) that gave rise to colonies of cells with a reticulofibroblastoid appearance. In the presence of HC, most colonies contained lipid-laden cells. Colonies could be further propagated as adherent layers when transferred into liquid cultures. These cells produced laminin, fibronectin, and collagen types I, III, IV, and V. They were negative for Von Willebrand factor VIII. The ability to synthesize laminin and collagen type IV distinguished these cells from a population of previously described bone marrow fibroblasts (CFU-F). The relationship of CFU-RF to hemopoietic precursors was investigated using patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and bone marrow transplant recipients. Cells within CFU-RF-derived colonies were uniformly negative for the Philadelphia chromosome, thus making it unlikely that they belonged to the malignant hemopoietic clone. CFU-RF-derived colonies in bone marrow transplant recipients were found to be exclusively of host origin. Both observations support the view that CFU-RF is not part of the repertoire of hemopoietic stem cells.","['Lim, B', 'Izaguirre, C A', 'Aye, M T', 'Huebsch, L', 'Drouin, J', 'Richardson, C', 'Minden, M D', 'Messner, H A']","['Lim B', 'Izaguirre CA', 'Aye MT', 'Huebsch L', 'Drouin J', 'Richardson C', 'Minden MD', 'Messner HA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Antigens/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Collagen/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Factor VIII/analysis/immunology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/analysis/*cytology/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Laminin/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Stem Cells/analysis/*cytology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'von Willebrand Factor']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041270107 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1986 Apr;127(1):45-54. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041270107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the combinations at subcytotoxic concentrations induced significant growth inhibition of the resistant cells, but not of the sensitive cells. Of the alkaloids examined, catharine, vindoline, catharanthine, vincarodine, and lochnerine were able to bring about complete inhibition of cell growth. Further in vitro study using vindoline revealed that at 10 micrograms/ml it was able to completely reverse not only resistance to vincristine but also cross-resistance to vinblastine, daunorubicin, and adriamycin. In addition, we found that vinca alkaloids active in reversing resistance possess potent activities to enhance the net uptake of not only vincristine but also daunorubicin by the resistant cells, and this effect was proved to result from their inhibitory action on the active efflux process. These results provide further support for our hypothesis that both anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids can inhibit their own efflux process by interacting with the cell membrane, and this similarity provides a basis for their reciprocal cross-resistance, irrespective of their different chemical structures.","['Inaba, M', 'Nagashima, K']","['Inaba M', 'Nagashima K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Biological Transport', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/metabolism']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1986 Feb;77(2):197-204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the peripheral blood an increased proportion of T lymphocytes (and correspondingly a decreased proportion of B cells) could be demonstrated. However, when expressed in terms of absolute numbers, the T cell component was depressed because of severely decreased numbers of T4+ helper cells. In contrast, the absolute numbers of T8+ suppressor cells were either normal or increased in the majority of the patients. This resulted in markedly decreased ratios of T4+/T8+ cells, which were closely correlated to the number of transfusions given to the patients because of their refractory anemia. Finally, nearly all of the patients exhibited decreased numbers of cells reactive with the N901 natural killer (NK) antibody, thus explaining our earlier finding of decreased NK activity in these patients. In the bone marrow increased proportions of myeloid cells reactive with monoclonal antibodies present on immature myeloid cells (My7 and My9) were found, suggesting the presence of malignant clones. Indeed, when the numbers of My7+ cells and the morphologic evaluations of bone marrow smears at the time of diagnosis were compared to the progression of the disease, a group of patients with high numbers of My7+ cells and normal morphology could be identified that had a high probability of progression to refractory anemia with an excess of blasts or to overt acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, the use of antibodies defining leukocyte differentiation antigens might be of significant value in the diagnosis and prognostication of the myelodysplastic syndromes. These findings are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of this potentially premalignant condition with special emphasis on possible defects in the immunologic defense mechanisms against early neoplasias.","['Hokland, P', 'Kerndrup, G', 'Griffin, J D', 'Ellegaard, J']","['Hokland P', 'Kerndrup G', 'Griffin JD', 'Ellegaard J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Preleukemia/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/pathology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81255-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Apr;67(4):898-902.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was treated with vitamins, androgens, and sequential trials of immunosuppressive therapy, all without response. Two years after diagnosis, repeated marrow cytogenetic studies showed a 5q- abnormality in 70 percent and later in 100 percent of marrow metaphases. Because of transfusion-induced hemosiderosis and the availability of a cytogenetically normal monozygotic twin, bone marrow transplantation was undertaken. In light of the clonal (and suspected preleukemic) nature of the 5q- syndrome, the patient's marrow was ablated with a busulfan plus cyclophosphamide regimen used for patients with nonlymphocytic leukemia.

However, in the presence of lectins such as Con A, CTLs destroy virtually any cell, regardless of its antigens. The oligosaccharides of the T-cell antigen-specific receptor, a dimeric surface glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked alpha and beta subunits, are of interest because of their potential involvement in this lectin-dependent cytotoxic activity. We report here that three or four asparagine-linked oligosaccharides could be enzymatically removed from each of the receptor subunits expressed by a cloned line of murine CTLs (clone 2C), consistent with the presence of glycosylation sites deduced from cDNA sequences of the alpha and beta genes expressed in this clone. All the N-linked glycans on the alpha subunit were of the complex type (i.e., resistant to endoglycosidase H), but the beta subunit carried two or three endoglycosidase H-sensitive (high-mannose) oligosaccharides. High-mannose glycans can bind tightly to Con A and, indeed, this lectin was found to bind specifically to solubilized 2C T-cell receptor. The Con A-dependent cytotoxic activity of clone 2C, but not of other CTL clones, was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (1B2) that is specific for the T-cell receptor of clone 2C. Antibody 1B2 also inhibited clone 2C cytotoxicity mediated by phytohemagglutinin, lentil-lectin, and wheat-germ agglutinin. These results suggest that, although lectin-dependent lysis of target cells by CTLs is antigen nonspecific, the cytolytic activity can be triggered by binding of the lectin to the T-cell antigen-specific receptor.","['Hubbard, S C', 'Kranz, D M', 'Longmore, G D', 'Sitkovsky, M V', 'Eisen, H N']","['Hubbard SC', 'Kranz DM', 'Longmore GD', 'Sitkovsky MV', 'Eisen HN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.96 (Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Concanavalin A/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligosaccharides/*analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.6.1852 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Mar;83(6):1852-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.6.1852.,PMC323182,"['CA26712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM31318/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although we and others have isolated complementary DNA clones encoding a protein that binds IL-2, formal proof that this protein is the IL-2 receptor requires demonstration of IL-2-dependent growth stimulation of cells expressing the protein. In addition, a functional assay system other than binding of IL-2 is required to investigate the molecular mechanism of signal transmission through the IL-2 receptor using artificially mutated cDNA. The IL-2 receptor expressed in non-lymphoid cells by cDNA transfection did not mediate a growth signal, implying that lymphoid cells expressing the functional receptor might have specific accessory molecule(s) for signal transmission by the receptor. Therefore, we established a line of IL-2-dependent mouse cells (CT/hR) expressing both murine (endogenous) and human IL-2 receptors. Here, by blocking the endogenous mouse IL-2 receptors with monoclonal antibodies, we show that the human IL-2 receptor of CT/hR cells is functionally active. Although CT/hR expressed the human IL-2 receptor constitutively, growth of these cells was strictly dependent on IL-2, indicating that uncontrolled over-expression of the IL-2 receptor was not by itself sufficient for T-cell transformation.","['Kondo, S', 'Shimizu, A', 'Maeda, M', 'Tagaya, Y', 'Yodoi, J', 'Honjo, T']","['Kondo S', 'Shimizu A', 'Maeda M', 'Tagaya Y', 'Yodoi J', 'Honjo T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'DNA/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*physiology', 'Transfection']",1986/03/06 00:00,1986/03/06 00:01,['1986/03/06 00:00'],"['1986/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/320075a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1986 Mar 6-12;320(6057):75-7. doi: 10.1038/320075a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LSTRA Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV)-induced thymoma cell line contains approximately 20-fold more phosphotyrosine in protein than do typical haematopoietic cell lines; this seems to result from the expression of an abnormally high level of a cellular tyrosine protein kinase termed p56tck (refs 3, 4). This kinase is normally expressed at low levels in most, but not all, murine T cells. The elevated levels of p56tck could contribute to the malignant properties of LSTRA cells. Therefore, we have isolated cloned complementary DNAs encoding the whole of p56tck. Sequence analysis shows it to be a novel cellular tyrosine protein kinase which is distinct from all others described to date. p56tck is encoded in LSTRA cells by a hybrid messenger RNA; approximately 200 nucleotides at the 5' end of the mRNA are identical to the 5' end of the genome of M-MuLV. The three- to ninefold transcriptional activation of the gene therefore results from retroviral promoter insertion.","['Voronova, A F', 'Sefton, B M']","['Voronova AF', 'Sefton BM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Myristates)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Myristates/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/02/20 00:00,1986/02/20 00:01,['1986/02/20 00:00'],"['1986/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/319682a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1986 Feb 20-26;319(6055):682-5. doi: 10.1038/319682a0.,,"['CA-09345/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17289/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['GENBANK/X03533'],,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, samples from patients with trisomy 12 also have many normal metaphases. To identify immunologically the cells in which both the trisomy 12 and the normal karyotypes occur, we studied two patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia--one whose neoplastic cells demonstrated lambda light-chain clonality and one whose cells had kappa light-chain clonality. We used a recently developed cytogenetic method that allows simultaneous analysis of cell morphology, immunologic phenotype, and karyotype in the same mitotic cell. In cultures of blood cells stimulated with pokeweed mitogen and tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, all the mitotic cells with either the lambda or the kappa immunoglobulin had trisomy 12, whereas all the cells that lacked these light chains or that had T-cell markers (OKT8 or OKT4) had normal karyotypes.

Toxicity was assessed by the survival of clonogenic cells in a colony assay. The kill of clonogenic Thy-leukemic cells was 99.99% with both nucleoside enzyme inhibitor combinations following 4-h incubations when 50 microM concentration of nucleoside were used. With these nucleoside concentrations some reduction in toxicity was apparent when drug treated cells were cultured in the presence of deoxycytidine (50 microM), however, this reduction in toxicity was not apparent when higher nucleoside concentrations were used (100 microM). Survival of bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells (CFU.GM) was only slightly reduced by these nucleoside concentrations following 4 hour incubations. The presence of a twenty-fold excess of normal bone marrow cells reduced the cytotoxic effect but clonogenic cell incubation still ranged from 99.98 to 99.99% for deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine respectively.

We have examined the inter-relationship of these two pathways by investigating the effects of modulating Ca2+ activity on the binding of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) to protein kinase C in intact phagocytes. Differentiated HL-60 cells were equilibrated with [3H]PDBU prior to stimulation with various agents known to alter Ca2+ homeostasis in cells. Agents that elevated cytosolic Ca2+, such as f-Met-Leu-Phe and A23187, up-regulated radioligand binding by increasing the affinity of the PDBU/protein kinase C interaction. These effects were time- and agonist concentration-dependent and temperature-sensitive. The kinetics of the up-regulation of binding by f-Met-Leu-Phe coincided with the kinetics of Ca2+ mobilization (by quin2 fluorescence measurements). The putative intracellular Ca2+ antagonist 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate alone down-regulated [3H]PDBU binding and inhibited the up-regulation of ligand binding by f-Met-Leu-Phe and A23187.

Host survival and cell-cycle kinetic analysis.,465-70,"alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, was used alone and in combination with multiple doses of methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) to treat mice with systemic L1210 leukemia. Used as a single agent (administered p.o. as a 3% solution in tap water), DFMO exerted a weak therapeutic effect against this tumor. The therapeutic effect of MGBG (administered i.p. at 50 mg/kg/day) was only slightly better. However, 1-3 days of pretreatment with DFMO strongly potentiated the effect of MGBG treatment. Thus, mice treated with the combination exhibited an increase in life span of up to 138%. The prolonged survival of leukemic mice treated with a combination of DFMO and MGBG was associated with inhibition of polyamine synthesis and a marked decrease in the spermidine and spermine content of the tumor cells as compared to untreated controls. As a consequence, there was a continuous decrease in the S- and G2-phase fractions with a concomitant increase in G1.

In the first 3 weeks following bone marrow transplantation, the predominant regenerating mononuclear cell population in peripheral blood exhibited a phenotype characteristic of natural killer (NK) cells. After 4 weeks, T lymphocytes became predominant, but NK cells persisted. Cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained 12 weeks posttransplant were able to display significant cytotoxicity against leukemic blasts that had been cryopreserved at the time of relapse 5 months prior to bone marrow transplantation. To further characterize those cells with antileukemia activity, we used in vitro cloning techniques to identify four monoclonal populations, termed TC12, -48, -50, and -59, with strong antitumor activity. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated that each clone was of donor origin. Phenotypic characterization showed that the four clones expressed NKH1A but did not express T3, T4, or T8 antigens. Three of the four clones expressed T11/E rosette antigen. Each clone exhibited strong cytotoxicity against genetically unrelated hematopoietic tumor cell lines such as K562, Molt-4, JM, and U937. In addition, we found that these patient clones were similar to cloned NK cells previously derived from normal individuals. Taken together, these results suggest that at least some clones with antileukemia activity following bone marrow transplantation are cells with NK-like function and phenotype.

We observed that CLL T cells have a direct correlation between levels of T3 membrane antigen and proliferative response to mitogen. The appearance of activation antigens (transferrin, HLA-DR, and interleukin 2 [IL 2] receptor) was normal in CLL T cells post-mitogen exposure. Despite the normal presentation of IL 2 receptor on CLL T cell membrane, there was decreased production of IL 2 by CLL patients (v controls) (39.6 +/- 10.2 cells per milliliter v 64.6 +/- 11.0 cells per milliliter). Finally, we were able partially, but not fully, to reconstitute CLL T proliferative response to mitogen by adding purified exogenous IL 2.

It is made worse by attempts at precise or coordinated movement (intention myoclonus) and may also be provoked by certain sensory stimuli. The effective stimuli for action myoclonus is probably feedback from muscle afferents, although it may be initiated by corollary discharge from motor cortex to reticular formation before or at the onset of voluntary movement. The condition is usually associated with diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although action myoclonus may be limited to one limb in some cases of focal cerebral damage. It is caused by hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus), or both. No consistent pathological change has been reported in autopsied cases of action myoclonus. The underlying disorder appears to be a loss of inhibitory mechanisms involving serotonin and possibly GABA as transmitter agents. The term PME is used for the association of myoclonus with degenerative changes in the nervous system which are commonly diffuse but may predominate in certain systems. There may or may not be associated tonic-clonic seizures, other manifestations of epilepsy, or dementia. Those cases of PME associated with Lafora inclusion bodies and cerebral storage diseases can be distinguished from the system degenerations. Systems which may be involved in the latter group include cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar pathways, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers. Confronted with this diversity of pathological change, it seems unnecessary to make any clinical distinction between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (Baltic myoclonus) because cerebellar signs are found in patients described under both headings. Additional systems may be involved in individuals or families who are otherwise typical. All three names could well be joined in an eponymous title (Unverricht-Lundborg-Hunt disease) or the condition simply known as the systems degeneration type of PME, as Halliday (43) suggested. The cause of the condition (or spectrum of conditions) is at present unknown. Action myoclonus usually responds to sodium valproate or clonazepam, and some individuals, particularly those with posthypoxic myoclonus, improve with the administration of serotonin precursors.","['Lance, J W']",['Lance JW'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Neurol,Advances in neurology,0367524,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/complications', 'Cerebellar Ataxia/*physiopathology', 'Cerebellum/pathology', 'Craniocerebral Trauma/complications', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsies, Myoclonic/complications/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/complications', 'Infections/complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Movement', 'Myoclonic Cerebellar Dyssynergia/complications/*physiopathology', 'Myoclonus/complications/genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Posture', 'Uremia/complications']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Adv Neurol. 1986;43:33-55.,,,114,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estimates of net cost savings during the first year ranged from $177,570 to $272,253 (1982 dollars; cost-to-benefit ratios were 1:1.39 to 1:2.14.) In a matched cohort study of marrow transplant patients, CDPP platelet transfusions were as effective as those from family donors while total platelet and red cell use was unchanged. In patients with acute leukemia treated with chemotherapy, significant reduction in both platelet and red cell use was seen after institution of CDPP support. We conclude that the CDPP is a cost-effective approach to platelet support.","['McFarland, J G', 'Larson, E B', 'Hillman, R S', 'Slichter, S J']","['McFarland JG', 'Larson EB', 'Hillman RS', 'Slichter SJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Component Removal/*economics', 'Blood Donors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Community Health Services/*economics/statistics & numerical data', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Health Promotion/economics', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/economics/therapy', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Plateletpheresis/*economics/statistics & numerical data']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1986.26186124042.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1986 Jan-Feb;26(1):91-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1986.26186124042.x.,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-17265/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responders were maintained on repeated IV treatment cycles or daily intramuscular (IM) injections. Patients were entered at fixed dose levels of 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/m2/d. The maximum safely tolerated dose was 0.5 mg/m2. The most common side effects were constitutional symptoms, including fever, chills, fatigue, and myalgias. Reversible and transient increases in hepatic transaminase and decrease in granulocyte counts were seen. Treatment was associated with a dose-dependent increase in serum levels of beta 2 microglobulin. Partial responses (PRs) were observed in one patient with Hodgkin's disease and one patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fairly constant levels of serum IFN were found at four and six hours during infusion, followed by a rapid decline within one to two hours.

Biochemical studies of this hormone-directed terminal differentiation have been hindered by the lack of a homogeneous population of erythroid cells at the developmental stages of CFU-e and proerythroblasts that will synchronously differentiate in response to EP. Such a population of cells can be prepared from the spleens of mice with the acute erythroblastosis resulting from infection with anemia-inducing Friend virus (FVA). Using these FVA-infected erythroid cells, which were induced to differentiate with EP, four proteins other than hemoglobin that have key functions in mature erythrocytes were monitored during the 48-hour period of terminal differentiation. Synthesis of spectrin and membrane band 3 proteins were determined by immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; accumulation of the cytoskeletal protein band 4.1 was monitored by immunoblotting; carbonic anhydrase activity was measured electrometrically. Band 3 synthesis and band 4.1 accumulation could be detected only after exposure of the cells to EP. Spectrin synthesis was ongoing prior to culture with EP, but it did increase after exposure to the hormone. Carbonic anhydrase-specific activity changed very little throughout the terminal differentiation process. These results reveal at least three patterns of production of principal erythrocyte proteins during EP-mediated terminal differentiation of FVA-infected erythroid cells. Depending on the specific protein examined, de novo synthesis can be induced by EP, an ongoing production can be enhanced by EP, or the production of a protein can be completed at a developmental stage prior to EP-mediated differentiation in these cells.","['Koury, M J', 'Bondurant, M C', 'Mueller, T J']","['Koury MJ', 'Bondurant MC', 'Mueller TJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane band 4.1 protein)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 1)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/biosynthesis', 'Blood Protein Electrophoresis', 'Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Neuropeptides', 'Spectrin/biosynthesis', 'Spleen/cytology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041260216 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1986 Feb;126(2):259-65. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041260216.,,"['AM-31513/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-30489/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results therefore suggest that these LDGFs are T-cell specific.","['Uittenbogaart, C H', 'Nishanian, P G', 'Anisman, D J', 'Erikson, T K', 'Fahey, J L']","['Uittenbogaart CH', 'Nishanian PG', 'Anisman DJ', 'Erikson TK', 'Fahey JL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', '*Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factors']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Mar;46(3):1219-23.,,['CA-12800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two lines are murine lymphocytic leukemia cells which differ in their ability to metabolize 5'-methylthioadenosine, the by-product of polyamine biosynthesis: L5178Y cells contain a specific 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; L1210 cells do not. In L1210 cells, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (lC50S) of the various analogues were 3.0 mM for alpha-difluoromethylornithine, 0.2 mM for alpha-(fluoromethyl)dehydroornithine, 0.1 mM for alpha-(fluoromethyl)dehydroornithine methyl ester, and 0.01 mM for RR-MAP. L5178Y cells were somewhat more sensitive to the inhibitors with lC50 values of 0.5 mM for alpha-difluoromethylornithine, 0.06 mM for alpha-(fluoromethyl)dehydroornithine, 0.03 mM for alpha-(fluoromethyl)dehydroornithine methyl ester, and 0.002 mM for RR-MAP. In all cases, growth inhibition was fully prevented by exogenous putrescine. The effects of the inhibitors on parameters related to polyamine metabolism were compared at drug concentrations approximating the average of lC50 values for the two cell lines. Under these treatment conditions, polyamine pools were similarly affected by the various inhibitors. Typically, putrescine and spermidine were depleted, but effects on spermine pools differed according to the cell line, increasing slightly in L1210 cells and decreasing by about 50% in L5178Y cells. Spermine pools in L1210 cells could be reduced by RR-MAP at concentrations higher than the lC50 (i.e., 0.1 mM). Clonogenicity in soft agar was decreased about 50% by putrescine and spermidine depletion and was not further affected by spermine depletion. The inhibitors elevated S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity in both cell lines with a 2-fold greater increase in L5178Y cells than in L1210 cells. Finally, the inhibitors decreased S-adenosylmethionine pools in L1210 cells by about 50% but had little effect on these pools in L5178Y cells with the exception of RR-MAP, which decreased S-adenosylmethionine pools by about 40%. Whether the different polyamine responses of the two cell lines are related to their ability to metabolize 5'-methylthioadenosine is uncertain. It is apparent, however, that the presence or absence of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase does not substantially modulate the antiproliferative activity of ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Pera, P J', 'Kramer, D L', 'Sufrin, J R', 'Porter, C W']","['Pera PJ', 'Kramer DL', 'Sufrin JR', 'Porter CW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '81645-70-7 (6-heptyne-2,5-diamine)', '82006-84-6 (alpha-(fluoromethyl)dehydroornithine)', '96681-91-3 (2-(fluoromethyl)dehydroornithine methyl ester)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Alkynes', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diamines/*pharmacology', 'Eflornithine', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/biosynthesis', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/metabolism']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Mar;46(3):1148-54.,,"['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the frequency and distribution of tumor types in children with NF, the authors reviewed the experience at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh between 1953 and 1984. During that time, 121 children younger than 18 years with documented NF were seen. Three patients (2.5%) developed locally extensive, unresectable sarcomas, two of which were clearly neural in origin. Two other children died from complications of highly cellular but not histologically malignant neurofibromas. Seventeen patients (14%) had brain tumors, of which 3 (2.5%) were malignant astrocytomas and 9 were optic gliomas. Two children had acute myelogenous leukemia. Although it has been said that patients with NF are particularly susceptible to the oncogenic effects of radiation, 12 children were treated with a median of 5000 rad to their tumor bed. Follow-up after radiation in that small cohort of patients ranged from 6 months to 12 years (mean, 6 years). Eleven of 12 patients experienced adequate local control. During the follow-up period, none developed a second tumor outside or within the radiation port that could be related to radiation. The authors conclude that clinically significant tumors in children with NF, not all of which are histologically malignant, are not rare. Although more prospective information is needed on response to and sequelae from therapy, the data in this report suggest no contraindication to aggressive therapy.","['Blatt, J', 'Jaffe, R', 'Deutsch, M', 'Adkins, J C']","['Blatt J', 'Jaffe R', 'Deutsch M', 'Adkins JC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Astrocytoma/epidemiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Brain Stem/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Nerve Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glioma/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neurofibroma/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Optic Nerve Diseases/epidemiology', 'Pennsylvania', 'Registries']",1986/03/15 00:00,1986/03/15 00:01,['1986/03/15 00:00'],"['1986/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19860315)57:6<1225::aid-cncr2820570627>3.0.co;2-p [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Mar 15;57(6):1225-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860315)57:6<1225::aid-cncr2820570627>3.0.co;2-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For all cancers combined, the incidence rate shown in Table 4 for males 65 and older (2,468.2 per 100,000) is four times the age-adjusted rate for males 45 to 64 years of age (586.7). For elderly females, the incidence rate is twice that for females aged 45 to 64 (1,401.1 versus 609.7). Ratios of incidence rates for older versus younger males are about four to five for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, and urinary bladder, and for leukemia; about three for cancers of the lung and kidney, and for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas; and 10 for cancer of the prostate. For females, the corresponding ratios are similar to those for males, although a little lower for cancers of the colon, rectum, and urinary bladder, and for leukemia, and a little higher for cancers of the stomach and pancreas. The ratios for breast, uterine cervix, uterine corpus, ovary, and lung are less than two. The relative survival rates for patients 65 and older are for many cancer sites only a few percentage points lower than rates for those 45 to 64 years of age (Table 5), suggesting that patients in this age group fare only a little worse than younger patients in escaping the effects of cancer once it has been diagnosed. Exceptions are cancer of the urinary bladder and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas for both men and women and cancers of the uterine cervix, uterine corpus, ovary, and kidney for women. For these sites, the survival rates for older patients are considerably lower than for their younger counterparts. For female breast cancer patients, there was no difference in the five-year relative survival rate for those 65 and older compared with those 45 to 64.","['Baranovsky, A', 'Myers, M H']","['Baranovsky A', 'Myers MH']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,CA Cancer J Clin,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,0370647,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'California', 'Connecticut', 'Female', 'Georgia', 'Humans', 'Iowa', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Michigan', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'New Mexico', 'Sex Factors', 'Utah', 'Washington']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3322/canjclin.36.1.26 [doi]'],ppublish,CA Cancer J Clin. 1986 Jan-Feb;36(1):26-41. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.36.1.26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specificity of the 212Bi-labeled anti-Tac was demonstrated for the IL-2 receptor-positive adult T-cell leukemia line HUT-102B2 by protein synthesis inhibition and clonogenic assays. Activity levels of 0.5 microCi or the equivalent of 12 rad/ml of alpha radiation targeted by anti-Tac eliminated greater than 98% the proliferative capabilities of HUT-102B2 cells with more modest effects on IL-2 receptor-negative cell lines. Specific cytotoxicity was blocked by excess unlabeled anti-Tac but not by human IgG. In addition, an irrelevant control monoclonal antibody of the same isotype labeled with 212Bi was unable to target alpha radiation to cell lines. Therefore, 212Bi-labeled anti-Tac is a potentially effective and specific immunocytotoxic reagent for the elimination of IL-2 receptor-positive cells. These experiments thus provide the scientific basis for use of alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides in immunotherapy.","['Kozak, R W', 'Atcher, R W', 'Gansow, O A', 'Friedman, A M', 'Hines, J J', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Kozak RW', 'Atcher RW', 'Gansow OA', 'Friedman AM', 'Hines JJ', 'Waldmann TA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Bismuth/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Radioisotopes', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.83.2.474 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jan;83(2):474-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.2.474.,PMC322882,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Environmental causes of childhood cancer were difficult to discern because prior exposures were numerous, diverse, and usually ill defined. The questionnaire yielded more data than the medical record on gestational and family history and helped identify patients with exceptionally high cancer risk for additional investigation.

The IL 1-dependent T cell lymphoma LBRM33-1A5.47, which requires phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and IL 1 to produce IL 2, was compared with the IL 1-independent T cell lymphoma LBRM33-5A4 and T cell hybridomas DO-11.10/S4.4 and 3DO-54.8. The latter hybridomas do not require exogenous IL 1 to produce IL 2 in response to mitogens or ovalbumin (OVA)/I-Ad. Even though IL 1 is not required by these IL 1-independent T cell lines, we tested whether IL 1 could modulate their response but found no significant effect of exogenous IL 1. We then studied the activation of these T cell lines by the calcium ionophore A23187 and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). In the case of the IL 1-dependent line LBRM33-1A5.47, there was a strong response when both A23187 and PMA were used simultaneously. We subsequently found that A23187 can replace PHA, and PMA can replace IL 1 in the activation of this cell line to IL 2 production. These observations suggest that the signal(s) provided by PHA and IL 1 involve at least in part a calcium flux, and activation of protein kinase C. Parallel experiments with the use of the IL 1-independent T cell lines showed a strong response to both agents when used simultaneously. A modest response observed to A23187 alone was always enhanced by the addition of PMA. No response was observed to PMA alone. IL 1-rich P388D1 supernatant could replace the enhancing effect of PMA in the response of the IL 1-independent T cell lines. We suggest that the activating signals provided by A23187 and PMA are at least part of the sequence of events that lead to production of IL 2 in either IL 1-dependent or IL 1-independent T cell lines. In IL 1-independent T cell lines, however, both of the activating signals studied may be delivered through stimulation of the Antigen-MHC T cell receptor.","['Zlotnik, A', 'Daine, B']","['Zlotnik A', 'Daine B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phorbols)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia P388/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Feb 1;136(3):1033-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells isolated from the lymph nodes draining the infected footpads were assayed for their proliferative responses to leishmania antigens (promastigote and amastigote) or to concanavalin A (Con A). Although lymph node cells (LNC) from both mouse strains proliferated to mitogen and antigen early after infection, both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice developed diminished in vitro proliferative reactivity within 3 to 5 wk after infection. LNC from both mouse strains recovered lymphoproliferative reactivity to Con A (week 6), but only C57BL/6 mice regained reactivity to leishmania antigens. BALB/c cells remained unresponsive to leishmania antigens throughout the subsequent course of the infection. Supernatants derived from cultures of LNC that had been stimulated with Con A or leishmania antigens were assayed for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by analyzing three distinct activities associated with IFN-gamma. Culture supernatants derived from leishmania antigen stimulation of LNC from infected C57BL/6 mice, but not BALB/c mice, were able to induce surface Ia on murine P388D1 cells. Ia-inducing activity was detectable in supernatants from C57BL/6 cells as early as 3 wk, and peaked by 5 wk after infection. Although cells from infected BALB/c mice never produced detectable IFN-gamma in response to leishmania antigens, LNC from both mouse strains produced readily detectable IFN-gamma in response to Con A throughout the course of infection. Culture supernatants that induced Ia on P388D1 cells were also capable of activating resident peritoneal macrophages to display leishmanicidal activity and of inhibiting encephalomyocarditis virus replication in murine fibroblasts. Each of these activities could be removed by prior incubation of the supernatants with rabbit heterologous anti-murine IFN-gamma sera or monoclonal rat-anti-murine IFN-gamma. The correlation of healer status with the capacity to generate IFN-gamma in vitro in response to leishmania antigens was examined in BALB/c mice that had been exposed to sublethal irradiation (550 rad) before infection. These animals have been previously shown to effectively resist L. major infection.

This has been interpreted by McCulloch and colleagues as aberrant programming or lineage infidelity and contrasts with earlier suggestions that lineage fidelity of gene expression was usually maintained in leukemia. We argue that several examples of infidelity are suspect on technical grounds, whereas others are bona fide and require explanation, eg, partial rearrangements and expression of Ig heavy-chain and/or T cell receptor genes in inappropriate cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in leukemic myeloblasts. Individual examples of truly aberrant gene expression may well occur in leukemia but with insufficient regularity to be of general significance. We suggest that verifiable and consistent examples of apparent lineage infidelity do not reflect genetic misprogramming but rather the existence of a transient phase of limited promiscuity of gene expression occurring in normal biopotential or multipotential progenitors and able to be preserved as a relic in leukemic blast cell populations that are in maturation arrest. This alternative explanation has interesting implications for mechanisms of hematopoietic differentiation and leads to some testable predictions.","['Greaves, M F', 'Chan, L C', 'Furley, A J', 'Watt, S M', 'Molgaard, H V']","['Greaves MF', 'Chan LC', 'Furley AJ', 'Watt SM', 'Molgaard HV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79044-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jan;67(1):1-11.,,,136,,,,,,,,,,,,

UCHT1-DT killed human peripheral T cells and T leukemia cells (Jurkat) at 2 to 10 pM, a concentration 10- to 100-fold lower than UCHT1-ricin and 10 to 500 times lower than native DT.

UCHT1-DT shows greater selectivity between T cells and stem cells than UCHT1-ricin, and may better prevent graft-vs-host disease in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The kinetics of UCHT1-DT were extremely rapid. UCHT1-DT inhibited Jurkat cell protein synthesis faster than DT and had a different ratio of lag time to inactivation rate. UCHT1-DT killed 90% of Jurkat cells within 2 hr at concentrations nontoxic to human stem cells. In contrast, UCHT1-ricin required more than 18 hr to kill one log of Jurkat cells.

When fully FV-induced leukemic mice (14 days post virus inoculation; spleen weight, greater than 0.75 g) were given one injection of 5 X 10(6) in vitro cultured T-cells and no other treatment the mice experienced permanent regressions of their disease. From T-cell cultures depleted of specific cell populations with monoclonal antisera, helper Lyt-1+ cells were shown to be responsible for permanent regressions (cures), whereas cytotoxic Lyt-2+ cells caused temporary leukemia remissions. This model thus provides an experimental system of highly effective passive cellular immunotherapy against an autochthonous, fully developed leukemia, requiring no adjunctive treatment for activity.","['Johnson, C S', 'Thurlow, S M', 'Furmanski, P']","['Johnson CS', 'Thurlow SM', 'Furmanski P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jan;46(1):183-9.,,['CA 33939/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such studies will be important for the design of drug combinations and for the development of novel antifolate and fluoropyrimidine analogs. A greater understanding of MTX and ara-C transport and drug levels required to optimize transport may also aid in these endeavors. Pharmacokinetic parameters have been found to be predictors of relapse in children with acute leukemia, particularly with respect to MTX, 6-MP and ara-C. The intracellular terminal half-life of ara-C was correlated with remission duration in AML. Assay systems aimed at uncovering response predictors through biochemical analysis of patient tumor samples are being developed, including an interesting use of NMR spectroscopy to study the pharmacokinetics of fluorine-19-labeled 5-FU in vivo. Such an approach may yield valuable information on 5-FU anabolism in tumors in situ. A high frequency of resistance to MTX apparently may be generated within a single cell cycle by transient exposures to DNA synthesis inhibitors. The resistance may be based on either target enzyme amplification or altered membrane transport. These important studies provided bases for the rapid emergence of clinical resistance. Further, the multidrug-resistant phenotype appears to be a much broader based phenomenon as MTX resistance was found to be a frequent event in cells selected for multidrug resistance. A variety of novel approaches have been proposed to overcome antimetabolite resistance and to improve the selectivity of these agents, including the use of guanosine nucleotides, leucovorin and allopurines as biochemical modulators of 5-FU. Efficient techniques for the transfection of resistant DHFR into tissues using retroviruses have been reported. These studies serve as starting point for the ultimate development of more effective strategies for the treatment of human malignancies.","['Allegra, C J', 'Grem, J L', 'Yeh, G C', 'Chabner, B A']","['Allegra CJ', 'Grem JL', 'Yeh GC', 'Chabner BA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Chemother Biol Response Modif,Cancer chemotherapy and biological response modifiers,8812385,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Purines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Chemother Biol Response Modif. 1988;10:1-22.,,,90,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically distinctive patterns of cutaneous metastasis of epithelial origin include alopecia neoplastica, pulsatile nodules, Sister Mary Joseph's nodules, morpheaform, and cellulitis-like lesions. Biopsying these lesions reveals adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or anaplastic carcinoma. The type of histologic pattern seen can be a clue to the organ of origin giving rise to the cutaneous metastasis. Skin that is damaged allows for circulating malignant cells, often of epithelial or leukemic origin, to lodge and proliferate locally (inflammatory oncotaxis). The commonest form of leukemia to affect the skin of elderly males is chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, when leukemia involves the mucous membranes, acute myeloid leukemia (acute monocytic and acute myelomonocytic leukemia) is the most likely diagnosis. When papules, nodules, or plaques develop on the head, neck, or torso in a middle-aged male accompanied by lymphadenopathy, there must be a high index of suspicion that these lesions are metastatic lymphomatous deposits. Definitive histologic diagnosis on a skin biopsy specimen is difficult. In this situation, it is best to rely on histologic patterns seen in lymphoid tissue along with cellular marker studies. An elderly patient having bone pain, anemia, elevated blood calcium level, and renal failure along with purplish or skin-colored nodules and plaques on the trunk has a good chance of having multiple myeloma. Biopsying these lesions is most certain to reveal atypical plasma cells, and blood immunoelectrophoresis will demonstrate characteristic monoclonal gammopathy. There are two malignancies seen in children under 3 years of age that often times affect the skin in a characteristic fashion. Letterer-Siwe disease, which is distinguished from other histocytic disorders by its cell of origin, the Langerhans cell, clinically shows maculopapular and erosive lesions distributed in a seborrheic pattern. Neuroblastoma derived from cells of the neural crest demonstrates clinically widespread bluish papulonodules. Kaposi's sarcoma, a multifocal vascular malignancy, has a wide spectrum of clinical expression. Those patients who are immunocompromised secondary to concomitant disease or immunosuppressive therapy are more susceptible to a disseminated fulminant course accompanied by opportunistic infection. In conclusion, although specific signs of internal malignancy are less common than nonspecific ones, they are just as important; if the clinician managing the cancer patient is familiar with these clues to internal disease, proper patient management will ensue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kaplan, R P']",['Kaplan RP'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Dermatol,Advances in dermatology,8606032,,IM,"['Carcinoma/secondary', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma', 'Skin Neoplasms/*secondary']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Adv Dermatol. 1986;1:3-42.,,,193,,,,,,,,,,,"['University of California, Los Angeles.']",

Analysis of this sequence indicates that it encodes a protein which is structurally related to transmembrane receptors with a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. Unlike most growth factor receptors, it contains two hydrophobic regions which are potential transmembrane domains. Comparison of the sequence of the ret proto-oncogene with that of the ret transforming gene revealed that, in addition to the amino-terminal truncation, the last 51 carboxy-terminal amino acids of the ret proto-oncogene were replaced with 9 unrelated amino acids of the ret transforming gene. The focus forming activity of the ret cDNA, containing both amino-terminal and caboxy-terminal truncations, was approximately 13-fold higher than that of cDNA containing only the amino-terminal truncation.

We constructed and compared three retrovirus vectors which carried cDNA encoding the light chain (Tac) of the interleukin 2 receptor under the control of different promoters; long terminal repeat (LTR) of murine retroviruses, the early promoter of simian virus 40 (SV40) and the promoter of the class I antigen gene of the major histocompatibility complex. We made three constructs containing these promoters. A first construct did not contain any additional promoter but LTR. A second and a third constructs contained the SV40 and the class I antigen gene promoters, respectively, in addition to LTR. The LTR of retrovirus vectors is derived from MoMuLV except that the U3 region of the 3'LTR of the third construct is derived from myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV). The second and third constructs were used for infection of bone marrow stem cells as the first construct was less efficient in expression of the interleukin 2 receptor in fibroblasts. Hematopoietic stem cells infected with the recombinant viruses were transplanted into lethally irradiated mice, and the expression of the transduced gene in hematopoietic progenitor cells was analyzed. Analysis of RNA isolated from spleen colonies showed that substantial amounts of interleukin 2 receptor mRNA were made by the construct containing the class I gene promoter and MPSV LTR. However, we could not detect any transcripts from the constructs containing MoMuLV LTR and SV40 early region promoter.","['Takeda, S', 'Hamaguchi, Y', 'Zong, S Q', 'Kuze, K', 'Honjo, T', 'Ishimoto, M', 'Nakano, T', 'Kitamura, Y']","['Takeda S', 'Hamaguchi Y', 'Zong SQ', 'Kuze K', 'Honjo T', 'Ishimoto M', 'Nakano T', 'Kitamura Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2K(K) antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Spleen/cytology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08977198809000247 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 1988;1(1):59-66. doi: 10.3109/08977198809000247.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Medical Chemistry, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Japan.']",

The blast cells of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) are maintained by stem cells with these two properties. Since renewal and differentiation can be assessed separately in cultures of AML blasts, these cancer cells provide a useful model for examining stem regulation; such studies have practical importance for future developments in the treatment of AML. This paper considers three aspects of blast cell biology. First, evidence is presented that self-renewal and differentiation are regulated by specific genes; further, the DNA encoding these genes has structural features that affect the chemosensitivity of self-renewal. This sensitivity varies from patient-to-patient and is an important attribute contributing to variation in treatment efficacy. Second, the effects of myelopoietic growth factors on blast stem cells are presented and discussed, as these bear on the regulation of the balance between renewal and differentiation. Finally, models of leukaemic haemopoiesis are considered in light of the experimental findings. The suggestion is advanced that leukaemia can be explained better by abnormalities of gene expression than by blocked differentiation.","['McCulloch, E A', 'Minden, M D', 'Miyauchi, J', 'Kelleher, C A', 'Wang, C']","['McCulloch EA', 'Minden MD', 'Miyauchi J', 'Kelleher CA', 'Wang C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Cell Sci Suppl,Journal of cell science.

These features have made the HL60 cell line an attractive model for studies of human myeloid cell differentiation. This review summarizes the major properties of HL60 cells, describes some aspects of the regulation of gene expression in differentiating HL60 cells, including a novel interaction between transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls, and discusses the possible involvement of c-myc in proliferation and differentiation.","['Birnie, G D']",['Birnie GD'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Cancer Suppl,The British journal of cancer.

The same panel of McAbs was used to determine the antigens on leukaemic blast cells from peripheral blood of 15 patients with CGL in blastic transformation (BT) by complement mediated lysis and in vitro culture technique for clonogenic blasts (CFU-L) and immunofluorescence assay for total blast population. McAb for HLA-DR antigens (L243) and McAbs MY9, S3-13, S17-25 and 53/6 reacted with CFV-GM and CFU-L. In contrast, McAbs PM81 and AML-2-23 recognizing antigens on more mature myeloid cells did not react with these progenitor cells. McAb S4-7 reacted with the majority of CFU-L and a small proportion of ""early"" and ""late"" CFU-GM. This McAb may be useful for the prediction of blastic transformation in CGL patients. Generally, the reactivity of most McAbs was more heterogeneous with CFU-L than with CFU-GM in individual patients. The majority of McAbs included in our study reacted with a higher percentage of CFU-L and CFU-GM than predominant blast cell population in individual patients perhaps because the detected antigens are expressed more strongly on dividing progenitors than on relatively nonproliferative progeny. Thus we interpret the results of these studies showing that the antigenic phenotypes of the blast colony progenitor cells in CGL-BT are very similar to but not identical with those of CFU-GM from CGL-CP patients.","['Robak, T']",['Robak T'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 1988;36(4):471-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Pharmacology, Medical Academy, Lodz.']",

Combinations of ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell growth with concurrent cytotoxicity. The drugs in this combination were targeted at the individual subunits (non-heme iron and effector-binding) of ribonucleotide reductase and at the differential sensitivities of the substrate reductions to these agents. The reduction of the intracellular pools of all four dNTPs through the direct inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase has the effect of reducing DNA polymerase activity in a sigmoidal manner rather than in a hyperbolic fashion due to the requirement of DNA polymerase for all four substrates. As a result relatively small decreases in the intracellular concentrations of the dNTPs cause remarkably large decreases in DNA synthesis and hence cell replication. It appears that there may be a relationship between the capability of the cell to synthesize DNA at a minimal absolute rate and cell viability. That is, if DNA synthesis is decreased to or below a specific level, then the processes leading to cell death takes precedence over the tendency of the cell to complete DNA replication leading to cell division.","['Cory, J G']",['Cory JG'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(88)90030-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1988;27:437-55. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(88)90030-1.,,"['CA 27398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",52,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine, H.

Vibrios are characteristically indigenous to marine, estuarine, and brackish environments. They are distributed mainly in Gulf of Mexico coastal water, and these organisms ""bloom"" when the water is warm. Outbreaks of disease in humans frequently occur in summer, coinciding with multiplication of vibrios in warm water. Sporadic cases and small outbreaks of cholera continue to occur in persons living on or near the Gulf of Mexico, but infection in most persons is unrecognized. In fact, more serious and frequent illnesses result from V. vulnificus wound infections and from gastroenteritis caused by vibrios other than V. cholerae 01. Underlying hepatic or neoplastic disease (especially leukemia) apparently increases the likelihood and severity of illnesses caused by V. vulnificus and Aeromonas. Some Vibrionaceae produce clinical illness by means of enterotoxins identical or similar to cholera toxin. For many others, hemolysins, cytotoxins, and other exotoxins are necessary to produce disease; the importance of these virulence factors often is not known or the importance of these virulence factors often is not known or is of doubtful significance. Also, purported pathogenicity as demonstrated by animal models, such as fluid accumulation in ligated ileal loops, is quite nonspecific and needs to be interpreted cautiously. For Plesiomonas, a mode of pathogenesis has not been discovered. Eating raw shellfish (frequently raw oysters) has been linked epidemiologically to enteric infections with most of these bacteria; foreign travel and exposure to seawater are other frequently observed epidemiologic associations with infection. Foreign travel, particularly to the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, has been strongly associated with the acquisition of non-01 V. cholerae and Plesiomonas organisms. Most Vibrionaceae in the United States are susceptible in vitro--and illnesses from them are responsive--to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and other common antimicrobial agents. However, as for other bacteria that cause diarrhea, the main treatment for uncomplicated disease is the judicious replacement of fluids and electrolytes lost in diarrhea. A loose network of surveilance for these organisms comprises hospital and public health laboratories in Gulf coastal states that plate diarrheal stools on TCBS agar. As recognized pathogens are more assiduously screened for, and as newly identified vibrios are definitely included or excluded as enteric pathogens, the clinical importance of these members of the Vibrionaceae family should become clearer.","['Holmberg, S D']",['Holmberg SD'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Infect Dis Clin North Am,Infectious disease clinics of North America,8804508,,IM,"['Aeromonas', '*Bacterial Infections', '*Cholera', 'Diarrhea/*etiology', 'Humans', '*Vibrio Infections']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Infect Dis Clin North Am. 1988 Sep;2(3):655-76.,,,154,,,,,,,,,,,"['Epidemiology Branch, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia.']",

The vast majority of infections in the United States are caused by serotypes not specifically adapted to human or animal hosts, whereas the most frequent isolate in developing countries is S. typhi, which is highly adapted to human hosts. The number of isolates reported in the United States has been increasing steadily since 1975, largely a result of outbreaks associated with the mass production of food products, particularly poultry, which is frequently contaminated. Salmonella infection occurs when ingested organisms bypass gastric defenses, multiply within the intestinal lumen, penetrate the intestinal mucosa, and multiply within macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. They may then disseminate via the systemic circulation. Several virulence factors have been identified. The wide range of pathologic and clinical manifestations are subdivided into four syndromes, each requiring a distinct diagnostic and therapeutic approach: (1) gastroenteritis, (2) enteric fever, (3) bacteremia with or without metastatic disease, and (4) asymptomatic carriage. Although any serotype can cause any of these syndromes, certain serotypes are associated with specific presentations. Serious complications of bacteremic infection include infections of the aorta, endocardium, bone, and meninges. Salmonella infection is particularly severe in patients who have AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, immunodeficiency of other causes, inflammatory bowel disease, schistosomiasis, and macrophage dysfunction. Diagnosis is based on culture of the organism from appropriate sites. Several serologic tests have been developed that warrant further evaluation. Chloramphenicol, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole have clearly established efficacy. Experience with third generation cephalosporins and quinolones is preliminary and fragmentary, but results suggest that they may prove to be efficacious in certain clinical circumstances. Antibiotic resistance has become a major problem in certain geographic areas. The three vaccines for S. typhi that are currently in use internationally provide only moderate protection for short periods of time.","['Goldberg, M B', 'Rubin, R H']","['Goldberg MB', 'Rubin RH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Infect Dis Clin North Am,Infectious disease clinics of North America,8804508,,IM,"['Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Salmonella Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'United States']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Infect Dis Clin North Am. 1988 Sep;2(3):571-98.,,,137,,,,,,,,,,,"['Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",

Is differentiation-induction therapy possible?,705-11,"In this review we have discussed the data which indicates that differentiation can indeed occur to a limited degree in the neoplastic cells in acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Attempts to increase the degree of differentiation as an approach to the treatment of these disorders have utilised a variety of chemical agents which have been reported to exert such an effect in vitro. Analysis of the results, however, indicates that beneficial effects of these agents in patients is due to cytotoxic action which selectively reduces the neoplastic cell population. Leukemic cells can also undergo incomplete differentiation in vitro when exposed to appropriate growth factors, which raises the question of whether leukemia and myelodysplasia can be treated by the induction of differentiation in the malignant cells following the administration of these agents. This question, and questions about the nature of complete remission, will be answered in the coming years by clinical trials of growth factors, and further studies of the DNA in mature cells to analyse whether these cells are derived from leukemic progenitors.","['Januszewicz, E H', 'Firkin, F C']","['Januszewicz EH', 'Firkin FC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1988.tb00158.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1988 Aug;18(5):705-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1988.tb00158.x.,,,46,,,,,,,,,,,"[""University of Melbourne Department of Medicine, St Vincent's Hospital, Vic, Australia.""]",

Although for the second group of patients a longer follow-up is needed in order to evaluate eradication of the disease and long-term toxicity, the combination chemotherapy alone results in improving survival (71% versus 28%) and decreasing relapse rate (30% versus 56%) compared with the group of patients who received the chemoradiotherapy regimen. Also the incidence of Interstitial Pneumonia has been lower in the group receiving chemotherapy alone. We conclude that this protocol is generally well tolerated in young patients, without increasing secondary toxicity.","['Giardini, C', 'Polchi, P', 'Lucarelli, G', 'Galimberti, M', 'Moretti, L']","['Giardini C', 'Polchi P', 'Lucarelli G', 'Galimberti M', 'Moretti L']",['ita'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Pediatr Med Chir,La Pediatria medica e chirurgica : Medical and surgical pediatrics,8100625,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Premedication', 'Prognosis', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatr Med Chir. 1988 Nov-Dec;10(6):563-7.,,,,,Il trapianto di midollo osseo nelle leucemie acute in eta pediatrica.

Case report and review of the literature.,296-301,"A case of primary brain neoplasm is reported that developed 11 years after prophylactic brain irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) given for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) at the age of 3 years. Cases of supposed postirradiation gliomas in children seem to have increased in recent years, particularly following apparently successful treatment for ALL or medulloblastoma. This increase might reflect the increased number of long-surviving cancer children and thus suggest that brain irradiation may be a potential risk factor in this population. After reviewing some general data on neurooncogenesis, two points are stressed: (1) the child's brain is particularly susceptible to the mutagenic effects of ionizing radiation owing to physiologically active postnatal glial cell proliferation, which takes place in the cerebral hemispheres, especially during myelinogenesis; (2) MTX could promote glial neoplasm by enhancing reparative glial cell proliferation. Prospective studies seem necessary to show whether or not prophylactic brain radiation in ALL plays an oncogenetic role. Nevertheless, besides recurrent leukemia, leukoencephalopathy, and radionecrosis, the remote possibility of radiation-induced glial neoplasms should always be considered in cases of children treated for leukemia who present with neurological complications.","['Palma, L', 'Vagnozzi, R', 'Annino, L', 'Ciapetta, P', 'Maleci, A', 'Cantore, G']","['Palma L', 'Vagnozzi R', 'Annino L', 'Ciapetta P', 'Maleci A', 'Cantore G']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Glioma/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 1988 Oct;4(5):296-301.,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,"['Cattedra di Neurochirurgia, Istituto di Scienze Neurologiche, Policlinico Le Scotte, Siena, Italy.']",

This contrasted the secondary normal CFU-GM, which were less sensitive to Ara-C than the primary CFU-GM.

These signals can lead to growth, differentiation or the activation of an effector function. CSF-dependent cells maintained in culture resemble pre-leukemic cells and releasing cells from a factor-dependent growth state must be a final step in leukemogenesis. The measurement of metabolic changes in cells following ligand-receptor interactions has thus far failed to reveal the biochemical identity of growth signal transducing events. The patterns of growth responses observed in various CSF-dependent cell lines provide some idea of the relationship of these events for different CSF species. A number of IL-3-dependent cell lines can be switched to an IL-2- or a GM-CSF-dependent growth state. This implies the intracellular pathways activated by signal transduction through their different receptors must be related. The expression of the v-src oncogene in IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent cells leads to CSF-independent growth, whereas in an IL-2-dependent growth state the expression of v-src in these same cells does not lead to a loss of the requirement for IL-2 for growth. It might be argued that signal transduction through IL-3- or GM-CSF-specific receptors involves a protein tyrosine kinase. However, the addition of IL-3 or GM-CSF to cells expressing v-src results in a decrease in tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting that the effect of IL-3- or GM-CSF-specific signal transduction is to inhibit the expression of tyrosine kinase. It is unlikely that G-CSF signal transduction involves a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase. 32Dcl-23 cells respond to G-CSF by cell division and terminal differentiation, but when these cells are transformed to factor-independent growth following v-src infection, they remain responsive to G-CSF but lose the capacity to terminally differentiate. We have investigated the growth and differentiative responses of a range of human myeloid leukemias to G-CSF, IL-3 and GM-CSF. There is heterogeneity in the responses of different leukemic cells to these growth factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Watson, J D', 'Barber, K E', 'Crosier, P S']","['Watson JD', 'Barber KE', 'Crosier PS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Behring Inst Mitt,Behring Institute Mitteilungen,0367532,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/pathology', 'Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Behring Inst Mitt. 1988 Aug;(83):154-64.,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Immunobiology, School of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",

Only seven genes and one fragile site were confirmed assignments to chromosome 20 at the Ninth Human Gene Mapping Workshop in September 1987 (HGM9). One fragile site, 13 additional genes, and 10 DNA sequences that identify restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), however, were provisionally added to the map at HGM9. Five mutated genes on chromosome 20 have a relation to disease: a mutation in the adenosine deaminase gene results in a deficiency of the enzyme and severe combined immune deficiency; mutations in the gene for the growth hormone releasing factor result in some forms of dwarfism; mutations in the closely linked genes for the hormones arginine vasopressin and oxytocin and their neurophysins are probably responsible for some diabetes insipidus; and mutations in the gene that regulates both alpha-neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase activities determine galactosialidosis. The gene for the prion protein is on chromosome 20; it is related to the infectious agent of kuru, Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, and Gertsmann-Straussler syndrome, although the nature of the relationship is not completely understood. Two genes that code for tyrosine kinases are on the chromosome, SRC1 the proto-oncogene and a gene (HCK) coding for haemopoietic kinase (an src-like kinase), but no direct relation to cancer has been shown for either of these kinases. The significance of non-random loss of chromosome 20 in the malignant diseases non-lymphocytic leukaemia and polycythaemia vera is not understood. Twenty-four additional loci are assigned to the chromosome: five genes that code for binding proteins, one for a light chain of ferritin, genes for three enzymes (inosine triphosphatase, s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, and sterol delta 24-reductase), one for each of a secretory protein and an opiate neuropeptide, a cell surface antigen, two fragile sites, and 10 DNA sequences (one satellite and nine unique) that detect RFLPs.","['Simpson, N E']",['Simpson NE'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jmg.25.12.794 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Genet. 1988 Dec;25(12):794-804. doi: 10.1136/jmg.25.12.794.,PMC1051606,,146,,,,,,,,,,,"[""Department of Paediatrics, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",

The quinone moiety of this compound places it among a group of compounds whose activity is believed to be modulated by a redox cycle that activates the compounds to their free radicals (e.g., adriamycin). AZQ is unique among these compounds in that it can be reduced to its free radical (AZQH) by a variety of cells in culture, including human and murine cancer cells. Red blood cells (RBC) were also observed to reduce AZQ to its free radical. Using electron spin resonance (ESR), we observed that soon after the AZQ free radical appeared, it decayed and was replaced by a doublet with ESR parameters that suggested the presence of the ascorbyl radical (AH). The identity of AH was confirmed by adding exogenous ascorbic acid to AZQ free radicals generated by a suspension of L1210 murine leukemia cells. The endogenous ascorbic acid was shown to arise mostly from the ""buffy coat"" of an RBC preparation which contained leukocytes. Leukocytes are second only to the adrenals in level of ascorbic acid in humans. Cyclic voltammetry of ascorbic acid, AZQ, and adriamycin in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS pH 7.5), the buffer used for biological measurements, showed that the oxidation peak potential for ascorbic acid (Eap = +0.43 V) is closer to the reduction peak potential for AZQ (Ecp = -0.36 V) than that for adriamycin (Ecp = -0.67 V).

Review of the literature indicates that all osteoblastic cells, defined by their origin or by their ability to produce mineralized matrix, have a few common properties: production of type I collagen; increased alkaline phosphatase activity; and parathyroid hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase. Other features, such as osteocalcin and prostaglandin E production and the response to prostaglandin E, are selectively expressed by certain cell types. Pilot studies on mRNA levels of 'bone proteins' in developing calvaria suggest that such differences may reflect stages in osteoblastic differentiation. Immortalization of calvaria-derived cells using a SV40 large T antigen vector, which may freeze the cells in their particular state of differentiation (as proposed for leukaemia cells), yields phenotypes consistent with that hypothesis. Immortal cell lines may thus help to characterize osteoblastic differentiation. The diversity of osteoblast responses in culture to hormones and growth factors could be due to these phenotype differences but could also represent a subspecialization of differentiated cells. In addition, in the organism regulatory agents act in concert on a heterogeneous interactive cell population. Nonetheless cell cultures can be useful in screening for and predicting in vivo responses, as was shown by the 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of osteocalcin, and for studying the molecular mechanisms of regulatory effects. Cell lines are also convenient for the production of specific proteins and cDNA libraries, and for the expression of specific genes.","['Rodan, G A', 'Heath, J K', 'Yoon, K', 'Noda, M', 'Rodan, S B']","['Rodan GA', 'Heath JK', 'Yoon K', 'Noda M', 'Rodan SB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone and Bones/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/9780470513637.ch6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1988;136:78-91. doi: 10.1002/9780470513637.ch6.,,,41,,,,['NASA: 89152553'],,,,,,,"['Department of Bone Biology, Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, Pennsylvania 19486.']",

An MUO is defined as a metastatic tumor for which the site of origin is not suggested by thorough history, physical examination, chest x-ray studies, routine blood and urine studies, and histologic evaluation. Two major groups of MUO can be defined: MUO to lymph nodes only (N1-3), and MUO to visceral sites. The prognosis may be quite good for patients with MUO limited to lymph nodes in the mid to high cervical, axillary, and groin areas. However, MUO in other lymph node areas is far more serious, with the possible exception of that in patients with a new syndrome, i.e., ""advanced poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary origin."" There is some suggestion that these patients may respond to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Patients with MUO to visceral sites have a poor prognosis. However, metastases from some primary tumors are sensitive to chemotherapy and a limited search for these tumors should be undertaken. These tumors include leukemia-lymphoma, germ cell tumors, small cell carcinoma of the lung, adenocarcinomas of the breast, ovary, endometrium, thyroid, or prostate, and possibly adrenal carcinoma. We start by reviewing the biochemical events of metastasis that may be targets for therapy. The importance of a correct tissue diagnosis is then considered, including the role of standard histochemistry, electron microscopy, enzyme histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. The relatively limited value of radiologic tests in localizing the primary site of origin of the tumor is emphasized, as well as the limited role of currently available biomarkers. We conclude by discussing the treatment of each of the subtypes of MUO.","['Haskell, C M', 'Cochran, A J', 'Barsky, S H', 'Steckel, R J']","['Haskell CM', 'Cochran AJ', 'Barsky SH', 'Steckel RJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Cancer,Current problems in cancer,7702986,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['*Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis/therapy/ultrastructure', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Carcinoma/diagnosis/therapy/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Neoplasms, Unknown Primary/diagnosis/therapy/ultrastructure']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0147-0272(88)80007-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0147-0272(88)80007-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Probl Cancer. 1988 Jan-Feb;12(1):5-58. doi: 10.1016/s0147-0272(88)80007-2.,,,146,,,,,,,,,,,['UCLA School of Medicine.'],

This type of neoplasm is more common in Japan than in Western countries, and may show distinct clinical pictures such as hypergammaglobulinemia, hypercalcemia, etc. T-cell lymphomas are more prone than B-cell lymphomas to become leukemic. Because of a marked intermingling of reactive cells (histiocytes, eosinophils, etc.), the histologic diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma is often difficult. Proliferation pattern and cellular size do not correlate with prognosis as in B-cell lymphoma. Since T-cell lymphomas often manifest with several distinct clinicopathologic settings, their categorization should be based on several parameters, such as the presence or absence of ATLL-associated antigen in serum, histology, phenotype of the neoplastic cell, and clinical features. Since a classification for T-cell lymphomas has not been established, a further multi-disciplinary approach is necessary for a better understanding of this interesting neoplasm.","['Watanabe, S', 'Mukai, K', 'Shimoyama, M']","['Watanabe S', 'Mukai K', 'Shimoyama M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,,IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*classification/genetics/pathology', 'Risk Factors']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00047754 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1988 Nov;7(3):243-61. doi: 10.1007/BF00047754.,,,90,,,,,,,,,,,"['Epidemiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",

However, in limited areas in Japan a specific type of lymphoid malignancy called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), which is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), is highly prevalent, and there are also many healthy carriers of HTLV-I in the same areas. A cross-sectional seroepidemiological study of HTLV-I showed that the age-specific proportion of healthy HTLV-I carriers in these ATL-endemic areas increased with age, especially over 40, and was higher in females than in males. Three main routes of HTLV-I transmission are recognized: 1) vertical transmission from mother to child mainly through breast milk; 2) horizontal transmission from man to woman through semen, and; 3) parenteral transmission from carrier donor to non-carrier recipient. The annual incidence rate of ATL among HTLV-I carriers is estimated at 2.0 in males and 0.5 in females, and the cumulative risk for ATL in HTLV-I carriers during a 70-year life span is 1%-5%. Possible risk factors for ATL in addition to HTLV-I infection were considered, i.e. genetic factors, environmental factors, nutritional condition, thymus involution etc., but none of these were found to be clearly associated with ATL. To determine whether there exist particularly susceptible hosts for ATL in the ATL endemic areas, HLA types were examined, but no conclusive results on the positive relationships between HLA types and ATL manifestation or HTLV-I infection were obtained. From follow-up studies on the age-specific distribution of HTLV-I carriers in Japan, it is now speculated that the HTLV-I infection rate might have decreased naturally in the more recent generational cohort groups, even in the ATL-endemic areas. However, ATL in Japan is an important subject for study in the field of cancer epidemiology, and several trial intervention programs for the prevention of ATL, such as controls of vertical transmission from mother to child through breast milk, are now ongoing in the ATL-endemic areas of Japan.","['Tajima, K']",['Tajima K'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00047753 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1988 Nov;7(3):223-41. doi: 10.1007/BF00047753.,,,83,,,,,,,,,,,"['Division of Epidemiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute Chikusa-Ku, Nagoya, Japan.']",

After 72 hours of antibiotic therapy, in case of persistent fever, piperacillin or ceftazidime was added to the ceftazidime + amikacin or piperacillin + amikacin combination, respectively. The antibiotic treatment was, however, modified according to in vitro susceptibility if a positive culture was present. Success without regimen modification was observed in both antibiotic combinations in 52.6% of cases. Considering the empiric cross of antibiotics, the response rate reached 78%. Neither toxicity nor side effects were observed in the reported groups. Considering blood isolates, we observed a greater incidence of gram-positive organisms compared with gram-negatives (28 cases vs 5 cases, 84.7% vs 15.3% respectively). Fungal infections were documented in four cases, two in each group. Even though no statistical difference was found between the two groups as far as patients not responding to the first antibiotic combination are concerned, piperacillin seems to have had more efficacy (twelve patients responding to the addition of piperacillin vs seven patients responding to the addition of ceftazidime). Piperacillin + amikacin seems to be as effective as ceftazidime + amikacin in the empirical therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.","['Fenu, S', 'Raccah, R', 'Santilli, S', 'Micozzi, A', 'Girmena, C', 'Martino, P', 'Avvisati, G']","['Fenu S', 'Raccah R', 'Santilli S', 'Micozzi A', 'Girmena C', 'Martino P', 'Avvisati G']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Italy,Chemioterapia,Chemioterapia : international journal of the Mediterranean Society of Chemotherapy,8401667,"['84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Amikacin/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy', 'Ceftazidime/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Piperacillin/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Random Allocation']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chemioterapia. 1988 Oct;7(5):323-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita degli studi La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",

Seven patients were resistant to previous therapy and were grafted in the evolutive phase. Only 1 patient was grafted without any previous treatment. At the time of BMT 5 patients were classified according to the Rai classification in stage IV, 1 in stage III and 2 in stage 1. The delay between diagnosis and BMT was 47 months (5 to 68). Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was methotrexate (1 patient), cyclosporine (2 patients), methotrexate + cyclosporine (3 patients), cyclosporine + physical removal of T cells (2 patients). The conditioning regimen was standard for 5 patients, reinforced for 3 patients with Chlorambucil (1 patient) and etoposide (2 patients). A successful engraftment was obtained in all cases. The lymphocytosis decreased slowly and disappeared from day 0 to day 28. All patients developed an acute GVHD 5 of which resolved. Three patients died: 2 of acute GVHD and 1 of intracerebral hemorrhage. Five patients are alive in persistent complete remission without clinical symptoms and with normal peripheral blood and normal bone marrow. The median follow-up is 27 months (13-53).

New treatments should take into account a balance between risks and benefits. Relatively risky therapies can be tried only in those subsets of patients in whom the survival is shortened as compared to the control population. The impact of new therapies on survival is best demonstrated by prospective randomized trials. Two errors are common when the response to treatment is analyzed. Frequently unsuitable statistical methods, biased in favour of responders, are employed. In addition, it is often incorrectly implied that response causes longer survival. To investigate whether CLL can be cured, more research should be directed to the characteristics of complete clonal remissions. The use of non-risky biologic response modifiers in early stages may contribute to these efforts.","['Rozman, C', 'Montserrat, E']","['Rozman C', 'Montserrat E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Risk Factors']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1988;30(5-6):453-5.,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,"['Postgraduate School of Haematology Farreras Valenti, Hospital Clinico, Universidad de Barcelona, Spain.']",

Regimen A was significantly better for remission induction (p less than 0.001), and prolonged survival (p less than 0.01) in comparison to regimen B. More aggressive chemotherapy is associated with better response but requires close monitoring of both antineoplastic effect and haematological toxicity. Total tumor mass score (TTM) proved to be suitable for definition of both early, stable disease and the response to therapy because of its quantitative continuous character and its independence of bone marrow failure. This system is helpful for the detection of treatment toxicity and consequently enables safe monitoring of therapy. Although statistically significant difference has not yet been reached between the patients treated early and non treated patients the latter group seems to fare better.","['Jaksic, B', 'Brugiatelli, M']","['Jaksic B', 'Brugiatelli M']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Chlorambucil/*administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage', 'Random Allocation', 'Remission Induction', 'Yugoslavia']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1988;30(5-6):437-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Dept. of Medicine, University Hospital, Zagreb, Yugoslavia.']",

Several factors may contribute to an increased risk of infection in individual patients but, overall, impaired antibody production--commonly manifest as hypogammaglobulinaemia--appears to be a major factor. Early studies of immunoglobulin replacement using the intramuscular route showed equivocal results. More recently, highly purified preparations of IgG have become available for intravenous use making regular replacement therapy a realistic possibility for patients at risk. We have recently undertaken a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of regular intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) replacement in patients with CLL at risk of infection as defined by presence of hypogammaglobulinaemia, a significant infection history, or both. Eighty-four patients with CLL were randomized to receive IVIg (Gammagard Baxter Healthcare Corporation Hyland Division), 400 mg/kg body weight or an equivalent volume of normal saline every 3 weeks for a year. Patients receiving IVIg showed a 45% reduction in bacterial infection during the study period (p = 0.01). In patients completing a full year of study, a 61% reduction in bacterial infection was observed (p = 0.001). A significant reduction in bacterial infection was also seen in a blinded crossover study in which 12 patients from one centre who had completed a full year in the former study were subsequently given the alternative infusion for a further year.

To best identify regimens worth pursuing in large scale clinical trials, uniform eligibility, response and toxicity criteria are essential. Standardization will facilitate comparison of results, ensure homogeneity of patient groups on clinical trials, and minimize the arbitrary nature of dose modifications. In 1987, an NCI-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) developed Guidelines for US clinical trials for CLL which included specific eligibility, response and toxicity criteria. These will be modified over time as more is learned about the disease. Trials are currently restricted to patients with active B-CLL. Although complete and partial response are carefully defined, alternative systems (e.g. stage shift for partial response) may be tested concurrently and definitions revised if warranted. Similarly, use of the modified Rai staging is encouraged, although other systems may also be studied and compared for clinical relevance. The U.S. Cooperative Oncology Groups and Cancer Centers are participating in a National CLL treatment program following the NCI-WG Guidelines.

There are a variety of techniques to determine whether the transformation represents a clonal evolution of the original CLL or an independent disease. These include cytogenetic analysis, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement by Southern blot analysis, and anti-idiotypic antibodies. While identity can be determined by gene rearrangement and anti-idiotypic antibodies, lack of identity can occur because of somatic mutation within a single clone. Thus, even with optimal techniques it is difficult to definitively exclude lack of identity in some instances.

Due to the availability of monoclonal antibodies, FcR for IgE (Fc epsilon R) and for IgG (Fc gamma R) have been characterized and their genes have been cloned. These receptors are markers of leucocyte sub-populations. Fc epsilon RII(CD23) in almost exclusively expressed on B lymphocytes and B tumour cells. Fc gamma RII(CDw32) is found on B lymphocytes, but also on monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and platelets. Fc gamma RIII(CD16) is mostly borne by granulocytes, but is also a marker of NK cells ans some T lymphocytes. FcR are molecules which are readily released in the sera where they can be detected by radioimmunoassays and dot-blot assays. The amount of circulating Fc epsilon RII is strongly increased in sera from patients with B-CLL and this increase seems to be related to the Rai stage of the disease. Circulating Fc gamma RIII is not grossly modified in B-CLL, although some patients have very low amounts of these molecules. The significance of these data has to be envisioned in view of the possible role of immunoglobulin-Binding Factors (IBF), FcR-related immunoregulatory lymphokines, in the control of B cell proliferation. For instance, IgE-BF, a cleavage product of Fc epsilon RII has been proposed to act as an autocrine growth factor on malignant B cells. IgG-BF, antigenically related to Fc gamma RII in the mouse and to Fc gamma RIII in the human, inhibits the IgG production and the growth of malignant B cells. Thus, the dosage of FcRs and IBFs could bring new insights in the monitoring of B cell proliferations, including B-CLL.","['Fridman, W H', 'Mathiot, C', 'Montcuit, J', 'Teillaud, J L']","['Fridman WH', 'Mathiot C', 'Montcuit J', 'Teillaud JL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,"['0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Prostatic Secretory Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (beta-microseminoprotein)', '0 (immunoglobulin-binding factors)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', '*Lymphokines', '*Prostatic Secretory Proteins', '*Receptors, Fc']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1988;30(5-6):311-5.,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,"[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Clinique, INSERM Unite 255, Paris, France.""]",

We examined antibody-expressing malignant B cells from patients with CLL for reactivity with each of several mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for immunoglobulin (Ig) cross-reactive idiotypes (CRI) associated with human autoantibodies. Nearly 20% of all Ig-expressing CLL were recognized by a mAb specific for a rheumatoid factor (RF) heavy-chain associated CRI. Furthermore, approximately 20% of the kappa light chain expressing CLL reacted with 17.109, a mAb specific for a kappa-light-chain-associated CRI. In contrast, NHL that do not co-express the CD5 surface antigen apparently react with these anti-CRI mAbs at significantly lower frequencies. None of the forty CD5-negative NHL tested reacted with the mAb specific for the Ig heavy chain associated CRI. Moreover, only one of 30 kappa light chain expressing CD5-negative NHL tested reacted with 17.109. We examined the molecular basis for the high frequency expression of autoantibody-associated CRIs in CLL.

These so-called CD5 + B cells constitute a minority of B cells in adults, although they predominate during foetal life. This latter fact induced a majority of authors to assume that CLL B lymphocytes correspond to proliferation of an immature B-cell clone. However, this hypothesis does not explain the particular high frequency with which hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmune phenomena directed against blood cell components are found in B-CLL, as well as the difficulty to include CD5 antigen in most differentiation pathways of B-cells. In this work, we shall discuss the available evidence coming from Ly 1-B cells (mouse counterpart of CD5 B cells), indicating that these cells correspond to a separate B lineage. We shall also discuss the evidence for hypogammaglobulinemia being mainly a B cell defect caused by dilution or inhibition of normal CD5 negative B cells and disordered autoimmunity as a consequence of a disturbance of the idiotypic network, which normally antagonizes autoimmune clones.","['Dighiero, G']",['Dighiero G'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,,IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1988;30(5-6):283-8.,,,39,,,,,,,,,,,"[""Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immuno-Pathologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",

With better appreciation of the wide variability in its clinical and hematologic manifestations, some authors have proposed several subtypes of HCL such as leukopenic and nonleukopenic subtypes and subtypes with and without massive splenomegaly. As opposed to such a clinical and hematologic variability, the pathology of HCL in the spleen and bone marrow is consistent and highly characteristic. Since the spleen becomes available for pathologic examination only after therapeutic splenectomy, the bone marrow pathology often plays the most important role in the differential diagnosis of HCL. It is characterized by focal or diffuse mononuclear cell infiltration with a wide spacing between individual nuclei in most patients and by a severely hypocellular marrow with individual hairy cells infiltrating between the marrow fat cells in the remaining minority of patients. The bone marrow biopsy also serves as one of the criteria in selecting the therapeutic modality as well as monitoring the therapeutic effect. Further, new insights into the pathogenesis of HCL are emerging from recent studies of the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Katayama, I']",['Katayama I'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/etiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1988 Dec;2(4):585-602.,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical School, Japan.']",

A combined approach.,537-55,"Although the cytologic type of acute leukemia can often be suspected on the basis of conventional panoptically stained specimens, it is important to document as precisely as possible the type of leukemia before the institution of specific treatment. At the present time, this documentation can usually be achieved with cytochemical stains that demonstrate enzymes and/or metabolites of diagnostic value. Additional immunocytochemical stains can often identify cells of ambiguous origin on the basis of cell-specific properties such as antigens. Immunophenotyping has proven to be of considerable value in the diagnosis and classification of ALL. At present, the practicality of surface antigen phenotyping in ANLL remains to be documented. The identification of hybrid leukemia is clearly facilitated with immunologic markers. Present criteria for the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome do not include immunophenotyping. By use of a combination of morphologic criteria, traditional cytochemical stains, and immunocytochemical techniques, it is possible to establish the cell of origin in the large majority of cases of acute leukemia. Those rare cases in which the usual patterns of reactivity do not occur provide additional stimuli to develop new cytochemical and immunologic methods that will help to establish the origin of the leukemic blast.","['Kass, L', 'Elias, J M']","['Kass L', 'Elias JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1988 Dec;2(4):537-55.,,,111,,,,,,,,,,,"['Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio.']",

The truth of this hypothesis was investigated by studying the effect of phytohemagglutinin and/or interleukin 2 on the sensitivity to methotrexate (MTX) of normal T lymphocytes and of lymphoblasts of a patient with acute T-cell lymphoid leukemia. In both cases, inhibition of proliferation by MTX was increased from less than 30% in resting cells or those suboptimally stimulated, in the case of leukemic blasts, to 68-83% in maximally stimulated cells. Similar results were observed when the AML 193 human myeloid leukemia line was stimulated with human recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulation factor (GM-CSF). Under basal proliferation conditions, the addition of 1 microgram/ml and 10 micrograms/ml MTX was followed by 48% and 72% inhibition respectively. When 1 ng/ml GM-CSF (40 I.U./ml) was present, these figures rose to 89% and 91%. It is thus clear that growth factor-induced cell proliferation increases sensitivity to cycle-specific cytostatic agents. There is thus a biological premise for new perspectives in antineoplastic therapy.","['Ciaiolo, C', 'Ferrero, D', 'Pugliese, A', 'Biglino, A', 'Marletto, G', 'Tonello, M', 'Colzani, G', 'Marietti, G']","['Ciaiolo C', 'Ferrero D', 'Pugliese A', 'Biglino A', 'Marletto G', 'Tonello M', 'Colzani G', 'Marietti G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/10/31 00:00,1988/10/31 00:01,['1988/10/31 00:00'],"['1988/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1988 Oct 31;74(5):537-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Amedeo di Savoia Hospital, Turin, Italia.']",

Separation and recovery of cells was totally dependent on the use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies binding to the labelled population. The nylon matrix, precoated with an anti-mouse immunoglobulin, traps the cells coated with monoclonal antibodies, and these can be released simply by gentle manipulation of the matrix. The matrix employed has been shown to not specifically trap committed bone marrow progenitors as determined by CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM assays.

Studies of the expression of certain lineage restricted molecules on the surface of or within normal lymphoid cells and their malignant counterparts have been largely responsible for this advance, which has markedly improved the classification of ALL. These studies have disclosed previously unrecognized biologic heterogeneity and have shown that there are several different immunophenotypic subsets of ALL. Some of these subsets differ in their clinical and cytogenetic features, as well as in their responsiveness to modern therapy, underscoring the clinical relevance of such studies. A consideration of all of these features of ALL permits a more accurate assessment of prognosis for children with newly diagnosed disease and has permitted tailoring therapy based on expected relapse hazard. Recent cytogenetic studies have disclosed that clonal abnormalities are present in the blast cells of most children with ALL.

Myeloablation was performed by total body irradiation (1200-1560 cGy) and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg). Morphological findings were graded semi-quantitatively and correlated with previous and current therapy. Histological alterations did not correspond to the dosages of myeloablative therapy. However, cardiac failure, the primary cause of death in four patients, was associated with coagulative fiber necroses and contraction band necroses, which may be related to acute cyclophosphamide toxicity. In three of these patients high-dose cardiotoxic pretreatment with anthracyclines and mitoxantrone has been performed beyond the critical cardiotoxic level. High-dose pretreatment was correlated with histological hallmarks of anthracycline heart disease: marked chromatin clumping of myocardial cell nuclei (3/3 patients), occurrence of plurivesicular ""adria"" cells (3/3 patients), and diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis (2/3 patients).

Most studies on either procedure deal with selected patients and lack randomized or concurrent controls; many exclude high-risk subgroups. There are only a few preliminary reports on the direct comparison between bone marrow transplantation and intensive chemotherapy. Considerable controversy remains as to whether patients with AML in first remission who have an HLA identical sibling should receive a bone marrow transplant at that time or whether the transplant should be delayed until relapse or second remission. In patients under the age of 25 years, results of bone marrow transplantation are considered to be equivalent or superior to those achieved with chemotherapy. Because of a high lethality rate few results suggest that survival of patients transplanted during first remission is not superior to that obtained by intensified chemotherapy; however, the relapse incidence is decreased. In recent years, results in adult ALL, treated with various intensified programs, have improved considerably and are nearly comparable to those obtained in childhood ALL. Therefore, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is usually performed in standard risk patients during second remission and, if relapse occurs within the first three years. It is not clear at present whether ALL high-risk patients will benefit from bone marrow transplantation during first remission.","['Jehn, U', 'Grunewald, R']","['Jehn U', 'Grunewald R']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Remission Induction']",1988/07/15 00:00,1988/07/15 00:01,['1988/07/15 00:00'],"['1988/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01728802 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1988 Jul 15;66(14):614-23. doi: 10.1007/BF01728802.,,,66,,Postremissions-Behandlung der akuten Leukamie im Erwachsenenalter: allogene Knochenmarktransplantation oder Chemotherapie?,,,,,,,,,"['Medizinische Klinik III, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen.']",

During the second therapy phase (consolidation) considerable deviations from the recommended therapy occurred in all nonresponders and in 34% of the patients who had achieved remission. The maintenance therapy had to be reduced in one third of the patients, mainly due to thrombopenias. Lethal complications caused by therapy-induced toxicity, occurred in 7 out of 173 cases (4%), and followed severe infections (mycoses), or other complications such as cardiotoxicity. The proportion of severe complications decreased from the induction through the first to the second consolidation phase.

The observations illustrate, that less favorable subtypes of childhood ALL are more frequent in these children, preferably in infants aged six months and less, explaining decisively the impaired prognosis. These subtypes are characterized by large tumor burden (p = less than 0.001), initial central nervous system (CNS) involvement (p = less than 0.001), and a high CNS relapse rate (p = 0.03). Phenotypically the undifferentiated leukemic blast cells show negative reactions for cALLa and often for Tdt (0-ALL and AUL; p = less than 0.001). The switch to prognostically more favorable ALL subtypes occurs about the end of the first year of life.

A vast amount of laboratory data have clearly demonstrated the potent antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects of vitamin A and the synthetic analogues (retinoids). Recent in-vitro work has led to the exciting proposal that protein kinase-C may be centrally involved in many of retinoids' anticancer actions including the effects on ornithine decarboxylase induction, intracellular polyamine levels, and epidermal growth factor receptor number. Several intervention trials have clearly indicated that natural vitamin A at clinically tolerable doses has only limited activity against human neoplastic processes. Therefore, clinical work has focused on the synthetic derivatives with higher therapeutic indexes. In human cancer prevention, retinoids have been most effective for skin diseases, including actinic keratosis, keratoacanthoma, epidermodysplasia verruciformis, dysplastic nevus syndrome, and basal cell carcinoma. Several noncutaneous premaligancies, however, are currently receiving more attention in retinoid trials. Definite retinoid activity has been documented in oral leukoplakia, laryngeal papillomatosis, superficial bladder carcinoma, cervical dysplasia, bronchial metaplasia, and preleukemia. Significant therapeutic advances are also occurring with this class of drugs in some drug-resistant malignancies and several others that have become refractory, including advanced basal cell cancer, mycosis fungoides, melanoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and of the head and neck. This report comprehensively presents the clinical data using retinoids as anticancer agents in human premalignant disorders and outlines the ongoing and planned studies with retinoids in combination and adjuvant therapy.","['Lippman, S M', 'Meyskens, F L Jr']","['Lippman SM', 'Meyskens FL Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Am Coll Nutr,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,8215879,"['0 (Retinoids)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Retinoids/therapeutic use', 'Vitamin A/*therapeutic use']",1988/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07315724.1988.10720244 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Coll Nutr. 1988 Aug;7(4):269-84. doi: 10.1080/07315724.1988.10720244.,,"['CA 23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27502/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",133,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Medicine, University of Arizona Medical Center, Tucson.']",

However, when survival of T-zone and AIL-like T-cell lymphoma was compared with survival of large cell immunoblastic and polylobated lymphomas no significant difference was detected.

At the time of this report 48 patients, of whom 22 were splenectomized, had been treated for at least 3 months and were considered evaluable for response. The median observation time on IFN-alpha-2b was 11 months (range 3 to 20). 4 cases with atypical disease (spongy lymphoid myelofibrosis) were also included. All patients responded to IFN. After 3 months 11/48 patients (23%) had achieved a partial remission (PR) with normalization of peripheral blood values. After 6 months 27/43 patients (63%) had achieved a favourable response; complete remission (CR) was recorded in 4 and PR in 23 patients. The proportion of patients with favourable responses (CR + PR) increased with the duration of therapy and after 12 months of therapy 23/28 (82%) patients showed CR or PR, 9 patients (32%) being in CR.

Acute myelogenous leukemia and acute myelomonocytic leukemia.,420-8,"In this study, pretreatment peripheral and/or bone marrow blasts from 12 patients with acute unclassifiable leukemia (AUL) expressing the myeloid-related cell-surface antigen (CD 11) were isolated for further analysis. Despite a lack of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, 1 patient's blasts contained cytoplasmic Auer rods. The circulating blasts from another patient expressed MPO while maintaining the same surface phenotype during 20 months of clinical follow-up. In addition, the blasts from 3 cases demonstrated both myelomonocytic and monocyte-specific surface antigens, whereas the remaining 9 cases completely lacked any monocyte-specific antigen detectable by monoclonal antibodies, Mo2, My4 and Leu M3 (CD 14). The first case eventually was diagnosed as acute myelomonocytic leukemia and the second as acute myelogenous leukemia by means of immunophenotypic analysis using flow cytometry (FACS IV). In addition, the presence of MPO protein was identified in the cytoplasm of blast cells from 5 patients with AUL by means of a cytoplasmic immunofluorescence test using a monoclonal antibody (MA1). Our study indicates that non-T, non-B AUL expressing OKM1 (CD 11) antigens include acute leukemias which are unequivocally identifiable as being of either myeloid or myelomonocytic origin. However, further investigations, including immunophenotypic and cytoplasmic analysis, ultrastructural cytochemistry and gene analysis with molecular probes (tests applicable to normal myeloid cells), are necessary in order to determine the actual origin of blasts and to recognize the differentiation stages of the various types of leukemic cells from patients with undifferentiated forms of leukemia.","['Imamura, N', 'Tanaka, R', 'Kajihara, H', 'Kuramoto, A']","['Imamura N', 'Tanaka R', 'Kajihara H', 'Kuramoto A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Monitoring, Immunologic']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00221.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1988 Nov;41(5):420-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1988.tb00221.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",

The results suggested that the process is not a single cascade of molecular chain reactions, but a synergistic result of two different inducible intracellular reactions. One reaction is induced following damage to DNA (inhibition of DNA replication) and is not specific to MEL cells. The other reaction, which is specific to MEL cells, is fully induced by typical erythroid inducing agents such as dimethylsulfoxide or hexamethylenebisacetamide even at concentrations suboptimal for the erythroid induction. Based upon these data, we searched for the putative trans-acting differentiation-inducing factors and detected two proteinaceous factors (DIF-I and DIF-II) in the cytosol fraction which apparently correspond to these reactions. When, partially purified, either one of these factors was introduced into undifferentiated MEL cells, it triggered erythroid differentiation, provided that the recipient cells had been potentiated by the induction of the other reaction. In this article, we summarize the basic characteristics of these cytoplasmic factors involved in erythroid differentiation in MEL cells.","['Watanabe, T', 'Nomura, S', 'Kaneko, T', 'Yamagoe, S', 'Kamiya, T', 'Oishi, M']","['Watanabe T', 'Nomura S', 'Kaneko T', 'Yamagoe S', 'Kamiya T', 'Oishi M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Cell Differ Dev,Cell differentiation and development : the official journal of the International Society of Developmental Biologists,8811335,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Extracts/analysis', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', '*Growth Inhibitors', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Lymphokines/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*analysis/cytology']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0922-3371(88)90106-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Differ Dev. 1988 Nov;25 Suppl:105-9. doi: 10.1016/0922-3371(88)90106-2.,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,"['Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",

These advances have contributed significantly to the establishment of immunophenotyping as an essential diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of types of acute leukaemia. Immunophenotyping allows for the objective and reproducible distinction of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) from acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and of T-lineage from B-lineage ALL. Immunologically defined ALL and AML subtypes have been found to convey prognostic significance. Using cell lineage-specific and differentiation stage-specific MAbs, cases of T- and B-lineage ALL and of AML can be further classified into a number of different subtypes. Routine immunophenotyping concentrates on the diagnostic enquiry into a few major, clinically relevant subtypes; only a limited number of crucial reagents are employed that are commercially available. The simplification and standardization of discriminatory immunomarker panels make immunophenotyping a reliable diagnostic instrument for the provision of critical data to make a differential diagnosis. An effort to identify the nature and origin of the blast cells precisely, immunological typing definitely plays an important part in the multiple-marker analysis of acute leukaemia (morphology, cytochemistry, karyotyping, genotyping) for applied diagnostic and fundamental research purposes.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gignac, S M', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gignac SM', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification', '*Phenotype']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320752 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1988 Dec;57(6):327-39. doi: 10.1007/BF00320752.,,,91,,,,,,,,,,,"['Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, Academic Department of Haematology, London, UK.']",['Blut. 1990 Jan;60(1):48-51.

Factors predictive for successful remission induction were a long interval between bone marrow transplant and relapse in ALL patients; and isolated extramedullary relapse. Presenting blast count, karyotype and remission status and number at the time of BMT were not predictive. Donor bone marrow was shown to be responsible for haemopoietic recovery occurring in the 21 out of 31 patients tested who achieved remission using donor karyotype or red blood cell antigens as markers. Nine patients received a second bone marrow transplant but only one became a long-term survivor.

The activities of the compounds as measured in the two assays show a good correlation. Reduction of the quinone compounds is essential for activity in the two assays. Reduction activates opening of the aziridine ring and formation of an alkylating species. The results suggest that steric factors are important in DNA adduct formation. Methylation of the aziridine rings decreases the activity. Bulky 3,6-substitutes also decrease the activity. No correlation is found between above-mentioned assays for DNA modification and in vivo activity towards tumour cells. It is possible that, as well as DNA, other cellular targets are involved. A correlation is observed between the DNA modifying activity and toxicity against L1210 cells in vitro.

In patients receiving marrow unpurged of T lymphocytes, keratinocyte HLA-DR staining was found in the majority of patients with, and in about one third of those without, histological evidence of GVHD. Positivity was strongly related to the presence of a rash and was more likely to be found if the interval between the onset of the rash and biopsy exceeded 24 hr. There was a strong association between the presence of positive cells and the subsequent development of systemic GVHD, indicating that staining for HLA-DR on keratinocytes may be a useful adjunct to conventional morphological analysis in the interpretation of post-transplant skin biopsies. Positivity was not observed in patients who received marrow depleted of T lymphocytes, indicating a crucial role for these cells in stimulating keratinocyte HLA-DR expression.

It was shown that there exist two ets loci in humans, c-ets-1 and c-ets-2, which were mapped to human chromosome 11 and 21, respectively. The human c-ets-1 proto-oncogene locus was shown to translocate from chromosome 11 to 9 or 4 in certain patients with acute monocytic leukemia. In order to understand the functional role of c-ets-1 proto-oncogene, we have made a cDNA library from MOLT-4 cells and isolated seven c-ets-1 positive cDNA clones. Analysis of two cDNA clones revealed a complete open reading frame of the c-ets-1 proto-oncogene. Except for 81 nucleotides at the 5'-end (downstream of initiation codon) and 39 nucleotides at the 3'-end (upstream of termination codon), the c-ets-1 cDNA is approximately 82% homologous to v-ets oncogene sequences and encodes a 441-residue protein (c-ets-1a) which contains contiguous 5' and 3' regions of the v-ets oncogene as in the case of chicken. Sequence analysis also revealed alternative splicing, giving rise to another related c-ets-1 polypeptide (c-ets-1b) lacking 87 amino acids. Our results suggest that differential RNA splicing allows the synthesis of at least two related c-ets-1 polypeptides from a single c-ets-1 proto-oncogene.","['Reddy, E S', 'Rao, V N']","['Reddy ES', 'Rao VN']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncogene Res,Oncogene research,8801457,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (oncogene proteins v-ets)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA Splicing', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene Res. 1988;3(3):239-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",

These cells can be induced to blast transform, differentiate and, in some cases, proliferate upon exposure to IFN. Treatment with IFN-alpha enhanced the levels of c-myc mRNA in malignant cells from the patients, whereas the levels of c-myb mRNA decreased, as measured by slot blot hybridizations. In cells from some patients, an enhanced expression of c-fos and k-ras was observed following exposure to IFN-alpha. No major effect on the expression of c-raf or of enolase was observed in any of the patients following exposure to IFN-alpha, whereas the levels of beta 2-microglobulin mRNA increased. In contrast to the observed effects on oncogene expression in CLL cells, IFN had no major effect on the expression of any of the tested oncogenes in lymphocytes from healthy donors or in B-cells from three neoplastic cell lines (380, FL18, RS). We conclude that IFN-alpha can enhance or repress the expression of several oncogenes in nondividing primary malignant cells from patients with leukemia. We also show that the response of malignant cells from patients to IFN-alpha is different than that seen with neoplastic cell lines which represent a similar stage of B-cell differentiation.","['Einhorn, S', 'Showe, L', 'Ostlund, L', 'Juliusson, G', 'Robert, K H', 'Gahrton, G', 'Croce, C']","['Einhorn S', 'Showe L', 'Ostlund L', 'Juliusson G', 'Robert KH', 'Gahrton G', 'Croce C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Oncogene Res,Oncogene research,8801457,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 4.2.1.11 (Phosphopyruvate Hydratase)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phosphopyruvate Hydratase/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene Res. 1988;3(1):39-49.,,['CA-39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,"['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",

Differentiated resting human T-cells and B-cells do not express detectable amounts of c-myb protein. However, upon mitogenic stimulation in vitro T-cells exhibit strong expression of the c-myb protein as demonstrated by immunocytochemical staining and indirect immunoprecipitation. In contrast to the transformed T-lymphoblastic cell line Molt-4, where c-myb protein is a nuclear antigen, it was found in proliferating normal T-cells almost exclusively distributed in the cytoplasm. Screening of a total of 70 fresh human malignant lymphomas by immunohistochemical staining indicates the presence of the c-myb protein primarily in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with a large growth fraction, i.e. precursor cell-derived lymphoblastic lymphomas of B-cell type and T-cell type (9/10, 3/4, respectively) and anaplastic large cell Ki-1 lymphomas (5/9), which originate from activated lymphoid cells. The c-myb protein was located predominantly in the nucleus and in some cases additionally in the cytoplasm. The different subcellular locations suggest a dual functional role. While nuclear localisation is exhibited by transformed haematopoietic cells, cytoplasmic localisation appears to be characteristic for proliferating normal T-cells and points to a second property of the c-myb protein other than interaction with DNA.","['Bading, H', 'Gerdes, J', 'Schwarting, R', 'Stein, H', 'Moelling, K']","['Bading H', 'Gerdes J', 'Schwarting R', 'Stein H', 'Moelling K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Cell Nucleus/analysis', 'Cytoplasm/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'T-Lymphocytes/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1988 Sep;3(3):257-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Max-Planck-Institut fur Molekulare Genetik, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany.']",

It was observed that in the low-grade specimens (where NORs are less frequent than in those of high-grade histology), the AgNOR sites were highly significantly (P less than 0.001) larger than in high-grade NHL. In the low-grade lymphomas, the AgNOR maximum diameter (Dmax) ranged from 0.7 to 1.7 micron 2 (mean 1.11 micron 2) and area ranged from 0.48 to 1.99 micron 2 (mean 1.11 micron 2).

Furthermore, these types of complications may increase after T-cell depleted BMT. We have closely followed six patients with Ph-positive CGL treated with T-cell depleted bone marrow for 169-720 days after BMT. A number of different cytogenetic patterns were found. The first patient, transplanted while in accelerated phase, relapsed at 155 days with the same clonal abnormalities and died in blast crisis. Four other patients were found to have cytogenetic relapses between days +41 and +233. In every case the Ph reappeared along with other clonal and nonclonal abnormalities, some of which were transient.

Recent developments and the potential expansion of the donor pool.,567-70,"Graft versus host disease is a preventable complication of allogenic bone marrow transplantation. A complex biological manoeuvre has enabled us to achieve this. Unfortunately T-cell depletion of the donor marrow shifts the delicate immunological balance in favour of the recipient immune system. The consequence has been an increased risk of graft rejection and leukaemia relapse. It is necessary to shift this balance back in favour of the donor (derived) immune system. This can be achieved by increasing the immunosuppressive power of the 'conditioning' chemoradiotherapy. Toxicity considerations limit our scope although single fraction fast dose rate radiotherapy appears to diminish the risks inherent with T-cell depletion. Logically an approach with greater promise will be to use specific immunological means of eliminating the recipient T lymphocytes in vivo. Early experience with a monoclonal anti-lymphoid antibody in vivo in an HLA matched unrelated donor programme suggests that this approach has great promise whilst lacking toxicity. We hypothesise that a shift in immunological superiority to the donor derived immune system will not only allow T-cell depletion whilst minimising the risk of graft rejection, but also enhance the anti-leukaemic properties of the graft. Of further interest will be the potential for application of lymphokines (e.g. IL2) without increasing the risk of lethal graft versus host disease.","['Prentice, H G', 'Brenner, M K', 'McGovern, M']","['Prentice HG', 'Brenner MK', 'McGovern M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Host vs Graft Reaction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Recurrence', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02841868809093589 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 1988;27(5):567-70. doi: 10.3109/02841868809093589.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Bone Marrow Transplant Programme, Royal Free Hospital and Medical School, Hampstead, England.']",

The blood disease was a chronic myelomonocytic dysmyelopoiesis which was discovered during the eruption and resulted in the patient's death within a few months, probably through acutization. The skin lesions were atypical, bullous and ulcerated. On this occasion, the international literature concerning all cases of Sweet's syndrome associated with malignant or premalignant hemopathies is reviewed. Several concepts emerge from this study: the association is frequent (about 20 p. 100 of all published cases of Sweet's syndrome); there is a strong predominance of granulocytic hemopathies over lymphoplasmocytic and monocytic hemopathies; the blood disease is revealed by the skin eruption in some 50 p. 100 of the patients; there are frequent chronological relations between Sweet's syndrome and the events that occur in the course of the hemopathy; finally, the association is usually of poor prognosis. A comparison with Sweet's syndrome unassociated with a blood disease showed only three significant points: the frequency of bullous lesions, of the initial anaemia (the most important element) and of extreme figures in leucocyte counts (leucopenia or major hyperleukocytosis). The atypical character of the skin lesions in the patient presented here incites to discuss the nosological relationship between Sweet's syndrome and bullous pyoderma, an entity closely associated with hemopathies. It has recently been suggested by several authors that this anatomico-clinical kinship should be turned into a wide spectrum of acute neutrophilic dermatoses, with typical Sweet's syndrome at one end and Pyoderma gangrenosum at the other end. The interface between this spectrum and haemopathies seems to be maximum at its intermediate stage: the bullous and superficially ulcerated lesions. The aetiology and pathogenesis of this new nosological entity are uncertain. The presence of chemoattractants or of polymorphonuclear cell abnormalities is still open to discussion. The relationship between the entity and leukocytoclastic vasculitis has recently been questioned.","['Dereure, O', 'Guillot, B', 'Barneon, G', 'Zabarino, P', 'Guilhou, J J']","['Dereure O', 'Guillot B', 'Barneon G', 'Zabarino P', 'Guilhou JJ']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Fever/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*complications', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', '*Neutrophils', 'Skin Diseases, Vesiculobullous/*complications/etiology/pathology', 'Syndrome']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 1988;115(6-7):689-701.,,,83,,Dermatoses aigues febriles a neutrophiles et hemopathies malignes: presentation d'un nouveau cas bulleux et revue de la litterature.,,,,,,,,,"['Service de Dermatologie-Phlebologie, Hopital Saint-Charles, Montpellier.']",

In the present study, cultured myeloid leukemia HL60 cells, directly sampled bone marrow cells, and peripheral blood neutrophils were exposed to 1-5 microM monensin for 0.5-20 hours. The effects were evaluated using ultrastructural, cytochemical, and biochemical methods. In HL60 cells and marrow promyelocytes treated with monensin, progressive vacuolation of the trans then the cis Golgi was observed. These vacuoles lacked diaminobenzidine (DAB) reactive peroxidase, high iron diamine (HID) reactive sulfated glycoconjugates, and periodate-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate (PA-TCH-SP) reactive vicinal glycol containing complex carbohydrates, but some cis Golgi elements retained osmium zinc iodide reactive reducing groups. The number of normal intensely stained HID reactive granules decreased and an incomplete granule that was DAB-positive/HID-negative, PA-TCH-SP-negative with flocculent matrix density increased in frequency as a function of time and concentration of monensin. Treatment of HL60 cells with monensin markedly reduced 35SO4 incorporation but myeloperoxidase labeling and activity per cell remained constant, although it shifted to lower density granule fractions consistent with the persistent DAB staining of endoplasmic reticulum and synthesis of a DAB-positive, HID-negative granule in intact HL60 cells. The Golgi complex of monensin-treated myelocytes and segmented neutrophils was also vacuolated. A subpopulation of preformed primary granules in promyelocytes, myelocytes, and segmented neutrophils appeared to increase in size and peripheral or central electron lucency.

A 37-year-old woman suffering from Glanzmann's thrombasthenia has been regularly seen since 1955. Characteristically (and in contrast to the first description by Glanzmann!) persistently prolonged bleeding times were noted. Clot retraction is severely diminished and the platelets fail to aggregate upon various stimuli. (Platelet agglutination upon addition of ristocetin to platelet rich plasma is normal.) The diagnosis of thrombasthenia was confirmed by demonstration of a deficiency of the membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex. In recent years the patient has become refractory to platelet transfusion therapy, a response shown to be due to antibodies against GPIIb/IIIa in the plasma. Spontaneous bleeding tendency has appeared to improve over the years. 2. Two patients with proliferation of B-lymphocytes are presented. a) Splenomegaly and an increase of B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood were detected in a 45-year-old asymptomatic man. DNA analysis suggested that polyclonal proliferation of B-lymphocytes was present. Diagnostic considerations are discussed. b) In a 46-year-old male patient with subacute aleukemic leukemia of a pre-B-cell type diagnosed in 1981, the disease showed an unexpectedly benign course: after initial mild chemotherapy the patient has remained in a stable condition while off cytotoxic treatment for the last two years. Nevertheless, besides anemia necessitating regular transfusions, persistent agranulocytosis is present which is not explained by bone marrow infiltration. In vitro experiments suggest suppression of myelopoiesis by cellular interaction with leukemic cells or a deficiency of growth factors causing agranulocytosis. 3. An 81-year-old man showed signs and symptoms of lead intoxication which proved to be due to oral ingestion of a lead-containing ointment.","['Bucher, U']",['Bucher U'],['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bleeding Time', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/*blood', 'Cell Division', 'Clot Retraction', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lead Poisoning/*blood', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/deficiency', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Thrombasthenia/*blood']",1988/10/22 00:00,1988/10/22 00:01,['1988/10/22 00:00'],"['1988/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1988 Oct 22;118(42):1510-27.,,,40,,"Ungewohnliches bei Thrombasthenie Glanzmann; Proliferation von B-Lymphozyten, Bleivergiftung.",,,,,,,,,"['Hamatologisches Zentrallabor, Universitat Bern.']",

Cellular genes induced by Tax include those encoding the alpha subunit of the high-affinity interleukin 2 receptor (Tac), interleukin 2, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Tax induction of the interleukin 2 gene is synergistically amplified by mitogens that augment cytoplasmic levels of calcium. These changes in the pattern of cellular gene expression reflect a specific action of Tax, as they are undetectable in isogenically matched control cell lines expressing antisense tax cDNA. The spectrum of cellular genes regulated by Tax appears to be restricted: several other T-cell genes, either inducibly or constitutively expressed, are unaffected by this viral protein.

Effect of recombinant cytokines on leukemic B cell proliferation.,50S-56S,"Proliferation and differentiation of B lymphocytes is influenced by a variety of soluble mediators. The recent cloning of various cytokines has made it possible to study the effect of molecularly defined lymphokines and other cytokines on B-cell activation. In the present study, we have analyzed the effect of several cytokines on the in vitro proliferation of highly purified leukemic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The recombinant human cytokines tested included interleukins 1, 2, 3, and 4 tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-alpha (IFN alpha), all of which are known to play a role in B-cell activation. B cells from 10 of 13 patients (all with white blood cell counts greater than 100,000/ul) did not respond to any of the cytokines tested. In contrast, B cells from 3 other patients responded well to IL-2 when preactivated for 24 h with phorbolester TPA and ionomycin. Moreover, preactivated B cells from 2 of these patients also proliferated in response to TNF-alpha, and some proliferation of unactivated B cells in response to TNF-alpha was seen in one case. Together, these results stress the clonal heterogeneity of CLL B-cell populations, and demonstrate that both IL-2 and TNF-alpha may act as a B-cell growth factor on B cells from certain CLL patients.","['Nerl, C', 'Janssen, O', 'Kabelitz, D']","['Nerl C', 'Janssen O', 'Kabelitz D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Dec;2(12 Suppl):50S-56S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Hematology, Stadtisches Krankenhaus Schwabing, Munchen, FRG.']",

Even at the subclinical stage of the disease the marker should be present. The effect of therapy should be monitored and relapses noted. Thus high standards of methodology are required. There are many substances that may indicate a malignant process in the central nervous system. However, there are many pitfalls in their determination. Malignant cells may occur in CSF via processes involving leptomeningeal structures such as metastases and leukaemia, but primary brain tumours seldom show cells in CSF. Human chorionic gonadotrophin and alpha-fetoprotein determinations assist in the early detection of cerebral germ cell tumours and of relapses, even in the subclinical stage. Desmosterol may aid in the diagnosis of medulloblastomas and malignant gliomas and in monitoring therapy. Putrescine levels are elevated in CSF of patients with medulloblastoma and correlate with the clinical state, and serial analyses may reveal relapses. Fibronectin, when determined in CSF at the time of diagnosis, appears to be of great significance for the prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Multivariate proportional hazards regression models were used to determine disease-related and transplant-related factors associated with posttransplant mortality and relapse. The projected 5-year survival rate was estimated at 18% by the product-limit method. The major causes of death were interstitial pneumonia, infection, and relapse. Splenomegaly at initial diagnosis and longer time interval from diagnosis to transplant were associated with decreased overall survival and event-free survival. Sixteen patients have relapsed between 17 and 1,569 days (median, 486) posttransplant. The use of T-cell-depleted marrow and older age of the donor or recipient were associated with an increased probability of leukemic relapse. Ten of the 16 relapses occurred among the 15 patients who received T-cell-depleted marrow. The actuarial relapse risk 2.5 years posttransplant was 100% in patients administered T-cell-depleted marrow as compared with 25% in patients administered unmodified marrow. The data in this report emphasize the increased risks and relatively poor results that occur when marrow transplantation is deferred until after signs of acceleration appear. When compared with results for patients who received transplants during chronic phase, the poor results seen here in patients administered unmodified marrow stem primarily from increased transplant-related mortality rather than increased relapse risk. The strikingly increased relapse rate associated with the use of T-cell depletion would discourage its use for graft-v-host disease prevention in patients who receive transplants for CML.","['Martin, P J', 'Clift, R A', 'Fisher, L D', 'Buckner, C D', 'Hansen, J A', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Doney, K C', 'Sullivan, K M', 'Witherspoon, R P', 'Storb, R']","['Martin PJ', 'Clift RA', 'Fisher LD', 'Buckner CD', 'Hansen JA', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Doney KC', 'Sullivan KM', 'Witherspoon RP', 'Storb R', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82157-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Dec;72(6):1978-84.,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",

We have previously shown that transferrin-gallium (Tf-Ga) inhibits cellular iron incorporation. In the present study, Tf-Ga-induced inhibition of HL60 cell growth and upregulation of Tf receptor density was reversed with hemin. Cells exposed to 2 mumol/L Tf-Ga for six hours or longer displayed a diminution in the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy signal of the tyrosyl radical of the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. The effect of Tf-Ga on the ESR signal was reversed by hemin. Tf-Ga decreased the incorporation of 14C-adenosine into DNA and decreased intracellular deoxyribonucleotide pools, with the maximum diminution seen in deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) pools. Exposure of cells to combinations of Tf-Ga and hydroxyurea (a known inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase) resulted in a marked inhibition of cell growth that was consistent with drug synergy. Our studies suggest that Tf-Ga inhibits DNA synthesis through action on the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and that combinations of Ga and hydroxyurea should be further evaluated in in vivo tumor models.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Matthaeus, W G', 'Antholine, W E', 'Graff, K', ""O'Brien, W J""]","['Chitambar CR', 'Matthaeus WG', 'Antholine WE', 'Graff K', ""O'Brien WJ""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gallium/*pharmacology', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transferrin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82151-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Dec;72(6):1930-6.,,['CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['Blood. 1989 Aug 1;74(2):887-8.

The 67 boys and 34 girls with T-ALL were 1 month to 18 years old (median, 8 years) with leukocyte counts ranging from 2 to 810 x 10(9)/L (median, 55 x 10(9)/L). Eighteen of these patients were black, and 70 had a mediastinal mass. Twenty-six boys and five girls with a median age of 9 years (range, 1 to 20 years) had T-NHL. Seven of these patients were black, and 24 had a mediastinal mass. The distributions of thymocyte developmental stages (early [CD7+], intermediate [CD1+ and/or CD4+ and/or CD8+], and mature [CD3+]) in cases of T-ALL and T-NHL were significantly different: 34%, 43%, and 23% v 6%, 62%, and 32% (P = .02). A comparison of the patients' clinical features according to the maturational stage of thymocytes failed to disclose significant differences in the majority of characteristics studied. However, patients with mature-stage T-NHL, with or without the addition of subjects with mature-stage T-ALL, were less likely to have a mediastinal mass (P = .02 for both comparisons). Those with intermediate-stage T-cell malignancy (T-ALL and T-NHL combined) were the subgroup most likely to have a mediastinal mass (P = .01). Response to remission induction therapy was significantly worse in the T-ALL subgroup with an early-stage phenotype: a failure rate of 21% v 0% and 6% for the two more differentiated phenotypic subgroups (P = .007). Event-free survival was not affected by thymocyte maturational stage in cases of either T-ALL or T-NHL. Despite evidence of clinical heterogeneity among the maturational stages of T-cell malignancies in children, these developmental subdivisions do not appear to be critical determinants of outcome once remission is achieved. We conclude that such phenotypes need not be included in the stratification plans for clinical trials using common induction treatment.","['Crist, W M', 'Shuster, J J', 'Falletta, J', 'Pullen, D J', 'Berard, C W', 'Vietti, T J', 'Alvarado, C S', 'Roper, M A', 'Prasthofer, E', 'Grossi, C E']","['Crist WM', 'Shuster JJ', 'Falletta J', 'Pullen DJ', 'Berard CW', 'Vietti TJ', 'Alvarado CS', 'Roper MA', 'Prasthofer E', 'Grossi CE']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Monitoring, Immunologic', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*pathology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82145-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Dec;72(6):1891-7.,,"['CA-15989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,"[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",

These quantities do not necessarily approximate one another, and the etiologic fraction is not generally estimable without strong biologic assumptions. For these reasons, care is needed in deciding which (if any) of the concepts is appropriate for a particular application. It appears that the excess fraction (like incidence proportion) will be most relevant in situations that require only consideration of whether disease occurs by a particular time. In situations that require consideration of when disease occurs, direct measures of effect on incidence time may be as relevant as or more relevant than any attributable fraction. To avoid technical complications, we have not discussed additional problems of causal attribution that can arise when exposure has multiple levels or is sustained over time, and the estimation problems that can arise when considering case-control studies, competing risks, or differential censoring.

Direct nucleotide sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction products showed that the mutations involved a G----A transition in five of the six cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia. In four cases the mutations seemed to occur in only a fraction of the neoplastic cells, and one case displayed two distinct NRAS mutations, most likely present in two distinct cell populations. These results indicate the following: (i) RAS oncogenes are not found in all types of human malignancies, (ii) significant differences in the frequency of RAS mutations can be found among subtypes of neoplasms derived from the same tissue, (iii) in lymphoid neoplasms the NRAS mutation correlates with the most undifferentiated acute lymphocytic leukemia phenotype, and (iv) NRAS mutations present in only a fraction of malignant cells may result from either the selective loss or the acquisition of mutated alleles during tumor development.","['Neri, A', 'Knowles, D M', 'Greco, A', 'McCormick, F', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Neri A', 'Knowles DM', 'Greco A', 'McCormick F', 'Dalla-Favera R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Codon)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Codon', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.85.23.9268 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Dec;85(23):9268-72. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.23.9268.,PMC282720,"['CA 37165/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37295/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, NY 10016.']",

It appears, moreover, that even with 2 or 3 inductions courses, the more intensive the chemotherapy regimen in previously non-treated patients, the higher the peak of PB CFU-GM and the better the collection of CSC. The measurement of CFU-GM is certainly a less effective indicator of pluripotent stem cells in blood than in bone marrow, and it is probably necessary, but sufficient, to inject 5 times more CFU-GM than normally injected in marrow transplants to allow prompt and stable engraftment.

Investigations of chromosome translocations in B and T cell lymphomas and in chronic myelogenous leukemia have demonstrated the effects on protooncogenes of transposition within the genome, with or without structural change in the gene. These studies have also provided evidence for many previously unidentified human oncogenes. Similarly, the recognition through cytogenetics of gene amplification units in aggressive forms of certain tumors has helped to define another important type of somatic genetic change in neoplasia, again involving both known and previously unknown oncogenes. The observation of nonrandom chromosomal deletions in other malignancies has contributed to the delineation of an additional major class of tumorigenic genes, called suppressor genes, which appear to have a significant role in inherited malignancies and are now being actively sought in many common cancers. Finally, chromosome studies have helped to demonstrate the clonal nature of most neoplasms and the importance, in tumor progression, of sequential somatic genetic changes within the neoplastic clone. This latter phenomenon appears to depend primarily on acquired genetic lability in the tumor cell population. Karyotypic data are providing leads to its basis, as well as to the significance in carcinogenesis of constitutional chromosomal fragility and of specific fragile sites within the genome of different individuals.","['Nowell, P C', 'Croce, C M']","['Nowell PC', 'Croce CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.2.15.3056765 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 1988 Dec;2(15):3054-60. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.2.15.3056765.,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",

Flow-cytofluorimetry measurements of DNA content and BrdU incorporation allowed for a precise determination of the variations of the cell cycle parameters. Cells underwent a transient arrest in both G1 and G2 + M between 6 to 16 h of induction. The progression of the cells through S phase seems not to be affected during this period. After this time cells escaped from G1 and reentered the S phase. We described previously [S. Khochbin et al. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 200, 55-64], that p53 decreased continuously during the induction of MELC and remained at a steady-state level after 18 to 20 h of induction. In order to look for a possible redistribution of the protein along the cell cycle during the induction process, we measured the accumulation of the protein along the cell cycle. In noninduced cells there were four steps in the accumulation of the protein throughout the cell cycle: the amount of p53 was constant during G1 and it increased as cells progressed through S phase, which is characterized by an increased accumulation at the G1/S transition and a more moderate accumulation during progression through the rest of the S phase. A constant level in G2/M, approximately twice that obtained in G1, was achieved. There was no change in this distribution that correlated with the various modifications of the cell cycle in induced cells. It seems then, that p53 is associated neither with the progression of the cells in the S phase nor with the resumption of the DNA synthesis after the G1 block.","['Khochbin, S', 'Chabanas, A', 'Lawrence, J J']","['Khochbin S', 'Chabanas A', 'Lawrence JJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0014-4827(88)90294-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1988 Dec;179(2):565-74. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(88)90294-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Unite INSERM 309, Departement de Recherche Fondamentale, CEN-Grenoble, France.']",

At about half of the maximal population density the long interspersed repetitive DNA element (L1Rn) is suddenly transcriptionally activated without any obvious exogenous reason. Population growth is then inhibited and, within about 24 h after reaching the maximal density, the population undergoes programmed death (apoptosis). Suicidal cell death is caused by sudden incorporation, apparently by retroposition via an RNA intermediate, of about 300,000 copies of the L1Rn element into random locations in the cell genome, thus creating lethal mutations. The preceding growth inhibition is associated with repression, to an undetectable level, of c-Ki-ras expression. Up to the point of massive L1Rn incorporation and cell death, all phenomena are quickly reversible by subculturing; medium change alone is not sufficient. Biological implications of these surprising findings are discussed.","['Servomaa, K', 'Rytomaa, T']","['Servomaa K', 'Rytomaa T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Tissue Kinet,Cell and tissue kinetics,0174107,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, ras', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Rats', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1988.tb00769.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Kinet. 1988 Jan;21(1):33-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1988.tb00769.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Laboratory of Radiobiology, Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Helsinki.']",

Subsequent clinical trials were carried out to clarify this relationship and to determine whether post-transplant immunosuppression could have an effect on graft durability. Two factors were found to be associated with graft failure. Patients with hematologic malignancy given a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and 15.75 Gy fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) had a 27% cumulative incidence of graft failure, which was less than the 69% incidence seen previously in patients given cyclophosphamide and 12.0 Gy fractionated TBI (p less than 0.05, log-rank test). Patients with acute leukemia had a higher risk of graft failure than patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (p less than 0.005). The incidence of graft failure was not influenced by post-transplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine, methotrexate or a combination of cyclosporine plus methotrexate or by the omission of all post-transplant immunosuppression. Similarly, graft failure was not associated with the complement lot used for marrow treatment, the recovery of BFU-E or CFU-GM, or with the number of nucleated cells or T cells in the graft. The effect of primary diagnosis and the inverse relationship between the amount of pretransplant TBI and the graft failure rate suggest that a host factor may have been involved in a presumably immune-mediated rejection. This observation further leads to the inference that certain T cells present in donor marrow can suppress host immunity or help to maintain function of the graft.","['Martin, P J', 'Hansen, J A', 'Torok-Storb, B', 'Durnam, D', 'Przepiorka, D', ""O'Quigley, J"", 'Sanders, J', 'Sullivan, K M', 'Witherspoon, R P', 'Deeg, H J']","['Martin PJ', 'Hansen JA', 'Torok-Storb B', 'Durnam D', 'Przepiorka D', ""O'Quigley J"", 'Sanders J', 'Sullivan KM', 'Witherspoon RP', 'Deeg HJ', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1988 Sep;3(5):445-56.,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",

One of the methods of purging involves the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed to antigens expressed on the surface of leukemia cells. Several mAbs lend themselves to this use because of their high degree of reactivity with leukemia cells and their lack of reactivity with normal pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. Candidate mAbs include those directed to the CD14, CD15, and CD33 molecules. This review focuses on the pre-clinical data concerning the use of mAbs to these antigens and on the results of on-going clinical trials of ABMT using mAb-mediated purging.","['Ball, E D']",['Ball ED'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1988 Sep;3(5):387-92.,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire.']",

These phenomena are: (1) the response of T cells within the donor marrow allograft to recipient alloantigen, resulting in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with its attendant morbidity and mortality; and (2) the response of recipient cells which have survived the ablative conditioning regimen against alloantigen borne by the donor marrow allograft, leading to failure of alloengraftment. While T cell depletion of donor marrow has successfully reduced the incidence of severe GVHD, this reduction has been associated with an increased incidence of failure of alloengraftment. In this communication we review several recent approaches being studied in animal models in our laboratory to avoid such undesirable effects of host-anti-donor and donor-anti-host alloaggression. The first approach is based on the observation that administration of T cell-depleted (TCD) syngeneic bone marrow (BM) appears to limit GVHD while still permitting engraftment by co-administered non-TCD allogeneic BM. This anti-GVH effect of TCD syngeneic marrow can be enhanced by delaying the administration of allogeneic BM by 8 days following whole body irradiation and syngeneic BMT. Evidence that natural suppressor cells derived from syngeneic marrow may be responsible for this phenomenon is reviewed. We also present evidence for the existence of a non-stem cell bone marrow subpopulation, distinct from those T cells which cause GVHD, which is capable of increasing levels of allogeneic chimerism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Sykes, M', 'Sharabi, Y', 'Sachs, D H']","['Sykes M', 'Sharabi Y', 'Sachs DH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Experimental/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1988 Sep;3(5):379-86.,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,"['Transplantation Biology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",

Nearly 90% can expect to attain an initial remission and the majority of those will remain disease-free. There is increasing concern about the long-term consequences of ALL and its treatment on the psychological adjustment of the survivor. This article selectively reviews the available literature on the neuropsychological and psychosocial adjustment of long-term survivors of ALL. The risk of neuropsychologic deficiencies among children who have remained in continuous remission has been the focus of conflicting findings, while the risk among those who have survived CNS relapse is clearly elevated. Generally, long-term survivors of childhood cancer have a 30-40% risk of school-related problems. Moreover, children treated for ALL with cranial irradiation have 3-4 times the risk of school problems relative to those who are not irradiated.

On relationship of GVHD and the long term survival, the probability of 5 years survival was 38%, 47% and 25% in grade 0, I and II-IV of acute GVHD respectively. The difference might be due to that of relapse rate of leukemia.

The final 12 months of treatment for both groups was MP and oral MTX; all patients received intrathecal MTX every 12 weeks. With a median follow-up of 5 years, complete remission durations have been significantly longer among children treated with HDMTX, compared with RTSC (P = .049) or historical institutional control regimens (P = .002). Approximately 67% of the patients receiving HDMTX and 56% of those receiving RTSC are expected to be in continuous complete remission at 4 years. Overall, isolated CNS relapse rates were similar (P = .17) in the two treatment groups, although by newer risk criteria cranial irradiation could be expected to provide better protection in patients with an unfavorable prognosis. These findings indicate that addition of intermittent HDMTX infusions to conventional chemotherapy is an effective method for extending complete remissions in children with ALL.","['Abromowitch, M', 'Ochs, J', 'Pui, C H', 'Kalwinsky, D', 'Rivera, G K', 'Fairclough, D', 'Look, A T', 'Hustu, H O', 'Murphy, S B', 'Evans, W E']","['Abromowitch M', 'Ochs J', 'Pui CH', 'Kalwinsky D', 'Rivera GK', 'Fairclough D', 'Look AT', 'Hustu HO', 'Murphy SB', 'Evans WE', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Random Allocation', 'Teniposide/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950160502 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1988;16(5):297-303. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950160502.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,"[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",

Recent seroprevalence studies in the United States suggest that there are about 50,000 infected individuals. The identification of 5 individuals with HTLV-I-associated leukemia/lymphoma referred to our center with relatively limited screening methods suggests that these disorders are more common than currently appreciated. Though 99% of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this virus may cause immunosuppression, lymphomas, or myelopathy. The lymphomas have been classified as acute or chronic forms of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). Acute ATLL is a T cell form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an HTLV-I-infected individual with leukemia, skin infiltration, or hypercalcemia. This disorder is poorly responsive to chemotherapy and all patients should be referred for experimental protocols. Chronic ATLL is an insidious disease characterized by lymphadenopathy, skin infiltration of less than 10% of the body surface, and/or atypical lymphocytes with highly convoluted nuclei which include 1 to 10% of the nucleated cells in the peripheral blood, but no visceral involvement or hypercalcemia. The prognosis of these patients is not clearly defined. All individuals with mature T lymphocytic malignancies should be evaluated with HTLV-I-specific assays. The most sensitive and specific assays available include the enzyme linked immunoadsorbent antibody assay (ELISA) and the polymerase chain DNA amplification reaction assay. With improved laboratory techniques and greater awareness of the characteristics of this disease by clinicians, it is likely that the natural history of HTLV-I infection will be better defined, and improvements in therapeutic management will be developed.","['Ratner, L', 'Poiesz, B J']","['Ratner L', 'Poiesz BJ']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'United States']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005792-198811000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1988 Nov;67(6):401-22. doi: 10.1097/00005792-198811000-00004.,,"['AI24745/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI25903/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",234,,,,,,,,,,,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",

In addition, a 10 fold increase in the number of colony forming units in cultures (CFU-C) was found in the leukemic spleen indicating a shift in hematopoiesis from the bone marrow (BM) to the spleen. The low levels of IL-2 found in the conditioned medium of Concanavalin A (Con A) activated leukemic spleen cells could not result from active consumption of IL-2 by the cells, pointing to a genuine defect in IL-2 production. This failure of IL-2 secretion could be partially overcome by the addition of phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) to the cells but not by the addition of IL-1.

Of the 68 evaluable patients, the major response rate was 75%, with 13% complete responses (CRs) and 62% partial responses (PRs). An additional eleven patients (16%) had minor responses (MRs). Duration of response was denoted as failure-free survival (FFS), defined as the time from the end of IFN therapy to a need for further antileukemic therapy. Of the 60 responding patients followed after discontinuation of IFN, 27 have relapsed, requiring further therapy. The median actuarial FFS for these 60 patients is 25.4 months. All but five patients are alive, and the actuarial overall survival for the 69 patients is 91% +/- 4% at 4 years from the start of IFN.

After drug selection, greater than 90% of the growing cells expressed nuclear SV-40 large T cells and a fraction of these contained the astrocyte-specific marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein. The majority of these cells also expressed surface marker A4 (specific for neural tube derivatives), Ran 2, p185 (the 185-kD phosphoprotein product of the neu oncogene), and fibronectin, but did not express the astrocyte enzymes glutamine synthetase and monoamine oxidase B. Surface markers characteristic of glial progenitors (A2B5) and oligodendrocytes (galactocerebroside) were not detected. After two rounds of cell cloning, subclone A7.6-3 expressed Ran 2, fibronectin, and the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) but not glial fibrillary acidic protein and A4. The A7 cell line and subclones also displayed certain functions of type 1 astrocytes: the conditioned medium of these cells had a potent mitogenic activity for glial progenitor cells which could be neutralized by anti-platelet-derived growth factor antibodies and monolayers of these cells supported the growth of embryonic hypothalamic neurons. We conclude that a retrovirus containing SV-40 large T antigen can immortalize rat CNS cells and that such immortalized glial cells retain at least two important functions of type 1 astrocytes: the ability to secrete platelet-derived growth factor and to support the growth of embryonic CNS neurons. Moreover, such stable immortalized clonal cell lines can be used to study gene regulation in glial cells.","['Geller, H M', 'Dubois-Dalcq, M']","['Geller HM', 'Dubois-Dalcq M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/*genetics', 'Astrocytes/immunology/microbiology/physiology', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Mitogens/metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Neurons/*immunology/microbiology/physiology', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.107.5.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1988 Nov;107(5):1977-86. doi: 10.1083/jcb.107.5.1977.,PMC2115320,['NS-25168/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Biology, University College, London, England.']",

The evidence for carcinogenicity of benzene in humans was evaluated by the IARC in 1982 as follows: ""It is established that human exposure to commercial benzene or benzene-containing mixtures can cause damage to the haematopoietic system, including pancytopenia. The relationship between benzene exposure and the development of acute myelogenous leukaemia has been established in epidemiological studies. ""Reports linking exposure to benzene with other malignancies were considered to be inadequate for evaluation. ""There is sufficient evidence that benzene is carcinogenic to man."" This evaluation now warrants some elaboration and updating. While the epidemiological evidence concerning benzene carcinogenicity is strongest for acute myelocytic leukaemia, there is some limited evidence of increased risks of chronic myeloid and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In addition, recent studies have suggested an increased risk of multiple myeloma, while others indicate a dose-related increase for total lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms. Corroborative evidence for such a generalized effect comes from experimental studies showing that exposure to benzene depresses all lympho-haematopoietic cell lines. While only limited evidence of benzene carcinogenicity in experimental animals exists, the recent findings of the National Toxicology Program (NTP, 1984) in the U.S.A. and Maltoni et al. (1985) strongly indicate that benzene is an experimental carcinogen. Toluene and xylene. While no direct human evidence is available, there is recent evidence of carcinogenicity of toluene and xylene at high concentrations in experimental animals. It should also be noted that any future epidemiological observations of cancer risks associated with toluene or xylene would have to take account of the suspected effects of benzene impurities.","['McMichael, A J']",['McMichael AJ'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Xylenes)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', '*Carcinogens, Environmental', 'Chromosomes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Toluene/*toxicity', 'Xylenes/*toxicity']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1988;(85):3-18.,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Community Medicine, University of Adelaide, South Australia.']",

Prevention of GVHD has been tried by treatment after the transplant or treating the marrow (lymphocyte depletion). Cyclosporine (CsA) or CsA plus methotrexate has reduced acute GVHD but not chronic GVHD. Marrow has been treated with monoclonal antibodies and lectins or elutriated to decrease numbers of T lymphocytes. Some studies have been effective, but the majority have shown an increased number of rejections or leukemic relapses. Apart from teratogenic effects, thalidomide has minimal toxicity. It effectively prevents and treats acute and chronic GVHD in rodent models. Clinical trials will soon begin.

So it is with hematopoietic tissue wherein dysplasia of bone marrow cells can be an early sign of impending acute myeloid leukemia. Although this 'preleukemic syndrome' of hematopoietic dysplasia can often be identified well in advance of the classic histological signs of acute leukemia, a wide variety of basic studies on bone marrow cells, from patients and from experimental animals with induced preleukemia, clearly indicate that the preleukemic marrow cells are members of a fully established neoplastic clone. Consequently, it is likely that the preleukemic syndrome is merely acute leukemia diagnosed earlier than usual and which, in some patients, can be very slowly progressive, and in others may not progress at all. This article reviews the evidence in support of the notion that the preleukemic syndrome is an 'early leukemia', places the preleukemic syndrome in the context of a larger group of myelodysplastic disorders, reviews the laboratory studies of value for both diagnosis and for use in the assessment of prognosis, and summarizes the therapeutic options available for the management of patients with this disorder.","['Bagby, G C']",['Bagby GC'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Humans', 'Preleukemia/diagnosis/*therapy']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(88)90025-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(88)90025-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1988 Sep;2(3):194-205. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(88)90025-2.,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,"['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland.']",

Some criticisms of this codification are presented and other approaches to classification are discussed. Among these are included the potential importance of multiple lineage expression, measurements of cell differentiation using cytochemical criteria, the relevance of isoenzyme biochemistry of leukaemic cell populations, their surface antigenic differences as demonstrated by the use of monoclonal antibodies and the growing contribution of cytogenetics. The development and complexity of combined classifications which attempt to incorporate most of these features is illustrated.

Although its accepted use over the last 40 years has been in the prevention and treatment of infection its widest and, arguably, most important application has been in the prevention of Rhesus haemolytic disease of the newborn. However, the development over the last decade of a number of safe and effective immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous use has allowed its more widespread utilisation in clinically appropriate settings. It is now widely accepted that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIgG) is indicated, on a repeat basis, as treatment of choice as replacement therapy for patients with primary antibody deficiency. It may also be effective, in the non-immune deficient patient, in the management of certain bacterial as well as viral infections. This is particularly the case in the pre-term neonate but may have an application in the infected intensive care patient. The benefit in these patient groups has led to a re-evaluation of the use of immunoglobulin replacement therapy in the severe secondary antibody deficiency states associated with such haematological conditions as multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These are currently the subject of randomised, controlled studies. The observation that the use of IV IgG may be associated with effects other than passive transfer of antibody were first made by Imbach in Switzerland. While treating children with immunodeficiency he noticed that two with a coincident immune thrombocytopenia had a rapid platelet increment in close association with the immunoglobulin infusion. He subsequently confirmed that this was a rapid and predictable form of therapy in childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and that in some children it appeared to affect the natural history of the disease. Since these initial observations the response has been confirmed in both children and adults and extended to other immune-based haematological disorders.","['Newland, A C']",['Newland AC'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive/*methods', 'Injections, Intravenous']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(88)90021-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(88)90021-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1988 Sep;2(3):157-67. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(88)90021-5.,,,77,,,,,,,,,,,"['London Hospital, Whitechapel, UK.']",

The first 36 patients received a preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, 60 mg/kg/d (days -6 and -5), and 750 cGy single-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) (day -1). Subsequently, 37 patients received cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d (days -6 and -5), and 165 cGy fractionated TBI administered twice daily for a total dose of 1,320 cGy (days -4, -3, -2, and -1). Survivors have been followed from 9 to 124 months (median, 40 months). The 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45% to 77%) projected disease-free survival (DFS) of 41 children less than 18 years old does not differ significantly from the 62% (95% CI, 49% to 73%) projected DFS of 32 adults at 84 months (P = .89). Similarly, the 15% (95% CI, 1% to 29%) projected relapse rate seen in children does not differ from the 9% (95% CI, 0% to 21%) seen in adults (P = .69). Multivariate Cox regression analysis of presenting features demonstrates that a presenting WBC count greater than 20,000/m3 is associated with decreased DFS (P = .01). When compared with other French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, presentation with FAB M4 or M5 morphology is significantly associated with relapse in multivariate analysis (P = .014). Other presenting features such as preparation with single-dose or fractionated TBI, interval from diagnosis to CR or CR to BMT, donor or recipient sex, and donor or recipient cytomegalovirus serology do not correlate independently with either DFS or relapse. When included in the stepwise multivariate analysis of presenting patient features, two posttransplant events, development of grades 2 to 4 acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) (P less than .03) and development of interstitial pneumonitis (P less than .001), also correlate independently with poor DFS. Allogeneic BMT provides equivalent, prolonged DFS in both children and young adults when performed in first CR and should be considered the therapy of choice for all first CR patients under 45 years of age with a suitable donor. Continued efforts to prevent and treat acute GVHD and pneumonitis as well as efforts designed to prevent relapse in patients presenting with FAB M4 and M5 morphology should further improve outcome.","['McGlave, P B', 'Haake, R J', 'Bostrom, B C', 'Brunning, R', 'Hurd, D D', 'Kim, T H', 'Nesbit, M E', 'Vercellotti, G M', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Woods, W G']","['McGlave PB', 'Haake RJ', 'Bostrom BC', 'Brunning R', 'Hurd DD', 'Kim TH', 'Nesbit ME', 'Vercellotti GM', 'Weisdorf D', 'Woods WG', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Age Factors', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79232-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Nov;72(5):1512-7.,,['P01 CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",

The optimal timing of the transplant is difficult to determine because of the high peritransplant mortality of 20-35% and the existence of a group of patients who can have the disease controlled by drug treatment for prolonged periods. We have developed a mathematical model implemented with a computer program which calculates lower and upper time limits for the timing of marrow transplantation. The lower time limit for transplantation is derived from the loss of life expectancy with delay, and the upper time limit is calculated by comparing the transplant survival probability with the probability of surviving an additional year without a transplant. Thus, an objective basis is provided for bracketing the most appropriate time for transplantation. This analysis suggests that the decision to transplant can be postponed in some patients for periods longer than may generally be recommended.","['Simon, W', 'Segel, G B', 'Lichtman, M A']","['Simon W', 'Segel GB', 'Lichtman MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Computers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Mathematics', '*Models, Biological', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02430.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Sep;70(1):31-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02430.x.,,"['CA12790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, N.Y.']",

Retinoids modulate the cellular differentiation and proliferation in many types of cells. A series of retinoidal benzoic acids, named retinobenzoic acids, have potent activities on human promyelocytic leukemia cells, HL-60, and other assay systems. Among them, Am80, AM580 and Ch55 are more active than retinoic acid in most cases. As these compounds possess quite different structures or physicochemical properties from retinoic acid or conventional retinoids, they are expected to be applied clinically for the treatments of the diseases in oncology and dermatology. Recently, progresses on the mechanistic studies on retinoidal actions have been reported. One of them is isolation and cloning of human retinoic acid-receptors and the mechanism of retinoidal action was concluded that the retinoid-receptor complex interact directly with DNA to regulate the expression of the gene, like steroid hormone. The other is the establishment of the presence of the retinoid-specific-binding protein (RSBP) by the use of our retinobenzoic acids as the probe.","['Kagechika, H', 'Hashimoto, Y', 'Kawachi, E', 'Shudo, K']","['Kagechika H', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Kawachi E', 'Shudo K']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Disease extent, systemic symptoms, age, sex, and achievement of complete remission lasting longer than 12 months following chemotherapy, as well as certain treatment-related complications (e.g. acute leukemia), constitute the major variables affecting survival. Bulky lymphoma and inadequate primary irradiation are factors which have influence on relapse-free but not necessarily on total survival. Recent reports provide no evidence that minimalizing treatment (except salvage treatment), will demonstrably reduce treatment-related complications. Optimal treatment, giving patients the best chance to enter first durable complete remission, still seems to represent the best strategic approach. However, in given patient subsets, the impact of various treatment strategies on the 5-, 10-, and 15-year results is now being balanced against delayed morbidity, such as organ damage and second malignancies, produced by the intensity of treatment or the prolonged delivery of certain drugs.","['Jotti, G S', 'Bonadonna, G']","['Jotti GS', 'Bonadonna G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Prognosis']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1988 Jul-Aug;8(4):749-59.,,,88,,,,,,,,,,,"['Institute of Anatomy and Pathological Histology, University of Parma School of Medicine, Italy.']",

This study confirms the relationship between plateau-phase disease and light chain isotype suppression (LCIS) and documents an inverse relationship between LCIS and CD38 positive lymphocytes (.001 less than P less than .01), which is similar to the relationship we have described with the expression of CD10 positive lymphocytes. PCA-1 is rarely expressed in the peripheral blood of patients with myeloma and does not fulfill a role as a marker of active vs. stable disease. There is no relationship between the labelling index of plasma cells and LCIS, because many patients can enter a stage of progressive disease and yet have a labelling index of less than 1% at that time, although a labelling index less than 1% is present in the majority of patients with LCIS. beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2M) also fails to differentiate these two phases of disease in myeloma and does not have a relationship with LCIS, CD38 expression, or CD10 expression. These data suggest that myeloma, like chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), can be considered as having two phases of disease: a stable or chronic phase disease, as identified by the presence of LCIS, the absence of CD10 and CD38 positive lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, and a low labelling index, and progressive disease, which is associated with the loss of LCIS and of, CD10 and CD38 positive lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and a high labelling index, although in many cases of progressive disease, the labelling index may also be low. beta 2M does not differentiate between these states.","['Joshua, D E', 'Ioannidis, R', 'Brown, R', 'Francis, S E', 'Gibson, J', 'Kronenberg, H']","['Joshua DE', 'Ioannidis R', 'Brown R', 'Francis SE', 'Gibson J', 'Kronenberg H']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Aged', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*analysis', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Plasma Cells/*immunology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/analysis']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830290103 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1988 Sep;29(1):5-11. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830290103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Department of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",

One case had the phenotype of CFU-E, and in the remaining case of AML-M6 the erythroblasts showed a ""mature"" surface antigenic profile. This immunophenotypic spectrum was unrelated to the morphologic maturity of the erythroblasts. In two cases of CGLBC-E, an early erythroblastic phenotype was observed, while in as many cases a ""mature"" phenotype was present. Four of eight cases, however, revealed a mixed, erythroid plus myeloid phenotype. In one of the four cases, two separate blast populations, which represented erythroblasts and myeloblasts, could be identified.

This new technique makes use of low-density polypropylene beads (density: 0.91) coated with a monoclonal antibody anti-CALLA (antibody ALB2). To ascertain its ability to selectively remove human B/pre-B hematopoietic cells, this technique was applied to normal human bone marrow cell suspensions contaminated with 1-5% of tumor cells. Samples were incubated with the floating beads at 4 degrees C on a rotating wheel for 60 min, followed by a 10-min decantation period, after which the beads bearing the tumor cells floated on the surface, whereas unbound normal marrow cells remained in suspension and were easily recovered free of beads. To demonstrate the feasibility of our method, 2 types of assays were carried out, one using target cell radiolabeled with 111indium, and the other a clonogenic assay. The first assays were to calibrate the different parameters (cellular density, quantity of beads, incubation time) with tumor cell lines: Namalwa (CALLA+) and Molt 4 (CALLA-). These 2 cells lines being able to clone, it is hard to envisage clonogenic assays. In this case, it is very hazardous to evaluate correctly the remaining clonogenic units of Namalwa cells. It is why radiolabelling assays were used for these first experiments. The second assays were to study a model close to the clinical setting and to control the safety of the beads on normal bone marrow cells. In this case, the mixture experiments in which only Namalwa cells were able to clone were evaluated with clonogenic assays, which are more sensitive than radiolabeling assays. A 3- to 4-log reduction of tumor load was achieved with 1-step treatment, and an average of 5-log depletion was obtained by repeating the process twice, as ascertained by the clonogenic assay. Viability, average recovery of nucleated cells, and stem cells potential following the purge were excellent.","['Hirn-Scavennec, J', 'Brailly, H', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Mannoni, P', 'Mawas, C', 'Delaage, M']","['Hirn-Scavennec J', 'Brailly H', 'Maraninchi D', 'Mannoni P', 'Mawas C', 'Delaage M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Plastics)', '0 (Polypropylenes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Microspheres', '*Plastics', '*Polypropylenes', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-198810000-00018 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1988 Oct;46(4):558-63. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198810000-00018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Immunotech, Marseille, France.']",

The spontaneous proliferative activity in cells obtained extempore varied widely. On the basis of this index groups of patients with high proliferative activity (group 1) exceeding the level of thymocyte proliferation and with low proliferative activity (group 2) were distinguished. Direct correlation was revealed between the initial spontaneous proliferative activity and the number of leukocytes as well as with the absolute number of blasts in the blood. A decrease in the initial high proliferative activity in the time course of cultivation was noted in some patients of group 1 (group 1B). In the majority of these patients (91%) the administration of interleukin-2 into the cultural medium prevented a decrease in the proliferative activity. In the other patients of group 1 (group 1A) a high spontaneous proliferative activity was not decreased during cultivation. In group 1A a proliferative response to T-cell growth factor was observed in 36% of patients. The patients' blast cells in group 2 did not respond to this lymphokine.

Numerous phase I trials with first-generation MoAbs have revealed both the broad therapeutic promise of MoAbs in anticancer therapy and the obstacles that must be overcome before they can be utilized fully in the clinical setting. MoAbs can be used to activate or manipulate the patient's immune system to destroy malignant cells. They also can be used as carriers for antitumor agents such as chemotherapeutic compounds, radiation, and toxins. Because many MoAbs are prepared from mouse cells, a common problem has been the development of resistance to the heterologous mouse protein. Strategies to circumvent this resistance include the use of human MoAbs, the production of chimeric mouse-human MoAbs, and the induction of tolerance to the mouse MoAbs. The possibility of combination therapy using MoAbs in conjunction with chemotherapy, lymphokines, or other biological response modifiers also is being explored.","['Houghton, A', 'Scheinberg, D']","['Houghton A', 'Scheinberg D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1988 Jul;25(3 Suppl 3):23-9.,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,"['Division of Medical Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",

With this approach, some otherwise incurable patients can be treated successfully. For most hematologic malignancies (acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and malignant lymphoma), if transplantation is delayed until patients have end-stage disease (drug-resistant relapse) or blast crisis, approximately 10 to 20% of patients can be saved. If transplantation is carried out earlier in the course of disease, the outcome improves considerably. Some of the major limitations of marrow transplantation are the need for an appropriate source of marrow, the severe myelosuppression seen in the immediate posttransplant period, the complications of graft-v-host disease (GVHD), and disease recurrence. The use of autologous marrow and the formation of a national donor registry may make transplantation more widely applicable. The availability of growth factors can hasten hematopoietic recovery, making the immediate posttransplant period safer. New immunosuppressive regimens and T-cell depletion of donor marrow can diminish the impact of GVHD. The need for better preparative regimens persists and has emerged as the major requirement for continued progress in marrow transplantation.","['Appelbaum, F R']",['Appelbaum FR'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0037-1963(88)90066-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1988 Jul;25(3 Suppl 3):16-22.,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",36,,,,,,,,,,,"['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA 98104.']",

The presence of grade II-IV GvHD increased RBC requirements significantly, but not PLT requirements. In addition these patients were dependent on RBC transfusions for significantly longer periods. Only one patient required therapeutic granulocyte transfusions. In a CMV-negative patient with a CMV-negative marrow donor, who died of veno-occlusive disease, cytomegalovirus was transmitted inadvertently by a seropositive PLT concentrate in his final course. Our transfusion strategy included frozen deglycerolized RBC concentrates and single donor PLT concentrates, collected mainly from the marrow donor by a cell separator.

Today more than 50% of children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and about 30% of children with Acute non Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ANLL) can be cured with chemotherapy. The German Group BFM has obtained a significant improvement of results, both in ALL and ANLL using multidrug intensive treatment schedules. In Italy, thanks to the Italian Pediatrics Association of Hematology and Oncology (AIEOP), results have been improved in the last 10 years; very recently, new protocols with the BFM strategy have been started. Allogenic matched bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is indicated in children with ALL in 2nd complete remission (CR) following a relapse during or shortly after discontinuing treatment and in patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. Chemotherapy results remain very poor in these patients. Allogenic BMT in usually performed also in children with ANLL in 1st CR. Autologous BMT, and allogenic BMT mismatched or from unrelated donors are being used with promising results when matched donors are not available.

The analysis presents evidence suggesting that the immune response to leukemia cells exists in a state of balance; this appears to be regulated by the dose of antigen and the state of the cells used to immunize the patients. The injection of high doses of live allogeneic leukemia cells produced a significantly prolonged duration of the first remission in in AML patients. Immunization with high doses of irradiated and dead cells induced some prolongation of the remission phase and survival time, although the percentage of survivors after 3 years was not increased in these groups as compared to non-immunized patients. Immunization by the same route using a 100-fold lower amount of leukemia cells afforded no protection against relapse of the disease during the maintenance phase. A few patients even developed the relapse earlier than did patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Our understanding of the immune responses to malignant cells has increased considerably during the past 2 decades due to various observations. The results obtained with active immunotherapy of the AML patients during the same period agree well with experience from laboratory studies. Thus the results confirm the potential of an immunological interaction between the leukemia cells and the patient. Consequently, it seems likely that the addition of immunotherapy to the treatment of patients with AML might be effective and the tool for maintaining the phase of remission by up-to-date immunological engineering.","['Laursen, M L']",['Laursen ML'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*transplantation']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0306-9877(88)90122-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(88)90122-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 1988 Aug;26(4):221-5. doi: 10.1016/0306-9877(88)90122-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Dept. of Hematology A 2152, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",
