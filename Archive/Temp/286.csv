Only patient C (breast cancer) had received chemotherapy. In all cells studied, L amino acids (1 mM) such as leucine, glutamine, tyrosine, and methionine reduced the cell-to-medium ratio of melphalan at 3 and 35 min. There was a good correlation between the reduction of melphalan transport at 35 min in the heterogeneous nucleated bone marrow cell population by amino acids and their effect on melphalan cytotoxicity in the CFU-C system. Aminoisobutyric acid (A1B), a specific substrate of the A system of amino acid transport, at a concentration between 1 and 50 mM had no significant effect on melphalan uptake at 3 min in any of the human cells studied except those of patient C. At 35 min A1B (10 or 50 mM) significantly reduced the intracellular melphalan concentration in normal bone marrow cells and tumor cells from patients B and C. At 2 mM, 2-aminobicyclo-(2, 2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), a specific substrate of the L system of amino acid transport, reduced the cell-to-medium ratio to 70% of control at 3 and 35 min in human bone marrow cells. In tumor cells from patients A, B, D, and F, 2 mM BCH had no significant effect on melphalan uptake at 3 min; it slightly decreased uptake in tumor cells from patient C. At 35 min, 2 mM BCH significantly reduced melphalan transport in tumor cells from patients C and F only. The lack of a BCH-suppressible component to melphalan uptake into human tumor cells freshly obtained from previously untreated patients contrasts with the presence of this component in murine L1210 leukemia cells, murine P388 leukemia cells, and human tumor cell lines. This suggests that minor differences in melphalan transport may exist amongst species and also between human tumor cells which are freshly obtained and cell lines maintained in culture.",,['R01 CA28984/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1007/BF00257522 [doi]'],,,,,

Exposure of cells in culture to dGuo increased ara-C nucleotide accumulation measured in cell lysate, with an average increase of 386% (range, 242%-537%) of control in the presence of 500 microM dGuo. Maximal elevation occurred after 8 hours of exposure and remained constant through 48 hours. dGuo also enhanced deoxycytidine nucleotide accumulation, but dGuo enhancement favored accumulation of ara-C nucleotides over dCyd nucleotides. In cell cycle kinetic studies using flow cytometry, dGuo slowed accumulation of cells with apparent S-phase DNA content in a concentration-dependent fashion. However, neither the rate nor the magnitude of this effect correlated with the increase in ara-C nucleotide accumulation. Since the increase in ara-C nucleotide accumulation caused by dGuo could be prevented by 5 micrograms/ml of cycloheximide, this process appears to require new protein synthesis. Although these data suggest that the elevation of ara-C nucleotide accumulation caused by dGuo may represent induction of enzyme synthesis, other possibilities are discussed. Exposure of bone marrow blast cells obtained from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia to dGuo for 16 hours in liquid culture also increased ara-C nucleotide accumulation. In six of seven studies, exposure to dGuo in concentrations from 50 to 500 microM increased ara-C nucleotide accumulation from 160% to 3400%.

In many systems, resistance to anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids correlates with a diminished intracellular content of drug. In P388 leukemia and Ehrlich ascites tumor, an active outward transport of anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids occurs. Calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, inhibit this active outward transport and increase intracellular content of vinblastine and anthracyclines in cells resistant to vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines, respectively. We report a phase I trial of vinblastine (1.5 mg/m2 daily as iv continuous infusion X 5 days) in 17 patients and concurrent verapamil in escalating doses. Verapamil was administered as a loading dose (0.02-0.1 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance infusion (0.036-0.18 mg/kg/hour) for 5 1/2 days with continuous cardiac monitoring. There was no apparent augmentation of vinblastine toxicity when vinblastine and verapamil were given concurrently. ECG change was the dose-limiting toxicity. At 0.12 mg/kg/hour, five of nine patients developed first-degree heart block (mean P-R interval, 0.32 seconds; range, 0.23-0.52 seconds). Junctional rhythms were noted in two of 17 patients. Reversible nonspecific T-wave changes were seen in four of 17 patients. Blood pressure and left ventricular ejection fractions (ultrasonic) were not altered. Five of 17 patients had wbc count nadirs less than 2000/mm3, and two of 17 patients had platelet count nadirs less than 100,000/mm3. Four patients experienced neurotoxicity. A mean vinblastine concentration of 2.2 ng/ml (0.55 nM) and a mean verapamil concentration of 290 ng/ml (0.45 microM) were achieved with the concurrent 5-day infusion.

Two isomers of LAA, D-isoascorbic acid and D-ascorbic acid, which have weaker antiscorbutic activity than that of LAA, also produced the L-CFC growth-enhancing effect, but to a lesser degree than that of LAA. A dose-response study also substantiated that D-ascorbic acid was definitely less effective than was LAA. Since D-ascorbic acid is the true optical isomer of LAA and has identical physicochemical properties as does LAA, this differential effect is clearly of biological nature.

Although these previous reports attempted to rule out released drug or endocytosis of drug-support particles as alternative explanations for the observed cytotoxicity, a more thorough analysis is necessary to substantiate fully the cell surface idea. In the present work, the stability of the drug-support linkage was increased by use of cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol as the support and cyanuric chloride or a diazonium salt for attachment of the drug. Different anthracycline orientations were tested by coupling Adriamycin at the amino sugar and carminomycin at the D-ring. The Adriamycin cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol and carminomycin cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol preparations had much lower drug release rates than did the earlier used carbamate-linked Adriamycin cross-linked agarose materials. All three immobilized drug preparations inhibited the growth of L1210 or S180 clones following 2- or 20-h incubation with cells at 37 degrees C.

This plant has been the site of energy related research, including uranium and plutonium reactor technology and radioisotope production. Radiation doses, primarily from gamma rays, were generally low; the median cumulative exposure for workers was 0.16 rems. Historical follow up was conducted for the years 1943-77 and ascertainment of vital status was achieved for 92.3% of the cohort. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed to contrast the subjects' cause specific mortality experience with that of the United States white male population. The observed number of 966 deaths from all causes was 73% of the number expected. Mortality deficits were also seen for arteriosclerotic heart disease (SMR = 0.75; 344 observed) and all cancers (SMR = 0.78; 194 observed). These results are indicative of the healthy worker effect and the favourable influence on health of the cohort's relatively high socioeconomic status. Non-statistically significant raised SMRs were seen for all leukaemias (SMR = 1.49, 16 observed), cancer of the prostate (SMR = 1.16, 14 observed), and Hodgkin's disease (SMR = 1.10, 5 observed). Internal comparisons of mortality (standardised rate ratios, SRRs) were made between subgroups of the cohort according to radiation dose level and duration of employment in various job categories. No consistent gradients of cause specific mortality were detected for radiation exposure. Leukaemia mortality was highest among workers with greater than or equal to 10 years employment in engineering (SRR = 2.40) and maintenance (SRR = 3.12) jobs.

Human cell types expressing the induced isozyme, which is the product of the same structural locus as the constitutive isozyme, include mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, virally transformed B-lymphoblastoid cells, leukemia-derived T-lymphoblastoid cells, HeLa cells, both normal and transformed fibroblasts, and placental tissue. Extracts of nondividing or terminally differentiated human cells/tissues, such as erythrocytes, striated muscle, peripheral lymphocytes, and platelets, contain high levels of the constitutive TPI-1/1 isozyme but little or undetectable levels of the TPI-1/2 or TPI-2/2 isozyme. The cell division-associated TPI-1/2 and -2/2 isozymes are distinct in electrophoretic mobility from the deamidated forms of the constitutive isozyme. Extracts of dividing gorilla fibroblasts display an isozyme pattern identical to that of proliferating human cells, but various proliferating cells derived from the African green monkey, rabbit, and chicken express only the constitutive isozyme.

Society's requirement, however, is for the best information available, however good it may be, and not necessarily for the definitive solution to the problem posed. Bayesian methods may be useful for presenting incomplete and varied data and informed scientific opinion in a form suitable for use in societal decision making, while at the same time providing a disciplinary framework for incorporating opinion into scientific recommendations. Inferences about individual cases and their relationship to risk of radiation carcinogenesis provide an especially severe test of the completeness of our understanding of the relationship between exposure and risk. This is particularly true with respect to the distribution of excess risk over time following exposure. Recent work suggests that a standard model often used for projection of risk forward in time, the constant relative excess model, may give a surprisingly accurate picture of time to tumor for a number of cancer sites.",,,['10.1007/978-1-4684-4970-9_21 [doi]'],,,,,

To identify patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis without reliance on invasive diagnostic procedures, a discriminant scorecard for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis based on clinical parameters was evaluated in a three-phase study. In phase I, the records of 62 patients, including 15 with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, were reviewed. Eleven clinical parameters distinguished patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis from control subjects. These parameters were combined into a discriminant scorecard. In phase II, the discriminant scorecard was validated by a blinded, retrospective review of 94 consecutive admissions. The discriminant scorecard score was highly associated with the clinical outcome (p less than 0.0005). The sensitivity of the discriminant scorecard was calculated as a range from 62.9 to 92.8 percent and the specificity as a range from 87.5 to 98.3 percent. In phase III, the clinical utility of the discriminant scorecard was determined by its prospective application to 49 consecutive patient admissions. The discriminant scorecard identified patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis at an average of 4.1 days prior to clinical recognition of the disease and initiation of amphotericin B therapy. The discriminant scorecard outperformed a complex function based on multiple linear regressions, was easy to use, and did not require difficult calculations. Thus, for this patient population, the discriminant scorecard was an accurate, useful noninvasive screening test for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

Levels of ADA above 350 U/mg of protein were found in 10 out of 12 LL tested, but not in any other specimen. The 3 TdT- LL had high contents of ADA. Therefore, all LL can be detected using both ADA and TdT markers. The 3 TdT- LL had a heterogeneous phenotype and their possible origin is discussed in view of the possibility that they constitute a rare entity distinct from the more common TdT+ LL. Very low levels of ADA (below 100 U/mg of protein) were found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and immunocytoma, and in Burkitt's lymphoma. In other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, intermediate values between 100 and 350 U were often found, and this finding could be relevant to the different cellular origin of the various B-cell neoplasias.

Lower mortality from noncancer causes in nuclear workers (the healthy worker effect) partly accounted for the observed elevated cancer proportional mortality. More important, however, was measurement bias which occurred in the proportional mortality study when nuclear workers who had not died of cancer were misclassified as not being nuclear workers based on information from their next of kin, thereby creating a spurious association. Although the proportional mortality study was based on a small sample of all deaths occurring in the cohort, selection bias did not contribute materially to the discrepant results for total cancer deaths.

Automated counts were compared with manual differential counts over a seven-month period. The S-Plus IV categorizes cells by volume after treatment with diluent and lysing solution. The three categories are labeled lymphocyte, mononuclear, and granulocyte, and, in normal samples, these correspond with lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. Eosinophils are counted either as mononuclear cells or granulocytes. Automated counts agree well with manual counts for the lymphocyte and granulocyte categories. Agreement is poor for the mononuclear category; this is likely due to the imprecision of the manual differential count. The S-Plus IV accurately classifies most samples as normal or abnormal. When all parameters of the hematology panel were evaluated, the false negative rate was less than 1%. Sixteen percent of results from the S-Plus IV were flagged, and 79% of these indicated an abnormality. False positive flags are usually due to a failure to adequately segregate mononuclear cells from granulocytes. Most commonly encountered abnormalities and hematologic disorders have abnormal three-part differential counts. The authors think the three-part differential cannot totally replace the manual differential but can decrease the number of repeat manual differentials on inpatients. It also offers quality control features useful to the hematology laboratory.",,,['10.1093/ajcp/84.1.49 [doi]'],,,,,

This tumor-like, osteolytic bone lesion presents both diagnostic and therapeutic problems. Solitary eosinophilic granuloma of the spine is not common. Compared to the multiple manifestation of eosinophilic granuloma, which seldom spares the spine, vertebral involvement is rare in cases of solitary eosinophilic granuloma (about 10 p.c.). Spinal involvement of this disease is mainly characterized by an undramatic, uneventful clinical course, even in cases of extensive osteolytic bone defects, varying laboratory findings as well as partial or complete collapse of a vertebra, mostly in form of a true vertebrae plana. Open biopsy is recommended instead of needle aspiration biopsy in solitary eosinophilic granuloma of the spine in order to exclude Ewing's sarcoma, neuroblastoma, or bony manifestations of leukemia. In cases of solitary eosinophilic granuloma various therapeutic methods have been tried. Some authors have registered good results by means of prolonged immobilization, similar to fracture treatment. Others have used radiation therapy in moderate doses. We suggest operative treatment of solitary eosinophilic granuloma. Our procedure comprises open biopsy, frozen section examination, and curettage of the affected vertebral body, taking care not to destroy the epiphyseal plate or the intervertebral disc. Vertebral body replacement is achieved by means of a bone graft, taken from the iliac crest. The original height of the vertebra is thus restored and immediate stability of the involved area guaranteed. Undisturbed bone growth of the end plated of the vertebral body can be observed. This technique is to prevent disturbances of spinal growth and permanent deformities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,['10.1055/s-2008-1045140 [doi]'],Das eosinophile Granulom der Wirbelsaule.,,,,

A strong correlation was found between achievement of complete remission and cellular ara-CTP levels. We therefore, attempted to improve the complete remission rate in patients with low ara-CTP levels by decreasing the intermittent ara-C dosing interval, thereby raising the minimum ara-CTP level in leukemic cells between doses. This initial attempt at pharmacologic direction of chemotherapy was successful in elevating minimum ara-CTP levels but did not produce an increase in response rate, probably because the total duration of ara-CTP exposure was decreased when the dose intervals were shortened. Currently we are engaged in a new approach based on the knowledge accumulated over the past three years. Patients receive a test ara-C dose from which data on ara-CTP cellular metabolism is derived, followed by a CI of ara-C at a dose calculated individually for each patient. Preliminary results of this approach thus far indicate an increased response rate and a different spectrum of toxicity than that observed with intermittent dose ara-C. Further clinical trials will determine the true effectiveness of this approach.",,['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['0093-7754(85)90029-6 [pii]'],,,,,

Seven of these 17 patients (41%) obtained a complete remission that ranged in duration from 2 to 11 (median 3) months. Two additional patients who failed to develop normal peripheral blood counts despite postinduction bone marrows that were normocellular and free of leukemia were classified as nonresponders. The median time to complete remission and median duration of leukopenia (WBC less than 1,000/mu 1) were 34 days and 23 days, respectively. Induction chemotherapy was complicated by fever in all patients, documented infection in six patients, and death secondary to sepsis in three. Survival of the 17 patients ranged from less than 1 to 39 (median 4) months. Patients achieving a complete remission had a median survival time of 10 months compared to 2 months for the nonresponders. The other 14 patients received only supportive care and had a median survival of 2 months. These findings indicate that therapy-associated acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (t-ANLL) can frequently respond to chemotherapy and that achieving a complete remission is associated with longer survival.

Fanconi's anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by progressive pancytopenia, skeletal abnormalities, hyperpigmentation, and other congenital anomalies. Increased chromosomal instability and defective DNA repair have been uniform findings. Several reports suggest associated immune deficiencies. There is an increased frequency of leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), including six cases of head and neck SCC. We reported a young girl with FA who developed SCC of the tongue. Initial studies suggest low lymphocyte counts, but normal lymphocyte responsiveness.

However, on most occasions, hypoalbuminemia was associated with weight/height, arm muscle area, and triceps skinfold measurements in the normal range. In order to further identify determinants of serum albumin, we analyzed dietary, chemotherapy, and temperature data in 10 prospectively studied leukemia patients, half of whom received parenteral nutrition. In these patients there was little relationship of serum albumin to chemotherapy or dietary intake. In all of these patients, especially those receiving total parenteral nutrition, low serum albumin was highly associated with fever (p less than 0.0005).

The sequence shows that R-MCF virus, like other MCF viruses, is a recombinant virus. Its env gene contains sequences which were acquired from an env gene in the mouse genome and which confer on the MCF virus its dualtropic host range. Unlike F-MCF and M-MCF viruses, R-MCF virus will not replicate in NIH 3T3 cells. The deduced amino acid sequence for the gp70 of R-MCF differs from that of F- and M-MCF viruses by 15 amino acids between residues 49 and 138 of gp70. These differences in amino acid sequences may be responsible for the inability of R-MCF virus to replicate in NIH 3T3 cells. The host range of two hybrid viruses constructed in vitro is consistent with this hypothesis. R-MCF virus and Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MLV) show 98% identity in their env gene 3' from the acquired env sequences. This contrasts with 82% identity between the env gene of R-MCF virus and M-MLV. The LTR of R-MCF shows 98% identity with the LTR of F-MCF as compared to 88% identity with the LTR of M-MCF. This striking similarity between the sequences of R-MCF, F-MCF, and F-MLV is surprising since the Rauscher virus and the Friend virus are thought to have originated independently. The high degree of similarity suggests that Rauscher and Friend viruses have a common origin. In contrast to M-MLV, which induces predominantly a lymphoid disease, R- and F-MCF viruses induce an erythroproliferative disease in NIH Swiss mice. A hybrid R-MCF virus with a genome derived primarily from R-MCF virus and a 3' end including the U3 region derived from M-MLV induces a lymphoid disease instead of an erythroid disease. This result indicates that it is the U3 region which determines the tissue specificity of the MCF virus-induced disease. It is suggested that the putative viral enhancers in the U3 region play two roles in the process of leukemogenesis: in the Friend and Rauscher disease, the viral enhancers act by increasing the transcription of the MCF env gene; in the thymic lymphoma, the enhancers activate mainly the expression of cellular genes.",PMC254914,['CA 13608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1128/JVI.55.1.184-192.1985 [doi]'],,['GENBANK/M10100'],,,

The pretreatment of animals with benzo[a]pyrene caused a large increase in both microsomal hydroxylations, whereas the pretreatment with phenobarbital caused a weak increase, with a preservation of 9-hydroxylation/7-hydroxylation ratio greater than 1 in both cases. The two hydroxyolivacines have been also found as principal in vivo metabolites of olivacine in rat bile as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.

Of the successful studies, the leukemia case-control analysis showed a possible relationship to lacquer production, which probably included benzene exposure.

One postoperative death (due to pulmonary embolus) (0.9%) occurred, with one serious complication (0.9%). Between 1968 and 1973, patients were randomized to receive either involved field radiation treatment (RTIF) or extended field radiation treatment (RTEF). Since 1973 all patients have received RTEF, 4,000 cGy in four to five weeks, with a median follow-up of 7.4 years. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 102 patients (94.4%), with no significant difference according to treatment or stage. Of the complete responders, 25 patients relapsed: 5/15 RTIF and 20/87 RTEF (P = .6). Twenty-one of 25 relapsing patients achieved a second CR. Disease free survival rates at five and ten years constituted: PS IA, 78.6% for both; PS IIA, 74.8% and 73.1% (P = .6); RTEF, 76.7% for both; RTIF, 73.3% and 66.7% (P = .7). Eighteen patients have died: eight of recurrent lymphoma, two of pulmonary embolus, one each of myocardial infarction, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) (following salvage chemotherapy), and one of diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (DHL). Four patients died in remission of unrelated causes.

Age, sex, number of sites, and mediastinal involvement did not influence the outcome. Acute toxicity was modest and more frequent among those receiving RTEF (P = .08). Chronic toxicity (onset more than 30 days after completion of treatment) was identified in 16 patients: 1/16 RTIF; 15/92 RTEF (P = .5). Three patients developed a second malignancy: one carcinoma of the cervix in situ; one ANLL (following salvage chemotherapy); and one DHL of the stomach. At least 75% of patients with PS IA and IIA Hodgkin's disease were cured by radiation alone, with a risk of secondary malignancy following radiation alone of 0.9%.

The serologic response was directed against a highly restricted cell surface antigen, closely related to or identical with the unique transplantation antigen characteristic for this tumor. In this paper, we report the results of our attempts to obtain additional augmentation by using Cy and adjuvants together. For these studies, the optimal Cy dose, interval between Cy and vaccine administration, and vaccine cell number were determined. Mice were injected with Cy 25 mg/kg i.p., and 3 days later, with viable irradiated (10,000 rad) Meth A cells subcutaneously, under conditions in which only few mice produced antibody. Sera were tested for antibody with reactivity against Meth A by complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDCX), which predominantly detects IgM, and by the protein A (PA) and anti-IgG assays, which detect IgG. Of the various adjuvants tested, only monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and CP20,961 resulted in significantly increased titers of reactivity in both the CDCX and PA assays over that obtained when using Cy alone. Although the mean titers observed with CDCX ranged between 1/160 and 1/320, no titer above 1/40 was observed with the PA assay. The specificity of the CDCX reactivity detected by the assay for the Meth A antigen was ascertained by absorption analysis of selected sera by using a panel of BALB/c spleen and tumor cell lines grown in vitro or in vivo. PA titers were too low to permit absorption analysis, and the titers obtained in the anti-IgG assay were lower still. Attempts to augment the anti-Meth A IgG response or to convert the IgM response to IgG were unsuccessful. The combined approach described here (i.e., vaccination with irradiated syngeneic tumor cells plus MPLA in Cy-pretreated mice) was also shown to be effective in augmenting the serologic response against two additional murine leukemia virus-negative sarcomas that are known to be less immunogenic, CMS4 and CMS5. It appears, therefore, that this combined approach may be applicable to stimulating serologic responses against a variety of tumor cell surface antigens.",,['CA-28461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Similarly, incubation of p-benzoquinone or hydroquinone with rabbit bone marrow mitochondria showed a dose-dependent inhibition of mtDNA synthesis with 50% inhibition at 1 mM and 10 mM, respectively. That these metabolites inhibit mitochondrial replication was evidenced by the fact that [3H]dTTP incorporation into characteristic 38S, 27S and 7S mitochondrial replication intermediates was decreased by the quinones, as analyzed on 5-20% neutral sucrose velocity gradients. p-Benzoquinone, hydroquinone and 1,2,4-benzenetriol inhibited the activity of partially purified rat liver mtDNA polymerase gamma using either activated calf thymus DNA or poly(rA) X p(dT)12-18 as primer/template, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 25 microM, 25 microM and 180 microM, respectively.

The ability of hydroquinone or p-benzoquinone to inhibit binding of [14C]hydroquinone to the enzyme suggests that the compounds bind to a common site or are converted to a common intermediate.

When the cytotoxic potential of vitamin K3 was recognized, the effects of vitamin K3 on human tumor colony formation were studied in 34 tumor explants using a soft agar (clonogenic) assay system. Complete inhibition of L1210 growth in flask culture was achieved at concentrations of 200 micrograms/ml of warfarin, 75 micrograms/ml of vitamin K1, and 4 micrograms/ml of vitamin K3. Combined use of vitamin K and warfarin enhanced cytotoxicity because a concentration of 1 micrograms/ml of vitamin K3 together with 70 micrograms/ml of warfarin resulted in nearly complete inhibition of L1210 growth. Comparable inhibition of growth was seen against malignant murine cell lines in the soft agar assay system, where greater than 70% decrease in colony formation was seen with vitamin K3 at concentrations of 6.4 micrograms/ml for L1210 leukemia and 1 microgram/ml for HII4E hepatoma lines.

Whether the agents are potentially mutagenic/carcinogenic is discussed on the basis of recent clinicopathological observations on secondary malignancy. In the in vitro studies, the induction of SCEs by various anticancer agents, including three anticancer antibiotics, six alkylating agents, and three antimetabolites, was examined and compared with induction by two known carcinogens, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and N-ethyl-N'-nitronitrosoguanidine. In the in vivo studies, SCE frequencies were examined in the lymphocytes from 74 blood samples drawn from 40 patients with cancer or leukemia at various times after the agents had been administered alone or in combination. The SCE frequencies induced by the anticancer antibiotics were variable because the drugs had different modes of action: generally, the drugs have strong cytotoxicity that must affect the viability of cells. On the other hand, alkylating agents induced significantly high levels of SCE frequencies in vitro; the modes of SCE inducibility were similar to those of the two carcinogens. The fact that cells were viable up to relatively high molar concentrations of the agents and that high SCE levels persisted for a long period suggests that the lesions induced by alkylating agents are long-lived and may therefore be more frequently involved in mutagenesis. This finding may be compatible with the clinical observation that the vast majority of patients with second malignancy are found in the group treated with alkylating agents. Antimetabolites generally showed only a weak SCE induction or none in vivo and in vitro.",,,,,,,,

Exponentially growing cells displayed the expected S-phase specificity and dose saturation properties of drug action. In contrast, in stationary cultures, progressively more cells were killed by increasing the concentration of the drug. Moreover, the fraction of cells killed at high doses exceeded by 2- to 3-fold the number of cells in drug-sensitive S phase detectable by flow cytometry or [3H]thymidine radioautography. To identify these apparent non-S targets of ara-C at high doses, L1210 cells were separated according to cell cycle position by velocity sedimentation at unit gravity. Large fractions of cells, accumulating at the G1-S boundary by nutrient starvation, were detected in stationary tissue culture cells as well as in ascites or solid tumor cells. The cells located in this cell cycle compartment (termed S1 cells) were sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of high-dose ara-C.

VM-26 inhibited ara-C transport by Ehrlich ascites cells within 1 min of exposure, and inhibition was only partially reversed after 45 min in VM-26-free medium. ara-C transport was slowed by 50% by 7 microM VM-26 or by 35 microM VP-16. Since epipodophyllotoxins were noncompetitive inhibitors, fractional inhibition was independent of the ara-C concentration. Analysis of ara-C transport kinetics revealed only a single saturable transport route, and there was no indication of VM-26-insensitive transport. VM-26, VP-16, and ara-C were competitive inhibitors of the specific binding of nitrobenzylthioinosine to the nucleoside carrier with Ki values of 7.4 microM, 23 microM, and 2.2 microM, respectively. The rate of dissociation of nitrobenzylthioinosine (t 1/2 = 20.6 min) was accelerated by 5 microM ara-C (t 1/2 = 18.5 min) but slowed by 100 microM VM-26 (t 1/2 = 34.6). By these criteria, the interaction of VM-26 with the nucleoside carrier was qualitatively similar to that of dipyridamole. Although VM-26 inhibited ara-C transport, it did not significantly slow the rate of net intracellular accumulation of ara-C by Ehrlich cells, presumably because transport capacity far exceeds the capacity for phosphorylation in these cells. In freshly isolated human leukemic blasts, which have far less nucleoside transport activity, inhibition of ara-C accumulation by VM-26 was dependent on the ara-C concentration. At 1 microM ara-C, a concentration where transport was rate limiting for net uptake, VM-26 inhibited accumulation of ara-C over a 60-min time course. At 50 microM ara-C, transport was in excess, and VM-26 did not slow ara-C metabolism.",,,,,,,,

In tumor cells, fluorescence was intensely localized in the nucleolus and was more diffuse in the cytoplasm. Change of less than 10% in the ds-RNA levels was observed in cell lines as a function of cytokinetic determinants such as cycle phase, culture age, and cycle traverse rate. Tumor differentiation by dimethylsulfoxide resulted in a significant decrease in cellular ds-RNA content. For quantitative comparison of clinical material, a ds-RNA excess was defined in relationship to normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. ds-RNA excess greater than 30% was observed in only one of 34 normal tissues (3%) as compared with 124 of 201 neoplastic tissue samples (62%). This incidence was higher in patients with acute leukemia (76%), high-grade and intermediate-grade lymphoma (75%), and high tumor stage myeloma (83%), as compared with chronic leukemia (20%), low-grade lymphoma (25%), and intermediate or low tumor mass myeloma (43%). Prognostically, a high pretreatment ds-RNA excess in myeloma was associated with a lower remission rate. The persistence of ds-RNA excess in the bone marrow of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in remission predicted for a shorter remission duration (seven v 22 months; P = .05).

Membrane vesicles were isolated from them and serotonin transport was measured. Two types of transport were identified. One was sensitive to imipramine and sodium-dependent, while the other was sensitive to reserpine and ATP-dependent. The transport systems exhibit different affinities for serotonin (sodium-dependent, Km 0.22 microM; ATP-dependent, Km 2.6 microM) and are different in their substrate specificity, the former being much more specific. The 5-hydroxytryptamine transport by the reserpine-sensitive system was strongly inhibited by other biogenic amines, like norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine, whereas that by the imipramine-sensitive system was not. Upon Ficoll gradient centrifugation the two transport systems were separated. The reserpine-sensitive activity was found much further into the gradient than the imipramine-sensitive one. The latter co-migrated with the receptor of IgE, which is located in the plasma membrane. Characterization of latter showed that in addition to the dependence of 5-hydroxytryptamine influx on external sodium it was also absolutely dependent on external chloride and was strongly stimulated by internal potassium. On the other hand, efflux required external potassium. An alternative potassium independent way of loss of labelled 5-hydroxytryptamine was by exchange. A small but consistent stimulation of influx was observed in the presence of valinomycin, indicating that the process is electrogenic. The reserpine-sensitive system could also be driven in the absence of ATP. This required the imposition of pH gradient (acid inside) and was stimulated by an artificially imposed membrane potential (positive inside).",,['NS16708-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0005-2736(85)90508-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(85)90508-5 [doi]']",,,,,

Tumor cells located in ascites, in contrast to those in the enlarged spleen, show a very high plasma membrane fluidity, mainly due to a decreased level of cellular (membrane) cholesterol. Yet, the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis in the tumor cells as estimated by the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and the incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol was extremely high when compared to various lymphoid cells in normal control mice. Also the rate of biosynthesis and the cholesterol content in liver and spleen of tumor-bearing mice were substantially higher than in the organs of control mice. Blood plasma cholesterol, however, was decreased in tumor-bearing mice as a result of altered lipoprotein patterns. Outgrowth of the tumor was accompanied by a strong reduction in plasma high-density lipoproteins. Low-density lipoproteins became transiently increased, but eventually all lipoproteins, and consequently the plasma cholesterol content decreased to very low levels, especially so in the ascites plasma. The low transfer of [14C]cholesteryl ester-labeled lipoproteins between blood and ascites plasma after either intravenous or intraperitoneal injection suggested a hampered flow between the two compartments. Also apparent differences in cholesteryl ester fatty acid composition between lipoproteins of the blood and ascites plasma indicated the lack of a rapid equilibration between the two compartments. The results suggest that the limited availability of lipoproteins as an additional source of cholesterol to the rapidly growing ascites cells promotes their high membrane fluidity.",,,"['0005-2736(85)90391-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(85)90391-8 [doi]']",,,,,

Under similar conditions, liposomes containing MTX-DMPE II (MTX-alpha-DMPE) and MTX-DMPE III (MTX-alpha, gamma-diDMPE) produced partial and no inhibition, respectively. These effects on cell growth were paralleled by the capacity of liposomes, prepared with each of the DMPE derivatives, to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase isolated from L1210 cells. Analogous experiments with the three corresponding glycerophosphorylethanolamine (glyceroPE) analogs also indicated that MTX-glyceroPE I was the most effective inhibitor of both cell proliferation and enzymatic activity. However, MTX-DMPE I sensitized liposomes apparently enter target cells as a consequence of phagocytosis, and not via the ubiquitous methotrexate transport system that is employed by MTX-glyceroPE I. For example, novel use of thiamine pyrophosphate showed that this compound had no influence on inhibition of cell proliferation due to liposomes, whereas thiamine pyrophosphate could completely antagonize the inhibitory effects of methotrexate and MTX-glyceroPE I.

The influx carrier was inhibited reversibly and completely by probenecid with a Ki of 0.25 mM, while efflux via the same system was relatively unaffected by this compound (50% inhibition above 2.0 mM). The two remaining efflux routes (which do not contribute to methotrexate influx) showed a much higher sensitivity to probenecid. Efflux via these components was reduced half-maximally at probenecid concentrations of 0.08 and 0.22 mM, respectively, and a complete block was achieved with excess amounts (2.0 mM) of the inhibitor. Intracellular levels of ATP, glucose metabolism, and the membrane potential were also reduced by probenecid, indicating that the mechanism for inhibiting methotrexate efflux may involve the ability of probenecid to act as a metabolic inhibitor.

A definite cytotoxic effect in cultures of malignant melanocytes was also reported. In order to establish if the cytotoxic effect of the diacid is exerted equally in the absence of tyrosinase, lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines were cultured for 72 hr with 10(-3) M, 10(-2) M and 5 X 10(-2) M C9 disodium salt. Normal resting lymphocytes, lymphocytes activated by phytohemoagglutinin, and mouse Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts were also tested to study a possible effect of azelaic acid on DNA synthesis and cell duplication. At 10(-3) M C9 had no effect on the viability of all the cells tested; at 10(-2) M and 5 X 10(-2) M, C9 2Na had a 50-80% cytotoxic effect on lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines, while at the same concentrations it was not toxic to normal lymphocytes, either resting or stimulated, or to 3T3 fibroblasts. The experiments on cellular incorporation of (1-9 14C) azelaic acid showed that the radiocarbon uptake was two to three times higher for lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines than for lymphocytes, either resting or stimulated, or 3T3 fibroblasts. Biochemical analysis revealed that the diacid underwent beta-oxidation in all the cell cultures. Fractionated centrifugations of 3T3 fibroblasts cultured in the presence of radiolabelled azelaic acid (2 X 10(-4) M) plus cold C9 2Na (10(-2) M), showed that the radioactivity was mainly concentrated in the cytoplasm. The results, being similar to those obtained by adding azelaic acid to cultures of melanoma cells, suggest that the cytotoxic effect of azelaic acid may be due to interference with mitochondrial oxido-reductase enzymes, rather than with tyrosinase. The difference in reaction between lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines and normal or stimulated lymphocytes, and 3T3 fibroblasts, could be explained on the basis of a different degree of permeability of the cell membrane, and/or to a possible different sensitivity of reaction of mitochondrial functions. A similar argument could be used to explain the absence of an effect of dicarboxylic acids upon normal as compared with hyperactive or malignant melanocytes in vivo.",,,"['0006-2952(85)90630-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(85)90630-6 [doi]']",,,,,

Of nine patients with underlying diabetes mellitus, eight developed rhinocerebral mucormycosis and one had the cutaneous form. Two additional patients with acute leukemia showed the disseminated and pulmonary forms of mucormycosis. In nine patients, the diagnosis was established by histologic appearance and by culture of infected tissue obtained by biopsy. In two patients the diagnosis was made during postmortem examination. Five patients survived.

This report demonstrates that hypoxanthine, which alone has no inductive effect, enhances induction by thymidine, resulting in a greater absolute, as well as relative, percentage of benzidine positive cells. This effect is seen over a 20-fold concentration range for both thymidine and hypoxanthine. This enhancement involves commitment, i.e., a process in which the induction of hemoglobin synthesis is coupled to a limitation in the number of subsequent cell divisions. Although thymidine alone increases the percentage of cells in S phase, hypoxanthine does not augment this. Purines other than hypoxanthine also enhance induction by thymidine. This enhancement by hypoxanthine of thymidine induction is inhibited by pyrimidine nucleosides. Mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase, itself an effective K562 inducer, is not additive to thymidine and hypoxanthine, suggesting that hypoxanthine may act by reducing the supply of guanosine nucleosides.",,,"['0003-9861(85)90726-X [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(85)90726-x [doi]']",,,,,

A sequence of statistical procedures was applied to the multiparameter morphometric data, enabling us to divide up the cell population into classes and to represent a given cell sample by a vector whose coordinates correspond to the distribution of the cells among the different classes (the lymphoid differential count). Automatic classification of the samples was carried out using this model. The groups obtained roughly matched the cytologic diagnosis, even though no diagnostic indications were added to the morphometric data. The lymphoid differential also permits good discrimination between chronic lymphoid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The method, suitable for large data sets, performs a reduction of the data that, because of its flexibility, achieves a compromise between loss of information and ease of application.

Our data indicate that variation in radiologic use is no larger, on average, than is variation in the use of surgical procedures and that the largest variations are found in mammograms and films of the skull and lumbar spine. For all patient age groups, four types of examinations contribute 75%-85% of the annual dose to the active bone marrow: examinations of the stomach and intestines using barium contrast material, intravenous urograms, studies of the biliary tract, and lumbar spine films.

The mechanism of this peroxidation is probably associated with the release from cells of catalyzers which perform free-radical oxidation of higher unsaturated fatty acids. Two processes occur upon irradiation of cells: disintegration of the released catalyzers, and stimulation of their release from cells. Correspondingly, the formation of malonic dialdehyde was inhibited or stimulated depending on the radiation dose and time of the combined incubation of liposomes and cells.

Both the F-MuLV envelope gene and the long terminal repeat (LTR) contribute to its pathogenic phenotype (A. Oliff, K. Signorelli, and L. Collins, J. Virol. 51:788-794, 1984). To determine whether the F-MuLV gag and pol genes also possess sequences that affect leukemogenicity, we generated recombinant viruses between the F-MuLV gag and pol genes and two other murine retroviruses, amphotrophic clone 4070 (Ampho) and Friend mink cell focus-inducing virus (Fr-MCF). The F-MuLV gag and pol genes were molecularly cloned on a 5.8-kilobase-pair DNA fragment. This 5.8-kilobase-pair F-MuLV DNA was joined to the Ampho envelope gene and LTR creating a hybrid viral DNA, F/A E+L. A second hybrid viral DNA, F/Fr ENV, was made by joining the 5.8-kilobase-pair F-MuLV DNA to the Fr-MCF envelope gene plus the F-MuLV LTR. F/A E+L and F/Fr ENV DNAs generated recombinant viruses upon transfection into NIH 3T3 cells. F/A E+L virus (F-MuLV gag and pol, Ampho env and LTR) induced leukemia in 20% of NIH Swiss mice after 6 months. Ampho-infected mice did not develop leukemia. F/Fr ENV virus (F-MuLV gag and pol, Fr-MCV env, F-MuLV LTR) induced leukemia in 46% of mice after 3 months. Recombinant viruses containing the Ampho gag and pol, Fr-MCF env, and F-MuLV LTR caused leukemia in 38% of mice after 6 months. We conclude that the F-MuLV gag and pol genes contain sequences that contribute to the pathogenicity of murine retroviruses. These sequences can convert a nonpathogenic virus into a leukemia-causing virus or increase the pathogenicity of viruses that are already leukemogenic.",PMC254876,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16599-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1128/JVI.54.3.864-868.1985 [doi]'],,,,,

Defining the type of immunological deficiency seems of primary importance, since it can be caused by haematological diseases, their treatment, by repeated surgery or by a polytrauma. The degree of immune deficiency should be quantitated by laboratory procedures, whenever possible. The treatment of these patients may include substitution therapy, decontamination and antimicrobial chemotherapy. Since the immune deficiency can only rarely be specifically substituted, hygiene plans should be made up for every patient, including the selective decontamination. An intensive microbiological surveillance can give early information about the prevalence of certain microorganisms, thereby facilitating a subsequent treatment. The antimicrobial chemotherapy of an overt infection in medical and pediatric oncology can follow fixed schedules, taking into account the various causative agents that can be expected. This procedure has proven to be efficient in the treatment of infections occurring during the therapy of acute lymphoblastoid leukemia in childhood. In surgical intensive care units, however, treatment of infections should be based on microbiological findings in conjunction with the local profile of bacterial resistance. Furthermore, it is important to be aware that ""non-pathogenic"" microorganisms can be the cause of life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Our experience shows that interdisciplinary cooperation and a mutual exchange of information is important for an efficient treatment of infections in patients with immunological deficiencies.",,,,Antibiotische Therapie bei Patienten mit immunologischer Abwehrschwache.,,,,

Lonidamine decreases amino acid incorporation in all cells tested, although the inhibition is partially relieved by glucose. The inhibition of labeled precursors into acid-insoluble material cannot be ascribed to an impairment of amino acid uptake which, on the contrary, is enhanced by the drug. Tests on cell-free systems showed that lonidamine does not inhibit the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-mRNA-directed in vitro protein synthesis, thus indicating that protein synthetic machinery per se is not affected. The inhibition of the rate of protein synthesis achieved by lonidamine must be ascribed to an effect on energy-yielding processes with a mechanism similar to that observed in other metabolic inhibitors. Lonidamine, however, because of its capacity to inhibit both respiration and glycolysis in neoplastic cells, is effective at 10 to 20 times lower concentrations. DNP and oligomycin potentiate the inhibitory effect of lonidamine on the rate of protein synthesis.

It was shown previously that the same effect occurred during incubation with various cytostatic agents, and that only the D2 stage correlated with the stage of cell death monitored by the usual trypan blue exclusion test. Therefore the ethidium bromide technique seems to monitor an earlier stage of cell death. The decrease in the number of dye-excluding (V) cells during heat exposure occurred in two phases.

HT was most active against HL-60 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and least active against DND-41 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, with a 70-fold differential activity. Sensitivity of the cell lines is, in decreasing order: HL-60 greater than RPMI-8402 greater than DND-39A congruent to ML-2 congruent to MOLT-3 congruent to KG-1 greater than Daudi congruent to NALL-1 greater than BALM-2 greater than DND-41. The cell lines with rapid cell growth tended to be more sensitive to HT. To further elucidate the selectivity of the differential sensitivity, uptake and release of HT were compared in HL-60 and DND-41 cells. Uptake of [3H]HT into HL-60 and DND-41 cells showed no difference; however, the binding of [3H]HT to cellular components was greater than 16-fold higher in HL-60 cells than DND-41 cells. There were also minor, but significant differences in the inhibition of [3H]leucine incorporation into proteins of these two cell lines in the presence of 1 microgram/ml HT. To test whether the biological effects of HT are related to the concentration of, or exposure time to, HT, KG-1 cells were exposed to HT for different periods of time and the growth-inhibitory effects were compared. Increasing exposure time from 1 h to 3 h resulted in a 100-fold decrease in concentration X exposure time (c X t) at ID50; from 3 h to 6 h, in a 20-fold decrease at ID70; and from 6 h to 24 h, in a 16-fold decrease at ID90. HT was not inactivated by cells up to 24 h. These results indicate that (a) the sensitivity of different cell lines to HT may be related to the degree of HT binding; and (b) the effects of HT are more dependent on exposure time than concentration. Continuous infusion is thus rational for clinical trials of this drug, and the degree of HT binding to leukemic cells may be predictive of clinical response.",,"['CA-25865/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1007/BF00258117 [doi]'],,,,,

At the concentrations used in this study, SA was not immediately toxic to L1210 cells, but inhibited growth at 2 days without lowering levels of cellular heme.

Treatment with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) (60 to 100 micrograms/mL) eliminated 2.0 to 3.5 logs of clonogenic cells. Antitumor activity depended upon the concentration of 4-HC and the length of incubation, but not upon the concentration of normal bone marrow cells. Comparable removal of clonogenic Burkitt's cells was achieved by treatment with rabbit complement (C') and a combination of J5 anti-common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (J5 anti-CALLA), J2 anti-gp 26, and the B1 anti-B1 murine monoclonal antibodies. A combination of 4-HC and monoclonal antibodies proved slightly but significantly more effective than either single agent in eliminating clonogenic tumor cells. Although treatment with 4-HC markedly reduced granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units-C (GM-CFU-C) content of human bone marrow, neither treatment with 4-HC nor treatment with monoclonal antibodies and C' eliminated precursor cells that could generate new GM-CFU-C after growth in continuous bone marrow cultures.

Four of the 6 patients abruptly developed overt clinical evidence of pulmonary dysfunction within the 96 h preceding the resolution of the peripheral leukopenia. In all 6 patients, the alveolar to arterial oxygen tension difference increased between leukocyte counts. The mean value for the alveolar to arterial oxygen tension difference for the group doubled during this period (148 +/- 37 mmHg 3 days prior to resolution; 290 +/- 37 mmHg 1 day after resolution; p less than 0.05). As an index of lung capillary permeability, we measured the lung permeability-surface area product for urea (PSu) for an additional patient with oxygen toxicity and drug-induced leukopenia whose hypoxemia increased immediately before the resolution of leukopenia. The PSu in this patient was high, in the range previously reported as being highly specific for increased permeability pulmonary edema with a fatal outcome. We conclude that such diffuse lung injury resembling the adult respiratory distress syndrome can occur in leukopenic patients, but the resolution of leukopenia in such patients may be associated with worsening oxygenation and with abnormally high pulmonary microvascular permeability. These observations do not prove a causal relationship but provide a clinical parallel to several leukocyte-depletion studies reported in animal models of increased permeability pulmonary edema that implicate white blood cells in the pathogenesis of hypoxemia and lung edema.",,,['10.1164/arrd.1985.131.4.579 [doi]'],,,,,

Subsequent investigations with a mouse myelomonocytic leukemia cell line (WEHI-3B(D+)) showed significant loss of replicative ability during brief (less than 1 h) exposures to 1 mCi/ml of 32P. Complete loss of cell replicative ability was found with isotopic doses less than 100 rad (i.e., 100 muCi/ml for 5 h). Experiments employing a less radiosensitive pre-B-cell line (18.81) revealed that significant loss of viability occurred during incubation with 32P under identical conditions to those employed for the WEHI-3B(D+) cell line. Control experiments utilizing decayed batches of 32P and physical separation of the isotope solution from the cells confirmed that the cytotoxicity was caused by radiation emission rather than the presence of toxic components in the isotopic solution. The radiation doses absorbed by cells biosynthetically labeled with 59Fe, 33P, 35S, and 14C were calculated. Although significant levels of radiation can be absorbed 32P was considerably more radiotoxic than the other isotopes. The results of calculations indicated that the judicious choice of container geometry could reduce the absorbed radiation dose from 32P solutions. In particular the biosynthetic radiolabeling of cells in capillary tubes (diameter less than 1 mm) can reduce the absorbed rate to less than one-tenth of the dose received by cells suspended in Petri dishes or centrifuge tubes.",,,"['0003-2697(85)90125-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(85)90125-3 [doi]']",,,,,

The dog, a 5-year-old female wire-haired bird dog, became ill about 21 months after it had returned from a year's stay in Spain (Malaga). The clinical signs were fever, lameness, enlargement of the popliteal lymph nodes and weight loss. A tentative clinical diagnosis of leukaemia was discarded after the microscopic recognition of Leishmania organisms in a biopsy from a popliteal lymph node (Fig. 1). The diagnosis was confirmed by the demonstration of the kinetoplast in the organisms by electron microscopy (Fig. 3 a-b). The organisms measured about 2 micron in diameter indicating that the species in question was Leishmania donovani infantum, which is indigenous to Spain and other Mediterranian countries. The dog was killed, and Leishmania were found in sections of mesenteric and popliteal lymph nodes, spleen, liver, lung and kidneys. The most interesting histologic features were interstitial nephritis, dominated by numerous plasma cells and membranous glomerulonephritis (Fig. 2). It is suggested that the glomerulonephritis is immune complex-mediated as it is in human visceral leishmaniasis. The risk of bringing dogs in and out of the Mediterranean region is stressed, and veterinarians are advised to have leishmaniasis in mind when they are confronted with dogs taken ill with non-specific symptoms after a stay in that part of the world, even if as much as two years have elapsed between the return and the onset of clinical signs.",,,,,,,,

Genetic and environmental disorders can result in further variation in specific dental traits. Identification of a dental anomaly can, at times, lead to the initial diagnosis of an underlying disorder and portend the patient's future health risks. Examples include the specific pattern of hypodontia seen before the development of iris dysplasia in Rieger syndrome, and the presence of supernumerary teeth and facial osteomas preceding malignant transformation of intestinal polyps in Gardner syndrome. In addition, dental anomalies can be useful in evaluating a patient's past medical history. A horizontal line of structural alteration in teeth can be used as a kymographic record of the causative metabolic disturbance and help pinpoint the active period of the disturbance. Normal eruption times of primary and permanent teeth also show a broad range of individual variation. Many disorders can cause extreme alterations in the eruption times of primary and permanent teeth or act to cause their premature exfoliation through disruption of their supporting tissues. The disruption of the eruption and integrity of the dentition can function as an indicator of the existent disease state. For example, the early exfoliation of primary teeth may be the presenting symptom of a patient with leukemia. Recognition of dental anomalies, distinct from normal variation can, therefore, be useful to the physician in the diagnosis of a patient's underlying condition and lead to a more thorough understanding of the mechanism of these disorders.",,,['10.3928/0090-4481-19850201-11 [doi]'],,,,,

One such gene seems to be c-myc, the oncogene frequently activated in B-lymphoid tumours either by retroviral insertion, as in the avian bursal lymphomas, or by a translocation to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, as in the predominant t(12; 15) of murine plasmacytomas and the analogous t(14; 8) of human Burkitt lymphomas. The c-myc gene was strongly implicated in T-cell neoplasia when 15-25% of T lymphomas arising in AKR mice, a strain prone to leukaemia, were found to have retroviral inserts near c-myc. Proviruses near c-myc were also found in several T lymphomas induced by murine leukaemia viruses (MuLV) in both mice and rats, but many of the rat thymomas bear an insert instead at one of several other common sites, at least two of which have murine homologues on chromosome 15. We show here that some murine T lymphomas contain proviral inserts in the recently identified chromosome 15 locus for plasmacytoma variant (6; 15) translocations, which we have denoted pvt-1. Although 6; 15 breakpoints map cytogenetically to the same chromosome band as c-myc, the alterations of pvt-1 in tumours occur at least 72 kilobases (kb) from the c-myc promoters. The insertions in T lymphomas suggest that an altered pvt-1 locus is conducive to neoplasia in T cells as well as B cells, possibly via long-range effects on c-myc expression.",,['CA12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1038/314740a0 [doi]'],,,,,

In short-term culture, the isolated cells will initiate globin synthesis and undergo other aspects of terminal differentiation only if erythropoietin (EP) is added to the medium. An early effect of the hormone on these cells is stimulation of total RNA synthesis. EP also causes initiation of transcription of the beta-globin genes after a lag period of 4 to 6 h. By 6 h, the transcription rate of beta-globin RNA is enhanced threefold, and by 12 h, it is nearly maximal at ca. 20 times the level of control cells which received no EP. Transcription rates of alpha and beta-globin genes are approximately equal to each other throughout the period of terminal differentiation. In the splenic erythroblasts, the chromatin structure in the vicinity of the beta-major globin gene was analyzed with two nucleases during these transcription rate changes. No S1 nuclease-hypersensitive site is detectable near the gene. The beta-major gene is quite sensitive to DNase I in comparison with the albumin gene; however, the level of sensitivity is the same before EP addition as it is during maximal gene transcription after EP addition. Also, a hypersensitive site near the 5' cap site of the beta-major gene is quantitatively equivalent both before and after EP addition. Analysis of cytosine methylation at two sites upstream from the gene showed no changes upon induction of beta-globin gene transcription by EP. Thus, the initiation of beta-globin transcription by EP appears to be at some step after chromatin structural alteration such as synthesis, release, or activation of a specific transcription initiation factor.",PMC366769,['AM-31513/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1128/mcb.5.4.675-683.1985 [doi]'],,,,,

The following findings are noted. C-NO2dUrd is about 500- to 2000-fold less inhibitory to tumor cell proliferation in vitro than NO2dUrd. Phosphorolysis of C-NO2dUrd by rabbit liver extracts was not observed under conditions where NO2dUrd was readily converted to 5-nitrouracil (NO2Ura). Also, C-NO2dUrd is converted to its 5'-monophosphate (C-NO2dUMP) by dThd kinase nearly as efficiently as the true nucleoside NO2dUrd. This metabolic conversion is necessary for the inhibitory effect of C-NO2dUrd on tumor cell proliferation in cell culture. The principal target enzyme for the cytostatic action of C-NO2dUrd is 2'-deoxythymidylate (dTMP) synthetase. C-NO2dUMP, the active metabolite of C-NO2dUrd, has a much lower affinity for dTMP synthetase than does NO2dUMP. This is the first demonstration of the interaction of a carbocyclic pyrimidine nucleotide analogue with dTMP synthetase. Neither NO2dUrd nor C-NO2dUrd exerts any significant antitumor activity in mice bearing L1210 or P388 leukemia; for NO2dUrd, this failure may be related to a rapid degradation to its inactive metabolite, NO2Ura; for C-NO2dUrd, it is most likely due to a decreased affinity of C-NO2dUMP for its target enzyme, dTMP synthetase.",,,,,,,,

The enzyme activity was first measured in cerebrospinal fluid from 131 patients with various disorders and was then prospectively measured in cerebrospinal fluid from 30 patients with cytologic results that were positive for or suggestive of malignant disease. Within the first group, elevated levels of beta-glucuronidase were found only among patients with neoplastic processes in the central nervous system, including neoplastic meningitis. Among 26 patients with neoplastic processes in the central nervous system, including neoplastic meningitis. Among 26 patients with positive cytologic results, 13 had elevated beta-glucuronidase activities. Elevated values were more frequent among patients with adenocarcinoma (75%) and myelogenous leukemia (60%). The patients with these two disorders also had the highest enzyme activities. The correlation of th beta-glucuronidase level with other cerebrospinal fluid values, including total protein, glucose content, and cell count, was not significant. The findings of this study indicate that measurement of beta-glucuronidase in cerebrospinal fluid can be used as an adjunctive diagnostic test for neoplastic meningitis.

The monoclonal antibody (MAb) WEM-G11 was produced which recognizes the GFA-2 structure. This MAb, when used as F(ab')2, stimulated human neutrophils to kill antibody-coated P815 cells and, in the case of human eosinophils, increased their cytotoxic effect on schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni in a dose-dependent manner. MAb WEM-G11 F(ab')2 also stimulated the phagocytosis of antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes by neutrophils. The effect of WEM-G11 F(ab')2 was specific, because other MAb, whether tested in the form of F(ab')2 fragments or as whole IgG, failed to stimulate neutrophils despite binding to these cells. In contrast to the F(ab')2 fragments of these cells. In contrast to the F(ab')2 fragments of WEM-G11, the whole IgG of this MAb inhibited ADCC and phagocytosis, presumably through interaction with granulocyte Fc receptors. WEM-G11 F(ab')2, and to a greater extent WEM-G11 IgG, induced degranulation, but only from cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils. GFA-2 was absent from lymphocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes, and myeloid and erythroid colony-forming cells, as shown by flow cytometry and colony-forming experiments. GFA-2 appeared at the promyelocytic stage and increased in density as neutrophils became more mature. In the mature neutrophil, the number of binding sites for WEM-G11 were found to be about 20,000 per cell. By immunoprecipitation, it appeared that GFA-2 consisted of a polypeptide chain of about 95,000 m.w. and a low m.w. peptide of about 43,000. By immunoblotting, it was demonstrated that the epitope recognized by WEM-G11 is in the chain of m.w. 95,000. GFA-2 thus constitutes a novel human granulocyte-specific antigen that is central to the functional activity and differentiation of these cells.",,,,,,,,

Mice were depleted of endogenous NK(YAC-1) cells by injection of anti-asialo GM1 antibody, followed by lethal whole body irradiation. Normal syngeneic bone marrow cells were transplanted into such pretreated mice. Regeneration of NK(YAC-1) activity in the recipient mice was monitored by two different assays: the ability of spleen cells to lyse YAC-1 cells in vitro and the ability to clear i.v. injected, 125IUdR-labeled YAC-1 cells from the lungs. With both assays, a dose-response relationship between the number of bone marrow cells injected and the degree of NK(YAC-1) activity generated could be demonstrated. However, the lung clearance assay appeared superior because the NK regeneration could be detected earlier and with lower numbers of injected marrow cells. With this assay, several characteristics of the NK precursors and their differentiation could be defined. 1) The generation of mature, lytic NK cells from their transplantable precursor requires an intact ""marrow microenvironment"" in the recipient mice, because differentiation failed to occur in mice rendered osteopetrotic by estradiol treatment. 2) The NK(YAC-1) precursors lack the surface antigens (NK-2.1, asialo GM1, Qa-5, Thy-1) that are characteristically seen on mature NK cells. 3) The NK-precursors could be eliminated from the bone marrow with anti-Qa-2 or anti-H-2 antisera + complement, indicating that these two antigens are expressed on the precursors. The relationship between NK(YAC-1) precursors and multipotent myeloid stem cells (CFU-S) was investigated by utilizing W/Wv and Sl/Sld mutant mice. Bone marrow cells of W/Wv anemic mice, although markedly deficient in CFU-S, have a normal frequency of NK(YAC-1) precursors. Sl/Sld mice that lack a suitable microenvironment for the development of CFU-S allowed normal differentiation of NK(YAC-1) precursors when transplanted with normal bone marrow cells. Together, these data suggest that multipotent myeloid progenitor cells, as defined by the CFU-S assay, and the NK(YAC-1) precursors are not closely related.",,"['AI20451/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

This phosphatase has been purified by a procedure which involves only two chromatographic steps: CM-cellulose chromatography and immunoaffinity chromatography on sheep antibodies generated against porcine uteroferrin. Uteroferrin is an abundant iron-containing acid phosphatase that can be recovered readily from porcine uterine secretions. Like uteroferrin, the purified human Type 5 phosphatase is a glycoprotein of molecular weight about 34,000. It contains two atoms of iron/molecule. The human phosphatase and uteroferrin also resemble each other closely in electrophoretic mobility, substrate specificity, and response to a variety of activators and inhibitors. Mouse monoclonal antibodies have been raised to uteroferrin and to the human Type 5 phosphatase. Three monoclonal antibodies which bind with high affinities to distinct sites on the uteroferrin molecule also recognize the human spleen enzyme, but bind to it with much lower affinity. These antibodies also recognize cationic acid phosphatases purified from bovine and rat spleens. A monoclonal antibody raised against the human enzyme, but selected for binding to uteroferrin, appears to recognize a relatively conserved site on all four phosphatases.

In contrast, accumulation and consequent cytotoxicity of Rho-123 in sensitive cells are not increased by verapamil. Similar results were obtained when ADM was used in this cell system. These results suggest that the efflux system for Rho-123 and ADM in sensitive cells is either reduced or absent.

P388 murine leukemic cells were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine and tritiated thymidine simultaneously. After fixation, the sample was first processed with a monoclonal antibody to bromodeoxyuridine (RPMB I) so that any cell in S-phase was brightly fluorescent (RPMB technique). Next, tritiated thymidine grains were developed by autoradiography, and the result demonstrated fluorescence as well as black grains in each S-phase cell. P388 cells sensitive (P388S) and resistant (P388R) to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine and [3H]ara-C simultaneously. Processing by autoradiography and RPMB techniques revealed that all S-phase cells in the P388S sample demonstrated vivid ""double labeling,"" whereas P388R cells only revealed bright green fluorescence in S-phase cells, but no grains, confirming a lack of ara-C incorporation into the DNA by this line. Finally, a computerized digital analysis system attached to a microphotometer was used to quantitate fluorescence and grains per cell, and the data demonstrated that the number of [3H]ara-C grains in each P388S cell was inversely proportional to the degree of fluorescence in that cell, indicating that DNA synthesis was inhibited by ara-C. In conclusion, a simple, easy-to-use double-labeling method has been introduced which will be useful to a wide variety of researchers, because this technique together with the digital analysis system offers the possibility of measuring drug sensitivities in individual cells.",,"['AI 19827/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA5834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

Feasibility was addressed in a pilot study during which basic methods, appropriate assay quality controls, and a standardized protocol for screening were developed. Considerable variability was noted in the availability and colony growth of different tumor types. The majority of the evaluable experiments utilized breast, colorectal, kidney, lung, melanoma, or ovarian tumors. For many tumor types, little evidence of growth was observed, or only rare specimens formed colonies. Colony-forming efficiencies ranged from 0.05 to 0.11% for the six most useful tumors listed above. A set of quality control measures was developed to address technical problems inherent in the assay. Testing of standard agents in the pilot study established that most of these agents could be detected as active. However, it also identified three assay limitations: compounds requiring systemic metabolic activation are inactive; medium constituents may block the activity of certain antimetabolites; and compounds without therapeutic efficacy may be positive in the assay. The assay categorized nontoxic clinically ineffective agents as true negatives with 97% accuracy. Of 79 compounds which were negative in the current National Cancer Institute prescreen (leukemia P388), 14 were active in the assay. Several demonstrated outstanding in vitro activity and are structurally unrelated to compounds already in development or in clinical trials. A subset of these active compounds were found to lack activity in a P388 in vitro colony-forming assay. This indication of differential cytotoxicity to human tumor cells makes this subset of compounds particularly interesting as antitumor drug leads. The demonstrated sensitivity to most standard agents, discrimination of nontoxic compounds, reproducibility of survival values within assays and between laboratories, and evidence of ability to identify active compounds which were negative in the in vivo prescreen suggest that the human tumor colony-forming assay may be a valuable tool for antitumor drug screening. However, because of technical limitations inherent in the current assay methodology, this must be confined to selected tumor types and limited to screening on a moderate scale.",,"['N01-CMO-7251/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CMO-7327/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CMO-7419/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

It has been shown in model experiments with incorporation into the tumor cell membrane of brain ganglioside GD3 combined with thymic LacCer or with egg phosphatidylcholine that the increase in the sensitivity of the tumor cell membrane to spleen effectors is linked with a change in the properties of the lipid membrane matrix under the effect of unsaturated fatty acids (e.g. in experiments with phosphatidylcholine).

Our data best fitted into the British Medical Research Council (1980) staging system, the survival curves of all three stages showing significant differences, with median survival time dropping from 83 months in stage A to 52 months in stage B and 26 months in stage C.

Using high-performance liquid chromatography, the sequential changes occurring in the acid-soluble intra cellular nucleotide pools of L1210 mouse leukemic cells were analysed after treatment with MTX, and a reduction of the dTTP pool to 46% of the control level was observed. Declines in the dCTP, ATR and GTP pools were also reduced to 36%, 30% and 24%, respectively, of the control level after treatment with MTX. Using MTX-5-FU combination chemotherapy, pretreatment with MTX enhanced the intracellular level of FUTP which is one of the active metabolites of 5-FU. There was, however, no significant difference in the value of dTTP levels between MTX-5-FU and 5-FU alone. One of the mechanisms of the synergistic interaction between MTX and 5-FU might therefore be stimulated phosphorylation of 5-FU with an increased PRPP level, which occurs as a result of the MTX-blocked purine de novo pathway. Using MTX-ara C combination chemotherapy, MTX enhanced the intracellular production of ara-CTP, which occurs as a result of MTX reducing the intracellular dCTP pools, following activation of deoxycytidine kinase. More clarification of the effects on intracellular nucleic acid metabolism will aid the development new and increasingly effective drug combinations involving thiopurines. The methods of combination chemotherapy will become more sophisticated as the biochemical modulation effect of the drug is clarified.",,,,,,,,

High levels of ADA activities were found in plasma, erythrocytes, and mononuclear cells from patients with acute leukemia, especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and blastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. Serial determination of plasma ADA activities was done in 9 patients with acute leukemia. All patients untreated or in relapse had an elevation of plasma ADA activity, which decreased to normal or subnormal levels during complete remission. On starch gel electrophoresis, plasma ADA in leukemic patients separated into two bands. The major band showed a mobility identical to that of normal red cells and mononuclear cells, and the minor band corresponded to that of normal plasma ADA. Enzymatic and immunological studies were performed on ADA from leukemic cells of acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia. There were no differences in Michaelis constant for adenosine, thermostability, electrophoretic mobility, immunological reactivity, and specific activity between ADA of leukemic cells and normal mononuclear cells. These results strongly suggest that the increased ADA activity in leukemic cells is caused by an increased synthesis of a structurally normal enzyme and that increased plasma ADA activity in leukemic patients reflects an increment of leukemic cells in bone marrow. Therefore, serial determination of plasma ADA activities seems to provide a good indicator of the total mass of leukemic cells in bone marrow.",,,['10.1002/ajh.2830190106 [doi]'],,,,,

Daudi cells were the most sensitive to it. Two T-cell lines (RPMI-8402, HUT78), three B-cell lines (Raji, Ly16, A3/Kawakami), one non-T, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line (KOPN-1) and three myelomonocytoid cell lines (U937, THP-1, ML-1) were moderately or slightly sensitive. Although the levels of sensitivity of these cell lines were different, cells could be killed by the recombinant alpha-interferon. Morphological changes in the sensitive cells treated with it were decreases in mitosis, pyknosis and fragmentation of the cells. Thirteen other cultured cell lines were not sensitive. The results indicated that the growth inhibitory activity of recombinant alpha-interferon is not always cell lineage-specific. There were only three cell lines whose sensitivity, expressed by the concentration required for 90% growth inhibition, was less than the several hundred units per milliliter that has usually been obtained as blood levels in clinical trials. These three included one of 10 T-cell lines and two of seven B-cell lines; none of six non-T, non-B ALL and myelomonocytoid cell lines were that sensitive. Among virus-associated cell lines, only Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell lines were sensitive to the interferon; adult T-cell leukemia virus-associated T-cell lines were not sensitive. It was demonstrated that recombinant alpha-interferon has a time-dependent, but not a concentration-dependent cytocidal action, indicating that optimal therapeutic schedules of recombinant alpha-interferon for cancer may be daily long-term treatment, not single or short-term large-dose therapy.",,,,,,,,

In order to study some aspects of the kinetics of cancer cell destruction in passing through narrow pores, we have developed a model system in which cancer cells are passed through polycarbonate filter membranes in vitro. Filtration through 5-micron pores causes immediate internal damage, reflected in the arrest of active cellular metabolism and reproduction, followed by loss of plasma membrane integrity and, ultimately, the death of the majority of the cells. In this communication, we address the question of whether survival from mechanically initiated filtration damage is a random event, or whether it is a manifestation of a subpopulation of cells, with hereditary resistance to mechanical trauma. Studies on the patterns of cell survival after repeated filtration, and comparisons of the filtration resistance of clonal derivatives developed from filtration survivors with original 'wild' populations, indicate that survival from mechanical trauma is a random event and that resistance to trauma is a nonhereditary property.",,,,,,,,

It was shown that in passing through membrane pores, impaired cell reproductive integrity and 3H-thymidine incorporation were the first detected signs of trauma, followed by impaired protein synthesis (14C-labelled amino acid incorporation) and finally, impaired plasma membrane integrity (loss of trypan blue exclusion). This, together with consideration of whole cell and nuclear diameters, suggests that damage may be the consequence of traumatic spatial dissociation between components of the cell periphery, the cytoskeleton and nucleus. Following a single filtration and return to culture, there was a progressive decline in cell numbers up to 96 h. After this, the survivors remained in a 'dormant' steady state for a further 5-6 days, and only then began to divide. The induction of a 'dormant' state in cancer cells by mechanical trauma, analogous to that inflicted in the passage through the microvasculature, is as interesting as it is unexpected.",,,,,,,,

PMA induced the appearance of FcR on the membranes of P388 cells as indicated by the binding of IgG-coated sheep red blood cells (IgG-SRBC). Concentrations of PMA as low as 1 ng/ml were sufficient to induce the expression of FcR as well as to inhibit cellular division and to induce adherence in the P388 tumor cell line; however, optimal FcR induction occurred at PMA concentrations of 10-100 ng/ml. Immunofluorescent analysis with heat-aggregated myeloma proteins indicated that PMA induced FcR which were capable of binding IgG2a and IgG2b immunoglobulins, but not IgG1. Adherence to a substratum was determined to be a second required signal for expression of FcR, since PMA induction of P388 tumor cells in teflon dishes failed to fully develop FcR and adherence of P388 cells to poly-L-lysine-coated culture dishes in the absence of PMA was insufficient for FcR expression. FcR which appeared after PMA induction were non-functional in the sense that membrane-bound IgG-SRBC were not ingested to any significant extent by the tumor cells. However, if FcR induction occurred in the presence conA-induced rat spleen cell culture supernatants, phagocytosis of membrane-bound erythrocytes occurred.

Stoichiometric calculations reveal that in the extracellular milieu 22 mol Ca2+ (maximum) are complexed per mol lectin. Binding of Ca2+ to the lectin increases its apparent Mr from 44000 to 56000 (electrophoretic determination) or from 36500 to 53500 (high-pressure liquid gel chromatographical determination); the s20, w increases from 4.3 S to 4.5 S if Ca2+ is added to the lectin. In the presence of Ca2+ the lectin undergoes a conformational change perhaps by expanding the carbohydrate side chains which are terminated by galactose. Subsequently the lectin molecules polymerize to large three-dimensional clumps (diameter up to 8 micron). Turbidimetric studies reveal an inhibition of the lectin polymerization by lactose. The Ka of the lectin-lectin polymerization rises from 0.9 X 10(6)M-1 to 14.0 X 10(6)M-1 after increasing the Ca2+ concentration (from 1 microM to 100 microM). Parallel with this increase in affinity, the Ka value of the lectin-aggregation factor binding drops from 41.2 X 10(6)M-1 (1 microM Ca2+) to 1.3 X 10(6)M-1 (100 microM Ca2+). In the absence of Ca2+, the Geodia lectin forms 1-10-micron two-dimensional sheets in the presence of homologous glycoconjugates. Cell binding experiments with polyacrylamide gels, containing covalently bound galactose, show that both homologous (Geodia cydonium) and heterologous cells (L5178y) bind with a higher affinity to the lectin-polymer matrix than to the lectin-monomer one.

The simple procedure which was earlier developed for the electronic counting of thymocyte rosettes in guinea-pigs was used and now supplemented with a method for rapid, graphical determination of rosette frequency. The low level of E rosettes in CLL patients was easily distinguished from the higher level seen in the other groups and there was a good agreement between electronic and visual determinations. In samples with a high rosette frequency, the cell counter initially gave 10-30% lower values than when recorded visually. This discrepancy was corrected, however, by a minor adjustment of discriminator level and the introduction of a correction procedure for the presence of double rosettes.

At extracellular VP-16 concentrations of 1 to 5 microM, verapamil (10 microM) addition resulted in an increase of DNA single-strand break frequency comparable to that found when VP-16 was present alone at a 3-fold higher concentration. In addition, the elevation of cellular VP-16 levels in the presence of verapamil was linearly correlated with the enhancement of DNA damage and increased cell kill. Verapamil-mediated increase in net VP-16 transport was rapid (1 to 2 min), and allowed for the same elevation of steady-state VP-16 concentration, whether verapamil was added simultaneously with VP-16 or was added after a steady-state level of VP-16 was achieved. Verapamil-mediated elevation of VP-16 levels was not seen at reduced temperature (0 degrees C). Studies of bidirectional VP-16 transport revealed that verapamil (40 microM) did not alter influx of VP-16 (15 microM), but lowered the unidirectional rate constant for efflux by 93%, resulting in the observed increase of steady-state level of the epipodophyllotoxin. Removal of verapamil resulted in a rapid return of VP-16 to levels comparable to that seen with VP-16 alone. When VP-16 was allowed to flow out of the cell in the presence of verapamil, less than 5% of cellular epipodophyllotoxin was retained, suggesting that the calcium antagonist is not acting by enhancing intracellular binding of VP-16. These results indicate that verapamil potentiates VP-16 activity by elevation of intracellular exchangeable epipodophyllotoxin; an activity which seems to be due to inhibition of the efflux mechanism for VP-16. The low intracellular retention of this epipodophyllotoxin and the good correlation between intracellular VP-16 and subsequent DNA damage and cytotoxicity suggest that the epipodophyllotoxin class of anticancer agents may be more useful for probing calcium antagonist effects on drug transport in sensitive cells and in cells exhibiting pleiotropic drug resistance than the vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines which have large tight binding intracellular components.",,['CA-00537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Cytotoxicity of the four analogues against the murine L1210 leukemia and the human Manca B cell leukemia, as determined by a 3-h clonogenic assay, showed aminopterin and the two 10-deazaaminopterin compounds to be approximately equivalent for each cell type and were 3- to 10- (L1210) and 7- to 14-fold (Manca) more potent than methotrexate. In murine Sarcoma 180 cells, 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin and aminopterin were similarly potent but were 5- to 10-fold more potent than 10-deazaaminopterin and 40- to 80-fold more potent than methotrexate. These results could be explained in part by the differences in transport properties and substrate activities for polyglutamylation for each analogue in these cell types. Initial rates of polyglutamate accumulation of the four analogues, which were determined under conditions of comparable rates of drug entry into the three tumor cell lines, were 7- to 18-fold less than drug entry rates. In L1210 and Sarcoma 180 cells, the relative rates of polyglutamylation were in the order aminopterin greater than 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin greater than methotrexate greater than 10-deazaaminopterin. In contrast, the relative rates of polyglutamylation in Manca cells were in the order 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin approximately equal to aminopterin greater than 10-deazaaminopterin greater than methotrexate, suggesting that folylpolyglutamyl synthetase may have varying substrate preferences in different cell types. The maximum relative extents of total polyglutamate accumulation in L1210 cells were 85 to 95% of the total drug at 24 h. In Manca cells, the maximum polyglutamate accumulation was also 85 to 95%, but this was obtained by 6 h. However, in Sarcoma 180 cells, only aminopterin polyglutamates reached a similar maximum percentage of accumulation, while lower relative polyglutamate levels were achieved with the other analogues. Accumulation of individual polyglutamates in each cell line was similar for all analogues except aminopterin. For methotrexate and the two 10-deazaaminopterins, accumulation occurred mainly as the tetraglutamate or as higher polyglutamates. Aminopterin was accumulated mainly as the diglutamate, particularly in Manca cells where 70% of total drug was in the diglutamate form within the first 3 h and remained the predominant form for 24 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 22346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Five patients had chromosomal analyses performed at the University of Chicago, two patients were studied at the All-Union Cancer Research Center in Moscow, and one patient each was studied at the University of Maryland and at Fairfax Hospital in Fairfax, Virginia. All nine patients had a reciprocal translocation involving the short arm of chromosome 6 and the long arm of chromosome 9 [t(6;9)(p23;q34)]. The patients, four males and five females, ranged in age from 5 to 51 years; the median age of 38 years is lower than that typically seen in ANLL. Only two of eight treated patients entered a complete remission. Classification of bone marrow morphology according to FAB Cooperative Group criteria revealed AML-M1 in one patient, AML-M2 in four, and AMMoL-M4 in three. One patient had refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) which evolved to AML-M2. All bone marrow specimens showed severe myelodysplasia, with Auer rods present in seven of the nine cases. Of note was the particular prominence of bone marrow basophils (greater than 1%) in eight of the nine (89%) patients. Among 160 evaluable patients with ANLL de novo seen at the University of Chicago whose cells lacked a t(6;9), only five (3%) had greater than 1% basophils in the marrow aspirates. It is of interest that the breakpoint in 9q involves the same chromosomal band as that in the t(9;22) observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), in which increased basophils are a prominent feature.

Forty-nine newly diagnosed patients with ANLL were evaluated during 1980 and 1981, and 24% had palpable splenomegaly. Although treated with usual doses of platelets per transfusion, there was no detectable statistical increase in transfusion requirement or incidence of hemorrhage in patients with splenomegaly. Experimental evidence indicates that the splenic platelet pool enlarges with splenomegaly, but the life span of circulating platelets is not significantly changed. Furthermore, the splenic platelet pool is in dynamic equilibrium with the circulating platelet pool thus allowing these platelets to participate in hemostasis.

Furthermore, at higher levels of supplemental iron (250 mg Fe/kg body weight), the pretreated animals inoculated with L1210 cells died in 9.7 d whereas controls died in 12.2 d (i.e., 25% faster). As expected, the lower iron dose (24 mg/kg) also resulted in shorter life spans, although the effects were less striking.

We tested intact ricin IT for its antitumor activity against established tumors. CEM, a human T-cell leukemia line expressing an Mr 67,000 cell surface antigen, and Daudi, a human B-cell lymphoma line which does not express the antigen, were found to be consistently tumorigenic in nude mice. ITs were synthesized using T101, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody reacting with the Mr 67,000 protein determinant and intact ricin. We have shown for the first time that established CEM solid tumors in nude mice will regress following intratumoral injection of T101-ricin IT, while Daudi tumors will not. Selective activity of T101-ricin is dependent on systemic i.v. administration of lactose and local intratumoral injection of the T101-ricin IT with lactose. Intact ricin ITs require the presence of lactose to block native ricin binding and render them antigen specific when linked to monoclonal antibody. Killing of target was cell specific since (a) nonspecific (irrelevant) ITs did not cause the regression of CEM tumors, and (b) injection of large amounts of free T101 antibody prior to T101-ricin IT blocked antitumor activity. Selectivity was not absolute, since regression occurred in one of six animals given irrelevant IT, and blocking was observed in two of four mice. Intratumoral IT treatment with 1 or 2 micrograms of T101-ricin IT plus lactose was not harmful to mice in contrast to intratumoral ricin treatment, which killed all treated tumor-bearing mice at a dose of 0.3 micrograms. Without i.v. injection of lactose, intratumoral injection of T101-ricin IT was also effective in eliminating established tumors. However, this treatment did not result in the selective elimination of tumor, since Daudi tumors also regressed following T101-ricin IT treatment. IT, made with ricin A chain only (T101-A chain IT), was also tested against established CEM tumors. We found that high dosages of T101-A chain IT did not destroy CEM tumors when injected intratumorally, even in the presence of activating agents such as NH4Cl or the carboxylic ionophore X-537 A. In contrast, in vitro experiments demonstrated that T101-A chain IT plus activating agents had potent and selective cytotoxic effect against CEM cells.

This activity was well correlated with trypan blue dye exclusion, which was tested to assess cell membrane damage. Scanning electron microscopy revealed loss of cell surface features and severe cell membrane destruction after incubation with CP-46,665. These effects on thymidine uptake and single cell viability were accompanied by a clear loss of the reproductive capacities of human tumor and leukemic cells as measured in a human tumor stem cell assay after incubation with CP-46,665. The above-mentioned cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of CP-46,665 were dependent on dosage and incubation time. Destruction of leukemic blasts was often completed with greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/ml after an incubation of greater than or equal to 48 hr or greater than or equal to 10 micrograms/ml after an incubation of greater than or equal to 24 hr. Cells from solid tumors usually required a slightly higher drug concentration and longer incubation period for maximum killing. The alkyl-linked lipoidal amine CP-46,665 often showed considerably greater efficacy than did the alkyl-linked phospholipid rac-1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methylglycero-3-phosphocholine tested in comparison.

When heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (HI-NBCS) was depleted of IgG its activity to promote the association of neuraminidase-treated 59Fe-labelled IFLE (59Fe-IFLE) with macrophages was markedly reduced but could be restored by the addition of bovine IgG. Trypsin treatment of macrophages caused incomplete inhibition of their subsequent association with both untreated and neuraminidase-treated 59Fe-IFLE in the presence of HI-NBCS. When spectrin, the major red cell cytoskeleton protein, was added to HI-NBCS there was a dose-related inhibition of the association with macrophages of both untreated and neuraminidase-treated 59Fe-IFLE. Moreover a mouse monoclonal antibody against spectrin promoted the interaction of neuraminidase-treated 59Fe-IFLE with macrophages. Mouse sera which supported the association of neuraminidase-treated 59Fe-IFLE with macrophages were found to contain anti-spectrin antibodies. These results suggest that IgG antibodies mediate the interaction between erythroblasts and macrophages via trypsin-sensitive and trypsin-resistant receptors on the macrophage surface and that at least some of the antibodies show specificity for spectrin.",PMC2041027,,,,,,,

The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Forty-two cancers were observed in the series in comparison with 31.13 expected (p less than 0.05) on the basis of cancer morbidity rates for the West Midlands region. The excess was due to the high relative risk of cancers of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues (observed = 11, expected = 1.27, relative risk = 8.7, p less than 0.001). The effects of confounding factors, including duration of rheumatoid arthritis and hospital selection on the level and pattern of risk over time were examined.

We followed the changes in the synthesis and content of ferritin in this and other cell lines during differentiation. Ferritin content of HL-60 cells ranged from 11 to 81 fg/cell, depending on the clone tested. Following exposure to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA) an increase in ferritin and a decrease in total protein synthesis was observed, resulting in increased ferritin content, reaching a peak after 2 days. This increase occurred prior to the appearance of the typical morphological and functional characteristics of mature granulocytes. A correlation was found between concentrations of DMSO effective in inducing differentiation and the increase in ferritin content. Other inducers of granulocyte differentiation had a similar effect, while 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an inducer of macrophage differentiation, had not. Another human cell line (U-937), which was induced into monocyte-like cells by RA, showed a twofold increase in ferritin content following differentiation. Addition of iron to the culture medium increased ferritin content of both differentiating and non-differentiating cells, but the former responded to lower concentrations of iron. The increase in ferritin during differentiation, however, was not related to an accelerated iron uptake.

This virus-induced burst growth occurs without the addition of erythropoietin (EP) which is normally required for erythroid progenitor growth in vitro. Erythroid progenitor cells from C57BL/6 mice infected in vitro with Friend virus are resistant to virus-induced burst growth, while cells from the B6.S mouse strain, which is congenic with C57BL/6 but possesses the 'Friend virus sensitivity' alleles at the Fv-2 locus, are susceptible. This susceptibility of the B6.S cells demonstrates that virus-induced burst growth is regulated by the Fv-2 gene. Two mechanisms by which the Fv-2 locus could control virus resistance were analysed. The possible modulation of the erythroproliferative effect of the virus by soluble substances which either promote burst growth in the sensitive strains or inhibit growth in the resistant strain was examined. Also, the possible restriction of virus infection or replication in resistant (Fv-2rr) haemopoietic cells was investigated. In a variety of experimental conditions designed to test the effects of soluble growth promoters on bone marrow cells infected in vitro, the resistance of C57BL/6 cells to erythroid burst formation could not be overcome. Neither could resistance be transferred to co-cultured sensitive cells by any soluble substances produced in culture by C57BL/6 cells. Use of haemopoietic cells from C57BL/6 animals in various physiological states of haemopoiesis also did not overcome the resistance to virus-induced burst growth. Quantification of several parameters of viral replication in whole marrow cultures or in erythroblasts from bursts of the Fv-2 sensitive and Fv-2 resistant congenic mouse strains showed that haemopoietic cells of both strains support virus growth equally well. These data suggest that Fv-2rr-mediated resistance to the erythroproliferative effect of Friend virus infection in vitro is an inherent property of an erythroid progenitor target cell and is not determined by external factors. The resistance is also not due to restriction of virus replication.",,['AM-31513/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1099/0022-1317-66-1-83 [doi]'],,,,,

We have utilized these properties in preparing stable liposomes of doxorubicin and cardiolipin with a net positive charge. Doxorubicin liposomes were formed by using 11.2 mumol of drug, 5.6 mumol of cardiolipin, 28.5 mumol of phosphatidylcholine, 19.5 mumol of cholesterol, and 11.1 mumol of stearylamine. These liposomes were sonicated for 90 min at 37 degrees followed by extensive dialysis against buffer. The pharmacological, toxicological, and therapeutic effects of doxorubicin entrapped in cardiolipin liposomes were compared with those of free doxorubicin in mice. At a dose of 4 mg/kg i.v., the peak cardiac concentration was achieved in 30 min following free doxorubicin administration, the value being 8.1 micrograms/g. The peak cardiac concentration with doxorubicin in cardiolipin liposomes was obtained at 5 min with a value of 2.8 micrograms/g of tissue. The cardiac concentration X time values for free doxorubicin for the 24-hr period of observation were 55.1 micrograms X hr/g, whereas it was only 7.8 micrograms X hr/g with the drug entrapped in cardiolipin liposomes. Compared to free drug, the liposomal entrapped doxorubicin significantly reduced the histopathological lesions in cardiac tissue of mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg as determined by electron microscopy. The nadir of peripheral white blood cell counts in mice with free drug, 6 mg/kg, was observed on Day 3 which was 50% of control, whereas with liposomal encapsulated drug it was reduced only 23% on Day 7. Doxorubicin in cardiolipin liposomes demonstrated enhanced chemotherapeutic potential against murine ascitic P388 leukemia with a 144% increased life span compared to 55% increased life span with free drug at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Days 1, 3, and 7. We conclude that doxorubicin liposomes developed in these studies possess improved therapeutic action as demonstrated by their ability to reduce the toxicity of the drug substantially.",,['CA2P30 CA1-4626/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Multiple i.p. injections of ABMFPP (125 mg/kg/injection) significantly augmented the cytotoxicity of both natural killer cells and macrophages in peritoneal exudates. The augmentation of both effector cell populations was delayed, but was more pronounced when animals received a dose of CY (100 mg/kg) prior to ABMFPP injections. The combination of CY and ABMFPP also showed a synergistic anti-P388 leukemia effect which appeared to be related to the initial reduction of the tumor burden by CY and the marked augmentation of the cytotoxicity of both natural killer cells and macrophages by ABMFPP. The antitumor activity of ABMFPP against B16 melanoma was almost completely eliminated when animals received a dose of 400 rads X-irradiation 5 days prior to tumor inoculation or a dose of 200 rads X-irradiation followed by several injections of anti-asialo monosialoganglioside antibody. The administration of anti-asialo monosialoganglioside alone also markedly reduced the anti-B16 melanoma activity of ABMFPP. The magnitude of reduction of the antitumor effect of ABMFPP by radiation and/or anti-asialo monosialoganglioside antibody directly correlated with the inhibition of the ABMFPP-mediated augmentation of immune responses. These results strongly suggest that the antitumor effect of ABMFPP alone or in combination with CY is at least in part mediated through its augmentation of natural killer cell and/or macrophage activities.",,,,,,,,

Human serum components inhibited the lytic activity of RC in the presence of murine monoclonal antibodies. The total concentration of bone marrow cells proved critical in determining the complete elimination of tumor.

A critical feature of the synchronization technique that determines chromosome length is the period of cell culture following thymidine release. This will depend on cell cycle time.

We studied 26 patients with acute leukemia and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, comparing those who recovered from chemotherapy-induced granulocytopenia (Group 1, 15 patients) with those who did not (Group 2, 11 patients). Radiographic evidence of pulmonary cavitation was not seen in any Group 2 patient, but developed in 11 of 15 (73%) Group 1 patients (p less than 0.005). In these patients, cavitation always occurred after marrow recovery, an average of 2.0 days (range: 0 to 6 days) after the granulocyte count exceeded 500/mm3. Eight patients in Group 1 and 2 in Group 2 experienced a total of 38 episodes of hemoptysis. Four of the 26 patients, all in Group 1, developed massive hemoptysis (greater than 150 ml of blood per episode), leading to 1 death. In 3 of these 4 patients, cavitation preceded the episode of massive hemoptysis. At the time of massive bleeding, the granulocyte count was greater than 500/mm3, the platelet count greater than 38,000/mm3, and the other coagulation parameters were normal in all 4 patients. Our findings demonstrate that in patients with acute leukemia undergoing chemotherapy, bone marrow recovery markedly influences the clinical and radiographic course of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Development of a granulocyte count greater than 500/mm3 is associated with pulmonary cavitation, and on occasion with massive hemoptysis.",,,['10.1164/arrd.1985.131.1.115 [doi]'],,,,,

Special emphasis was placed on the platelet parameter. Precision, linearity, and carryover were found to be well within the manufacturer's specifications. A total of 222 patient samples were analyzed in the routine laboratory and on the Model S-Plus IV. Coefficients of correlation of 0.99 or higher were obtained for white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hgb), platelets (Plt), except mean cell volume (MCV) (r = 0.93). Results from 99 selected normal samples were compared with those from manual reference methods. Coefficients of correlation of 0.98 or higher were obtained for WBC, RBC, and Hgb. For MCV, the correlation coefficient was 0.85 and for Plt, 0.89 was obtained. The lower coefficient of correlation for these two parameters may be a function of the imprecision of the manual reference methods. In a previous study with an original Model S-Plus, the Plt parameter occasionally exhibited spuriously high counts. With the advent of third-generation S-Plus instruments, represented by the Model S-Plus IV, the possibility of reporting aberrant Plt values virtually has been eliminated.

The alpha- and gamma-t-butyl esters, respectively, of methotrexate were coupled to poly(L-lysine) with diphenylphosphoryl azide in N,N-dimethylformamide, the ester-protecting group was cleaved with 15% hydrogen bromide in acetic acid, and small molecules were removed by dialysis. Poly(L-lysine) of Mr = 1,500-8,000 and 8,000-30,000 was used to prepare six different conjugates, which were characterized by ultraviolet absorbance measurement and quantitative amino acid analysis. The degree of substitution varied from one methotrexate per 4.7 lysines to one methotrexate per 10.2 lysines. Dihydrofolate reductase inhibition in a cell-free assay was observed with alpha- and gamma-conjugates, but the latter had the greater affinity (only 3-fold less than that of methotrexate itself). The binding of the conjugates exhibited a slight pH dependence, with affinity being greater at pH 7.2 than at pH 8.5 for both alpha- and gamma-conjugates. Toxicity to cultured rat hepatoma cells (H35) was also greater for the gamma-conjugates, and showed some dependence on the chain-length and degree of substitution of the poly(L-lysine) carrier. Cells resistant to methotrexate by virtue of a transport defect (H35R0.3 line) retained their sensitivity to the gamma-conjugate, but less so to the alpha-conjugate. There was also some retention of sensitivity in a more highly resistant cell line (H35R10) with impaired methotrexate transport and a concomitant increase in dihydrofolate reductase activity. gamma-Conjugation was likewise more favorable in cytotoxicity assays against L1210 murine leukemia cells, and there was partial retention of activity against highly methotrexate-resistant lines (L1210/R71 and L1210/R81) with a transport defect and/or an elevation of dihydrofolate reductase content. In antitumor assays against intraperitoneal L1210 leukemia in mice, a gamma-conjugate with Mr = 8,000-30,000 and one methotrexate per 5.5 lysines produced a 35-75% increase in lifespan when administered intraperitoneally at single doses equivalent to 10-20 mg/kg of methotrexate. A similar increase in lifespan with methotrexate alone on the single-dose regimen required 50-150 mg/kg. An alpha-conjugate of similar Mr and degree of substitution was inactive at nontoxic doses, as were other gamma-conjugates of lower Mr and/or degree of substitution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"['CA19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30897/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

Uptake was mediated by a temperature-dependent system with high affinity (apparent Km 24 +/- 4 microM) for histidine. Newly formed histamine was incorporated into the intracellular pool of histamine. In confluent cultures, substantial amounts of histamine were lost to the medium while intracellular histamine levels remained constant. As calculated from the rate of appearance of histamine in the medium, the maximum turnover time for the intracellular histamine pool (2-7 nmol/10(6) cells) was about 12 hr. Variation in histamine content, histidine uptake and histidine decarboxylation was noted with different passages of 2H3 cells, but with all passages there were characteristic changes in these parameters during growth and division of the cells. Separation of cells into fractions of different size by elutriation indicated low rates of histidine uptake and decarboxylation in the smallest 2H3 cells, a progressive increase in ability to take up and decarboxylate histidine as the cells approached the S phase of growth and marked decline in this ability in fractions containing the larger cells. The changes in kinetic constants suggested that fluctuation in histidine uptake during the life cycle of the 2H3 cell was due to changes in the number of active carriers or sites of histidine transport and that during cell division all components associated with histamine synthesis (i.e., histidine uptake and decarboxylation) were diminished.",,,,,,,,

Recurring chromosome abnormalities also correlated with specific ANLL histologic subtypes, such as t(8;21) with acute myelogenous leukemia and t(15;17) with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Presence or absence of cytogenetic abnormalities was compared with the ability of patients to achieve remission. Individuals exhibiting clonal abnormalities in bone marrow cells had an equally likely chance of achieving remission (74%) as those individuals with normal karyotypes (75%). Nonrandom chromosome abnormalities associated with a high induction success rate included +8 with a 94% induction success rate (P = .13) and t(8;21) with a 91% success rate (P = .46). Patients exhibiting the -7 abnormality associated with overall loss of 7q had a significantly less successful induction outcome, with only 28% achieving remission (P = .02); three of seven patients with t(15;17) died during induction therapy.",,"['CA 02649/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 03526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 14557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['10.1200/JCO.1985.3.1.3 [doi]'],,,,,

The bifunctional alkylating agent diethylamine 2,2'-dichloro-N-methyl-hydrochloride was used as reference. The alkylating activity was assessed by reacting with 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine, and antitumor activity was determined against L1210 in vitro and in vivo. The L1210 response, which is consistent with useful alkylating reactivity, was very marked with the two nitrosoureas and procarbazine. The nitrosoureas and, to some extent, procarbazine decreased the tumorigenicity of L1210 leukemia as evidenced by the increase in survival times with increasing numbers of treatment generations. After treatment for about five transfers (10(6) cells i.p.) with methylnitrosourea (40 mg/kg i.p. on Days 1, 3, and 5), the untreated control mice consistently survived free of tumor, whereas the treated mice died before Day 30. After treatment with ethylnitrosourea (80 mg/kg), the survival times also increased but more in the treated than in the corresponding control groups. Methylnitrosourea was most efficient in increasing the survival times and abolishing tumor transplantability. Antigenic change and loss of growth potential presumably were the reason for this increase in survival time, as indicated by tests in X-irradiated and nude mice.

Then, the doses of challenge cells which produced 50% tumor deaths were calculated for immunized and control mice.

For adult C57BL/6J mice, a single immunization with MuLV-induced leukemia cells was not effective; either cells plus Bacillus Calmette-Guerin or Corynebacterium parvum, or else two immunizations with irradiated leukemia cells were needed to produce statistically significant increases in the values of the doses of challenge cells which produced 50% tumor deaths. Cross-protection was obtained by immunization with other isogenic MuLV-induced leukemias, but not by immunization with isogenic carcinogen-induced tumors or with an isogenic spontaneous leukemia. For newborn mice, a single injection of irradiated leukemia cells provided 1.3 to 1.5 logs of protection, and admixture of B.

A single injection of formalin-treated isogenic leukemia cells admixed with C. parvum provided between 1.7 and 2.8 logs of protection.

Phenotypic analysis of these nonleukemic cells with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against NK cells revealed that the CLL patients had higher percentages of HNK-1-positive cells (23.5% compared to controls with 14.7%). In contrast, VEP13-positive cells were absent or low in seven patients (0.8% compared to controls with 11.2%) and normal in four patients (10.5%).

Isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorter of HNK-1-positive cells from patients lacking VEP13-positive cells and NK cell activity indicated that the majority of the HNK-1-positive cells in these patients had the large granular lymphocyte morphology that is characteristic of NK cells.

The mean age was 47 years (range, 36 to 58). Six of seven patients had prior splenectomies with minor or transient hematologic responses. One patient had no spleen enlargement. The seven patients had never received any cytotoxic drugs and had prolonged granulocytopenia (less than 300/microL) with recurrent, severe infectious episodes. Chemotherapy included Rubidazone (zorubicine hydrochloride) 450 mg/m2 on day 1, arabinosyl cytosine 200 mg/m2/d from day 1 to day 5, and cyclophosphamide, 2,000 mg/m2 on day 5. Responses were assessed through examination of repeat bone marrow biopsy specimens and blood counts. A complete response was defined as normal blood counts associated with the disappearance of hairy cell infiltration and fibrosis on the bone marrow biopsy specimens. A partial response was defined as normal blood counts with persistence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow. Three patients achieved a complete response, and one patient had a partial response. Three patients died of infectious complications during induction chemotherapy. For the responding patients, the mean duration of aplasia was 37 +/- 5 days. Follow-up for the responding patients has been 44+, 24, 32+, and 23+ months. One patient with a complete response died while on maintenance therapy.

Using potentiometric absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism measurements, we have shown that adriamycin can form two complexes with Pd(II). The first complex (I) involves two molecules of drug per Pd(II) ion; one of the molecules is chelated to Pd(II) through the carbonyl oxygen on C12 and the phenolate oxygen on C11, and the other one is bound to Pd(II) through the nitrogen of the amino sugar. This complexation induces a stacking of the two molecules of drug. In the second complex (II), two Pd(II) ions are bound to two molecules of drug (A1 and A2). One Pd(II) is bound to the oxygen on the carbons C11 and C12 of molecule A1 and the amino sugar of molecule A2 whereas the second Pd(II) ion is bound to the oxygen on C11 and C12 of molecule A2 and the amino sugar of molecule A1. The same complexes are formed between Pd(II) and daunorubicin. The stability constant for complex II is beta = (1.3 +/- 0.5) X 10(22). Interaction with DNA has been studied, showing that almost no modification of the complex occurred. This complex displays antitumor activity against P-388 leukemia that compares with that of the free drug.

All other patients had a marked stenosis of the retrohepatic IVC with caval pressure ranging from 12 to 24 mmHg (mean: 17 mmHg). Seven patients had an interposition mesocaval shunt using an autologous jugular vein. The patient with a thrombosed SMV had a portoatrial shunt. The patient with an obstructed IVC had a cavoatrial shunt after an erroneous portacaval shunt had failed to relieve ascites. There were no operative deaths and no major postoperative complications. One patient died 19 months after operation of acute leukemia complicating polycythemia rubra vera. All other patients were alive and well 8 months to 6 years after operation. None of them had encephalopathy. These results suggest several comments: Portal systemic shunts are a good treatment for BCS and have a low operative risk. The mesocaval shunt is an efficient procedure, even when there is stenosis of the IVC with high caval pressure; shunts to the right atrium should be performed only in the case of complete obstruction or inaccessibility of the IVC. The long-term prognosis is excellent, except in patients with potential malignancies.

With the exception of the cases of 9; 22 (Ph1) and 11q23 translocations, each of which is found in both myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, any one abnormality is rarely encountered in association with both categories of malignancy. Recent studies indicate that, with regard to many of the known chromosome translocations, the break occurs at a point close to the location of a specific cellular oncogene. Thus, c-myc and c-abl, which reside in 8q24 and 9q34, respectively, are known to undergo rearrangement in cases of 8q24 and 9; 22 translocations. These rearrangements have been proved to give rise to the production of an abnormal protein, which seems to cause the malignant transformation of cells with such chromosome translocations.

These three periods are approximately equivalent to before, during, and after World War II and span a total hiring period of more than 75 years. The results showed that a substantial portion of the cohort (3,330 or 27%) had been recruited during 1940-1945, and they contributed 980 or 28% of the total deaths. However, their mortality experience was quite different from the rest. A series of significant increases were seen among the external causes for accidents, suicide, and homicide. In terms of overall mortality and in contrast to the rest of the cohort, no ""healthy worker effect"" was seen (SMR = 1.00). They also showed increases in several types of cancer including cancers of the pancreas and prostate and leukemia. These unusual experiences cannot be explained either on the basis of their war-related deaths or on their period of employment (one-half were terminated within 1 year from date of hire), and data is insufficient to separate the role of hiring practices or their socioeconomic status. However, their life-styles were probably quite different judged from the fact that alcoholism-related deaths were increased as much as fivefold. Almost two-thirds of the total deaths occurred among 4,080 workers in the before 1940 subcohort. Further, the 5,117 workers of the after-1945 subcohort contributed only 5% of the total deaths. Thus, the results of the original refinery cohort (1937-1978) primarily reflect the experience of those employees hired before 1940. Given the same cohort method (historical prospective), cohort results vary widely according to different study designs, and this has implications for ""generalizable"" risk assessment or risk projections. A prospective study of new hires with 30 years of follow-up is rather inefficient because it would yield only a small number of deaths, with a strong healthy worker effect.

Virus insertion interferes with the synthesis of stable alpha 1(I) collagen messenger RNA and causes a recessive lethal mutation. The virus insertion has induced changes of the methylation pattern as well as the chromatin conformation in the mutated gene. Specifically, a DNase-hypersensitive site which is associated with active transcription of the wild-type collagen gene is not present in the mutant allele. The block of collagen expression could be caused by virus-induced instability of collagen mRNA or by impaired initiation of transcription. To distinguish between these possibilities, we have compared the activity of the alpha 1(I) collagen gene promoter in cell lines derived from wild-type and Mov13 embryos by nuclear run-on transcription experiments and S1 mapping of nuclear RNA. We show here that initiation of transcription of the mutant gene is reduced 20-100-fold. This indicates that the virus-induced change of chromatin structure in the promoter region of the mutant gene prevents RNA polymerase from binding to its DNA template. Our results are consistent with the notion that the promoter-associated DNase-hypersensitive site is a prerequisite for rather than a consequence of gene activity.",,"['HD-19015/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA38497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1038/320365a0 [doi]'],,,,,

When the principal uptake component was blocked by a specific irreversible inhibitor of this system, the remaining route (at pH 7.4) appeared to be saturable and was inhibited by several anions in addition to bromosulfophthalein (Ki = 2 microM), including 8-anilino-1-naphthalein sulfonate (Ki = 25 microM), unlabeled phthalate (Ki = 500 microM), and chloride (Ki = 3500 microM). A pronounced effect by pH was also observed. Influx and total uptake of phthalate both increased progressively with decreasing pH and reached values that were 20-fold higher at pH 6.0, compared with pH 7.4. This pH-dependent increase could be blocked, however, by the addition of compounds (nigericin and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) which, in combination, collapse proton gradients. Phthalate efflux was relatively insensitive to changes in extracellular pH but could be inhibited (up to 90%) by bromosulfophthalein. Several other anions also inhibited efflux, but to a lesser extent, while chloride, phthalate, lactate, glycolate and acetate enhanced efflux up to 1.8-fold. Efflux also increased at pH 6.0, but not at pH 7.5, upon addition of nigericin and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. These results suggest that phthalate is a nonphysiological substrate for a carrier system which mediates transport via an anion/H+ symport mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,['10.1007/BF01870899 [doi]'],,,,,

An examination of the resistant phenotype of cells derived through this model of tumor progression revealed that the more aggressive in vivo grown cells were less able to inhibit natural killer (NK) cell cytolysis and to bind natural antibodies (NAb) measured through fluorescence analysis, although they could not be distinguished from the starting clones by absorption of NAb for complement-mediated lysis. The in vivo grown cells also exhibited a reduced sensitivity to hypotonic lysis, which was not detectable after preincubation at 4 degrees C or upon exposure to sodium azide, procedures that reduced the lysis of the starting clones. The differential susceptibility of the in vivo grown cells was increased to control levels by treatment with cycloheximide or colchicine. These studies suggest that a decreased sensitivity to lysis associated with a reduced autolytic process and an increased counterlytic mechanism, in addition to a reduced antigen expression for binding of NK cells and certain NAb contribute to this resistant phenotype, which may characterize tumors that arise under the selective pressure of natural resistance mechanisms in the natural course of neoplastic development.",,,,,,,,

The inhibitor can be extracted with organic solvents and has properties consistent with it being a lipid or lipid-like component of the membrane. This report identifies a series of cloned macrophage hybridoma cell lines, obtained by fusion of splenic adherent cells and the P388D1 line, which have very high levels of lipid-like growth-inhibitory molecules. Furthermore, a survey of seven cloned lines indicated that the macrophages fell into two distinct groups with regard to their level of growth-inhibitory activity. Group 1 lines had little or no inhibitory activity when cells were examined for their effect on a B lymphocyte proliferative response. Organic extracts from these macrophages had inhibitory activity (on a per cell basis) comparable to that seen with extracts of the P388D1 parental cell line and lymphoid tumor cells. In contrast, relatively low numbers of Group 2 macrophages could profoundly inhibit B macrophage proliferation. The growth-inhibitory activity was quantitatively recovered in organic extracts of the macrophages. Although the precise nature of the lipid moiety remains undefined, the data argue against the involvement of oxidized cholesterol. These findings indicate that lipid-like inhibitors of cell growth are present and functional in these macrophage cell lines. In addition, the results demonstrate that the inhibitory activity found in plasma membranes and liposomes is present and active in the membranes of intact cells, which is in contrast to the possibility that the inhibitor is an artifact generated during subcellular fractionation. Thus, the inhibitor is likely to have a physiologic role in growth control and in macrophage-mediated immunoregulation, probably acting via a mechanism involving cell-cell contact.",,['CA-14723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

If cells were preincubated with ricin followed by antibodies, MAb 207 E5 and 216 B3 had a strong enhancing effect on toxin action. If antibodies and toxin were mixed and then added to sensitive cells, antibody 207 E5 gave a strong protection while 216 B3 maintained its enhancing activity. The effect of antibody 216 B3 was further investigated by quantitative cloning experiments which showed that toxin had a fivefold enhancement in its activity by a preincubation with this antibody.

Such a specific regulation mechanism is demonstrated here for a qualitative change--i.e., varying timing of DNA-replication--at the putative c-myc gene locus in band 15E of murine T-cell leukemia. In intraspecific hybrids between tumor and non-tumor cells this qualitative change spreads over to all chromosomes 15 of the same cell, irrespective of their origin. This effect is thought to reflect a binary trans-acting regulation mechanism between homologous chromosomal loci. In the past specific chromosomal aberrations have been described in various tumors but none of these aberrations involve the X chromosome.

Fourteen patients had congenital vascular malformations, most frequently AV-angiomas (9 patients). A Sturge-Weber-Syndrome and a venous angioma were found in two cases and one patient had an aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery. Thirty-eight patients had acquired cerebrovascular diseases such as ischaemic infarctions (22), intracranial haemorrhages without vascular malformations (14) and thromboses of the dural sinus (2). The cerebral infraction was a complication of a congenital heart disease in 8 children, two others suffered from chronic renal insufficiency and were on haemodialysis. Two children had a trauma of the internal carotid artery and in one patient a large haemorrhagic infarct was caused by hypernatremic dehydration. In 9 patients (6 females, 3 males) no obvious aetiology of the infarct could be found. However, in most of these cases a nonspecific febrile illness preceded the neurological manifestations. The thrombosis of the dural sinus occurred in a 6-week old previously healthy infant and in a 3-year old boy as a complication of a nephrotic syndrome. Intracranial haemorrhages (without cerebrovascular malformations) occurred in 14 patients, mainly as a complication of haematological diseases (acute lymphatic leukaemia, severe aplastic anaemia, haemophilia A, lupus erythematodes). Four children had spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhages without obvious causes.

Whether this is reactive or neoplastic in nature has been debated. We report the first case of an aggressive NK cell leukemia in an adult with establishment of an NK cell line. A 70-year-old man had two spontaneous episodes of jejunal perforation and one month later developed a severe febrile illness with moderate splenomegaly. Hemoglobin was 13.1 g/L, and WBC count was 1.8 X 10(9)/L with 2% large granular lymphocytes (LGLs). Platelet count was 143 X 10(9)/L; prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were normal. Bone marrow was infiltrated with 25% to 30% LGLs; serum lysozyme was normal. Serum LDH was initially 1,191 U/L and rose to 6,408 (normal 240 to 525 U/L). Ten days later, the WBC count increased to 99.9 X 10(9)/L with 70% LGL cells; the PT and PTT increased, and the platelet count dropped. No bacterial or viral cause of fever was identified. The cells from peripheral blood were LGLs that stained positively for acid phosphatase. All of the LGLs reacted with a monoclonal antibody reactive with NK cells (LEU-11b). Functionally, the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMs) demonstrated 100 times more lytic activity against K562 tumor cell lines than did normal PBMs. The patient's PBMs were propagated in vitro. The cultured cells showed the morphological, cytochemical, immunological, and functional characteristics of NK cells. In addition, partial trisomy involving chromosome 1 q with duplication in regions of q21 through q31 was observed in all metaphases analyzed. The extra chromosome 1q with duplication in regions q21 through q31 was translocated to the p-terminal of chromosome 5. One percent to 5% of normal PBMs comprise NK cells; in most cases, leukemias arise from normal phenotypic counterparts. This case demonstrated that aggressive NK cell leukemia may occur in adults. In addition, the chromosomal abnormalities suggest that this is not a reactive process but a malignancy.",,,['S0006-4971(20)81260-9 [pii]'],,,,,

The inhibitory effects of these compounds on thymidylate synthase were in the order BAT greater than IAT greater than CAT, which is in agreement with their cytotoxic effects in L1210 cells. In the presence of substrate during preincubation, the concentration required for 50% inhibition of the enzyme activity by these inhibitors was 4-8-fold higher than it was in the absence of dUMP. The I50 values for BAT were 1 X 10(-5) M and 1.2 X 10(-6) M in the presence and absence, respectively, of dUMP during preincubation. These results were in agreement with the observed inhibition of thymidylate synthase by BAT in intact L1210 cells. A Lineweaver-Burk plot revealed that BAT behaved as a competitive inhibitor. The Km for the enzyme was 9.2 microM, and the Ki determined for competitive inhibition by BAT was 5.4 microM. Formation of a tight, irreversible complex is inferred from the finding that BAT-inactivation of thymidylate synthase was not reversible on prolonged dialysis and that the enzyme-BAT complex was nondissociable by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column or by TSK-125 column chromatography. Incubation of thymidylate synthase with BAT resulted in time-dependent, irreversible loss of enzyme activity by first-order kinetics. The rate constant for inactivation was 0.4 min-1, and the steady-state constant of inactivation, Ki, was estimated to be 6.6 microM. The 5'-haloacetamido-5'-deoxythymidines provide specific inhibitors of thymidylate synthase that may also serve as reagents for studying the enzyme mechanism.",,['R01 CA23173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0304-4165(86)90003-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(86)90003-6 [doi]']",,,,,

Presenting features were similar to those in previous reports of primary lymphoma of Waldeyer's ring except for the striking degree of cranial nerve dysfunction (83 per cent) in patients with secondary nasopharyngeal disease.

Direct methylation of 1 with CH3I furnished 4-O-methylpyrazofurin (6). Dehydration of the pentaacetylpyrazofurin (9) with phosgene furnished 4-acetoxy-3-(2,3,5-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-1-acetylpyrazol e-5-carbonitrile (10). A similar dehydration of the precursor tetraacetyl derivative of 4 gave the corresponding carbonitrile, which on deprotection and subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine furnished 4- (benzyloxy)-3-beta-D-ribofuranosylpyrazole-5-carboxamidoxime (13).

Phosphorylation of unprotected 4 with POCl3 and subsequent debenzylation of the intermediate 17 gave pyrazofurin 5'-phosphate (18), which provided the first chemical synthesis of 18. Similar phosphorylation of 4 with POCl3 and quenching the reaction mixture with either EtOH or MeOH, followed by debenzylation, furnished the 5'-O-(ethyl phosphate) (19b) and 5'-O-(dimethyl phosphate) (20b) derivatives of pyrazofurin. DCC-mediated cyclization of 17, followed by debenzylation, gave pyrazofurin 3',5'-(cyclic)phosphate (21b). The NAD analogue 23b was also prepared by the treatment of 17 with an activated form of AMP in the presence of AgNO3. The structural assignment of 7,8, and 20a were made by single-crystal X-ray analysis, and along with pyrazofurin, their intramolecular hydrogen bond characteristics have been studied. All of these compounds were tested in Vero cell cultures against a spectrum of viruses.

Induction of an anti-GCSAa secondary antibody response has been found to require the use of liposomes as GCSAa vehicle for both the priming and the boosting immunizations. In order to investigate the sensitivity of highly immune cells to the liposome presentation, immune spleen cells were stimulated in vitro with either soluble GCSAa or GCSAa-liposomes and transferred together with the immunogen into syngeneic animals. Only spleen cells from high responders, which have been immunized twice with GCSAa-liposomes, were able to generate an antibody response in naive recipients after their restimulation with the GCSAa-liposome preparation. Their restimulation with soluble antigen was ineffective unless 10% peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from naive rats were added during the in vitro incubation. Stimulation with GCSAa-liposomes was further improved by the addition of 10% PEC. Macrophages were found to play a central role in the induction of antibody response in the recipients after stimulation with GCSAa-liposomes.

However, mice treated with CYT and DSF appeared to have longer-lasting neutropenia than animals treated with CYT alone. To determine whether DSF uroprotection of CYT-treated mice was associated with increased myeloid toxicity, we examined the effects of DSF plus CYT treatment on the bone marrow granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cell (GM-CFC). Marrow cellularity and GM-CFC numbers were analyzed at 1, 2 and 3 days after injection of CYT (62.5 or 125 mg/kg) or CYT plus DSF (200 mg/kg). CYT alone caused a decrease in total marrow cellularity varying from 20% to 50% of control. Animals given CYT plus DSF had a somewhat greater decrease in total marrow cellularity than those treated with CYT alone. However, in mice treated with CYT plus DSF, the GM-CFC were relatively well preserved and the recovery of the GM-CFC was not prolonged by DSF.

The in vitro myelotoxicity of C-6 compared with that of melphalan, a clinically active, myelosuppressive nitrogen mustard, was determined in the CFU-C assay in human bone marrow samples obtained from normal volunteers. There was no significant difference between the myelosuppressive actions of C-6 and melphalan at any of the concentrations used except for 4.0 microM, at which C-6 was significantly (P less than 0.05) more toxic than melphalan. Both agents decreased the number of bone marrow cell colonies to approximately 12% of control at 6.6 microM (1 h incubation), which is a good approximation of melphalan's CxT (concentration by time) in man. We used the human tumor stem cell assay (HTSCA) to investigate in vitro antitumor activity. We obtained two specimens of malignant melanoma and two of malignant ovarian carcinoma from patients not previously treated with chemotherapy. The antitumor activity of melphalan was either similar to or greater than that of C-6 at all concentrations utilized against any of the four tumor specimens, except at 1.3 microM for tumor I. In particular, there was no significant difference in the antitumor activities of the two agents at 6.6 microM. These results suggest that C-6 will not be less myelosuppressive than melphalan at doses that produce equivalent antitumor activity in man. In addition, C-6 did not demonstrate increased myelotoxicity for normal human bone marrow cells incubated in glucose-deficient medium as against medium containing 300 mg% glucose at any of the concentrations used. This suggests that C-6 is not transported into normal human bone marrow cells via the glucose transport system, despite the presence of a glucose moiety within the molecule.",,['R01 CA28984/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1007/BF00256165 [doi]'],,,,,

DisuDAG is a new derivative of hexitols with favorable therapeutic indices on rodent tumors. On the basis of IC50 values in molar concentrations, dianhydrogalactitol was five to six times more toxic than DiacDAG, and mitolactol was 36 (K562) or 80 (P388) times more toxic than DisuDAG. N-Formylleurosine was found to be 20 (P388) or 1000 (K562) times less toxic than vincristine. The large difference was due to the high resistance of K562 cells to N-formylleurosine. Both cell lines were very sensitive to doxorubicin: IC50 after 1 hour of exposure of P388 cells = 240 nM and after 1 hour of exposure of K562 cells = 275 nM. Continuous exposure to methotrexate resulted in 11 and 14.5 nM for P388 and K562 cells, respectively.

In L1210 cells several DPP derivatives caused a rise in the mitotic index which correlated well with the cytotoxicity of the drugs. Active DPP derivatives markedly stimulated tubulin-dependent guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis and inhibited tubulin polymerization or induced tubulin oligomer formation, depending on specific reaction conditions. These new agents, however, did not interfere with the binding to tubulin of radiolabeled colchicine, vinblastine, maytansine, or guanosine triphosphate. They thus appear to bind at a previously undescribed site on the tubulin molecule. Some DPP derivatives have significant herbicidal activity, causing mitotic disruption and a rise in the mitotic index in seedling root tissues. Although the DPP derivatives most toxic to plant tissues differ from those most active in inhibiting calf brain tubulin polymerization, virtually all active compounds bear a nitrile substituent at position 4 of the pyridazinone ring. Most active derivatives also bear substituents of varying structure at position 2 of this ring, but no clear structure-function pattern is apparent at this position. The phenyl rings in the most active herbicidal DPP derivatives either are unsubstituted or bear fluorine atoms. Derivatives with chlorine substituents have no detectable herbicidal activity. In contrast, interactions with calf brain tubulin are substantially enhanced if the phenyl rings bear chlorine substituents.",,,,,,,,

Survival of the cells using a soft agar clonogenic assay was plotted against the time at final temperature so that a Do (min of heat required to reduce survival by 63% on the exponential portion of the survival curve) could be calculated as an estimate of thermosensitivity. Cells heated from 37 degrees C-42 degrees C over a time period of 30 min (10 degrees C/h) were less thermosensitive (Do 62.7 +/- 12.5 min) as compared to those exposed immediately to 42 degrees C (Do 38.5 +/- 2.2 min). Cells heated over a period of 180 min (1.6 degrees C/h) showed almost no death even after 4 h at 42 degrees C. Thermosensitivity of cells heated to several other high temperatures was also a function of rate of heating. This relative thermal resistance induced by slow heating was not a result of a change in membrane cholesterol content or fatty acid composition. Similarly, there was no difference between cells heated at slow and fast rates in cell cycle distribution or in cellular protein concentration. The major heat shock protein of Mr 70,000, which was induced by immediate heating, was not synthesized at the same high rate 1-12 h after heat treatment by the cells made thermotolerant with slow heating. We conclude that the thermosensitivity of this neoplastic cell can be altered considerably by the rate of heating. This alteration is not due to a change in membrane lipids. Furthermore, the heat shock protein at Mr 70,000 which was synthesized after immediate heating could not be demonstrated in the gradually heated L1210 leukemia cells.",,"['CA 31526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR59/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

This regulation of neuroblastoma cells was believed to reflect an underlying event in the development of migrating embryonic neuroblasts. The current experiments were done to determine the effect on regulation with further embryonic development. The results indicated that later embryos (13 to 17 days of gestation) have a widespread inhibitory effect in all tissues tested, including the adrenal gland, testis, kidney, liver, limb bud, and heart.

No transferrin or transferrin-like molecules were detected in the conditioned medium from cells established in serum-free medium plus iron. In these cells, iron uptake was found to occur through a saturable transport system exhibiting the properties of an allosteric regulatory protein. This transferrin-independent iron transport coexisted with transferrin-mediated iron uptake. When the iron concentration in the medium is less than 0.1 microM, transferrin must be present in the culture medium in order to observe cell growth. Under these culture conditions, a 16- to 18-h treatment with a 1 mM concentration of the iron chelator desferrioxamine resulted in less than 20% DNA synthesis compared to control cultures. DNA synthesis was reinitiated without a lag time after addition of 1 mM ferric citrate to the culture medium. No heme synthesis was needed to observe this DNA synthesis. However, in the presence of the antioxidant propyl gallate the reinitiation of DNA synthesis was abolished. Ferricyanide could not replace ferric citrate as a stimulant of DNA synthesis.

Evidence was obtained for a single influx route for methotrexate: (a) Influx at 2 microM [3H]methotrexate was inhibited completely by high concentrations of unlabeled methotrexate, o-phthalate, and bromosulfophthalein, and the inhibition profile with each anion was monophasic; and (b) Pretreatment of the cells with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of methotrexate also blocked influx, and this inhibition was complete over a range of substrate concentrations from 2 to 50 microM. Influx was also saturable and proceeded with a maximum rate (Vmax) of 4.3 pmol/min/mg protein (at 37 degrees C) and with a Kt of 0.8 microM in an anion-deficient buffer and 4.6 microM in a 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonate-buffered saline. The ratio of Vmax to the amount of carrier protein (0.3 pmol/mg protein) gave a turnover number for the transport system of 14.3/min. In contrast to influx, methotrexate efflux proceeded via three routes which could be separated by their sensitivity to specific inhibitors. The major portion of efflux occurred via the methotrexate influx carrier, the identity of which was established from its sensitivity to the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of methotrexate and by its requirement for anions in the external medium. Methotrexate, adenosine monophosphate, and phosphate each stimulated efflux via this route and this stimulation was half-maximal at anion concentrations that approximated their Ki values for inhibition of methotrexate influx. A second efflux route was identified by its sensitivity to bromosulfophthalein. This route was relatively inactive and did not fluctuate significantly upon addition of various anions, glucose, or metabolic inhibitors. The third route was quantitated by its sensitivity to probenecid and its activity was increased in saline buffers and upon addition of glucose and was inhibited by oligomycin. Similar transport routes for methotrexate are present in L1210 mouse cells, although these two cell lines can be distinguished by the amount of transport protein and by the activity of the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive efflux route for methotrexate.",,['CA 23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

To characterize the ferritin species that affect the in vitro growth of human colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), we tested different preparations of basic (L-subunit-rich) and acidic (H-subunit-rich) isoferritins. Three preparations of human liver (basic) ferritin did not show any effects on CFU-GM growth at concentrations up to 10(-9) mol/L, irrespective of the degree of glycosylation. Acidic isoferritins were purified both from HeLa cells and human heart. HeLa cell ferritin did not affect in vitro colony formation. One of two preparations of human heart ferritin, containing 5% glycosylated ferritin, showed a mean inhibition of 26% +/- 8% of the control at 10(-9) mol/L (P less than .02), whereas the other preparation, which contained no glycosylated ferritin, did not show any effect of CFU-GM growth. A preparation enriched for glycosylated acidic isoferritins from human heart was found to produce a mean inhibition of 32% +/- 11% of the control at 10(-9) mol/L (P less than .01), whereas another one was ineffective. A significant part of the inhibitory activity was removed by preincubation with the monoclonal antibody 2A4 directed against human heart ferritin. The present findings indicate that basic isoferritins, ie, the predominant ferritin type in human blood, have no effect on the growth of human CFU-GM, and this is in keeping with indirect clinical evidence. Inhibition of colony formation may be obtained by some preparations of acidic isoferritins that are rich in H subunits and bind to concanavalin A. The mechanism(s) responsible for this are not clear, but the effective concentrations are higher than those found in human blood both under normal conditions and in leukemia. At present, the physiologic significance of the observed inhibitory activity is uncertain.",,,['S0006-4971(20)81392-5 [pii]'],,,,,

However, flow cytometric analysis of blasts from three patients showed the simultaneous expression of the lymphoid-associated antigen B4 (CD-19) and the myeloid-associated antigen My-1 (X-Hapten). Electron microscopic examination of blasts from one patient that expressed both lymphoid- and myeloid-associated antigens demonstrated ultrastructural characteristics of both lineages. These findings suggest that acute leukemia with the t(4;11) abnormality has mixed lineage characteristics as a result of leukemogenesis in a multipotential progenitor cell or aberrant gene expression later in differentiation. Furthermore, serial analysis of karyotype, immunophenotype, and heavy-chain immunoglobulin genes revealed changes in these biologic markers over time, suggesting continued chromosome rearrangement and gene modulation after the leukemogenic event in cells with the t(4;11).",,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)81376-7 [pii]'],,,,,

In P388/DOX cells which are cross-resistant to vinblastine (VLB) and vincristine (VCR), cell kill following treatment with VLB and VCR alone was evident only after 12 hr of treatment. Additionally, the 2- to 10-fold increase in cytotoxicity of the vinca alkaloids in the presence of 2 and 4 microM trifluoperazine (TFP) was observed only in P388/DOX cells treated for 12 hr, but not for 3 or 6 hr.

Cellular accumulation of [3H]VLB in P388/DOX cells was 12-fold lower than in similarly treated P388/S cells and, in the presence of 2 and 4 microM TFP, cellular VLB levels were enhanced 1.3- to 2.0-fold in P388/S cells and 2- to 8-fold in P388/DOX cells.

DNA-protein crosslinking (PXL) immediately following platinum removal (used as a measure of active drug delivered to the cell nucleus) was not altered by theophylline nor were the kinetics of either DNA interstrand (ISC) or DNA-protein crosslink formation after DDP treatment changed by the presence of theophylline. Peak protein crosslinking occurred 6 hr and peak interstrand crosslinking occurred 12 hr after DDP removal. We measured crosslink removal by using thiourea to block the conversion of platinum monoadducts to crosslinks. DNA-protein crosslinks were removed more rapidly in the presence of theophylline. There was no change in interstrand crosslink removal rate when theophylline was present. We conclude that the addition of theophylline to DDP treatment results in decreased amounts of DNA interstrand crosslinking most likely by increasing the removal of DPP-DNA monoadducts.

Before raIFN, 11 patients had hairy cells (HC) in the PB; 11 were granulocytopenic; 12, monocytopenic; and 6, thrombocytopenic. The median bone marrow hairy cell index (HCI = %HC X %BM cellularity/10,000), an indicator of HC packing in the BM, was 0.56 (range, 0.12-0.83). The myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio was below 1:1 in all patients. By the end of the study, HC in the PB had disappeared or decreased in numbers.

Positive PRAT was observed in 85% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, as well as in about half the patients with CLL and a normal platelet count or amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. In contrast to findings in patients with idiopathic autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura or in those with leukemia who were alloimmunized, positive PRAT in patients with lymphoproliferative disease was predominantly caused by C3-only sensitization of platelets. Results were analyzed in relation to other clinical and laboratory findings. There was no significant difference in antiglobulin sensitization pattern between CLL and other lymphomas, different cell type, stage of disease, presence or absence of splenomegaly, recent or distant chemotherapy, sex, or history of pregnancy. Previous transfusion did affect antiglobulin sensitization patterns, as did presence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. A high frequency of low serum complements (CH50, C3, C4, and factor B) and increased circulating immune complexes was observed; these did not correlate with frequency or sensitization pattern of positive PRAT.

A novel immunoassay was used to quantitate this adduct in buffy coat DNA from testicular and ovarian cancer patients undergoing cisplatin therapy. 44 out of 120 samples taken from 45 cisplatin patients had detectable cisplatin-DNA adducts. No adducts were detected in 18 samples of DNA taken from normal controls, patients on other chemotherapy, or patients before treatment. The quantity of measurable adducts increased as a function of cumulative dose of cisplatin. This was observed both during repeated daily infusion of the drug and over long-term, repeated 21-28 d cycles of administration. These results suggested that adduct removal is slow even though the tissue has a relatively rapid turnover. Patients receiving cisplatin for the first time on 56-d cycles, and those given high doses of cisplatin as a ""salvage"" regimen, did not accumulate adducts as rapidly as patients on first time chemotherapy on 21- or 28-d cycles. Disease response data, evaluated for 33 cisplatin-treated patients, showed a positive correlation between the formation of DNA adducts and response to drug therapy. However, more data will be required to confirm this relationship. These data show that specific immunological probes can readily be applied to quantitate DNA adducts in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy.",PMC423377,,['10.1172/JCI112335 [doi]'],,,,,

Because catalase has a low affinity for H2O2, others have suggested that glutathione peroxidase clears most H2O2 within the erythrocyte and that catalase is of little import. We hypothesized that erythrocyte catalase might function to protect heterologous somatic cells against challenge by high levels of exogenous H2O2 (e.g., in areas of inflammation). We find that, whereas nucleated cells (L1210 murine leukemia) are readily killed by an enzymatically generated flux of superoxide (and, therefore, H2O2), the addition of human and murine erythrocytes blocks lethal damage to the target cells. Inhibition of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, depletion of glutathione, and lysis of the erythrocytes do not diminish this protection. However, inhibition of erythrocyte catalase abrogates the protective effect and the addition of purified catalase (but not superoxide dismutase) restores it. Furthermore, erythrocytes derived from congenitally hypocatalasemic mice (in which other antioxidant systems are intact) do not protect L1210 cells. Our results raise the possibility that the erythrocyte may serve as protection against by-products of its own cargo, oxygen.",PMC423343,,['10.1172/JCI112294 [doi]'],,,,,

The gene for human insulin receptor has recently been mapped to this region of chromosome 19 (p13.2-13.3). This gene shares structural and sequence homologies with the epidermal growth factor receptor (erb-B oncogene) and members of the src family of oncogenes, suggesting that alterations in the insulin receptor, resulting from chromosomal translocation, could lead to a role in tumorigenesis.

In vitro experiments with rat liver extracts indicated that BVUra was not a substrate but an inhibitor for the reductive step in pyrimidine degradation catalyzed by dihydrothymine dehydrogenase. Kinetic and dialysis experiments suggested that BVUra was an irreversible inhibitor of this enzyme. The binding of BVUra to the enzyme depended on the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in the reaction mixture. Dihydrothymine dehydrogenase activity was also inhibited in the dialysed 105,000 X g supernatant fraction of livers from rats that had previously been treated with BVUra. Such inhibitory effects also occurred in vivo; previous administration of BVUra increased the plasma half-lives of thymine and FUra by 10- and 5-fold and their area under the curve by 9- and 8-fold, respectively. The effect of BVUra on the antitumor activity of FUra was evaluated in DBA/2 mice inoculated with 10(6) P388 leukemia cells. The mean survival times for the control and FUra-treated mice (5 mg/kg at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after tumor cell inoculation) were 9.7 and 12.4 days, respectively. When BVUra (200 mumol/kg) was administered 1 h before each injection of FUra, the mean survival time was extended to 17.1 days. BVUra alone did not affect the mean survival time. When the dose of FUra was increased to 20 mg/kg, the mean survival time was 15.3 days; upon a preceding injection of BVUra the mean survival time decreased to 9.2 days. The latter effect probably resulted from an increased toxicity of FUra. Similar results were obtained if FUra was replaced by 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine and BVUra by (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine. The enhancement of both the antitumor and toxic effects of FUra by BVUra were most probably due to an inhibition of FUra degradation, since, like in rats, BVUra increased the plasma half-life of FUra in DBA/2 mice. Hence BVUra appears to be an interesting compound, increasing the potency of FUra by decreasing its degradation.",,,,,,,,

The adenosine kinase activity was markedly reduced in the resistant sublines as compared with that of the respective sensitive lines. Furthermore, neplanocin A competitively inhibited the phosphorylation reaction of adenosine in a cell-free system. The results indicate that neplanocin A is activated by adenosine kinase.

The results of this study are published elsewhere and show a significantly reduced recurrence rate and prolonged disease-free survival time for the combined modality arm compared with the no therapy arm. Severe toxicity in the combined therapy arm was significantly worse (P less than 0.001) than in either single modality arm. Most of the differences in toxicity experienced between the three regimens involved diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Analysis of all parameters of radiotherapy quality assurance data was not significantly associated with toxicity. Radiation enteritis was noted in 5 patients of 96 (5.2%) in the two arms containing irradiation. All five required laparotomy. The two enteritis fatalities occurred late at 605 and 1000 days after start of combined modality treatment, respectively. One other patient on the chemotherapy arm died of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. The authors conclude that combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy, although significantly more effective in reducing recurrence than no therapy, is significantly more toxic than single-modality therapy in many parameters, although most of the toxicity is transient and therefore not limiting. Late complications, which are less reversible and therefore much more important than early reactions, and radiation enteritis in this study were relatively uncommon.

Life-threatening forms of cancer will develop in at least one of every three Canadian newborns during their lifetimes if current cancer risks are not reduced. Lung and breast cancers are, respectively, the leading causes of premature death due to cancer among men and women. Compared with other countries Canada has low death rates for stomach cancer but high rates for certain smoking-related cancers (those of the lung and of the mouth and throat), leukemia and cancers of the colon, breast and lymphatic tissues. Newfoundland has the highest rates of death from stomach cancer and the lowest rates of death from prostatic cancer, whereas the western provinces have the opposite pattern. The rates of death from lung cancer among men are highest in Quebec, the province with the highest prevalence of smoking. In Canada the overall rates of death from cancer increased by 32% among men from 1951 to 1983. However, among women they declined by 12% from 1951 to 1976 and increased from 1976 to 1983, particularly among those aged 55 to 74. The rising rates of death due to lung cancer were primarily responsible for these increases. Lung cancer will likely displace breast cancer as the leading cancer killer of Canadian women by 1990. Given the relatively low survival rates for cancers caused by smoking and the lack of substantial improvement in rates for the most frequent types of cancer, preventive strategies that include effective measures to reduce tobacco consumption are urgently required.",PMC1490679,,,,,,,

The remaining patient underwent morphological changes from FAB-L1 seen at the time of diagnosis to M5b at relapse. Immunologic marker studies in ten patients revealed that one had T cell type; another pre-B cell type; three CALLA- Ia- non-T, non-B type; two CAL-LA- Ia+ non-T, non-B type; two monocytic type (positive Fc-receptor); and the remaining one underwent phenotypic changes from CALLA+ Ia+ non-T, non-B type to monocytic type.

Hyperleukocytosis was observed in eight of the ten patients with acute leukemia, and two of the eight died of intracranial hemorrhage within two days of admission, associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. These findings indicate that leukemia with the 11q23 translocation share certain characteristics in common, irrespective of the recipient chromosome, even though the latter may have some influence on the morphological and immunologic phenotype.

We have morphometrically analyzed 2,391 giant and fusion granule profiles from 46 patients with neoplastic MPD, 127 other diseased control subjects, and 30 normal subjects using a computerized image analyzer. The largest granule profile observed in normal subjects had an area of 0.51 mu 2 and a perimeter of 3.21 mu. The most irregularly shaped of the large granule profiles photographed from normal subjects had a form factor (FF) value of 0.31. FF values indicate the degree of deviation of a given granule contour from a circle and is expressed by the formula 4 pi A/P2. A pathologic granule profile was then defined as a granule that exceeded any of these limits. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with neoplastic MPD were determined to have abnormal platelet granule profiles using the aforementioned morphometric criteria. It was determined, however, that morphometrically defined giant- and fusion-type granule profiles were nonspecific and were also found in 20% of the other diseased patients with no clinical evidence of an underlying neoplastic MPD. Morphometry has allowed us to define the upper limits of normal for the area and perimeter of individual platelet granules. Morphometrically defined giant fusion granules were determined to be more prevalent in the neoplastic MPD group, but because of their nonspecificity, may only have diagnostic significance for the individual patient in specific clinical settings.

The phospholipid vesicles were prepared by controlled dialysis of lipid/prodrug/detergent micelles yielding homogeneous and stable unilamellar liposomes. The liposome size ranged from 70 to 120 nm depending on the lipid composition and the amounts of prodrug incorporated. Depending on the total amount of micellized Ara-C prodrugs, a maximal incorporation rate of 250 micrograms prodrug per mg egg phosphatidylcholine was achieved. The incorporation efficiency was in the range of 85 to 97%. The in vivo antitumor activity of the liposome preparations against L1210 lymphoid leukemia was clearly superior by factors of 2-8 depending on the therapy schedule and route of drug application. The treatment of melanoma B16 with free Ara-C as well as with the prodrug-liposomes exhibit rather weak antitumor activity. Drug application by means of prodrug-liposomes yields equal or higher tumor-inhibitory effects at drug concentrations which were 2-4 times lower than those of free Ara-C. Although drug tolerance and myelosuppression studies with Swiss albino mice revealed that the prodrug-liposomes were 5-10 times more toxic than free Ara-C, a substantial improvement of efficiency could be observed. The incorporation of the ara-C prodrugs into liposomes provides protection against fast degradation and systemic elimination which might be an explanation for the improved antitumor effect of these preparations.",,,['10.1002/ijc.2910370123 [doi]'],,,,,

This antibody agglutinates fetal but not adult erythrocytes. Among blood cells, this antibody bound to both adult and fetal monocytes, platelets, and reticulocytes, but did not react with lymphocytes and granulocytes. Fluorescent labeling of marrow cells and of in vitro BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-MK-derived colonies has shown that the antigen defined by FA6-152 MoAb was absent from the granulocytic precursors and was detected on the megakaryocytic lineage at a later stage of differentiation than the platelet-specific markers. In contrast, the antigen appeared as a very early marker of the erythroid differentiation since all erythroblasts, including proerythroblasts, were labeled even before the expression of glycophorin A. Cells from adult marrow and fetal liver were sorted with the FA6-152 MoAb and studied by electron microscopy and cell culture. The negative fraction contained granulocytic, monocytic, and megakaryocytic precursors, whereas the positive fraction was devoid of these precursors and contained monocytes, erythroblasts at all stages of maturation, and a homogeneous population of blasts. Cultures have shown that the only hematopoietic progenitors present in this positive fraction were CFU-E and some BFU-E. The antigenic density was related to the differentiation stage of the erythroid progenitors. In conclusion, this antibody is similar to the previously described 5F1 MoAb (Bernstein and Andrews, J Immunol 128:876, 1982; and Andrews et al, Blood 62:124, 1983) and provides a useful probe for studies leading to improved understanding of normal and malignant erythroid differentiation.",,,['S0006-4971(20)79052-X [pii]'],,,,,

Responses occurred only in patients with relapsed ANLL, of whom 26 were treated at effective doses.

In P388/R cells, total calcium was approximately 1.4-fold higher than that of P388/S cells. Membrane-bound and intracellular calcium levels were also higher in P388/R cells.

Maximal levels of c-fos mRNA are detected 30 minutes after treatment and maximal levels of c-myc mRNA are detected 60 minutes after treatment. The c-fos protein is expressed at high levels for about two hours following induction, yet the cell morphology remains normal. Thus, either an extended period of c-fos expression is required for cellular transformation, or the highly modified form of the fos protein, present in stimulated cells, is biochemically different from the transforming protein and is therefore not capable of inducing transformation. In this system, growth factor treatment results in mitogenesis. However, c-fos and c-myc are also induced in A431 cells, and in subclones derived from A431 cells, treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF). No correlation was found between the effects of EGF on A431 cell proliferation and the induction of c-fos and c-myc. Interestingly, the strongest inducer of c-fos in A431 cells was the calcium ionophore A23187. Induction occurred in almost 100% of the treated cells without prior serum deprivation or growth arrest. Treatment of HL60 cells with 12-0 tetra decanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which promotes macrophage-like differentiation, also induced c-fos with a time course similar to that observed in mitogen-treated fibroblasts. Thus, in HL60 cells, c-fos induction is associated with differentiation. In normal macrophages c-fos and c-myc can also be induced by CSF-1. However, the kinetics of induction are entirely different from those in growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts. Taken together, the data suggest a more general role for c-fos and c-myc in the transduction of growth factor signals received at the cell membrane, within the nucleus.",,,,,,,"['Department of Molecular Oncology, Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, Nutley, NJ 07110.']",83

Emphasis is placed upon fixation strategies minimizing these artifacts and allowing the air drying of various specimens, even those showing very delicate surface microprojections. This attitude is illustrated by a variety of cells and tissues prepared for SEM by both conservative (i.e., critical point drying of samples treated with glutaraldehyde and/or osmium tetroxide) and reformative procedures, i.e., air drying of samples treated with glutaraldehyde, tannic acid, guanidine-HCl, and osmium tetroxide (GTGO-AD). The results clearly indicate that samples which were prepared by the GTGO procedure displayed very well preserved surface features with minimum shrinkage, even after being air dried.",,,,,,,,

Patients' autologous bone marrow cells were harvested during remission and treated in vitro with complement and three monoclonal antibodies (NL-1, NL-22 and HL-47) reactive to Null-ALL cells, and then cryopreserved. Three patients were transplanted with the antibody-treated bone marrow cells during the first remission period after preconditioning with intensive chemotherapy and total body irradiation, while transplantations in two other patients, who were in poor clinical condition, were done during the fourth remission period and the third relapse, respectively. Good preservation of hematopoietic stem cells after antibody treatment and cryopreservation of bone marrow cells was demonstrated in all five cases studied. Clinically, prompt recovery of white blood cells and platelets was observed in the three patients who received BMT during the first remission period; two of them have continued remission (2 and 15 months), while the other relapsed after 7 months of remission. these results suggested that autologous BMT with these three antibodies may be an effective mode of therapy for Null-ALL patients.",,,,,,,,

Three monoclonal antibodies, NL-1, NL-22 and HL-47, which were produced in our laboratories and shown to react predominantly to Null-ALL cells, were used. In most cases, 10 micrograms/ml of MoAb and 50% of C were required for optimal killing of leukemia cells. Combined use of MoAbs and multiple treatments were studied, but generally no significant increase in the cytotoxicity to the target leukemia cells was observed as compared with a single treatment with the most effective single MoAb. Selection of C was very important, because some lots had lower C activity from the beginning or after incubation with normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. Nonspecific cytotoxicity to human hematopoietic cells was also observed in some lots of C. Under the optimal conditions thus defined, the three MoAbs did not inhibit the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) or three other types of hematopoietic stem cells. Modulation of the antigens was also examined, and NL-1 antigen showed mild modulation, whereas NL-22 and HL-47 antigen did not. The results obtained indicated that these three MoAbs may be useful for eliminating Null-ALL cells in vitro from bone marrow in autologous BMT.",,,,,,,,

The vitamins were assayed in sera samples from normal subjects, patients with cancer of the uterine cervix or ovary, and leukemia and lymphoma patients. Among the murine group the tumors included sarcoma 180 in solid and ascitic form, benzo[a]pyrene-induced fibrosarcoma, Dalton's ascitic lymphoma and Schwartz lymphoblastic leukemia. The serum level of vitamin C was found to be lower than that of the normal controls in all cases studied. The level of vitamin A was found to be higher in cancer patients in the human group and lower in the murine group when compared with their normal controls. Studies on murine tumors showed that supplementary vitamins administered at the initial phase of tumor development reduced the percentage tumor take and the rate of tumor growth, and improved host survival, indicating that these vitamins have a protective role in the murine system.",,,,,,,,

Daudi cells (which do not express beta 2 microglobulin on their cell surface) were shown to produce 'macrophage replacing factors' which supported anti-beta 2-induced T cell division. Non-T cells could be effectively replaced by addition of interleukin 2 containing cell supernatants, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or teleocidin B.

This paper demonstrates that 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate (PMA), when cocultured with normal murine bone marrow cells (BMC), significantly augments an antigenic cell-surface determinant called 14D10. This antigen is present constitutively in the majority of bone-marrow lymphocytes of autoimmune lpr mice. PMA has little enhancing effect when cocultured with lpr BMC. In addition, Ia antigenic determinants are increased by PMA in normal but not lpr BMC. Retinoic acid (RA) and PMA act synergistically both to increase 14D10 and to enhance the stimulatory ability of target lymphocytes as measured by proliferation in an autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR). We suggest that lpr mice have persistent expression of gene products like 14D10 that are usually repressed in normal adult mice. These gene products can be activated in normal mouse bone marrow by PMA which acts through a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-dependent C protein kinase. The in vivo enhanced expression of 14D10 in lpr mice suggests activation by some mechanism or factors yet to be described.",,,['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1985.tb01928.x [doi]'],,,,,

Studies were made on whether Mm-A cells could be induced to differentiate further by agents that were effective for inducing differentiation of the parent M1 cells and other leukemic cells. Of the agents tested, butyrate, conditioned medium from concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cells, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and N6,O2-dibutyryl adenosine 3'5'-cyclic-monophosphate (dbcAMP) significantly stimulated the lysozyme activity of Mm-A cells, which is one of the most characteristic biochemical markers of monocytes and macrophages. Butyrate was the most effective agent for increasing lysozyme production by Mm-A cells; culture with 0.5mM butyrate for 3 days increased lysozyme production by Mm-A cells about 50-fold. Inducers of M1 cell differentiation such as dexamethasone, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, arginase, and proteinous inducer did not increase the lysozyme activity. Butyrate also induced NBT reduction and stimulated other differentiation-associated functions, such as expressions of Fc receptors on the cell surface, immune phagocytosis and production of inducer for M1 cell differentiation. Its effect in stimulating differentiation of Mm-A cells was synergistic with that of dbcAMP or LPS. Incubation with butyrate inhibited the proliferation of Mm-A cells, about 0.3mM butyrate causing 50% inhibition. These results indicate that monocytic, leukemogenic Mm-A cells can be induced to differentiate further by butyrate and that the inducers of differentiation of Mm-A cells are markedly different from those of the parent myeloblastic M1 cells.",,,,,,,,

The majority of group I patients had a progressive disease at test while all patients in group II were in a non-progressive state. Moreover, the smIg pattern changed with the clinical activity of the disease: when the disease progressed, the relative number of smmu + cells increased and when patients entered an indolent stage after treatment the smmu + cell population decreased. In patients with stationary disease the smIg pattern remained essentially unchanged or the relative number of smdelta + cells increased.

Lymphoid populations from peripheral blood, the thymus, and the anterior kidney, but not the spleen, were active in the cytotoxicity assay. Individual fish varied considerably in their ability to lyse one or both target cells. These data and the results of unlabelled target cell inhibition studies suggest that the reaction is selective if not specific. The addition of PHA to the reaction mixture resulted in markedly enhanced cytotoxic reactivity. In the presence of PHA lysis was readily detectable at 4 hr.

The DNA polymerase alpha enzyme of the two B-cell lines (both the leukemic and the ""normal"") showed the usual sensitivity toward inhibition by aphidicolin, while those from the two other leukemic cell lines were remarkably resistant to the antibiotic. Partially thiolated polycytidylic acid (MPC) strongly inhibited only the DNA polymerase alpha of the ""normal"" cell line, whereas the corresponding enzymes of all three leukemic cell lines were relatively insensitive to MPC. In contrast, the partially thiolated DNAs derived from the leukemic cell lines more strongly inhibited the DNA polymerase alphas of the leukemic cell lines than that of the ""normal"" cell line.

The objective of the study was to develop a reproducible flow cytometric method. A Burkitt's lymphoma-derived B-cell line, Daudi, and a pre-B ALL, Nalm-6, served as prototypes. Normal B cells and cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) were used as negative controls. Cytoplasmic mu was expressed in 77.3 +/- 7.5% (n = 10) of Nalm-6 cells. CALLA+ ALL and CML cells lacked cytoplasmic mu. The surface-membrane immunoglobulin on the viable B cells was blocked with purified goat anti-human IgM. Subsequently, the B cells were fixed in cold absolute methanol and stained with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-human IgM to demonstrate cytoplasmic IgM. After the surface-membrane IgM was blocked, normal B cells had no cytoplasmic IgM (0.3-0.5% positive cells) detectable by flow cytometry. However, the peripheral blood lymphocytes from five patients with CLL and the Daudi cells contained cytoplasmic IgM, ranging from 7.8 to 76.7% and 45.7 to 89.3%, respectively. We conclude that cytoplasmic mu in Nalm-6, CLL, and Daudi cells can be easily and rapidly demonstrated by flow cytometry.",,,"['0145-2126(85)90126-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90126-2 [doi]']",,,,,

Treatment with 5-hydroxydopa failed to significantly increase survival of mice bearing i.p. or s.c. pigmented and non-pigmented B16 melanomas even though it inhibited local tumor growth. Treatment increased survival of both P388 and L1210 leukemias, and this increase was more pronounced in mice bearing i.p. tumors than in mice bearing s.c. tumors. This treatment significantly decreased final tumor weight of both leukemias implanted s.c., and inhibited ascites formation in mice inoculated with i.p. tumors. Ascorbate supplementation decreased or abrogated the effect of 5-hydroxydopa on survival in mice bearing i.p. or s.c. leukemia tumors and decreased survival relative to control mice bearing i.p. or s.c. pigmented and s.c. non-pigmented tumors. It did not affect survival of treated mice bearing i.p. non-pigmented melanoma tumors. Ascorbate supplementation did not modify the effect of 5-hydroxydopa treatment on primary s.c. tumor growth in mice bearing melanoma or leukemia tumors nor did it affect ascites formation in treated mice bearing i.p. leukemia tumors. The lack of correlation between the observed inhibition of primary tumor growth and the absence of an effect on survival in 5-hydroxydopa treated mice bearing i.p. melanoma may relate to an inability of this drug to interfere with tumor metastasis.

These cells incorporated [35S]sulfate into cell-associated proteoglycan molecules, which were then isolated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. As assessed by gel filtration chromatography, the native 35S-labeled proteoglycan and its beta-eliminated 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were of Mr approximately 200,000 and 50,000, respectively. The 35S-labeled proteoglycans were resistant to proteolysis, since their Mr were apparently not altered by incubation with either pronase or S. aureus V8 protease. The purified NK cell 35S-labeled proteoglycans were degraded by approximately 90% to 35S-labeled disaccharides with either chondroitinase ABC or AC. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the digests revealed these disaccharides to be composed entirely of chondroitin sulfate A (glucuronic acid----N-acetylgalactosamine-4SO4). Whole 35S-labeled cells incubated with chondroitinase ABC failed to release 35S-labeled disaccharides into the supernatant, and x-ray energy-dispersive analysis revealed that sulfur-containing molecules were present in the intracellular granules, thereby localizing the NK cell-associated proteoglycan primarily in the granules of the cell, rather than on the plasma membrane. The 35S-labeled cloned NK cells incubated for 30 min to 4 h with K562 tumor cell targets at a 0.5:1 ratio exocytosed a mean of 49% of the granular 35S-labeled proteoglycans during the first 60 min of the culture. Proteoglycan release was maximal with an effector/target cell ratio of 0.5:1 for JTB18:K562. Significant proteoglycan release from JTB18 NK cells was also obtained with other sensitive target cells such as REX, Molt4, and CEM, but not with cells such as KG1 and Laz156, which have been shown previously to be resistant to killing by this NK cell.

Although the parental cells were highly resistant to chemical carcinogenesis, this infected clone was rendered susceptible to transformation by chemical carcinogens. However, when it was exposed to the tested carcinogen at a low subculture passage post-infection, cell transformation was detectable only after many subsequent passages. On the other hand, if it was exposed to the carcinogen at a high passage post-infection, cell transformation was detectable sometimes even without further passage, or in other cases after the first subsequent passage. Mouse interferon could inhibit the transformation by carcinogen employed at the low but not at the high passage post-infection. This inhibitory effect was reversible; if interferon was removed, even after the cells had been passaged many times in its presence, cell transformation became visible at passage 11 after interferon removal, although no treatment with the carcinogen was repeated. Interferon had no effect on the replication or the focus-forming capacity of cells transformed by such chemical-retroviral co-carcinogenesis. The possibility that this carcinogenic process depends on amplification of the integrated provirus DNA, and that this amplification can be inhibited by interferon is discussed.",,,['10.1093/carcin/6.12.1787 [doi]'],,,,,

Twenty-two allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients and 12 acute nonlymphocytic leukemia patients (entering remission) were compared to 70 healthy control subjects studied during the same time interval. Studies performed included phenotyping T-cells using monoclonal antibodies and T-cell colony formation in response to phytohemagglutinin. The phenotypic profile for the two patient groups differed from each other and from that of the healthy controls. The total number of circulating cells reactive with OKT4 were significantly depressed in marrow graft recipients while only mildly, but significantly, depressed in leukemic patients. The number of circulating cells reactive with OKT8 were depressed in leukemic patients but were essentially normal in marrow graft recipients. The number of circulating cells reactive with OKla1 and OKT10 were significantly elevated in marrow graft recipients while significantly depressed in leukemic patients. The T4:T8 ratio was significantly depressed for marrow transplant recipients and significantly elevated for leukemic patients. T-cell colony formation in agarose without and with added interleukin-2 was decreased for both groups, more so for marrow graft recipients who virtually lacked the ability to make colonies without exogenous interleukin 2. These phenotypic and functional data suggest that T-cell reconstitution after bone marrow aplasia and profound lymphopenia takes quite different pathways for leukemic patients recovering from remission induction therapy and for recipients of bone marrow transplants. We were unable to correlate T-cell functional response in T-cell colony formation with the phenotypic profile of peripheral blood T-cells.",,,,,,,,

Some of these were discovered as intermediates in a synthetic program being conducted to find improved procedures for modifying the structure of mitomycin C (MMC). Markedly superior in vivo antitumor effects have been observed with BMY-25282 compared to MMC in initial tests against i.p.-implanted P388 leukemia and B16 melanoma. When administered i.v. to mice bearing s.c. B16 melanoma, BMY-25282 was also superior to MMC. The derivative was fully active against a line of L1210 leukemia which was partially resistant to MMC treatment but had little or no activity against a line of L1210 fully resistant to MMC. It is also 2 to 4 times more potent than MMC based on a comparison of doses required to achieve optimum antitumor effects. The superior antitumor efficacy of BMY-25282 over MMC against both i.p. and s.c. B16 melanoma was maintained when the drug was given in pluronic acid formulation. Against P-388 leukemia, however, the efficacy of the drugs was equivalent when BMY-25282 was administered in the pluronic vehicle. In an in vitro clonogenic assay involving freshly explanted human tumors, BMY-25282 was consistently more potent in cytotoxic effects than MMC. With human colorectal carcinoma samples, BMY-25282 was 13.8 times more potent than MMC. The i.v. 50% lethal dose values of BMY-25282 and MMC in C57BL/6 X DBA/2 F1 mice were 2.1 mg/kg and 8.6 mg/kg, respectively. Leukopenic effects of the drugs in mice were comparable at doses up to their respective 50% lethal dose values. Hematology studies in ferrets revealed a similar pattern of depression and recovery of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets for BMY-25282 and MMC; however, with BMY-25282 there was earlier recovery of platelet counts.

These five antisera do not show reactivity with immunoglobulin secreted by spleen cells from normal BALB/cAn mice or by B-cells from unrelated tumors and cell lines.

Furthermore all the neoplastic cells in culture or primary neoplasms (leukemias, sarcomas, carcinomas) studied contained transcripts from most of the TaDNA sequences found in malignant lymphoblasts whereas normal cells growing in vitro contained only a few TaDNA transcripts. It is shown in the present study that treatments of the myeloid leukemia HL60 cells with various inducers of cell differentiation (dimethyl sulfoxide, retinoic acid, mezerein, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, teleocidin) caused a dose-dependent reduction of the level of TaDNA transcripts, correlated with the diminution of c-myc transcripts. The 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment had this same effect on Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Raji or Namalwa) but the opposite effect on normal cells (Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphocytes or fetal fibroblasts) where it enhanced the formation of Ta-DNA transcripts up to the levels found in untreated malignant cells. These data suggest two conclusions (a) TaDNA corresponds to a multigenic set which seems to be involved in modulation of the malignant phenotype and (b) depending on the origin of the cells, agents like 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate may operate either as tumor promoters or as differentiation inducers through the control of TaDNA expression.",,,,,,,,

Transport by the A- and ASC-systems was not decreased in CLL B-lymphocytes. Because of the specific defect of the sodium-independent L-system amino acid transport in CLL cells, we have examined the activity of another sodium-independent transport system, the Y+-system, in human lymphocytes. The Y+-system favors the transport of dibasic, cationic amino acids such as lysine, ornithine, and arginine, which carry a positively charged group on their side chains. Our studies indicate that there is a large nonsaturable component of amino acid transport by the Y+-system in human lymphocytes.

Using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for NK cells or other lymphocyte populations, we unambiguously identify NK cells as the only PBL subset able to produce both NKCF and NK-CIA. We present functional and biochemical data suggesting that NKCF and NK-CIA represent the same molecule: (a) a highly significant positive correlation exists between the quantity of NKCF and NK-CIA in supernatants independently produced by different PBL subsets; (b) both NK-CIA and NKCF are induced by culture of PBL with NK-sensitive, but not with NK-insensitive cell lines, and with HLA-DR+ bone marrow cells; (c) both NKCF and NK-CIA are absorbed on the same cell lines or bone marrow cell types; (d) the two activities coelute in the same gel filtration fractions; (e) D-mannose-6-phosphate blocks both NKCF and NK-CIA activity, and prevents their absorption by K562 cells; and (f) both NKCF and NK-CIA activity are lost after 2 d at 37 degrees C. The NK-CIA-containing preparations are devoid of antiviral activity, and antiinterferon (anti-IFN) antibodies do not block the inhibitor activity of NK-CIA. The effect of NK-CIA on day 14 (early) colony-forming units of granulocytes and macrophages (CFU-GM) is synergistic with that of IFN-gamma, and this synergy is also evident on day 7 (late) CFU-GM growth. A combination of NK-CIA and IFN-gamma suppresses late CFU-GM, at concentrations of the two lymphokines that are completely ineffective when used independently. No synergy between NK-CIA and IFN-alpha or -beta was observed, due to a direct inhibitory effect of these two IFN types on late CFU-GM. Antibodies specific for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), but not those specific for lymphotoxins, inhibit both NK-CIA and NKCF activity in the NK cell-derived supernatant. Recombinant TNF, in the range of concentrations corresponding to that of the cytotoxic activity on L-929 cells present in supernatants, mediated both NKCF and NK-CIA activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",PMC2187923,"['CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1084/jem.162.5.1512 [doi]'],,,,,

Treatment of the cells with TPA induced marked enhancement of the phosphorylation of 28- and 67-kDa proteins and a decrease in that of a 75-kDa protein. When the cells were treated with diacylglycerol, i.e. 50 micrograms/ml 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), similar changes in the phosphorylation of 28-, 67-, and 75-kDa proteins were likewise observed, indicating that OAG actually stimulates protein kinase C in intact HL-60 cells. OAG (1-100 micrograms/ml), which we used, activated partially purified mouse brain protein kinase C in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 10 nM TPA for 48 h caused an increase by about 8-fold in cellular acid phosphatase activity. Although a significant increase in acid phosphatase activity was induced by OAG, the effect was scant compared to that of TPA (less than 7% that of TPA). After 48-h exposure to 10 nM TPA, about 95% of the HL-60 cells adhered to culture dishes. On the contrary, treatment of the cells either with OAG (2-100 micrograms/ml) or phospholipase C failed to induce HL-60 cell adhesion. Ca2+ ionophore A23187 failed to act synergistically with OAG. In addition, hourly or bi-hourly cumulative addition of OAG for 24 h also proved ineffective to induce HL-60 cell adhesion. Our present results do not imply that protein kinase C activation is nonessential for TPA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation, but do demonstrate that protein kinase C activation is not the sole event sufficient to induce HL-60 cell differentiation by means of this agent.",,,['S0021-9258(17)38707-0 [pii]'],,,,,

Among 25718 women treated between 1943-1977, 27 cases of leukaemia occurred one or more years after diagnosis. Four controls were matched to each case on age, calendar year of diagnosis and survival without developing a second cancer. Detailed medical records were abstracted, and individual radiation doses to active bone marrow were determined by medical physicists. All leukaemia diagnoses were classified by one haematopathologist. A 2.5-fold risk of radiogenic leukaemia was found, although the excess was not statistically significant (95% Cl = 0.5-12.1). The pattern of risk by dose was somewhat compatible with animal experiments, ie, the risk rose, peaked, and then decreased to near normal levels at the highest dose categories. The average dose to the total bone marrow was 783 rads, and thus a much greater risk of leukaemia was predicted on the basis of estimates from other exposed populations. Assuming that the pelvic bone marrow is essentially destroyed by high-dose radiotherapy and should, perhaps, be disregarded for the purpose of risk estimation, risk coefficients consistent with other studies can be computed. Nonetheless, the very low risk of radiogenic leukaemia found among cervical cancer patients suggests that the induction of leukaemia by radiation is a complex function of dose, and that very high doses may result in a decreased risk, possibly associated with cellular sterilization or other mechanisms.",,"['N01-CP0-1047/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP1-1017/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP3-1035/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1093/ije/14.3.363 [doi]'],,,,,

The results demonstrate that differentiation occurs in the absence of DNA synthesis and that some inhibitors of DNA synthesis may enhance the differentiation of HL-60 cells by the above inducers. Among the antimetabolites used, the enhancement of induction of differentiation by hydroxyurea was shown to be more effective than that of Ara-C or aphidicolin. The effect of thymidine blockage was similar to that of hydroxyurea. These different effects may be due to the different points at which the cell cycle is blocked by these agents. These results seem to be common in both the differentiation of the granulocytic line induced by retinoic acid and of the macrophage line induced by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3.

In contrast, cells derived from acute myeloblastic leukemia patients are often defective in their response to CSF, but can be induced to undergo terminal differentiation by exposure to 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) by a process that does not require cell proliferation. To investigate the relationship between TPA-induced leukemic cell differentiation and CSF-induced myeloid cell differentiation we investigated the effects of TPA on myeloblasts highly enriched from normal bone marrow and stable-phase chronic myeloid leukemia peripheral blood. TPA (10(-6)-10(-9) M) induced the rapid appearance of macrophage characteristics in the majority of myeloblasts in the absence of proliferation. The mechanisms of TPA- and CSF-induced myeloblast differentiation were compared by examining the requirement for DNA synthesis. Exposure of myeloblasts to CSF induced increased triatiated thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation within a few hours, while TPA did not induce 3H-TdR incorporation by itself and was inhibitory to CSF-induced 3H-TdR uptake. This requirement for DNA synthesis was further investigated by reversibly inhibiting DNA synthesis by depleting intracellular polyamines with difluoromethylorinithine (DFMO). DFMO inhibited both CSF-induced proliferation and differentiation of myeloblasts, but had no effect on TPA-induced differentiation.

Cancer represents a spectrum of diseases, and posttreatment impairments may vary from none, in the majority of cases, to major functional disability. Employers understandably have difficulty recognizing the variability that exists, both in terms of functional capacity and prognosis, and they are often unaware of the improved prognosis for many cancers. Today, many patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy or prolonged intermittent treatment and need to adjust their work schedule to allow for this. Some people need job training or vocational counseling; in many states, vocational rehabilitation agencies now have an increased interest in providing services to cancer patients. Discrimination against the cancer patient has been demonstrated; the major problems are in the area of hiring practices. Efforts need to be continued to educate employers and the public and to ensure that the rights of the cancer patient are recognized. We may, however, do our patients a disservice if we overemphasize potential problems to a degree that increases patient fear and insecurity in regard to employment. Instead, we as physicians may be able to help prevent problems by more effective communication with employers on behalf of our patients, as well as by direct patient counseling. The insurance problems of cancer patients, particularly those relating to health insurance, do require major attention. The potential productivity, as well as the quality of life, of the cancer patient are jeopardized when he or she feels unable to change jobs because of fear of loss of insurance coverage. The relatively high number of reported cancellations and changes in insurance benefits that have been reported by cancer patients also represents an area of concern, since some of these appear medically unjustified. The physician's opinion and input may be of importance in preventing or solving individual insurance problems. The physician can also help the cancer patient who has employment problems by providing information about available resources. The above-mentioned employment booklet (#4585-PS), available from the ACS, may be useful and contains information about legal resources. Referral to a vocational rehabilitation agency may be indicated. The best medicine of all may be a positive and optimistic attitude toward the patient's participation in the work force.",,,['10.3322/canjclin.35.6.360 [doi]'],,,,,

Despite immunological evidence of lymphoid differentiation (17 CALLA + and one T cell-associated antigen +) and findings of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, blasts from these patients reacted with one to five monoclonal antibodies identifying myeloid-associated cell surface antigens (My-1, MCS.2, Mo1, SJ-D1, or 5F1). Dual staining with microsphere-conjugated antibodies and analysis by flow cytometry confirmed that some blasts were simultaneously expressing lymphoid- and myeloid-associated antigens. Conversely, blasts from seven of 28 patients (25%) with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), diagnosed by otherwise standard morphological and cytochemical criteria, expressed lymphoid-associated surface antigens. Dual staining of individual blasts demonstrated simultaneous expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) (including Auer rods) in association with either T-11, CALLA, or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Blasts from one patient with ANLL demonstrated T cell receptor gene rearrangement, while blasts from another patient demonstrated characteristics associated with T (T-11), B (CALLA and heavy-chain immunoglobulin gene rearrangement), and myeloid (MPO) lineage. There were no consistent cytogenetic abnormalities, and no patient demonstrated independent leukemic clones. Each patient with typical ALL, except for myeloid-associated antigens, achieved complete remission with conventional induction therapy for ALL.

However, retinoids have been shown to inhibit interferon production, so they could act by influencing the production of lymphokines. Hence we have studied the effect of retinoic acid on the production of interleukins (ILs) 1 and 3 in vitro. Models for the production of ILs were the murine macrophage cell line P388D1 and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for IL 1 and the murine WEHI-3 cell line for IL 3. Retinoic acid stimulated IL 1 release by P388D1 cells in a dose-related fashion, starting at 10(-9) M and maximally at 10(-8)-10(-6) M. With peripheral blood mononuclear cells a maximal stimulation of IL 1 release was observed with 10(-7) M-retinoic acid. IL 3 release by WEHI-3 cells was also stimulated by retinoic acid in a dose-related fashion. The maximal response was obtained with 10(-8) M-retinoic acid. These results show that retinoic acid, in physiological concentrations, exerts selective effects on interleukin production in vitro, and this stimulation of IL 1 and IL 3 release may explain some of the immunostimulatory effects of retinoids in vivo.

To further characterize the phenotype of the blast cells, they were analyzed for surface markers using a panel of monoclonal antibodies selected to identify differentiation antigens of T cells, B cells and myeloid cells.

The heavy-chain V region (VH) is assembled from three separate germline DNA elements, the variable (VH), diversity (D) and joining (JH) segments; whereas light-chain variable regions of either the kappa or lambda type are assembled from two elements, the VL and JL. Analysis of tumour cell lines or sorted cell populations which represent early and late pre-B cells has suggested that heavy-chain assembly and expression generally precedes that of light chains; but, primarily because of the lack of appropriate model systems to study the phenomenon, the mechanism and significance of this apparently orderly differentiation process are much debated. Here we describe for the first time a transformed cell line, 300-19, which sequentially undergoes all of the immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and expression events associated with the differentiation of pre-B cells to surface immunoglobulin-positive B lymphocytes. Analysis of the in vitro differentiation of 300-19 cells provides direct evidence for distinct differentiation phases of first VH and subsequently VL assembly during B-cell differentiation. Furthermore, these analyses suggest that the mu heavy chain, resulting from a productive VHDJH rearrangement, has both a positive and a negative regulatory role in mediating this ordered differentiation process, that is, signalling the cessation of VH gene assembly and simultaneously signalling the onset of VL assembly.",,['AI-20047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1038/317353a0 [doi]'],,,,,

SF from the ascites fluid was partially purified by a four-step purification schedule consisting of ammonium sulphate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and Sephadex G-100 chromatography. This purification sequence resulted in approximately a 250- and 187-fold purification of SF and IL3 respectively on the initial starting material with a yield of 13 and 9.7% respectively of the initial activity. At each stage of purification, the fractions containing SF co-purified with IL3 activity, further supporting our previous report that SF and IL3 are probably identical molecules. The characteristics of the in-vivo derived (sera and ascites fluid) activities were found to be similar to those of the factors produced in vitro in WEHI-3 cell conditioned media.

In contrast, diphenyl disulfide reversibly inhibits this enzyme at 1-5 microM, irrespective of the GSH concentration in the supernatant. KCN also inhibits 5-lipoxygenase at 4 mM, suggesting the presence of a metal-containing prosthetic group. These observations imply that diphenyl disulfide and similar molecules with electron-releasing substituents on the aromatic rings could inhibit by binding to an electrophilic metallic center, the binding being stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the enzyme and the aromatic groups on the flexible disulfide. Even though diphenyl disulfide does not inhibit soybean 15-lipoxygenase or endoperoxide synthase in cell-free systems, this compound does suppress prostaglandin as well as leukotriene synthesis in intact murine peritoneal macrophages and CXBG cells.

Increased intracellular accumulation of ara-C after HU treatment was also observed in human acute myelogenous leukemic cells in circulating blood. Therefore, the synergistic cell kill of HU and ara-C may be the consequence of greater inhibition of DNA polymerase by the increased level of ara-CTP in the presence of the decreased concentration of the natural substrate of this enzyme, dCTP.

We have developed a rapid and effective procedure for the extraction of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products. The cells grown in spinner cultures were harvested and washed in phosphate buffer and stimulated by calcium ionophore A23187. The ethanolic extract of the cells was dried, dissolved in 20% methanol acidified with acetic acid and applied to octadecyl reversed phase cartridge (Backer C18). The cartridge was washed with 50% methanol (4 ml). Prostaglandins were eluted with 75% methanol (4 ml) and leukotrienes and related compounds with 100% methanol (4 ml). The identification of the fractions was carried out with pure standards. The recoveries of radiolabelled compounds ranged from 70% to 90%. This system can therefore accomplish an initial separation of major arachidonate metabolites and be applied in investigating metabolic pathways of arachidonic acid in different experimental conditions.",,,,,,,,

We show here that differentiation induction (with either sodium butyrate, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, or teleocidin) or recombinant alpha- or gamma-interferon (IFN) treatment resulted in the augmentation of HLA class-I antigen expression. This augmentation of HLA class-I antigens was also observed in the Burkitt X K562 hybrid cells PUTKO and DUTKO (the latter coming from two presumably HLA-A, B-negative parents). HLA class-I genes are thus functional in K562 cells. In this system, alpha- and gamma-IFN had no clear differentiating capacity, since they were not able to modulate the expression of various hematopoietic markers, as chemical differentiation inducers did. On the other hand, neither differentiation induction nor interferon treatment could induce HLA class-II antigen expression on K562 cells. These molecules could be very faintly induced in PUTKO and DUTKO hybrids, in contrast with strong HLA class-II expression on the B parental lines. Whether these results are due to ""lineage infidelity"" in K562 cells or whether K562 cells represent the proliferation of HLA class-I-positive class-II-negative hematopoietic cells, with active suppression of HLA class-II antigen expression, is discussed.",,,,,,,,

In four of seven boys, testicular relapse was bilateral with overt involvement of one testicle and microscopic involvement of the other. Three of these four boys demonstrated delayed sexual maturation, and in addition to elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations, testosterone levels were low and luteinizing hormone levels were elevated compared with controls.

J. Clin. Invest. 71:258). We found here that lysis of P815 mastocytoma cells by vernolepin, with or without BSO, required cystine in the culture medium. Addition of catalase markedly suppressed vernolepin-mediated cytolysis in cystine-containing media, suggesting the involvement of hydrogen peroxide in the cytolytic action of vernolepin. Consistent with this, inhibition of tumor cell glutathione disulfide reductase with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea or inhibition of endogenous catalase with aminotriazole synergistically augmented cytolysis by vernolepin. Moreover, H2O2 was released by suspensions of P815 cells in cystine-containing buffer (63 pmol/10(6) cells X h). Omission of cystine reduced the rate of H2O2 accumulation 10-fold. No H2O2 was detected without cells. Cytolysis by vernolepin could be restored in cystine-deficient medium by several other disulfides, themselves noncytolytic, such as disulfiram and oxidized Captopril, as well as by cysteine. In contrast, withholding two other essential amino acids (leucine or tryptophan) or adding cycloheximide did not interfere with cytolysis by vernolepin. These results suggest that cellular uptake of disulfides of physiologic and pharmacologic interest may be followed by their intracellular reduction and autooxidation with generation of H2O2.

We have investigated the effects of enzymatic removal of HL-60 cell surface GAG on maturation events. Cells treated with chondroitin ABC lyase to remove surface chondroitin sulfate, which is the major GAG constituent, did not demonstrate altered binding affinity for the differentiation inducer, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Similarly, a complex membrane antigen associated with maturation, the chemotactic peptide receptor, was not perturbed.

We have observed that in different CTL/TC systems the requirement for [Ca2+]ext varies, depending on the target. Some TC, like leukemia L1210, are strictly dependent on [Ca2+]ext for lysis while others, like EL4 (and P815), are not. It is therefore suggested that, where required, [Ca2+]ext exerts its effect(s) on the TC and not the CTL. In support of this conclusion are experiments showing that effector cells cytolytic to certain TC in the absence of [Ca2+]ext, require [Ca2+]ext when used themselves as TC of other effectors. Verapamil, a Ca2+-channel blocker, inhibits the lysis of L1210 but not of EL4 cells, suggesting involvement of Ca2+ flux into L1210 target cells and, if at all involved, Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores in EL4. The different lytic susceptibility of the two TC to the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, in the presence and absence of [Ca2+]ext, correlated with their responses to CTL. It suggests Ca2+ influx into both types of TC in the presence of [Ca2+]ext and its release from internal stores in the lysis of EL4 but not L1210 in the absence of [Ca2+]ext. In view of these results indicating that the target is the site of Ca2+ action, we propose that CTL induce a Ca2+-regulated activation of the TC leading to its lysis.",,,"['0008-8749(85)90300-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(85)90300-4 [doi]']",,,,,

Treatment with IFN-gamma increased monocyte-associated cell surface antigens detected by monocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These antigenic changes were accompanied by a functional differentiation, determined by the increase of phagocytic capability and superoxide generation. IFN-gamma was also found to suppress the growth of HL-60 cells and reduce expression of a c-myc oncogene. These phenotypic and morphological changes to macrophage-like cells induced by IFN-gamma were similar to those by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, whereas the plasma membrane antigenic changes were different. Moreover, the combination of IFN-gamma and suboptimal doses of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 have synergistic effects in augmenting mature monocyte specific antigens (Mo2, 63D3, OKM1, and OKM5).

In 43% an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio was detected, implying the presence of a malignant clone in the peripheral blood (clonal excess). In 67% of cases with an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio, the absolute lymphocyte count was within normal limits and 20% did not have morphologic bone marrow involvement. Light chain analysis of bone marrow aspirates was performed in three of four patients with a circulating clone and normal bone marrow morphology. All three patients had abnormal bone marrow aspirate kappa/lambda ratios. The presence of a circulating clone was associated with morphologic bone marrow involvement (P less than 0.05). Nine patients with documented B-cell NHL were followed with repeated examinations. The presence of a circulating clone persisted in two patients refractory to therapy and in two patients otherwise believed to be in remission. Conversion to an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio occurred in two patients coincident with the development of new bone marrow involvement and in a third patient prior to the onset of frank leukemia. In three instances, the PBL light chain analyses remained within normal limits in patients with stable lymphadenopathy. The kappa/lambda ratio returned to normal in one patient responding to treatment with a partial remission, and remained within normal limits despite progression of lymphadenopathy in one patient, and local disease recurrence in another patient.

Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation. The B- and T-cells were further separated on nylon wool columns.

Levels of CA and Hb seem to gradually increase in normal differentiating stem cells. In contrast, both human and murine erythroleukemia cells show high levels of CA, but not of Hb, prior to induction of differentiation. Friend virus infection of normal murine progenitors appears to stimulate CA synthesis as an initial and integral step in transformation. In addition, both the erythroleukemia cells and the erythroid progenitors transformed with Friend virus seem to contain much higher levels of CA than Hb during the early stages of differentiation. This relationship is in marked contrast to normal erythroid differentiation, in which Hb levels are always higher than CA levels.

In response to a pulse of GRF-44 (5 micrograms/kg intravenously), mean peak GH levels rose to values higher than those evoked by the pharmacologic agents L-dopa or arginine (6.4 +/- 1.3 ng/mL v 1.5 +/- 0.4 ng/mL, P less than .05). The peak GH value occurred at a mean of 26.0 minutes after administration of GRF-44. These responses were similar to those obtained in children with severe GH deficiency due to other etiologies (peak GH 6.3 +/- 1.7 ng/mL, mean 28.0 minutes). In addition, there was a trend toward an inverse relationship between peak GH response to GRF-44 and the postirradiation interval. Prolactin and somatomedin-C levels did not change significantly after the administration of a single dose of GRF-44. The results of this study support the hypothesis that cranial irradiation in children can lead to hypothalamic GRF deficiency secondary to radiation injury of hypothalamic GRF-secreting neurons.

Neoplasms were subclassified according to plasmacytoid features, leukemia (CLL) site of involvement (nodal or extranodal), serum monoclonal immunoglobulin, or clinical evidence of MM. The results defined two groups of lymphocytic lymphomas without plasmacytoid features (16 cases). Ten of these lymphomas were associated with CLL. Nine involved lymph nodes, all expressed IgM, five expressed IgD, nine were B2-positive, eight were T1-positive, and all were B1- and Ia-positive. Six of the lymphomas were not associated with CLL. Five of these tumors were extranodal, all were T1- B1+ B2- Ia+, five expressed IgM without IgD, and one contained IgG. These differences in clinical and immunologic phenotypes suggest that CLL and SL without CLL may be related to different stages of B-cell differentiation. T1 appeared to be a marker for CLL, since all T1-positive neoplasms were leukemic. Lymphomas with plasmacytoid features (ten cases) were more often extranodal, and none was leukemic. The immunologic phenotypes were heterogeneous: all of these lymphomas were T1-negative, most were IgM+ IgD-, three were B2-positive, and all were Ia-positive. The plasma cells in five lymphomas with marked plasmacytoid features were B1-negative; they were Ia-positive in four and Ia-negative in one. These data suggest that LP is a heterogeneous group, reflecting B cells at diverse stages of differentiation. Ten plasmacytomas, nine of which were associated with MM, differed from LP in showing heavy chain class switching; all were T1- B1- B2-, and all but one were Ia-negative. These results are consistent with the existence of two pathways or stages of B-cell differentiation: one that generates IgM-producing plasma cells, as seen in the primary immune response or in response to pokeweed mitogen, and one that generates IgG- or IgA-positive plasma cells, as seen in the late primary or secondary immune response. Plasmacytoid lymphocytic lymphoma reflects the first, while PL/MM reflects the second pathway.

Lymphoid blasts induced with phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, or concanavalin A were also non-reactive, and all non-hematopoietic cultured cells examined were also negative. The antibodies were, however, reactive to leukemia cells in 67 cases out of 91 cases (74%) of acute leukemia. In patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 43 out of 52 cases (83%) were positive and, in particular, all of 12 T-cell-type acute leukemias were reactive to HH 10. Comparison of percent HH 10 positive cells in the bone marrow of patients with acute leukemia with the results of cytological studies showed a good correlation. Analysis of sequentially collected bone marrow cells of acute leukemia patients using HH 10 revealed its usefulness for monitoring leukemia cells.",,,,,,,,

A similar difference was also noted in Swiss mouse thymus which develop thymic leukemia upon a single injection of 5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)-imidazole-4-carboximide. Galactosidase, which was 25 times less active than galactosyltransferase, was not responsible for this difference. These observations were extended to an evaluation of the serum level of the enzyme as a potential tumor biomarker. A 3- to 4-fold increase in the activity of galactosyltransferase was detected in serum samples obtained from both leukemic mice models (AKR/J and Swiss) compared to the controls, whereas the sera from P388 tumor-bearing DBA/2 mice showed a statistically nonsignificant increase of only 20%. The data indicate that serum galactosyltransferase (that accepts the low-molecular-weight acceptor, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) levels are elevated in the presence of thymic leukemia, and suggest the possibility of shedding of this enzyme from the tumor cells to the systemic circulation of the host.

Cytotoxicity was evaluated by colony formation in soft agar, and DNA damage was analyzed using alkaline elution filter assays. The purposes of these studies were: (a) to characterize the time course of MMC-DNA damage; (b) to characterize the type of DNA damage [DNA-DNA interstrand cross-links (ISC), DNA-protein cross-links (DPC), single and double strand breaks (SSBs, DSBs)]; and (c) to correlate this damage with cytotoxicity in vitro. Colony-forming assays showed the D0 value for 1 h MMC to be 15.0 microM for L1210 cells and 17 microM for 8226 cells. Alkaline elution studies showed that dose-dependent ISCs and DPCs formed rapidly following MMC exposure. Removal of cross-links was delayed, with only 50% repaired 32 h after exposure. There was a good correlation between ISCs and cytotoxicity in dose-response studies in each cell line. ISCs appeared to comprise most of the MMC-DNA lesions in both cell lines. No DNA SSBs or DSBs were observed following MMC exposure. Nuclei isolated from both cell lines and exposed to MMC produced less MMC alkylation than whole cells but, again, no strand breaks were evident. These results demonstrate that MMC is principally an alkylating agent when used at pharmacological (cytotoxic) concentrations in vitro.

Overall the death rates were below those prevailing in England and Wales but consistent with those expected in a normal workforce. At ages 15-74 years the standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were 74 for deaths from all causes and 79 for deaths from all cancers. Mortality from only four causes was above the national average--namely, testicular cancer (SMR 153; 10 deaths), leukaemia (SMR 123; 35 deaths), thyroid cancer (SMR 122; three deaths), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SMR 107; 20 deaths)--but in none was the increase significant at the 5% level. Half of the authority's employees were recorded as having been monitored for exposure to radiation, their collective recorded exposure being 660 Sv (65 954 rem). Among these prostatic cancer was the only condition with a clearly increased mortality in relation to exposure. Of the 19 men who had a radiation record and died from prostatic cancer at ages 15-74 years, nine had been monitored for several different sources of exposure to radiation. The standardised mortality ratios were 889 (six deaths) in employees monitored for contamination by tritium, 254 (nine deaths) in those monitored for contamination by other radionuclides, and 385 (nine deaths) in those with dosimeter readings totalling more than 50 mSv (5 rem); but the same nine subjects tended to account for each of these significantly raised ratios. Because multiple exposures were common and other relevant information was not available the reason for the increased mortality from prostatic cancer in this population could not be determined and requires further investigation. Excess mortality rates of 2.2 and 12.5 deaths per million person years per 10 mSv (1 rem) were estimated for leukaemia and all cancers, respectively. The confidence limits around these estimates were wide, included zero, and made it unlikely that the International Commission on Radiological Protection's cancer risk coefficients were underestimated by more than 15-fold. Thus despite this being the largest British workforce whose mortality has been reported in relation to low level ionising radiation exposure, even larger populations will need to be followed up over longer periods before narrower ranges of risk estimates can be derived.",PMC1416316,,['10.1136/bmj.291.6493.440 [doi]'],,,,,

When preloading the cells with high concentrations of the fluorescent Ca2+ chelator quin 2 and subsequently stimulating in EGTA medium, the anti-delta induced rise in [Ca2+]i was strongly reduced or blocked. Nevertheless, 86Rb+ influx, also induced by anti-delta, was potentiated. In fact, in a population of cells in which anti-delta increased [Ca2+]i, but not 86Rb+ influx under standard conditions, the combination of quin-2 preloading and subsequent extracellular Ca2+ chelation by EGTA revealed an anti-delta induced 86Rb+ influx. Most of this influx was ouabain resistant, suggesting only a minor contribution from the Na+/K+ pump.

Two methods were used, both based on the distribution of lipophilic fluorescent indicators: the anionic bis(1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate)-trimethine oxonol (fluorescence measurement made on whole cell suspensions) and the cationic 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (diOC6-(3] (using flow cytofluorimetric analysis). By the latter method, the resting membrane potential was calculated to range from -40 to -63 mV. The stimulatory effect of anti-Ig was investigated on two B cell populations. In one, which may be stimulated in this way to [3H]-thymidine incorporation, the membrane potential was apparently unchanged, at least during the first hour of stimulation. In the other population, anti-Ig induced a rapid depolarization (oxonol method), but these cells did not, on the other hand, respond with [3H]-thymidine incorporation. The nature of this depolarization was further investigated. Both Na+ and K+ permeabilities appeared increased, while Ca2+ influx did not contribute to the change in membrane potential. Nor did depolarization itself change free cytosolic Ca+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, as estimated by the quin-2 method. Furthermore, anti-Ig stimulation increased [Ca2+]i in these cells, even when depolarization was abolished by lowering the extracellular Na+ concentration. Thus, in cells where depolarization could be demonstrated, it was linked neither to early changes in [Ca2+]i nor to late [3H]-thymidine incorporation. In contrast, such effects of anti-Ig stimulation were observed in other cells without any significant early change in the membrane potential.",,,['10.1111/j.1748-1716.1985.tb07638.x [doi]'],,,,,

Ara-C incorporates into DNA, and the extent of (ara-C)DNA formation correlates significantly with loss of clonogenic survival. The inhibition of DNA replication by ara-C also results in DNA fragmentation and terminal differentiation of leukemic cells. Other studies have demonstrated that inhibition of DNA replication by ara-C results in an aberrant form of DNA synthesis with certain segments of DNA being replicated more than once within a single cell cycle. The additional copies of certain segments of DNA could lead to the accumulation of DNA fragments and alterations in gene expression. It is of interest that other inhibitors of S-phase DNA replication such as aphidicolin and hydroxyurea can also induce similar phenotypic changes in HL-60 and K562 leukemia cells. Although the in vitro data support the concept that ara-C is capable of inducing leukemic cell differentiation, there is no evidence to suggest that this agent induces differentiation of human leukemic cells in vivo. Drug levels achieved by administration of low-dose ara-C (42-64 nmol/L) result in the incorporation of ara-C into bone marrow mononuclear preparations from patients with preleukemia syndromes. This concentration of ara-C (5 X 10(-8) mol/L) slows DNA replication of human leukemic cells in vitro. Thus, the clinical use of low doses of ara-C that achieve plasma concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-7) mol/L could theoretically induce maturational effects by partially inhibiting DNA synthesis. At the present time we have no available data to support this contention. On the basis of chromosomal analyses, low-dose ara-C apparently maintains sufficient drug levels to suppress more ""malignant"" clones, but even ""clonal"" selection may represent elimination of leukemic cells by either cytotoxicity or induction of terminal differentiation. Further studies will be necessary to define the mechanism of action of low-dose ara-C in preleukemia.",,,['0093-7754(85)90058-2 [pii]'],,,,,33

While studying 65 patients with lymphoblastic leukemia whose karyotype was determined at diagnosis, we compared the findings in 8 patients with lymphomatous ALL and 57 patients whose presentations were more typical of ALL. Six patients with lymphomatous ALL had karyotypic abnormalities leading to loss of bands p21-p22 on the short arm of chromosome 9. The mechanisms varied and included deletions, unbalanced translocations, or loss of the entire chromosome. Only 1 of the 57 patients without lymphomatous ALL had an abnormality of chromosome 9 at diagnosis (P less than 0.001). These findings indicate that loss of chromosomal material in the region of 9p21-p22 is closely associated with lymphomatous ALL; by analogy with retinoblastoma, in which gene deletions are associated with an enzyme deficiency, this disease may be related to the loss of the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, previously reported in some of these patients.",,"['CA-19266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-72998/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1056/NEJM198508013130503 [doi]'],,,,,

We recently proposed that physiological and pharmacological agents which enhance differentiation and maturation in vitro act by two fundamentally different routes: (1) by hastening the progression through various differentiation/maturation steps; (2) by slowing proliferation (usually by inhibition of DNA synthesis). In order to test this thesis we looked for synergistic effects on differentiation using pairs of agents from the two groups in cultures of cells from myelodysplastic and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and from normal marrow donors. The results with three MDS, two AML and three normal samples show that combinations of differentiation inducing agents (retinoic acid, N-methylformamide) with DNA synthesis inhibitors (6-mercaptopurine, cytosine arabinoside and aphidicolin) produce a differentiation inducing effect equivalent to that of 10-100, or even 1000 fold higher concentrations of single agents. Myelotoxic effects in vitro were not synergistic.

Under reducing conditions, two major subunits of Mr approximately 26,000 and Mr approximately 42,000, and minor components of Mr approximately 28,000, 31,000, and 36,000 were observed. The Mr approximately 26,000 subunit was identical to kappa-light chains from HMy2 surface IgG in apparent m.w., isoelectric point, and staphylococcal V-8 protease peptide map, but was not precipitated in association with Ig heavy chain. The Mr approximately 42,000 component was homologous to rabbit skeletal muscle actin by peptide mapping with staphylococcal V-8 protease. The cell surface origin of the immunoprecipitated antigen was confirmed by demonstrating lactoperoxidase dependence of iodination and complete removal from the cell surface after pronase treatment of viable cells. Thus, cell surface expression of KMA is the result of membrane association of non-heavy chain-linked kappa-light chains, possibly in noncovalent association with actin.",,,,,,,,

Replacing the lymphocyte-specific IgH enhancer with a viral enhancer did not affect tissue specificity of mu Ig gene expression. We identified two new regulatory regions that provide transcriptional tissue specificity. First, the V H promoter region between position -154 and +57 was shown to direct lymphocyte-specific transcription of a bacterial gpt gene, even in the presence of a viral enhancer. Second, mu intragenic sequences, lacking the IgH enhancer, were found to regulate the level of accumulated Ig transcripts in a tissue-specific fashion.

Addition of a sublethal concentration of Aphidicolin (0.4 microM) in culture for 3 days suppresses DNA synthesis to a similar level of the resting stage (day 8) in control cultures. DNA synthesis is reactivated to the level observed in the growing stage of control cultures once Aphidicolin is removed after 3 days in culture. The level of DNA synthesis at the early stage of RA-induction (day 3) is suppressed by only 17% when compared to control cultures. The inhibitory effect of Aphidicolin on DNA synthesis in both control cultures and RA-induced cell cultures is similar. However, no reactivation of DNA synthesis is observed after removal of Aphidicolin on day 3 from RA-induced cell cultures. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content on day 3 reveals that cells accumulate in G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle after exposure to Aphidicolin with or without RA. Of interest is the fact that, while Aphidicolin alone did not induce cells to differentiate, neither did it interfere with RA-induced cell differentiation (the rate of RA-induced cell differentiation in the presence of Aphidicolin is similar to that of RA-treated cultures in the absence of Aphidicolin). These results suggest that the combined use of Aphidicolin and RA may inhibit leukaemic cell proliferation more effectively without causing severe cytotoxicity and without interfering with RA-induced cell differentiation.",,['CA-14278-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1985.tb00669.x [doi]'],,,,,

A decreased level of protein C activity was found in 96% of the plasma samples from individuals with DIC; the protein C antigen was decreased in 73%. The inhibitor of protein C was decreased in all samples. Analysis of serial samples from patients with DIC reveals that protein C activity and antigen and protein C inhibitor decrease progressively during the initial stages of DIC and remain at a low level for 24 to 48 hours before gradually returning toward normal in nonfatal cases. The protein C activity decreases in parallel with protein C inhibitor and is lower than protein C antigen. In a fatal case of DIC, protein C activity and protein C inhibitor rapidly decreased to undetectable levels; however, protein C antigen was gradually decreasing but still detectable at time of death.

LAMP-1 was purified from P388 cells by affinity chromatography with 1D4B monoclonal antibody, yielding a homogeneous glycoprotein comprising 0.1% of the total detergent-extracted cell protein.

No spontaneous production of IFN-gamma was found in supernatants of cultures from both patients and normal controls. However, whereas the enzyme galactose oxidase or staphylococcal enterotoxin B was able to induce IFN-gamma production by normal cells, no production could be obtained in the cells under study. The possibility that this lack of production might have been attributed to an excess of N-acetylneuraminic acid masking galactose residues or to a defect of monocyte accessory cells was ruled out either by pre-treating the cells with neuraminidase or by adding normal adherent cells to the cultures, both of which resulted in a lack of production. On the contrary, the calcium ionophore A23187 (considered to act as a second specific step, following oxidation of galactose residues, toward genetic derepression of IFN-gamma) induced considerable IFN-gamma production in all the three tested patients. It can be concluded that, although in rare cases, as previously reported by other authors, cells from patients with T or NK lymphoproliferative disorders may spontaneously produce IFN-gamma, this is not a general mechanism that underlies the disease. In fact, in all our cases a defect of IFN-gamma production was found. This defect seems due to an alteration at the membrane level of the galactose-containing glycoproteins and can be restored by induction with a calcium ionophore.",,,['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1985.tb01436.x [doi]'],,,,,

A Mr 25,000 protein was the major [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate-binding protein in extracts of RBL-1 cells. Double-immunodiffusion analysis of extracts revealed immunoreactivity for rat mast cell protease (RMCP)-II, a Mr 25,000 neutral protease present in the secretory granules of rat mucosal mast cells and cultured rat bone marrow-derived mast cells, but no immunoreactivity for RMCP-I, the predominant neutral protease of rat connective tissue mast cells. By radial immunodiffusion, there was 66.8 ng of RMCP-II per 10(6) cells. Whereas rat connective tissue mast cells stain with alcian blue and safranin and contain heparin proteoglycan, rat mucosal and rat bone marrow-derived mast cells stain with alcian blue only and contain a non-heparin proteoglycan and lesser amounts of histamine. Proliferation of rat mucosal mast cells in vivo and rat bone marrow-derived mast cells in vitro requires T-cell factors, whereas no comparable requirement has been observed for connective tissue mast cells. The transformed RBL-1 tumor cells, whose growth is independent of factors other than those present in standard tissue culture medium, has previously been shown to contain predominantly chondroitin sulfate di-B proteoglycans and low amounts of histamine.

We have cloned the chromosomal joinings between chromosomes 11 and 14 and also between chromosomes 14 and 18, in B-cell tumours carrying translocations involving these chromosomes, and suggested the existence of two translocated loci, bcl-1 and bcl-2, normally located on chromosomes 11 (band q13) and 18 (band q21) respectively, involved in the pathogenesis of human B-cell neoplasms. The results indicate that in the leukaemic cells from two different cases of CLL, the breakpoints on chromosome 11 are within 8 nucleotides of each other and on chromosome 14 involve the J4-DNA segment.

The cloned gene possessed a unique direct repeat sequence of 84 bp in the 5' flanking region as well as an enhancer-like element in the JH-C gamma 1 intron. The latter sequence is located 1 kb downstream of 3' end of the J6 exon. The direct-repeat sequence in the 5'-flanking region contained a core-like sequence resembling that of viral enhancer elements. It is located in the intron between two leader exons. P1 nuclease mapping and exonuclease VII digestion experiments showed that most of the direct repeats are noncoding regions and spliced out from the transcript. These data suggested that HIG1 gene might have two kinds of enhancer-like elements at both sides of the V region gene. HIG1 gene has been introduced by the protoplast fusion into mouse myeloma cells (NSI and J558L cells) and mouse fibroblasts. A pSV2gpt vector containing HIG1 gene (pSV2-HIG1) was used to transform the cells. The amounts of mRNA synthesized in the transformed cells were at least 50 to 100 times larger than those in ARH-77 cells, although about one copy of HIG1 gene was present in DNA of a transformed cell. HIG1 gene was not expressed in fibroblasts, indicating that the enhancer of HIG1 gene acts in a tissue-specific manner but not in a species-specific one.

The present study examines whether this phenomenon is related to a DFMO-mediated increase in the selectivity of MGBG for tumor tissue. Specifically, the effect of DFMO pretreatment on the tissue distribution and content of MGBG was investigated in mice bearing ascites L1210 leukemia. At 3 and 18 h following a single i.v. injection of [14C]MGBG (50 mg/kg), L1210 cells and seven tissues from nonpretreated (control) and DFMO-pretreated (3% by drinking water for 3 days) animals were compared for their [14C]MGBG content. In control mice, the greatest amount of drug was found in L1210 cells, small intestine, and kidney (in decreasing order of magnitude) at both 3 and 18 h. This distribution was not altered following DFMO pretreatment, but the relative MGBG content of other tissues was shifted. On an average, DFMO pretreatment increased the accumulation of MGBG by 30% in normal tissues and 32% in tumor tissues at 3 h and 56% and 69%, respectively, at 18 h. Thus, pretreatment of leukemic mice with DFMO fails to improve the selectivity of MGBG for L1210 cells. It is possible that other tumor systems might demonstrate sufficient DFMO-mediated increases in MGBG uptake to enhance drug selectivity but not without significantly increasing MGBG uptake (and hence toxicity) in normal tissues.",,"['CA-09072/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The compounds included a series of N4-SPD derivatives (N4-methyl-SPD, N4-ethyl-SPD, N4-acetyl-SPD, N4-hexyl-SPD, N4-hexanoyl-SPD, N4-benzyl-SPD, and N4-benzoyl-SPD) and a series of N1,N8-SPD derivatives [N1,N8-bis(ethyl)-SPD, N1,N8-bis(acetyl)-SPD, N1,N8-bis(propyl)-SPD, and N1,N8-bis(propionyl)-SPD]. Uptake studies revealed N4-alkyl derivatives to be the most effective competitive inhibitors of [3H]SPD uptake (Ki, 26 to 43 microM) followed by N1,N8-alkyl derivatives (Ki, 71 to 115 microM), then N4-acyl derivatives (Ki, 115 to greater than 500 microM), and N1,N8-acyl derivatives (Ki, greater than 500 microM). The data indicate the relative importance of the terminal amines and of charge as determinants of cellular uptake. Of the 11 derivatives, only N4-hexyl-SPD, N1,N8-bis(ethyl)-SPD, and N1,N8-bis(propyl)-SPD demonstrated antiproliferative activity at 0.1 mM with 50%-inhibitory concentration values at 48 h of 30, 40, and 50 microM, respectively. In the case of the N1,N8-SPD derivatives, recovery from growth inhibition was enhanced considerably by exogenous SPD, suggesting involvement of polyamine depletion. At 10 to 30 microM, both N1,N8-bis(ethyl)-SPD and N1,N8-bis(propyl)-SPD (but not N4-hexyl-SPD) inhibited polyamine biosynthesis as indicated by significant reductions in polyamine pools and in biosynthetic enzyme activities. The more effective of the two, N1,N8-bis(ethyl)-SPD, depleted intracellular putrescine and SPD and reduced spermine by approximately 50% at 96 h and decreased ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activities by 98 and 62%, respectively. Since neither derivative (at 5 mM) directly inhibited these enzymes from untreated cell extracts by significantly more than SPD itself, it is suspected that they act by regulating enzyme levels. As a measure of regulatory potential of the derivatives, ornithine decarboxylase was assayed in cells treated for 24 h and compared to the effects of 10 microM SPD which reduced the enzyme activity by 80%. None of the N4-SPD derivatives affected ornithine decarboxylase activity, while N1,N8-bis(ethyl)- and (propyl)-SPD were nearly as effective as SPD. Apparently, the central amine of the molecule is critical for regulatory function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

A modified peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method was used for staining paraffin sections with lectin I of Ulex europaeus (UEA-I), which is a specific marker for vascular endothelial cells. The T-cell nature of each case was proven by immunohistochemistry, including immunoperoxidase staining of frozen sections with monoclonal T-cell antibodies. The cases were subclassified according to previously established criteria, but with the addition of a separate group showing a high content of clear cells. For the purpose of the present study, the small blood vessels were separated into two main variants, viz.: high endothelial venules (HEV) and all other types of vessels with flat endothelium (SVFE). The development of each of these variants and the extent of lymphocyte migration through the vascular wall were assessed semiquantitatively. The findings suggest that the blood microvasculature, as a whole, is similar in all types of T-cell lymphoma. There were distinct differences, however, in the development of the two main categories of small vessels between the various types. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia of T-type (T-CLL) and Sezary's syndrome were poor in SVFE and rich in HEV, and there was considerable lymphocyte traffic through the latter. In contrast, T-immunoblastic and especially T-lymphoblastic lymphocyte traffic. The appearance of the microvasculature varied markedly in the various subtypes of ""pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma"". In the small cell subtype HEV predominated and SVFE represented only a small or moderate fraction of the microvasculature. As the size of the neoplastic lymphoid cells increased towards the medium-sized and large cell subtype, there was a decrease in the number of HEV and an increase in the number of SVFE accompanied by a decrease in lymphocyte migration. In T-cell lymphoma of the clear cell type the microvasculature showed features between those of T-CLL and the small cell subtype of pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma. Electron microscopy confirmed the light microscopic findings and revealed many similarities in vascular changes between ""pleomorphic T-cell lymphomas"" and lymphogranulomatosis X.",,,['10.1007/BF00737170 [doi]'],,,,,

The ricin-resistant SH9 lines, SH9.R0 and SH9.R1, were demonstrated to be deficient in cell surface ricin-binding sites, but otherwise had the cellular phenotype of SH9 cells. Ricin-resistant T-cell hybridomas were prepared by fusion of SH9.R0 and SH9.R1 with activated T-lymphocytes. The presence of ricin in the selection medium rapidly killed unfused T-lymphocytes and prevented cell transformation by human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) which is shed by the SH9.R0 and SH9.R1 cells. This ensured that the cells growing out were indeed hybridomas. Ricin-resistant T-cell hybridomas were characterised and also shown to lack cell surface receptors for ricin.

Cells were cultured for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 days with inducer and then plated in medium containing methylcellulose without inducer. Daily after plating, hemoglobin content was scored by benzidine staining, and growth was assessed by estimating the cell number per colony. With all inducers used, three types of colonies were found, those containing only benzidine-positive cells, those containing only benzidine-negative cells, and those containing both cell types (mixed colonies). Thymidine produced a progressive increase in the percentage of positive and mixed colonies and a progressive fall in the percentage of negative colonies. Whereas negative colonies grew at an exponential rate with a generation time of about 20 hours, positive colonies reached an average maximum size of 16 cells, representing a total of four divisions. Butyrate had a similar effect, except that the rise was greater for mixed colonies than for positive colonies, and the plateau in positive colony size was less evident. In contrast, CO2 depletion or hemin treatment induced an increase in the fraction of cells staining benzidine positive that was lost rapidly upon removal of the inducing condition. Thus, of the four conditions, thymidine and butyrate caused commitment, whereas hemin and CO2 depletion did not. Thus K562 cells, like Friend cells, demonstrate commitment, but, unlike Friend cells, demonstrate a significant rate of commitment in the absence of inducer and hence form a significant percentage of mixed colonies with or without inducer.",,,['S0006-4971(20)83592-7 [pii]'],,,,,

Recombinant DNA technology involving analysis of immunoglobulin gene arrangement has been used to classify neoplasms of previously uncertain lineage, aid in the diagnosis of neoplasms of the B-cell series, and define the state of differentiation of neoplastic B-cell precursors.

Using 40% TdT+ cells to define positivity, 71 of 102 cases were IP+/IF+, 12 were IP+/IF-, and 19 were IP/IF-.

Direct comparison of ABC and PAP technics in ten cases showed the results by both methods to be similar. In addition, previous reports utilizing the IF method found approximately 10% of cases of AML to have greater than 10% TdT+ cells. The authors' findings for the IF method were similar (15%), but using the IP methods, the authors were able to detect greater than 10% TdT+ cells in 46% of AML cases and greater than 40% TdT+ cells in 31% of AML cases.

Using [14C]nicotinamide to study the uptake of nicotinamide and its conversion to NAD, we showed that the analogs interfere with NAD synthesis, apparently by blocking formation of nicotinamide mononucleotide. The analogs also serve as weak inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is an NAD-utilizing, chromatin-bound enzyme, whose function is required for normal DNA repair processes.

Generally, continuous drug exposure of exponentially growing cells does not provide sufficient quantitative information concerning cell-cycle-phase-specific mechanisms of drug action. Alternatively, stathmokinetic experiments, which are usually limited to some fraction of one cell doubling time, provide little information about long-term drug effects. By using mathematical models constructed for this purpose, however, stathmokinetic data can predict the overall proportion of cells affected by a drug though failing to discern between various kinds of drug action (e.g. reversible v. irreversible block, blocking v. killing action, etc.), especially when it occurs in G2 phase. In addition, it can be shown that for at least one of the drugs (soluble ICRF) the stathmokinetic experiment fails to predict 'after-effects' of drug treatment which extend into the following cell cycle(s). It also becomes clear that the degradation of exponential growth characteristics of quickly dividing cells during long-term, continuous drug exposure makes prediction of cell-cycle kinetic perturbations uncertain when derived from short-duration stathmokinetic experiments. However, with care, the joint application of 'short term' (e.g. stathmokinesis) and 'long term' (e.g. continuous exposure) techniques allow adequate quantitative insight into drug-perturbed cell-cycle kinetics. The applicability of modelling techniques is discussed: in the present instance it is limited to lower drug concentrations.

Therefore, L5178Y (sensitive) or L5178Y/L-ASE (resistant) ascites lymphoma cells were incubated with 14C-labeled glyoxylate, glycine, serine, or asparagine, and the metabolism to other amino acids was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Metabolic differences between the two cells lines were found. Under control conditions, the interconversion rate of glycine and serine via serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) was higher in sensitive than in resistant cells. The transformation rate of glyoxylate to serine was also higher in sensitive cells. These results may indicate a difference in the activity of SHMT. An alternate explanation would be that transport or diffusion of serine and glycine into sensitive cells is greater than into resistant cells. Several crucial metabolic differences were observed between the two cell types when L-asparaginase was added. A key difference is the decrease of glycine synthesis from glyoxylate observed in the sensitive cells compared to resistant cells which show no change. This suggests that asparagine is used for transamination of glyoxylate. Also, only sensitive cells appear to compensate for L-asparaginase-induced loss of glycine formation from glyoxylate by increasing glycine synthesis from serine. Alterations in sensitive tumor glycine metabolism may be an important function of L-asparaginase anticancer activity.",,"['CA 00628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0006-2952(85)90190-X [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(85)90190-x [doi]']",,,,,

The relative reactivity of these nucleosides with MTAPase from HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells is MTA greater than 5'-deoxy-5'-fluoroadenosine (5'-FlAdo) greater than 5'-chloro-5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-ClAdo) greter than 5'-bromo-5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-BrAdo) greater than 5'-deoxy-5'-iodoadenosine (5'-IAdo). In MTAPase-containing cells, the adenine released from the 5'-halogenated adenosine was incorporated into adenine nucleotide pools; cleavage by (MTAPase appeared to be the rate-limiting step in this process. 5'-BrAdo and 5'-IAdo were growth inhibitors (EC50 values less than 10 microM) of MTAPase-containing cell lines (HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia and the L5178Y murine lymphoblastic leukemia) but were much less active (EC50 values greater than 65 microM) against MTAPase-deficient cell lines (the CCRF-CEM human T cell leukemia and the L1210 murine leukemia). The full cytotoxicity of these compounds, therefore, appeared to be related to their phosphorolysis by MTAPase.

These results suggest that an interaction between the idiotype of monoclonal immunoglobulins and antiidiotypic antibodies causes increased consumption of C1q and C1 inhibitor in patients with acquired angioedema and C1-inhibitor deficiency.

For the determination of whether chronic alkylating agent treatment of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro was detectably leukemogenic, murine long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) and clonal interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell lines [B6SUtA clone (cl) 27 and Ro cl 3-1] derived from LTBMC were chronically pulse treated in vitro with the alkylating agent melphalan [L-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM)]. Weekly treatment of C3H/HeJ or CD-1 Swiss mouse LTBMC with 3 X 10(-6)M L-PAM significantly decreased cumulative production of nonadherent granulocytes and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells responsive to L-cell or WEH1-3 cell colony-stimulating factor compared to the production seen in untreated control cultures; it also significantly reduced the hematopoietic longevity (13 wk compared to greater than 20 wk for untreated control cultures). Weekly, twice weekly, or daily (3 X 10(-6)M) L-PAM treatment of IL-3-dependent cell lines induced gradual L-PAM adaptation in the absence of a detectable change in the maximum binding capacity of 125I-labeled IL-3. No leukemogenic variants of line B6SUtA cl 27 were detectably induced. However, 3 stably expressed marker chromosomes were induced after 12 months of L-PAM treatment of line B6SUtA cl 27. Thus IL-3-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cells slowly adapt to L-PAM when in suspension culture in vitro.

This activity, termed monocyte cell line cytotoxin(s) (MCCT), was tested in vitro on different human continuous cell lines (Chang, ESH-7, GM3104A, HeLa, HT-1080, K562, Mel, T-24) and on primary human fibroblasts (GM3468, Manz). The continuous cell lines exhibited a spectrum of sensitivity to MCCT-containing supernatants whereas the primary fibroblasts were resistant to lysis. Enzymatic degradation and heat denaturation studies indicate that MCCT is a protein. Its bioactivity can be resolved into three lytic peaks after molecular sieving on Ultrogel AcA 44. The major peak, designated alpha MCCT, eluted with a molecular weight of 100,000-140,000 daltons. A minor peak, beta MCCT, was seen at 60,000-80,000 daltons, and a third, unstable minor peak, gamma MCCT, eluted at less than 10,000 daltons. The alpha-lytic peak was examined further and was found to migrate as a single peak in 7% native polyacrylamide gel electrolysis tube gels with an rf of 0.25-0.30. None of the MCCT forms were immunologically cross-reactive with human alpha-lymphotoxin. Various protease inhibitors known to inhibit monokine- and macrophage-mediated direct cell lysis in vitro were tested for their inhibitory effects on alpha MCCT activity. The irreversible binding inhibitor N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysyl chloromethyl ketone inhibited the biologic activity of alpha MCCT. The reversible binding inhibitors N alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester and soybean trypsin inhibitor were able to block in vitro lytic activity when added to alpha MCCT in the presence of the target cell. In contrast, the inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, L-1-tosylamide, 2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and N alpha-acetyl-L-lysine methyl ester were not effective in blocking cytolysis. Finally, the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase inhibited alpha MCCT lytic activity in vitro; however, the hypochlorous acid scavengers alanine, serine, and valine were without effect.",,,,,,,,

Non-S-phase incorporation was not, however, limited to neoplastic cells. Normal human peripheral blood B cells treated with the Cowan strain of Staphylococcus aureus (CSA) undergo a transient burst in thymidine incorporation, but do not go on to divide in the absence of other stimuli. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that 80% of this CSA-stimulated dN incorporation was into G0/G1 cells. These data are consistent with a more dynamic state of DNA synthesis than usually envisioned. Furthermore, the data show that although thymidine incorporation levels are related to incorporation of dN into DNA, they can be unrelated to cell proliferation.",,,['10.1016/0014-4827(85)90549-x [doi]'],,,,,

In vitro treatment of lymphocytes with the antiviral antibiotic cordycepin (10 micrograms/ml) lowers the level of SCEs in BALB/Mo cells to the same value of BALB/c cells. M-MuLV yield is also markedly reduced in BALB/Mo lymphocytes cultured in the presence of cordycepin. The drug also abolishes the increased sensitivity of BALB/Mo lymphocytes to the induction of SCEs by mitomycin C (MMC) either in vitro (3 X 10(-8)/10(-7)M) or in vivo (0.3/3 mg/kg). Since cordycepin is known to inhibit poly(A)synthesis thus blocking RNA maturation, it is suggested that M-MuLV proviral integration is not per se the sole factor responsible for the more pronounced susceptibility of BALB/Mo lymphocytes to SCE induction, but most likely viral gene expression and amplification are needed for this effect to occur.",,,['10.1093/carcin/6.1.131 [doi]'],,,,,

The addition of glutamyl moieties through gamma-linkage enhanced the inhibitory activity of PDDF against thymidylate synthetase without significant effect on dihydrofolate reductase.
