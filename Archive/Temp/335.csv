Our figure was 176. We excluded squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and a large number of cases that did not fulfill the prerequisites of confirmed diagnosis and no significant treatment. The four most common examples of regression were carcinoma of the kidney (31), neuroblastoma (29), malignant melanoma (19), and choriocarcinoma (19); these constituted more than half the group. We did not require that the regression be permanent because it appeared that the explanation of temporary regression would be just as important as the cause of permanent regression. There was no proven specific cause of the regression, but the following mechanisms had a possible relationship: immunologic action, elimination of carcinogens, trauma (altering the antigen-antibody relationship), hormones, irradiation, infection and/or fever, and drugs or chemicals. The most applicable of these is elimination of the carcinogen. Immunologic reactions seem to offer the best explanation, and the potential of humoral immunity is more impressive than that of cellular immunity.",,,,,,,,,,

The drugs were active against ip L1210 leukemia when administered ip, sc, or orally. Administration every fourth day x 3 proved to be the most effective treatment schedule for both drugs, although significant activity was seen on all treatment schedules tested. Both congeners had activity against sc implanted L1210 leukemia as well as a limited effect on the ic implanted tumor. 5-FU produced greater increases in lifespan of mice bearing L1210 leukemia than did ftorafur. 5-FU was also more effective against ip B16 melanoma and ip Gardner 6C3HED lymphosarcoma. Ftorafur was ineffective in the treatment of mice bearing ip P388 leukemia, a tumor which is quite sensitive to 5-FU. At approximately equimolar doses both drugs produced a persistent inhibition of 2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA of L1210 cells in vivo. Ftorafur produced a greater inhibition of uridine incorporation into RNA than did 5-FU, which may account for the lower therapeutic activity of ftorafur. In combination chemotherapy of L1210 leukemia 5-FU plus ftorafur was no more effective than 5-FU alone, neither of the congeners was synergistic with either adriamycin or actinomycin D, and in combination with methotrexate therapeutic synergism was observed with 5-FU but not with ftorafur. After eight transplant generations of exposure to ftorafur, a subline of L1210 leukemia became totally resistant to ftorafur and simultaneously cross-resistant to 5-FU. Doses of ftorafur and 5-FU which were optimally effective in mice bearing the parental L1210 line were lethal to mice implanted with the ftorafur-resistant subline. When treatment of the resistant subline was discontinued after nine transplant generations of exposure to ftorafur, sensitivity to 5-FU returned after three transplant generations without ftorafur. The subline retained its resistance to ftorafur until eight transplant generations after cessation of ftorafur treatment. Another subline of L1210 leukemia exposed to 5-fU for 20 transplant generations proved to be completely resistant to 5-fu and cross-resistant to ftorafur. The mutual cross-resistance between ftorafur and 5-FU supports the contention that ftorafur acts primarily as a depot form of 5-FU.",,,,,,,,,,

Both are related to findings in the early embryo aggregation derived mouse chimaera model. Such chimaeras are most commonly derived following the aggregation of two undifferentiated embryos and therefore not suprisingly they were originally considered examples of ""classic"" immunological tolerance. Since this time alternative mechanisms including humoral and cell suppressor activity have been suggested and until recently tolerance in tetraparental chimaeras has remained a controversy. This controversy is now reviewed in the light of recent findings which has suggested that such mice are in fact examples of classic tolerance with the possibility that this is achieved by heterogeneous elimination of the clone of potentially self in equilibrium self auto-reactive cells. Chimaeras have also been studied in respect of leukaemogenesis. Results in a group of AKR reversible CBA leukaemia susceptible reversible resistant chimaeras suggest resistance is dominant. Moreover evidence now points to lack of anti-viral antibody activity in these chimaeras which I wish to suggest may be related to apparent resistance to leukaemia. In this context it may be envisaged that in the absence of masking anti-viral antigen complexes ""normal"" tumour immunity may have been effected. Although this has yet to be proven evidence points to tolerance to the oncogenic virus being maintained in the chimaeras furthermore also in the naturally derived (AKR X CBA) F1. This in turn leads me to suggest that ""intolerance"" to the oncogenic virus, the spontaneous development of anti-viral antibodies and tumour development might well be related in the AKR. This in turn enables me to propose that tolerance and leukaemogenesis, at least in this stiuation, appear to be related.",,,,,,,,,,

The ionophore was used because it transfers divalent cations through biological membranes and causes the transformation of normal lymphocytes. The sensitivity of the cells was measured by incubation of lymphocyte suspensions with and without reagent at 37 degrees C for one to seven days and counting the number of viable lymphocytes before and after incubation. Viability of the cells was judged by cytologic criteria as visualized by phase contrast microscopy. Lymphocytes were obtained from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and from normal persons. Colchicine and vincristine killed in one day non-dividing leukemic lymphocytes while normal lymphocytes were much less sensitive to the two alkaloids. X-irradiation (1000 rad) killed nearly all leukemic lymphocytes in two days and normal lymphocytes in three days. Ionophore A23187 (2 X 10(-5)M) was moderately toxic to normal but not to leukemic lymphocytes and caused the transformation of both types of cells. The ionophore inhibited the cytocidal action of colchicine and vincristine to leukemic but not to normal lymphocytes and inhibited the action of X-irradiation to both types of lymphocytes. The present findings and a review of the literature suggest the hypothesis that calcium or other divalent ions are involved in the cytotoxicity of colchicine, vincristine, and X-irradiation of leukemic lymphocytes and that there may be an abnormality of the metabolism of divalent ions in leukemic lymphocytes.",['10.1159/000225126 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

A spectrum of qualitative abnormalities serves to distinguish myeloid leukemic CFU-c from normal and remission populations. These abnormalities in maturation and proliferation are diagnostic of a myeloid leukemic state and serve to functionally reclassify acute myeloid leukemia at diagnosis into a number of categories based on in vitro growth pattern. The virtue of this classification is that it permits detection of a substantial number of patients who are refractory to conventional remission induction protocols. The clear distinction between normal and leukemic growth in vitro permits early detection of emerging remission CFU-c during induction therapy and of early onset of relapse in patients who are otherwise in complete remission. In patients with leukemia undergoing allogeneic bone marrow engraftment, marrow culture has proved of value in documenting the reconstitution of the patient and in detecting re-emergence of the original leukemic stem line prior to its detection by cytogenetic and hematological techniques. Serial studies on patients with chronic myeloid leukemia have allowed early diagnosis of blastic transformation and classification of blastic phase disease on the basis of in vitro growth pattern has revealed a similar spectrum of in vitro abnormalities as seen in AML. The cloning of normal or leukemic human myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-c) in agar or methylcellulose has permitted analysis of both quantitative and qualitative changes in this cell compartment in leukemia and other myelodysplastic states (1-7). Among these changes are abnormalities in maturation of leukemic cells in vitro (4, 5, 6), defective proliferation as measured by colony size or cluster to colony ratio (5, 6), abnormalities in biophysical characteristics of leukemic CFU-c (4, 5), regulatory defects in responsiveness to positive and negative feedback control mechanisms (8, 9) and the existence of cytogenetic abnormalities in vitro (10, 11). Detection of this spectrum of abnormalities has proved of clinical utility in diagnosis of leukemia and preleukemic states (5, 6, 12), in classification of leukemias and myeloproliferative diseases (5, 6), in predicting remission prognosis and response to therapy (5, 13), in predicting onset of remission or relapse in AML (13) and in monitoring the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia or preleukemic disease (4, 14).

A newly developed culture system has been described in which marrow from AML patients in these disease stages form leukemic cell colonies. In this in vitro system, phytohaemagglutinin is the essential stimulator for colony formation. The leukemic origin of the colonies has been proven by ultrastructural morphology and cytogenetics. It appears that colony formation by leukemic cells in this system is predominantly independent from the leukocyte factor which is the main stimulator in the Robinson assay for growing colonies of marrow cells from haematologically normal individuals. Bone marrow cells in untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) demonstrate abnormal growth in vitro in the Robinson assay (Robinson et al., 1971; and Bull et al., 1973). Characteristically, there is a near total failure of colony formation; predominantly clusters are formed containing 20 cells or less (Bull et al., 1973; Greenberg et al., 1971; Moore et al., 1973 and 1974, and van Bekkum et al., in press). The absence of colonies has been shown to be due to a marked decrease of the normal myeloid precursor cell population in untreated AML. The small agregate formation of AML cells has been attributed to the suboptimal response of leukemic cells to the leukocyte stimulation factor. Because this poor proliferation in vitro might not represent the maximal in vitro and in vivo proliferation potential of the leukemic cells, we studied a number of modifications of the in vitro culture system. A number of factors were studied which may have some influence on cell proliferation in general, notably phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), which induces lymphocyte colonies in vitro (Rozenszajn et al., 1974), and endotoxin which has been demonstrated to increase the labelling index of leukemic cells in vivo (Golde et al.). In this paper an in vitro system is described in which marrow cells from untreated AML and AML in relapse were stimulated by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) to form leukemic cell colonies in soft agar. These (similar) cells predominantly formed small aggregates (20 cells or less) in the presence of the normal leukocyte feeder layer alone. Moreover, in the course of the experiments, it appeared that by adding low concentrations of endotoxin to the cultures, the stimulating effect of PHA could be amplified.",['10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Binding sites for cholera toxin (monosialoganglioside GM1) were found to be normally expressed in chronic leukaemias but greatly diminished or absent in acute leukaemias irrespective of their morphological type. Antibodies specific for the common form of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, non-T, non-B) have been produced in rabbits. After extensive absorption and testing these were shown to define a cell surface antigen of non-T, non-B type ALLs. The antigen is absent from other leukaemias with two interesting exceptions--the majority of acute undifferentiated leukaemias express the antigen as do a proportion of chronic granulocytic leukaemias in blast crisis relapse. The anti-ALL antibodies can therefore be used to distinguish different leukaemias and, more significantly, can identify the existence of relatively rare leukaemic cells in the blood of untreated patients and the marrow of treated patients considered to be in remission.",['10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_26 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

One unreported result which deserves such publication is the development of the expertise to design and analyse such trials. This report was prepared by a group of British and American statisticians, but it is intended for people without any statistical expertise. Part I, which appears in this issue, discusses the design of such trials; Part II, which will appear separately in the January 1977 issue of the Journal, gives full instructions for the statistical analysis of such trials by means of life tables and the logrank test, including a worked example, and discusses the interpretation of trial results, including brief reports of 2 particular trials. Both parts of this report are relevant to all clinical trials which study time to death, and wound be equally relevant to clinical trials which study time to other particular classes of untoward event: first stroke, perhaps, or first relapse, metastasis, disease recurrence, thrombosis, transplant rejection, or death from a particular cause. Part I, in this issue, collects together ideas that have mostly already appeared in the medical literature, but Part II, next month, is the first simple account yet published for non-statistical physicians of how to analyse efficiently data from clinical trials of survival duration. Such trials include the majority of all clinical trials of cancer therapy; in cancer trials,however, it may be preferable to use these statistical methods to study time to local recurrence of tumour, or to study time to detectable metastatic spread, in addition to studying total survival. Solid tumours can be staged at diagnosis; if this, or any other available information in some other disease is an important determinant of outcome, it can be used to make the overall logrank test for the whole heterogeneous trial population more sensitive, and more intuitively satisfactory, for it will then only be necessary to compare like with like, and not, by chance, Stage I with Stage III.",['10.1038/bjc.1976.220 [doi]'],PMC2025229,,,,,,,,

He has employed traditional terminology, thereby avoiding the jargon used by certain authors which is not justified in the light of modern scientific knowledge which, more than ever, merits the use of classical terminology. The authors present this W.H.O. classification for the first time to the french press. The reader will find familiar terms such as ""lymphosarcoma"", which may take a nodular or diffuse form (in the second case the recently identified immunoblastic form is introduced and mycosis fungoides is placed in the category) and reticulosarcoma. Microscopic typing of a haematosarcoma is essential since the various types differe considerably in their sensitivity to treatment with a corresponding difference in the chance of cure. The potential for cure is also dependent upon the topographic stage which should be determined by a series of routine step which may still be recommended today but which may be useless in the future by virtue of the frequency of disseminated forms in relation to localized forms, and of the remarkable effectiveness and constant progress of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",,,,,,,,,,

The distinction between leukemia and lymphoma based on the presence of bone marrow involvement at diagnosis is not prognostically useful in this group of patients. The blast cells of group II patients could not be morphologically distinguished from those of the group III patients. The 53 groups III patients had SIG, sE, and complement negative blast cells and could be further subdivided on the basis of while blood cell count. The nine group IIIA patients (greater than 100.0 X 10(9)/liter) had in general short survival, while most of the 44 group IIIB patients (less than than 100.0 X 10(9)/liter) have remained in complete remission. Positive surface markers, mass lesions, male sex, and age of diagnosis less than 2 years of greater than or equal to 10 years appear to be interrelated factors indicating poor prognosis. Elevated while blood cell count is a prognostic indicator independent of surface marker analysis or presence of mass lesions.",['10.1002/ajh.2830010406 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Ratios of observed: expected numbers of cancer deaths were lower for children with abnormal X-rays than for other X-rayed children, and lower for recent than remote exposures. The first of these differences was probably due to several antenatal conditions having positive associations with obstetric radiography and several causes of early (noncancer) deaths; the second one was probably due to a progressive lowering of film doses between 1940 and the present time.

However, there was a progressive increase in activity with the addition of each alpha-glutamyl residue, the Nepsilon-(penta-alpha-glutamyl)lysine being 88% as active as tetrahydrofolate. Nalpha-Tetrahydropteroyl-Nepsilon-(di-alpha-lysyl)lysine was the most active thymidylate synthetase substrate of the polylysine derivatives, being 67% as active as tetrahydrofolate. Addition or deletion of lysyl residues resulted in diminished activity. It is noteworthy that substrate activity is retained in spite of the positively charged poly(amino acid) side chain. None of the enzymatically prepared tetrahydrohomopteroyl derivatives tested was as active as Nalpha-tetrahydrohomopteroyl glutamate (tetrahydrohomofolate) as an inhibitor of E. coli thymidylate synthetase.",['10.1021/jm00233a008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

In animal experiments the most effective method of influencing the progress of leukemia after the implantation of living malignant cells has been a combination of nonspecific stimulation of the reticuloendothelial system, with agents such as BCG or Corynebacterium parvum, either with chemotherapy or with specific immunization with irradiated leukemic cells. However, such treatment is only effective if the number of living malignant cells is small as it takes a powerful immune response to overcome even a small number of malignant cells. It is for these reasons that most of the studies in man have been on patients with acute leukemia in remission. Mathe, in 1969, produced evidence that BCG and irradiated allogenic leukemia cells could lengthen the duration of remission in ALL in children. However, later results of intensive combination chemotherapy, together with prophylactic treatment of the central nervous system by Pinkel and his colleagues, were so encouraging that immunotherapy is not felt to be needed and therefore is not being extensively used in this form of leukemia at the moment. The situation in AML, particularly in adults, is completely different. The maintenance of remission with chemotherapy in this type of leukemia is difficult and relapses occur quite rapidly. Various centers have now shown that both remission lengths and overall survival are significantly prolonged by using BCG with or without irradiated allogenic leukemia cells.",,,,,,,,,,

In the light of predominantly CSF analyses in the field of pediatric oncology the above mentioned findings are clearly illustrated (ALL, AML, reticulum cell sarcomatosis, Ewing sarcoma, leptomeninx sarcoma, retinoblastoma, Letterer-Siwe's disease, familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, plexus papilloma). Malignancies are clearly distinguishable from benign conditions (toxic glial reactions, virus meningitides, CNS hemorrhages etc.). The higher cellular yield permits very early diagnosis of meningeal leukemia. This qualitative improvement of cytological diagnostic methods may considerably influence the choice of therapeutic procedures in the treatment of malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,

In mice, BCG is capable of increasing lymphocyte-mediated immunity to allogenic leukemia cells and of creating ""pseudoimmune"" cytotoxic lymphocytes when administered alone. Lymphocyte-activating factor (LAF) produced by macrophages, a T-lymphocyte mitogenic substance, is increased significantly by the administration of BCG and may play a role in the evocation of cytotoxic cells. BCG acts as a mitogen for splenic and thymic cells ""in vitro"". Macrophages were important regulators in the response, since a critical concentration (at least 0.25 % to 0.5 %) were required for T-cell stimulation and a high concentration (approximately 5 to 10 %) inhibited splenic lymphocytes. LAF was increased 20-fold above baseline ""in vitro"" by BCG. Methanol extraction residue (MER) stimulated thymic and splenic cells as well as did whole BCG. A delipidated cell fraction (DMC) stimulated only splenic non-T lymphocytes. BCG has antagonized several sorts of immunosuppression and may be useful clinically in this regard. There is also the possibility of antagonizing the myelosuppressive toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents through the stimulation of the macrophage-made granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Finally, if BCG can induce cytotoxic lymphocytes (or macrophages) in vitro, it may be possible to use these in clinical adoptive immunotherapy. BCG is a useful prototype of an immunological adjuvant with antitumor activity. Elucidation of its actions on lymphoid cells and its effects in therapeutic situations can serve as a model for future investigations with other substances with similar potential.",,,,,,,,,,

Purification of the human blood lymphocytes is obtained through nylon columns and measurement of transformation and proliferation by means of 3 H thymidine incorporation. Normal lymphocyte stimulation can be obtained within a range of concentrations of stimulants can be obtained within a range of concentrations of stimulants and the curves with PHA or lectin from Pisum show a peak of blastogenic activity. The activity of lectin from Pisum sativum was studied in this way on blood cultures of 8 chronic lymphocytic leukaemias and 5 immunodeficient patients. It appeared that lectin from Pisum and PHA have the same activity. The response of human peripheral lymphocytes to various mitogenic agents in vitro does not point out the proliferative abnormal cell and may not be used to detect different populations of human lymphocytes.,,,,,,,,,,

They are, on the contrary, frequently useful in poorly differenciated myeloblastic or monoblastic leukemia. But, they cannot help to solve every problem in cytological diagnosis: there are still 10% of undifferenciated acute leukemia, the lymphoblastic acute leukemia are not clearly defined and 4% of cases of acute leukemia have atypical characters leading to difficulties in cytological classification.

The antibody deficiency syndrome in these patients might well reflect a maturation defect of the leukemic B-lymphocytes. In patients with Hodgkin's disease the relative number of B- and T-lymphocytes in the blood was not markedly altered in comparison to normal controls. An increased proliferation primarily of T-lymphocytes however, might suggest their accelerated turnover as an indication of the host response. In most patients with ""Non-Hodgkin"" lymphomas high numbers of B-lymphocytes were found in affected lymph nodes, and these appear occasionally in the peripheral blood. Differences in immunopathological manifestations of the various subgroups of the ""Non-Hodgkin"" lymphomas are emphasized and the rare occurrence of lymphomas of T-lymphocytes (mainly observed in lymphoblastic lymphomas and in Sezary syndrome) is discussed.

A low proportion of cells from rosettes with sheep erythrocytes, the frequency of which is considerably increased after neuraminidase treatment. Unlike B lines but like T lines, K562 cells are lysed rapidly by C'/Fc receptor-positive human blood leukocytes and do not stimulate MLC reactions. On the other hand, K562 lacks T antigen, high radiosensitivity and sensitivity to growth inhibition by thymidine. The cells do not contain N-APase, an enzyme found in all lines derived from lymphoid cells and in lymphoproliferative diseases. By scanning electron microscopy, K562 cells were seen to be rounded and relatively smooth, with small numbers of short microvilli resembling undifferentiated leukemic cells. A few cells had narrow ridge-like profiles and small ruffles similar to granulocytic leukemic cells. K562 is strongly positive for immunoglobuln Fc receptors and pinocytosis, but does not phagocytose or mediate antibody-dependent phagocytosis or cytolysis. Among histochemical stains, K562 is positive for esterase, lipid, and acid phosphatase. There seems to be no doubt that K562 is not a B cell line. While it has some T cell properties, these are not exclusive. Some of its characteristics indicate that it is probably not lymphoid. Due to its low level of differentiation, its nature cannot be stated with certainty.

Morphologically eight cases were lymphoid and the remainder myeloid in appearance. All cases were negative with surface markers for thymocytes and T and B lymphocytes. Five of the lymphoid cases reacted with an antiserum specific for acute lymphoid leukaemia )ALL) of non-T non-B type and were also weakly reactive with a lymphocyte reactive antiserum. A sixth patient, whose blast cells were anti-ALL negative (ALL-) at presentation, subsequently developed central nervous system leukaemia with anti-ALL positive (ALL+) blast cells in the CSF. In all cases the leukaemic blast cells showed greatly diminished expression of cholera toxin receptors when compared to granulocytic cells from the chronic phase of CML. This parallels weak or negligible expression of the cholera toxin receptor in ALL and AML. These results suggest that the blastic phase of CML may involve different cellular derivatives of a pluripotential stem cell in which the primary malignant/genetic changes reside. The blast crisis of CML can therefore be heterogeneous with respect to cellular expression and in a significant proportion of patients involves a cell which is by membrane markers and morphological criteria indistinguishable from that seen in the common form of ALL. In these cases the Philadelphia chromosome may be the only distinguishing cellular characteristic.",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1976.tb00189.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Both pre- and postpuberal orchidectomy caused relative hypertrophy of the thymus. There was also an increase in size of peripheral lymph nodes to reach a sustained maximum (6 weeks). Sychronous thymectomy and orchidectomy prevented the lymph node enlargement that follows orchidectomy alone. Enlargement of the thymus was due to increased numbers of thymocytes, and it could be abrogated by administration of androgens. Orchidectomy was associated with an acceleration of rejection of skin allografts which was prevented by androgen administration and abrogated by antilymphocyte serum. The reactivity of orchidectomized mice to sheep red blood cells and the early response to oxazolone, which is limited by thymus-processed cells, was increased, whereas production of antibodies to oxazolone, skin allografts, and pneumococcal polysaccharide was unchanged. It is suggested that orchidectomy increases cell-mediated immune responses but has no direct effect upon responses that are mainly dependent on B cells. Orchidectomy prolongs the interval between the subcutaneous injection of methylcholanthrene and the appearance of subcutaneous sarcomas. In tumour transplantation experiments orchidectomy casued protection against the Meth A tumour grown in ascitic or subcutaneous form. This protection was counteracted by antilymphocyte serum and partially countered by adult thymectomy combined with orchidectomy. In contrast, the appearance in AKR mice of spontaneous leukaemia, a tumour known to be thymus dependent, was increased after orchidectomy. The results of experiments with hypopituitary mice suggested that the effects of orchidectomy on immune response result from androgen withdrawal rather than interference with the hormonal milieu.",,PMC2491857,,,,,,,,

For this reason these disorders are grouped together as ""cutaneous T cell lymphomas"". These neoplastic T-cells have a characteristic tissue distribution (preferentially infiltrating the skin and sparing the bone marrow). The abnormal T-cells of the leukemic phase of these disorders produce large amounts of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which may adversely affect macrophage mobilization, and also stimulate differentiation of B-cells into plasma cells. The antigenic properties, the usual slow rate of replication, and the circulatory route of these cells may be exploitable in the development of more specific therapeutic approaches to the management of affected patients. Although these T-cells have an affinity for the skin, the role of this organ in the proliferation and differentiation of these cells is as yet not established. Localization of the primary site(s) of proliferation awaits completion of in vivo kinetic studies. The neoplastic T-cells from such patients provide important cellular reagents for the study of diverse aspects of lymphocyte biology. They have already been used to investigate mechanisms of lymphocyte triggering, isolate histocompatibility antigens, and characterize anti-T-cell immunoglobulin from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.","['S0022-202X(15)44847-X [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12514718 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

The intensity of these phenomena vary with route and time of administration. In contrast, lentinan and levamisole depress both these macrophage activities. Living BCG, extracts from BCG and from M. smegmatis, and the lipopolysaccharide increase the cytotoxic potential of normal macrophages in vitro, suggesting that these agents may exert a direct action on macrophages.

We observed in vitro that while the B lymphocytes responded normally to mitogen, an intrinsic hyporeactivity to mitogens characterizes the T lymphocytes. Moreover, AKR mice exhibited a reduced in vivo response to both thymus dependent and independent antigens.",['10.1038/bjc.1975.231 [doi]'],PMC2024751,,,,,,,,

The results obtained indicate that the incubation of TL+ cells in relatively high concentrations of anti-TL antisera results in a detectable, but not major, loss in the quantity of antigen detected in the plasma membranes. This decrease is not inhibited by azide. Although the antigen loss seems to coincide with the appearance of patching of membrane TL antigens on leukemia cells observed in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, this is not the case when thymocytes are used as targets. Fab fragments prepared from anti-TL antibodies can also induce a quantitative decrease in antigen expression. The major mechanism involved in membrane antigen loss seems to be endocytosis, although some shedding may also occur. Resistance to immune cytolysis (antigenic modulation) occurs during incubation in anti-TL antibodies before either endocytosis or antigen redistribution has progressed enough to be directly responsible. Since antigenic modulation does not represent a depletion in TL antigens being expressed on the cell surfaces, another mechanism must account for the failure of guinea pig complement to achieve cell lysis.",,,,,,,,,,

The nitrosoureas are among the most active, if not the most active, anticancer drugs both quantitatively (log kill of sensitive tumor cells in vivo) and qualitatively (spectrum of mouse, rat, and hamster tumors responding to treatment). Therapeutic anticancer activity of the nitrosoureas has been consistently observed with oral as well as parenteral administration. The nitrosoureas are clearly the most active group of anticancer drugs observed against experimental meningeal leukemias and intracerebrally implanted transplantable primary tumors of central nervous system origin (eg, gliomas, ependymoblastomas, and astrocytomas in mice and hamsters). The nitrosoureas have been observed to be less than additive in lethal toxicity for vital normal cells in the mouse in combination with representatives of the other major classes of anticancer agents, eg, purine antagonists, pyrimidine antagonists, inhibitors of DNA polymerase(s) or ribonucleotide reductase(s), mitotic inhibitors, drugs that bind to or intercalate with DNA, and other alkylating agents. Therapeutic synergism against one or more transplantable or spontaneous tumors of mice, rats, or hamsters with one of several nitrosoureas in two-drug combinations with representatives of most of the major classes of anticancer agents listed above has been reported. With a number of advanced-stages mouse tumors, generally considered to be refractory to treatment with most anticancer agents, long-term cures have been obtained with combination-drug or combined-modality (surgery plus chemotherapy) treatment. The demonstrated lack of cross-resistance of several leukemias and solid tumors of mice selected for resistance to BCNU, meCCNU, or other alkylating agents suggests that the widely held opinion that all alkylating agents are very similar in biologic mechanism of action, and therefore resistance to one alkylating agent probably predicts cross-resistance to all alkylating agents, may no longer be tenable. If not, then alkylating-agent drug combinations, either used alone or combined with other treatment modalities (eg, surgery) which have been reported to result in therapeutic improvement in a number of experimental murine tumor systems, may be indicated for serious consideration as surgical adjuvant chemotherapy by surgeons or as primary therapy by medical oncologists.",,,,,,,,,,

Increased viscosity of circulating whole blood plus the microembolic action of individual sickled erythrocytes contribute to vasoocclusion. Decreased oxygenation and increased acidosis develop and lead to further sickling -- and further vaso-occlusion. The cycle of erythrostasis that characterizes sickling throughout the body is also applicable to the retina. The transparent media of the eye permit direct visualization of vaso-occlusions which occur preferentially in and about the macula and in the far periphery of the retina. Many of the occlusive episodes are transient. There dynamic events are simultaneously occurring elsewhere in the body but can only be visualized in the eye. The net effect in the retina is a remodeling of its vasculature, as some vessels close and others reopen. After the onset of arteriolar closure in the retina, affected blood vessels embark on a spontaneous, naturally evolving course of events leading to arteriolarvenular anastomoses, neovascular proliferations, vitreous hemorrhages, and retinal detachment. The advanced stages of proliferative sickle retinopathy are most commonly observed in SC disease and in Sthal, possibly because these two forms of sickling have significantly higher than normal whole blood viscosity. Retinal vaso-occlusions can also lead to blow-out hemorrhages which may evolve into salmon patches, iridescent spots, schisis cavities, and black sunbursts. In some respects sickle retinopathy is unique, but many of its manifestations are similar to those of retinopathies found in diabetes mellitus, AC hemoglobinopathy, Takayasu pulseless disease, sarcoidosis, chronic myelogenous leukemia, branch retinal vein occlusion, retrolental fibroplasia, and Eales disease.",,,,,,,,,,

The associations were: mercaptopurine-methotrexate, mercaptopurine-cytosine arabinoside and methotrexate-cyclophosphamide. Between cycles, ""reinductions"" with prednisolone and vincristine of two weeks duration were given. 3. ""Prophylactic"" treatment of CNS leukemia was administered according to two modalities: a) In group named C-1, 32 patients received one dose of i.t. methotrexate at the end of the induction treatment and every three months. b) The other 29 patients (C-2 group) were treated by cranial irradiation (2400 r.) and five doses of i.t. methotrexate, after the induction of remission (C.R.). RESULTS: 57 out of 61 patients (93%) attained C.R. Twelve months after induction of C.R., in C-1 group, one patient died by infectious disease and eight relapsed. Twenty (68%) remained in C.R. The number of CNS relapses in this period was six (20%). In C-2 group, from 21 evaluable cases, 18 children (85%) were in C.R. at the end of first year and relapses in CNS were only two (9%).

The induction phase of chemotherapy should include the use of at least prednisone and vincristine. This combination should result in a hematologic remission in about 90 per cent of the patients. The efficacy of the addition of either L-asparaginase or daunomycin, the consolidation phase or the periodic readministration of induction drugs has not been established. Specific central nervous system treatment, early in the course of therapy, is an integral component of recently reported effective protocols. Several modalities of prophalytic central nervous system therapy have been utilized. These include cranial irradiation plus intrathecal methotrexate, craniospinal irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate alone. An encephalopathy syndrome has been reported as a complication in 10 to 66 per cent of these patients. The most effective form of central nervous system therapy, associated with the least toxicity, has not been established. Maintenance chemotherapy should include a combination of two or more drugs. Complications are numerous, and include hematopoietic depression, immunosuppression, overwhelming infections, and, possibly, the development of secondary primary cancers. In the most successful protocols maintenance chemotherapy has been administered for 3 years. Because of the potential significant toxicity there is a need to define the optimal duration of maintenance therapy. Psychological complications developing in a patient with a disease now considered a potential long term chronic illness, rather than a disease once considered universally fatal, are also discussed. The possibility of an immunologic deficiency allowing for the initial development of acute lymphocytic leukemia and the role of immunotherapy are presented. While the use of intensive combination chemotherapy and specific central nervous system prophylactic therapy have resulted in an improved prognosis in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia, because of a significant incidence of failures, a standardized single form of therapy has not been established.","['S0025-7125(16)31844-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-7125(16)31844-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

The acute lymphocytic leukemias may or may not respond to immunotherapy and further work is needed in this area. No studies of immunotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been done, but this will be an important area for investigation, since there is often profound immunodeficiency in this disease. The malignant lymphomas are another fertile area for this type of research, since they have a high response rate, tumor-associated immunodeficiency, and at least differentiation antigens if not tumor-specific antigens. The scientific basis for the use of immunotherapy in leukemia includes the demonstration of a relationship of rate and duration of remission and survival to immunocompetence, the demonstration of unique tumor-associated antigens on leukemia cells, and the demonstration of immune responses to these antigens which can be boosted by immunization. At the present time, active nonspecific immunotherapy with BCG and MER and active specific immunotherapy have been proved effective in acute myelogenous leukemia. Careful attention should be given to dose, schedule, route, and so forth. Other types of immunotherapy remain to be explored.","['S0025-7125(16)31846-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-7125(16)31846-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

They may vary from 0.5 to 25% or more. When these Ig-positive cells are treated with trypsin and then incubated ""in vitro"" for six hours, many of them are no longer Ig-positive, i.e. they do not synthesize Ig. It might be possible, that the membrane-Ig observed before trypsinization does not represent true Ig-determinants of mature B-cells (antibodies attached to leukaemia-specific determinants?). The extent of these features decrease in remission until their disappearance. Relationship between the cell immunological patterns and the treatment response in ALL could exist. In a group of ALL-patients under the same treatment, that is, vincristine and prednisone, the correlation between the course of the disease after the above-mentioned therapy showed quick and complete remission in patients with low percentage of Ig-positive cells (below 10%) and poor improvement (often without complete remission) in patients with higher percentage of Ig-positive cells. Among the most important B-lymphocyte abnormalities in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are the following: (a) fluorescence intensity may vary not only from patient to patient, but also from cell to cell in the same patient; (b) the Fc-receptor can be lacking; (c) the C3b-receptor is not always present, or it is from 2 to 20-folds less frequent than the C3d-receptor, whereas normal human lymphocytes do not show any outstanding differences between the number of EAC rosette-forming cells either when tested with mouse complement (C3d-receptor) or with human complement C3b-receptor); (d) the traffic capacity of peripheral-blood B-lymphocytes in CLL is quite defective. Results of the observations on lymphocytes in CLL, taken as a whole, suggest that CLL is in general given by the expansion of an abnormal clone of cells of B origin, arrested in their maturative development, non-responsive to the mitogen stimulation, accumulating in the peripheral-blood for a traffic deficiency. On the contrary, the T-cells class is apparently normal, and the T-cell extent in CLL-peripheral blood can be even greater than normal when taken as absolute value.",,,,,,,,,,

The aetiology of these diseases is related at least in some cases to immunodeficiency, immunostimulation, autoimmunity and a dysregulation of the immune system. The majority of lymphomas and leukaemias are monoclonal proliferations of the B-lymphocyte series at different stages of maturation while some are derived from T lymphocytes and others have no recognisable B or T-cell markers. Each of the lymphoid malignancies has a characteristic and unique pattern of immunological deficiency, suggesting a unique aetiology. Hodgkin's disease and histiocytic lymphoma, the acute leukaemias and chronic myelogenous leukaemia have predominantly cell-mediated immune deficiencies, while lymphocytic lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and the plasma cell dyscrasias have predominantly humoral immune deficiencies. There is a relationship between immunocompetence and prognosis and between immunocompetence and extent of disease in the lymphomas and leukaemias. Immunocompetent patients have a better prognosis and more limited disease than immunoincompetent patients. Therapy for these diseases profoundly suppresses host defence mechanisms, particularly those which are cell-mediated. Ability to resist or recover from this immunosuppression is also associated with an improved prognosis. Lymphoma and leukaemia also induce a tumour-specific immune response in the tumour-bearing host and this also correlates with prognosis. These factors form a rational basis for immunotherapy and indeed lymphomas and leukaemias respond to active nonspecific immunotherapy with BCG and active specific immunotherapy with tumor cells resulting in prolongation of remission duration and survival.",,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, it was examined of immunopotentiating ability of Group A streptococcus (Su-strain), which is a active component of OK-432, with respects to reticuloendotherial system and serum complement components. Human fresh serum incubated with the heated streptococcus (HSu-coccus) was analyzed by means of immunoelectrophoresis. Activated component of C3 proactivator was observed in gamma region as immunoprecipitin line developed by rabbit anti human C3 proactivator serum, and conversion of C3 component (beta1C) to beta1A was observed in alpha region by rabbit anti human beta1C/beta1A serum. The activation of serum complement components might be occurred via alternate pathway, because EDTA inhibited the activation but EGTA did not. Meanwhile, the peritoneal exudate cells from mice injected intraperitoneally with HSu-coccus were examined with respects to cell population and their antitumor effect. On the 7th day after injection of HSu-coccus, about 90% of the peritoneal cells was lymphocytes, and 70% of these lymphocytes was susceptible to rabbit anti mouse thymus cell serum or to AKR anti thetaC3H serum. When L1210 leukemia cells preincubated with these peritoneal cells were inoculated intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice, the leukemic cells could not allowed the growth, resulting in prolongation of life-span of the experimental animals. These results suggested that nonspecific effector activity of T-derived lymphocyte induced by HSu-coccus could be one of the factors participating in antitumor activity of OK-432. Additionally, the results obtained with OK-432 were most the same as those with HSu-coccus in these respects. Further, the relation between the stimulation of leucocytes and activation of complement components was discussed.",,,,,,,,,,

Both graft vs. host disease and antithymocyte globulin were implicated since the presence of either factor alone was associated with depressed chemotaxis (31.1+/-4.9% for graft vs. host disease, P is less than 0.01; 17.0+/-7.8% for antithymocyte globulin, P is less than 0.02). When normal neutrophils were incubated with antithymocyte globulin in vitro, their chemotactic response was markedly suppressed in the absence of a cytotoxic effect. Transplant patients with defective chemotaxis experienced significantly more infections than those with normal chemotaxis, and analysis of specific etiologic agents showed that this was predominantly related to bacterial pathogens. Chemotactic inhibitors were detected in the sera of seven patients and elevated IgE levels were found in nine subjects, eight of whom had graft vs. host disease. Generation of chemotactic activity by endotoxin activation of serum was reduced in five patients.

This accelerated leukaemogenesis is not inhibited by syngenic restoration with bone marrow cells (BM). Using the AKR/T1ALD substrain which bears 38 chromosomes with 1 metacentric markers, it has been shown that AKR radio-chimaeras restored by T1ALD BM developed two kinds of L.S. : (i) early (radiation-induced) L.S. originating mainly from host cells surviving irradiation and (ii) late L.S from donor cells. The present experiments were investigate the potential influence of normal allogenic thymic cells, with or without syngeneic B.M., on the incidence, latency and origin of LS appearing in irradiated AKR recipients. Adding C3H allogenic thymic cells to syngenic B.M. increases the percentage of early L.S. whose latencies are unchanged. Besides, when C3H thymic cells are injected to irradiated controls without syngenic B.M. cells, L.S. are seen to occurr significantly earlier than in just the irradiated animals alone. In radio-chimaeras restored by allogenic thymic cells and syngenic B.M., except in one case, all the L.S. were seen to originate from B.M. cells. The interpretation of these results depends on the possible role of allogenic thymic cells on host cells surviving the irradiation, or the exogeneous B.M. In the first case, allogenic thymocytes could induce a graft versus host reaction increasing the post-irradiation depletion of lymphoid system and hastening thymic endoregeneration which is supposed to be the first step towards leukaemogenesis. The second hypothesis, which seems the most likely, would be that C1H thymic cells could selectively act on host cells surviving irradiation and enhance the differentiation of haemopoietic precursors at the expense of the lymphoid cells. Alternatively the thymic cells may co-operate with exogenic B.M., and stimulate their differentiation thus triggering them out of a stage whereby they could become a selective target for the Gross virus.",,,,,,,,,,

Both bone marrow and spleen derived erythroid colonies exhibited a retardation of maturation upon RLV infection of the donor mice; the spleen derived erythroid colonies showed the most severe changes. RLV itself could not mimic this phenomenon; moreover it was shown by immunofluorescence that only low amounts of RLV were present in the spleen colonies.

In addition, the cells were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface markers and ultrastructure of WDLT cells were compared with those of cells obtained from peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Like the CLL populations, most WDLT samples showed a low percentage of unsensitized sheep red blood cell-binding cells and a concomitantly high percentage of IgM EAC-binding cells. Furthermore, a substantial number of WDLT cells in several instances showed a lower binding affinity for IgM EAC than normal lymphocytes, as demonstrated by the poor attachment of the IgM EAC reagent to the WDLT cells in suspension and to frozen tissue sections. Weak IgM EAC binding capacity was demonstrated in the CLL cells as well. WDLT and CLL cells bound the IgG EA complex only when certain sensitive techniques were applied (pelleting). A variable percentage of cells with surface immunoglobulins was found among WDLT and DLL populations. However, accurate counting of surface immunoglobulin-bearing neoplastic cells was very difficult in most cases due to the extremely faint surface fluorescence as compared to normal. SEM did not reveal specific changes in WDLT or CLL cells that would permit their identification as neoplastic lymphocytes. No major differences were found between WDLT and CLL cells and no correlation could be established between SEM appearances and surface markers. As previously observed with other cell populations, the conditions under which the cells were manipulated before fixation (in particular the environmental temperature) seemed to play a major role in the final SEM appearance of both WDLT and CLL cells. The results of our studies indicate that WDLT cells represent a population of B-cells whose surface properties are very similar to those of circulating CLL cells. The poor capacity of WDLT cells and CLL cells to bind IGM EAC or to stain with fluorescein-conjugated antihuman immunoglobulin suggests low density or poor affinity of the surface receptors. In this regard, these neoplastic cells are different from those of follicular lymphomas, also of B-cell origin.",,,,,,,,,,

We are also assessing in animal models the potential value of thymsin in the treatment of specific autoimmune diseases. This information may yield new insights for the management of autoimmune type disorders such as SLE. Results from clinical trials to date suggest that thymosin will have a role in boosting the immune responses of patients with specific thymic malfunctions and may indeed exert an influence via the production of suppressor or regulator T-cells.,['10.1007/978-1-4613-4355-4_34 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

In man the situation is not yet clear but there are indications that a similar situation may apply in many human malignancies. These findings have led to a resurgence in interest in the role of immunotherapy in the treatment of malignant disease, but as yet there is no clear evidence from properly controlled clinical trials that immunotherapy is the treatment of choice for any tumour. At present clinical immunotherapy constitutes a field for careful investigation but it cannot be considered a proven modality of treatment. At present its use must be confined to controlled studies in which benefit or possible harm can be determined. When giving immunotherapy it is necessary to monitor carefully the specific immune reaction of the host against the tumour. Further progress in immunotherapy requires a better understanding of why tumour cells succeed in vivo to escape destruction by the immune responses of the host. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge concerning the nature of TSTAs, the effect of the immune response to TSTAs on metastatic spread and the mechanisms of escape with special reference to the role which circulating soluble TSTA plays in 'neutralizing' the action of cytotoxic cells and antibodies. It is stressed that there is no support for the hypothesis of a 'blocking antibody'. Finally the different types of immunotherapy which have been developed in animal systems are described and possible clinical applications are discussed.",['10.1007/BF02910012 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Oral pyrimethamine and CCNU were used for their potential activity as prophylactics against meningeal leukemia.

Six patients (35%) developed meningeal leukemia while on initial induction or maintenance therapy, 5 within 6 months of diagnosis.

Replication of TC and AP M-MuLV in spleen cells was determined by an infectious center (IC) assay at 1 and 2 weeks after the infection. Immune responsiveness of spleen cells was evaluated in challenge with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and subsequent enumeration of antibody plaque-forming cells (PFC). TC M-MuLV replicated faster in the spleen than did AP M-MuLV and reached about 10- to 100-fold higher titers. However, the response of anti-SRBC PFC, suppressed to the same degree in the spleens of mice infected with TC or AP virus, was from 10 to 50% of the control response.

Analyses of some data on exposure to radiation from internal deposits of radioactive material suggest that the dose-response curve at low and intermediate ranges in concave up, implying a smaller effect per unit exposure at very low doses than at intermediate ranges. Data on exposure to the very high but anatomically limited doses of radiation used in cancer therapy give conflicting results, suggesting in one report a continuation of the linear relation into the high-dose range. Other reports suggest a lesser effect per unit dose at high doses than at intermediate doses. Extensive laboratory studies of exposure of experimental animals indicate that over broad dose ranges, exceptions to simple linear relations are the rule, and that factors of dose rate and fractionation also affect the dose-response relation.",['10.1002/1097-0142(197602)37:2+<1102::aid-cncr2820370819>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The results of these studies, taken together with a meticulous morphologic examination on Giemsa smears allow a more subtle classification on these neoplasias. Among the most interesting points, one can list: a) The description of macroglobulinemic proplasmocytic leukaemia; b) The observation that all the prognostic parameters in the four types of common acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) (prolymphocytic, microlymphocytic, macrolymphocytic, prolymphoblastic) such as age, tumour mass (or leucocytosis are related to the cytological type); T marker may be found in all these types, except for the prolymphoblastic one; c) T or B immunoblastic acute lymphoid leukaemias have been described as a fifth type of ALL; d) The lymphosarcomas which can be histologically nodular (composed of B cells) or diffuse (composed of cells presenting B, T or no markers) can be cytologically prolymphocytic or lymphoblastic (or lymphoblastoid) if they are nodular, prolymphocytic, lymphoblastic, or immunoblastic if they are diffuse; true (African) Burkitt's lymphosarcomas (BLS) must be distinguished from all the pseudo (non-African) Burkitt's lymphosarcomas which have been described elsewhere and which are either immunoblastic or lymphoblastic (oid) lymphosarcomas with a few macrophages; e) The diagnosis of reticulosarcoma which was in the past abusively carried out (because of confusion with immunoblastic lymphosarcoma) is based on the presence of many reticluins fibers at histological examination and on the cytological aspect of the cells on smears (the distinction of those cells with immunoblasts is easy).",,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis of well-differentiated lymphosarcoma or leukemia cutis is more tenuous, since mature lymphocytic infiltrates were encountered in patients with or without evidence of extracutaneous lymphoma. These are designated ""unclassified"" lymphocytic infiltrates of skin, requiring careful clinical exclusion of these types of malignant lymphoma. Other purported histopathologic discriminants of malignant lymphoma and pseudolymphoma, the latter term utilized to designate banal disorders characterized by a polymorphous infiltrate with or without atypical reticulum cells, are of little value for their distinction.

However, a list of those factors believed to have importance in leukemogenesis in this disease includes: maleness, ethnic origin, the presence of myeloid metaplasia and/or early WBC precursors in the peripheral blood at the time of presentation, the influence of prolonged survival, and a possible dose-response relationship with 32P treatment. Many of the features of PV suggest that it is a malignant disease per se, with other factors (such as clones of cells, or altered host response) combining to increase the leukemogenic potential of the agents used to control the disease. It does appear that the incidence of AL in PV treated with 32P and/or x-ray is many times higher than that for PV treated with phlebotomy alone. However, overall survival for 32P-treated patients appears to be longer than that for phlebotomy treatment. Further, for both 32P and phlebotomy treatments, patients with AL do not die an an earlier age than do patients not developing this complication. Since the transformation of PV into AL has been described in more than 20 patients treated with phlebotomy alone, and in more than 30 patients treated with chemotherapy and phlebotomy, the question concerning the occurrence of AL in PV no longer appears to revolve around whether this is a function of the leukemogenicity of 32P or the effect of prolongation of survival. The occurrence of AL in multiple myeloma, lymphomas, other malignancies, and in nonmalignant diseases following treatment with myelosuppressive agents, forces one to consider the leukemogenic potential of any agent capable of suppressing the panmyelopathy of this disease, as well as the inherent tendency to AL of the ""untreated"" disease. Hopefully, the next decade will give us a more complete understanding of the complex interrelationships between PV, its treatment, and AL.",['0037-1963(76)90034-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,

It is a potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis in many organisms from viruses to man and in cell culture systems. To a lesser degree it can also inhibit RNA and protein synthesis. It is anti-mitotic and cytotoxic depending on the concentration used, the duration of exposure, and the sensitivity of the organism. In most cells HU is active mainly in the S-phase of the cycle and because of the easy reversibility of its action it has been used as a synchronising agent in cell cultures with some success. There is conflicting evidence about the ability of HU to act as an inhibitor of the natural DNA repair mechanisms in cells exposed to radiation or alkylating agents. HU has, however, been shown to induce chromosome damage in a number of organisms including man. It is clearly teratogenic in mammals and can cross the placental barrier at least in rats and the golden hamster, but it is believed to have only a limited mutagenic activity. Studies involving a direct comparison of the action of HU with other compounds suggest that the = C--NHOH moiety is responsible for its biological activity.","['0165-1110(75)90002-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1110(75)90002-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately this branch of science does not receive the attention it deserves. The following three problems have to be solved by the veterinary genetics: (1) the investigation of the relationship between the heredity and the pathology of animals; the examination of the mechanism of pathology at the molecular and organism genetic levels; (2) the elaboration of the methods of genetic diagnostics; (3) the search for scientifically-substantiated directions in breeding of animal breeds highly resistant to diseases. The main attention will be paid to the investigation of the mechanisms ensuring the natural resistance of animals to certain definite diseases. The establishment and development of veterinary genetics will exert a favourable influence on the progress of biological sciences. Its data will be indispensable both for the theory and the practice of agriculture.,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, lymphocytes from six melanoma patients were tested in CMC and ADCC assays against autologous tumour cells. The following results were obtained. (1) A large number of healthy controls possessed lymphocytes which readily lysed M1 target cells in CMC and MC assays. (2) CMC activity of lymphocytes from melanoma patients was generally lower than that of control lymphocytes and decreased further with progression of the disease. (3) CLL lymphocytes were virtually non-toxic for M1 cells, even at high aggressor:target cell ratios. (4) ADCC assays with a heterologous rabbit-anti-M1 serum showed generally higher isotope release than CMC assays; this was particularly pronounced in the melanoma group and in the group of patients with other tumours. (5) No tumour-specific blocking factor could be detected in melanoma sera, as judged by the capacity of the sera to block CMC activity. (6) No obvious correlation was found between the results obtained in short-term CMC and long-term MC assays. (7) T lymphocytes, as determined by E-rosette formation, were significantly diminished in melanoma patients.

However circannual, as well as infrannual rhythms, should not be dismissed as they are consequences of biometeorological factors the actions of which at least for temperature on toxic reactions are admitted.

A second sample of 46 current patients with untreated ALL was examined both for the presence of surface markers for T- and B-cells and for cell size. Bone marrow blasts from 10 of these 46 children formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (E)-- a T-cell marker.

SFFV persistence was initially observed using an in vivo rescue technique in which SFFV could be directly rescued to form splenic foci of malignant erythropoiesis in mice. At approximately 30 d after virus inoculation however, SFFV could not be rescued after inoculation of LLV-F indicating that persistently infected (i.e., SFFV+) mice were either immume to exogenous helper virus or able to express SFFV-associated defective-interfering (DI) function(s). Persistent infection by SFFV was further documented using an in vitro rescue technique and ultimately resulted in the induction by SFFV of erythroleukemia in the absence of polycythemia or overt virus production. However, SFFV rescued by LLV-F from persistently infected normal and transformed hemopoietic cells was able to induce polycythemia in adult mice suggesting that this is a helper controlled property of the Friend virus complex. Transplantable SFFV-induced erythroleukemic cells could be retrieved from persistently infected yet histologically normal mice. The duration of SFFV persistence in normal spleen tissue suggests that the SFFV provirus resides in either a long-lived or pluripotent hemopoietic cell. Further, certain changes occurred, presumably in the membranes of persistently infected cells, which preceded the overt development of Friend leukemia and facilitated the definition of an SFFV preleukemic phase. Cell surface alterations were revealed using cell transfer techniques. Hemopoietic cells harboring a rescuable SFFV failed to proliferate when inoculated into lethally irradiated, syngeneic adult mice. In contrast, the transformed progeny of preleukemic cell populations and spleen cells transformed by FV complex (i.e., cells replicating both SFFV and LLV-F) were not rejected. This result suggests that histologically normal SFFV+ preleukemic cells express an antigen recognition site which is not present on overtly transformed cells and which may be a pertinent surveillance target for host anti-leukemogenic reactions.",['10.1084/jem.149.2.340 [doi]'],PMC2184806,,,,,,,,

The concentration of drug and duration of exposure were factors critical to the subsequent development of in vitro cytotoxicity. The in vitro dosage which effected 50% leukemic cell death in L1210 cells correlated with reported in vivo drug levels. Other tumor models and human neoplastic cells were studied at this dosage level. A good correlation was noted in these studies between the in vivo responsiveness and the in vitro chemotherapy results in both animals and humans. It was suggested by these results that it may be possible to predict cancericidal drug activity for individual neoplasms by assaying the tumor cells in vitro for drug sensitivity.,,,,,,,,,,

In the past, the estimates of hazards in this range have been obtained by linear extrapolation from data on persons who were exposed to much higher dosages, generally in the centirad range used in radiotherapy of non-malignant disease. This article presents the first dosage response curve for the one rad range ever to be developed directly from data on men exposed to ordinary diagnostic radiation. The findings are based on approximately 220 men with non-lymphatic leukemia and more than 270 random-sample controls from the Tri-State Survey. The new findings suggest that the estimates previously obtained by extrapolation from high dosage levels to low dose levels underestimate the actual hazards by an order of magnitude. The new dosage response curves indicate that linear extrapolation fails because it disregards the subgroups in the general population that are particularly vulnerable to x-ray. There are immediate implications concerning the use of medical x-rays in screening or for routine purposes. The past risk-benefit calculations are based on extrapolative estimates and require drastic revision.

In 24 cases (12%) the bone biopsy was the only diagnostic procedure; these comprised partly dry aspirations and partly bone marrow smears in which the specific lesion was not represented. Bone marrow aspiration proved superior in 24 cases (12%) in view of the better detection of small and discrete malignant infiltrates and more detailed analysis of blasts and cytological changes in cell maturation.

We recently purified the novel glycoprotein EDC1 (mol wt 27,000) from the urine of patients with several types of cancer and found it to be a fragment of plasma inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (IATI) (mol wt 170,000). Both EDC1 and IATI are antiproteolytic. By radial immunodiffusion and radioimmunoassay of the 41 recognized plasma proteins and of EDC1, we have now analyzed the composition of urine protein in: (i) five nephrotics (""glomerular proteinuria""), (ii) four patients with cystinosis and four with hereditary renal tubular acidosis (""tubular proteinuria""), and (iii) 26 proteinuria (200-800 mg/day) patients with the six types of disseminated cancer listed above. In (i), (ii) and (iii) the 41 plasma proteins accounted for 100%, greater than 95%, and 33-60% of the urine protein, respectively, while EDC1 accounted for less than 1%, less than 1%, and 40-63% respectively. In normals, (i), (ii) and (iii), plasma EDC1 averaged less than 1, less than 1, less than 1 and 65 micrograms/ml respectively. Renal clearance of EDC1 in (iii) averaged 3% of creatinine clearance. In three cancer patients with EDC1-proteinuria, postmortem renal histology was normal. CONCLUSION: most types of cancer cell interact with plasma IATI to generate plasma EDC1 which is rapidly filtered by the glomeruli, with a resultant ""overflow"" or ""prerenal"" proteinuria which is unique to disseminated neoplastic disease.",,,,,,,,,,

This statistical method clearly defined three principal clinical features recognized at the time of diagnosis: lymph node proliferation, lymphoid infiltration and cytopenia. Cytopenia was clearly subdivided into peripheral and central types. Each of these clinical features were derived from clinical and laboratory observations which agreed with each other. Simple examination permitted an evaluation of these three syndromes. They seemed to be independent of each other except for a relationship between central cytopenia and lymphoid infiltration. Thus clinical staging at the moment of diagnosis must record three scales of severity corresponding to the three independant clinical features. Prognosis was essentially related to cytopenia, whatever the mechanism. In a further analysis of the subsequent progress of the disease, a ""common path"" for patients was found terminating in a region of the graph where marked splenomegaly and cytopenia were plotted. We conclude that it is necessary to consider the three clinical features independently in a clinical staging. This study emphasizes the poor prognosis of cytopenia and splenomegaly and indicates that follow up and treatment should take this feature into account.",,,,,,,,,,

The cell surface properties of the drug resistant and sensitive tumour cells are different. We found the resistant L1210 cells to be less agglutinable than the sensitive line. Pretreatment with Colchicin and Vincristin significantly reduced the agglutinability of sensitive L1210 cells. The sensitive L1210 cells are able to incorporate 3H Colchicine and 14C Vincristine more readily than the resistant L1210 cells.

It was confirmed by the presence of numerous granulations by electron microscopy and by that of a chloracetate esterase activity detected using Leder's protocol (9) on sections of material mounted in paraffin wax after formol fixation. Four marrow biopsies form different sites were normal. The course was fatal in six months, despite multiple chemotherapy, with massive invasion of the thorax by the tumor without the presence of myeloblasts in the circulating blood. The autopsy confirmed the preponderance of thoracic involvement (greenish in colour) and the presence of diffuse marrow myeloblastosis.

The therapy consists of high potassium, low sodium diet, with no fats or oils, and minimal animal proteins. Juices of raw fruits and vegetables and of raw liver provide active oxidizing enzymes which facilitate rehabilitation of the liver. Iodine and niacin supplementation is used. Caffeine enemas cause dilation of bile ducts, which facilitates excretion of toxic cancer breakdown products by the liver and dialysis of toxic products from blood across the colonic wall.

Based upon the results of 125I-lactoperoxidase labeling and antibody absorption procedures, and corrected for size differences between the two cell types, the quantity of TL antigens expressed by RADA-1 cells, a radiation-induced murine leukemia cell line of strain A/J mice, is approximately 5.0 times greater than that of somatic hybrids of RADA-1 and LM(TK)- cells. LM(TK)- cells are a thymidine kinase-deficient TL(-) mouse fibroblast cell line. The quantity of TL antigens expressed is related only in part to their susceptibility to lysis by TL antibodies and guinea pig complement (GPC). RADA-1 cells resist lysis. The quantity of TL antigens expressed by RADA-1 cells is analogous to that formed by nonneoplastic thymocytes obtained from F1 hybrids of two strains of TL(+) and TL(-) mice; cells from both strains are sensitive to TL antiserum and GPC. ASL-1 cells, a spontaneously occurring leukemia cell line of A/J mice, express TL antigens in significantly higher quantities than any of the cell types examined. Exposed to TL antisera, the quantity of TL antigens of ASL-1 cells, but not that of hybrid cells, gradually diminishes. ASL-1 cells convert over a 6-h period of exposure to antibody and guinea pig complement (GPC) resistance; hybrid cells remain sensitive. However, ASL-1 cells converted to TL antibody and GPC resistance continue for a time to express TL antigens in quantities similar to that of sensitive F1 thymocytes and resistant RADA-1 cells. RADA-1 X LM(TK)- hybrid cells, which are sensitive to TL antibodies and GPC, express the lowest quantities of TL antigens of any of the cell types examined. It is likely that differences in the quantities of TL antigens expressed by different cell lines reflect genetic mechanisms controlling TL antigen expression. The failure of TL antisera to affect the quantities of TL antigens expressed by hybrid cells is taken as an indication that genetic controls governing antigen expression may be distinguished from those involved in regulating responsiveness to specific antiserum.",['10.1002/jss.400090407 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem cell compartments of recipient mice were destroyed by Myleran treatment or gamma-ray irradiation. A single injection of Myleran reduced the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (CFU) and the erythropoietin responsive cells (ERC) in polycythemic mice to around 1% of that of controls. Repeated injections of erythropoietin (EPO) restored the erythropoietic precursor cell (ERC) population. Pretreatment of polycythemic hosts with Myleran totally suppressed the tumor colony forming ability of grafted Friend virus-infected spleen cells, whereas it had no effect on tumor colonies produced by inoculation of true tumoral Friend cells. After EPO injections in such Myleran-treated recipients, with a consequent appreciable ERC repopulation, splenic colonies again occurred. Similar results were obtained in hosts whose ERC populations were damaged by irradiation. These data strongly suggest that splenic colonies result from the proliferation of the host cells transformed by virus released by Friend virus-infected cells and not from the proliferation of donor tumor cells.",,,,,,,,,,

The patient was hospitalized in May 1977 with fever and severe asthenia. The laboratory results indicated a probable diagnosis of acute non-differentiated leukaemia of stem cells. In spite of treatment, the anaemia grew worse, the leukocytosis accompanied by blast cells became more pronounced, a massive thrombopenia occurred and the patient died in irreversible shock. Cytogenetic examination done on a medullar culture revealed the presence in all the cells of a chromosome No. 5 with the long arms deleted : 46,XY,5q--. This rare medullar anomaly was reported for the first time in 1974-1975 by the Louvain school (Van den Berghe, Sokal, et al.) in a group of refractory anaemias.

Thus, the decrease in the amount of 5-methylcytosine in lymphocyte DNA is due to a decrease in DNA methylation.

Changes in the pattern of DNA-methylase activities as well as the decrease and distortions in the character of DNA methylation may underlie the disturbances in the regulation of transcription of genome and cause the transformation of cells under conditions of lympholeucosis.",,,,,,,,,,

Infusions of Ara-C 7--10 mg/kg were given for 9 or 12 hours, depending on changes in the mitotic index. The group of responders (M1 or M2 marrows) could be predicted by the initial blast count in the marrow and the change in the mitotic index 18 hours after the Ara-C pulse. There were 9 (39%) complete and partial remissions. Six patients remained in remission more than 200 days. Since the changes in the mitotic indices induced by Ara-C were indistinguishable from those of another more successful trial, we infer that factors other than modulation of the cell cycle are critical to the success of this mode of therapy.",['10.1002/ajh.2830050203 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The study includes 32 patients with abnormal sideroblasts; 14 had mainly ringed sideroblasts while 18 had mainly the intermediate or ferritin type. Basic erythrokinetic data (59Fe erythrocyte incorporation and erythroblast labelling indices) were similar in the two groups. The colony forming capacity (CFUc) was abnormal in 2 of 5 patients with ringed sideroblasts compared to 12 of 13 in the intermediate sideroblast group. Patients with mainly ringed sideroblasts had significantly longer duration of disease state, higher platelet and leucocyte counts, no increase in the percentage of bone marrow myeloblasts and did less often develop acute leukaemia. Thus aregenerative anaemias can be divided according to the type of abnormal sideroblasts in two groups with different risk of development of acute leukaemia. The ringed sideroblastic anaemia seems not to be a preleukaemic stage in the prospective sense in contrast to aregenerative anaemia with mainly intermediate sideroblasts.",,,,,,,,,,

Toxic reactions included fever (in 100% of trials), nausea (44%) hypotension (28%), thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (68%), erythema (12%), and polyarthralgia plus myalgia (16%). Hypotension and arthralgia-myalgia were related to dose level and/or magnitude of interferon induction, but other toxic manifestations were not. Poly ICLC induced significant serum interferon levels in 76% of trials, and the correlation between dose and peak interferon titer was linear. The maximum tolerated dose for all patients at a given drug dose was 12 mg/m2; at this dose, the mean peak interferon titer was 1940 reference units/ml. At a dose of 18 mg/m2, the mean peak interferon titer was 4473 reference units/ml, but severe myalgia and arthralgia were intolerable in at least half of the patients, and most had significant hypotension. At a dose of 27 mg/m2, one patient had acute renal failure. At high doses, iv poly ICLC also induced interferon in the cerebrospinal fluid.",,,,,,,,,,

Most importantly, the palmitate that was subsequently incorporated into total cell phospholipids was elongated and desaturated somewhat more than that incorporated into triglycerides. This difference was due primarily to more extensive modification of the palmitate incorporated into the ethanolamine phosphoglycerides fraction. Although there was no difference between total phospholipids and triglycerides with linoleate, more of the linoleate incorporated into ethanolamine phosphoglycerides was elongated and further desaturated than that incorporated into choline phosphoglycerides and triglycerides. These findings indicate fatty acids incorporated into various cell lipid fractions are not structurally modified to the same extent.

In such mice, the reappearance of normal levels of TdT in the thymus appears to only be associated with the onset of overt leukemia. This effect on TdT expression was shown to be uniquely associated with the leukemogenic regimen of irradiation in that nonleukemogenic irradiation or variations such as bone marrow reconstitution or age which reduce leukemias did not show the same phenotypic effects on TdT expression. The basis for the loss of TdT-positive cells was shown not to be due to the lack of the requisite factors involved in differentiation, but rather to the ability of leukemogenic doses of irradiation to reduce or eliminate an inducible bone marrow stem cell.

Similar experiments were performed with cultured mouse leukaemia cells (L5178Y) irradiated in vitro at 0 degrees C. Irradiation induced single- and double-strand breaks in the DNA of the brain with a yield of 1.0 and 0.1 break per 10(12) dalton per rad (100 eV/break and 770 eV/break), respectively. The yield of single-strand breaks in the brain was lower than that found in the cultured cells, whereas the yield of double-strand breaks was found to be almost the same in both cases. Treatment of irradiated DNA with single-strand-specific S1 endonuclease gave rise to further breaks detected on neutral sucrose gradient analysis. The yield of these breaks was also higher in the brain compared to the cultured cells. The increase per unit dose in the template activity of the DNA from the brain was found to be five times as much as that found in the cultured cells. Then, the average number of deoxyribonucleotides incorporated per break was determined on DNA which had experienced different treatments. The value for the brain DNA irradiated in vivo was found to be five times as much as that found for DNA treated with pancreatic deoxyribonuclease and 10 times as much as those found for DNA from the cultured cells and isolated brain nuclei irradiated in vitro at 0 degrees C. Thus, in vivo irradiation seemed to induce gaps with 3'-OH terminals in addition to simple breaks with or without 3'-OH terminals found in the cultured cells. Radiation-induced single-strand breaks and 3'-OH terminals in the DNA of the brain were repaired following irradiation. Approx. 20--40% of the terminals or breaks induced were, however, remaining at 3 h or more after irradiation, depending on the dose administered.","['0005-2787(78)90257-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(78)90257-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

In this connection, interferon may be implicated in tumor cell destruction through macrophage activation to cytotoxicity. Studies of age-related susceptibility of New Zealand Black mice to three different carcinogens, ie, 3-methylcholanthrene, x-irradiation, and murine leukemia virus, have further emphasized the multifactorial determinants which may be operational in oncogenesis.

Such an effect is strictly associated with the antiproliferative and cytotoxic action. Thus, according such theories, consequent immunological depression should be considered as an ""unwanted effect"" related to a treatment that had been started for quite different purposes. Neverthelese recent medical literature reports several works which seem to evidence the immunological barrier insufficiency against neoplastic illnesses. Thus the above mentioned theories have been often criticized. After such considerations the Author emphasizes that also the treatment now used in some chronic lymphatic affections may be considered as an immune system depressing cure. The same is true for drugs used against autoimmune occurrences observed during malignant hemoblastoses. In a next future such a treatment will be in all probability followed more extensively, if more specific anti-lymphocyte drugs will be discovered, and in relation with recent attempts of transplantating normal bone marrow into leukaemic patients.",,,,,,,,,,

The initial rapid uptake of ara-C, mediated by the facilitated diffusion, was similar in all the cell lines tested but the subsequent slow uptake due to phosphorylation of ara-C was inversely correlated with their drug resistance. The capacity for drug phosphorylation was slightly higher in AH-66F and much lower in AH-60C, AH-109A, and AH-66 than in the host bone marrow. In contrast, mouse leukemia L-1210, one of the tumors sensitive to ara-C, phosphorylated the drug about 7 times faster than AH-66F and 4 times faster than the host bone marrow. More than 95% of phosphorylated ara-C was the triphosphate, the active form. Deamination of ara-C was not observed in any tumor or bone marrow.

Cross-resistance was observed to nonanthracycline DNA intercalating agents (with the exception of anthramycin), to agents which interfere with mitotic spindle function, and to antineoplastic inhibitors of protein biosynthesis (with the exception of bruceantin). P388/ADR was sensitive to antimetabolites and alkylating agents. Cross-resistance was also observed to several agents (ICRF-159, a terephthalanilide, taxol, lymphosarcin, bouvardin, and a crude extract of Ervatamia hyneana) whose mechanisms of action have not yet been clearly defined.

In the light of this and previous personal studies, we propose a kinetic pattern: the myeloma population may be seen as a highly differentiating population whose non-proliferating cells cannot re-enter the cycle. By contrast, the acute leukemia populations are unable to differentiate, and the non-proliferating cells (G0) can be recalled into the cell cycle.",,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it may be said that compounds useful in treatment of cancer will be found more and more in microbial secondary metabolites and more effective antitumor antibiotics and their derivatives, or more effective products producing immune resistance to cancer, will be discovered. In these studies, as discussed in this paper, the most urgent problem is to establish a rational screening principle or system to select compounds worth clinical examination. This is particularly important in the analog area. Bleomycin is an analog of phleomycin chosen because of lower renal toxicity. It has become an antitumor agent of significant value. Macromycin is a new structure which has been found to bind with animal cells and inhibit growth. Neothramycin is a new benzodiazepine antibiotic which has lower toxicity than other structures studied in this class and is active against L1210, Yoshida sarcoma, and Sarcoma 180. Aclacinomycin A is an analog of adriamycin chosen for clinical study based on its low cardiac toxicity and high distribution in mouse lung and spleen. Coriolins are another new structural class. Diketocoriolin B has activity in L1210 leukemia and has been shown to inhibit Na-K-ATPase. Bestatin is a compound which inhibits aminopeptidase B and leucine aminopeptidase has been shown to increase delayed hypersensitivity.

The latter structures had identical size to circles obtained after annealing of cDNA with the viral genome, 35S RNA. Circularization of a small viral RNA (3 kb) from infected cells in the RNA-cDNA hybrids is a direct evidence that like the 35S RNA it shares similar nucleotide sequences at both the 5' and 3' ends. The presence of 5' end sequences common to the two RNA species indicates the existence of a spliced viral RNA.

Analysis of R-MuLV glycopeptides obtained after exhaustive Pronase digestion showed that gp70 has at least two different glycopeptide size classes with molecular weights of 5,100 and 2,900, respectively. gp52, however, contained only a single glycopeptide size class of approximately 5,100 daltons, indicating that the two glycoproteins contain distinct carbohydrate components. Trypsin treatment of R-MuLV converted gp70 into a product with a molecular mass of approximately 52,000 daltons as well as a 45,000-dalton minor product, with little effect on virus infectivity. Similarly, trypsin treatment of 125I-labeled glycoproteins derived from AKR mouse lymphoblastoid cell membranes generated fragments antigenically related to gp70 and similar in size to those obtained by trypsin treatment of R-MuLV. In both cases, the appearance of cleavage products was accompanied by a decrease in gp70 during trypsin treatment. The occurrence of glycosylated components antigenically related to gp70 in AKR membrane glycoprotein preparations and in purified R-MuLV preparations which were similar to those generated by trypsin treatment supports the concept that these minor components arise from proteolytic cleavage of gp70.",['10.1128/JVI.28.1.84-94.1978 [doi]'],PMC354250,,,,,,,,

Of 16 strains tested, only BALB/c and some of its derivative strains showed high sensitivity. Studies from CXB recombinant inbred strains and hybrids between them are interpreted to indicate that BALB/c carries dominant sensitivity alleles at two loci, tentatively designated Av-1 and Av-2, which conferon these mice partial susceptibility to MuLV-A lymphoma induction. In addition, H-2 may play a minor role in determining the susceptibility of mice to MuLV-A, its effect being seen only in mice homozygous for resistance at both Av-1 and Av-2.

The standard cytotoxic test was demonstrated to be suitable for characterizing the H-2 antigens present on the surface of spleen cells from normal of FLV-leukemic parents of F1 hybrid mice. Individual colonies dissected out of the spleen of (C3HxC57B6/6) F1 recipients (H-2k/H-2b), 10 days after the intravenous graft of FLV-infected spleen cells of C3H origin (H-2k), were all sensitive to anti-C57BL/6 antibodies.

The radioactivity of the cell pellet is referred to a standard curve generated by incubating the L1210 with known amounts of heat aggregated IgG (AIgG). 7S IgG of three species (human, canine, murine) do not bind significantly to the L1210 in contrast to the respective AIgG. The assay readily distinguishes between sera of healthy individuals and sera of individuals (human and canine) with diseases known to be associated with circulation immune complexes (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, HBAg positive acute hepatitis). The L1210 radioimmune assay is capable of detecting as little as 5 micrograms of immune complexes per ml of serum in all three species tested.

The blockade of protein synthesis on liver and Walker carcinoma ribosomes and on suspensions of Walker carcinoma cells, depended essentially on the length of the alkylic chain and the substitution in C-1. The minimum chain was 9 carbons and a plateau in the activity was reached at 11 carbons. Replacement of the thiourea group in C-1 by an NH2 group did not change the pattern. A double bond in the distal section of the chain (AHR-1911) increased inhibition on intact cells with a parallel decrease in cytotoxicity, and reduced the aggregation of ribosomes, protein synthesis factors and other proteins. The antitumor effect depends on the pseudothiourea group and is not caused primarily by interference with protein synthesis. Aminoacyl tRNA binding and transfer appeared to be targets of AH4-1911, but this did not affect significantly tRNA change or nascent peptide release. Drug binding to ribosomes and their subsequent aggregation can be regulated by K+ concentration and temperature.

This technique allows the quantification of a new cell type, an erythropoietin (Ep) independent colony forming cell. These Ep independent colonies were taken as marker for the disease. Their number with time after infection was correlated with the compartment size of pluripotent, granuloid committed and erythroid stem cells at the time of infection. The results indicate that the development of the Friend leukemia does not require the actual presence of CFUE, as seen using Actinomycin D, and is not correlated with the number of pluripotent or granuloid stem cells, as seen after Busulfan. It is, however, dependent on the erythropoietic state of the animal, as seen in plethoric mice and mice after bleeding.

Aetiological relations were found to exist between lymphoid leucosis and the oncorna-virus-dependent lymphatic tumours in mammals, while similarities with Marek's disease were relating to infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt's lymphoma, and herpes-virus-dependent lymphatic tumours in monkey. Reference is made to the model nature of both lymphoid leucosis and Marek's disease and the resulting relevance to tumour research.",,,,,,,,,,

The dose-effect relationship appears to be curvilinear and, from the scientific standpoint, linear extrapolation to predict a low dose effect is not justified. Such linear extrapolation is nevertheless legitimate on grounds of radioprotection but should not be used to evaluate the risk of small doses such as those given for radiodiagnostic purposes (doses in the range of one rad), or those received by a population in the vicinity of a nuclear power station (doses in the range of one rad), or those received by a population in the vicinity of a nuclear power station (doses in the range of a millirad).

Most of the recent reports are almost entirely concerned with the pathological and functional aspects of the disease. In the present retrospective study the clinical features and laboratory data of 12 patients were analyzed together with a series of 123 adequately clinically documented cases from the literature. The Hb level and the sex of the patient proved to be the only parameters having some prognostic value for the survival time after diagnosis. The effect of splenectomy was assessed in two comparable groups of 24 splenectomized and 51 non-splenectomized patients. The operation seemed to be beneficial, but after 2 years the difference was not significant(.05 less than P less than .10). Analysis of subgroups showed that splenectomy was definitely beneficial in women, in patients with a Hb level over 8.0 g/dl or a platelet level above 50 X 10(9)/1, in patients with leucocytes below 3 X 10(9/1, , and also in patients with hepatomegaly (P less than .05 in all cases). These findings suggest that splenectomy is beneficial in cases where anaemia and thrombocytopenia are not very severe; in severe cytopenia the operation does not increase the life expectancy.",,,,,,,,,,

Hypogammaglobulinemia is a common feature, and anomalous immunoglobulin components occur in 3 to 5% of patients. The early symptoms and signs of CLL include fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, enlarged lymph nodes, and splenomegaly. Fever, weight loss, and impairment of bone marrow function, with anemia, bleeding and susceptibility to infection are characteristic of severe or advanced disease. In the great majority of patients, the disease can be controlled for 6 to 10 or more years with simple regimens using chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, often in combination with prednisone.

There is a constellation of neoplasms of lymphoid cells and their derivatives--leukemias, lymphomas, and plasmacytomas which need an integrated taxonomy. New diagnostic tests, new strategies of adapting therapy to tumor cell kinetics perturbed by the preceding treatment, and interesting clinical and preclinical combination of drugs provide new basis for favorable expectations. Immunotherapy is just emerging as a potent therapeutic tool. A technique for standardizing clinical results of different institutions to the age and sex of the population who develop the disease in question is much needed.

The response to combination chemotherapy was rapid and dramatic, but usually transient, with relapse in the CNS or previously involved sites.

Four transplanted leukemia or lymphoma lines were not inhibited in syngeneic rats immunized with allogenic tumor cells. Furthermore, immunization with allogeneic leukemic cells had only a relatively weak inhibitory effect upon a syngeneic fibrosarcoma and no inhibitory effect upon leukemias. In WKA rats immunized with allogeneic lymphoid cells from Donryu rats, the growth of fibrosarcoma, but not of lymphoma, was inhibited. Using transplantation experiments, both fibrosarcoma and lymphoma were defined as antigenic tumors in WKA rats.

The determination of SIgM-bearing (SIgM+) cells by immunofluorescent staining and the quantification of SIgM by radioimmunoassay (RIA) permitted the calculation of the SIgM density. In 12 normal subjects the percentage of SIgM+ cells averaged 8% (range 4%-12%) and the SIgM density 10.2 ng antigenic equivalent/10(6) SIgM+ cells (SD 4.3). In 12 patients with CLL the respective figures were 68% (range 35%-90%) and 0.68 ng (SD 0.57). Ig secretion from pokeweed mitogen-stimulated CLL cells was markedly diminished as compared with normal lymphocytes.

These cells have been tentatively categorized on the basis of either monocytic or lymphocytic markers, and the accumulating data points to the fact that they share some characteristics of both cell types. Although hairy cells are known to lack myeloperoxidase-positive granules, present in normal human monocytes, we investigated the possible presence of other peroxidase activities differing from the granule-bound myeloperoxidase. The study was carried out with several methods based on the incubation of fixed and unfixed cells in the presence of diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. A peroxidase activity was found in hairy cells, located always in the endoplasmic reticulum but not in the Golgi apparatus or in any granule. By its cytochemical characteristics it appears to be closely related to that of tissue macrophages, activated blood monocytes, and other nonlymphocytic hematopoietic cells. This peroxidase is not found in lymphocytes with B or T phenotypes.",['S0006-4971(20)70723-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,

In all these experiments the drug was administered i.v., according to different schedules. Higher antitumor activity at the optimal dose and an increase of activity at lower doses were observed in different experimental systems. Toxicity was also slightly enhanced. Tissue distribution was studied in normal mice and in tumor-bearing mice (Gross leukemia and MS-2 sarcoma). In animals give i.v. adriamycin diluted in 10% Tween 80 there was a higher drug concentration in spleen, lung and kidney than there was in mice given the drug in a water solution. In all the other organs examined (heart, liver, small intestine) and in the MS-2 tumor tissue, no significant increase was observed. In L1210 leukemia-bearing mice, i.p. treatment with adriamycin diluted in 10% Tween 80 resulted in a significantly higher toxicity than that which resulted from treatment with adriamycin in a wa ter solution; no increase of antitumor activity was observed.",,,,,,,,,,

Framework lesions (reticulin, vessels, bone) and cytologic modifications (histiocytic or plasmocytic infiltrations) have been appreciated, and their importance in the induction of aplasia and in the prognosis is emphasized. Comparison between first and second biopsy has shown a repletion of the marrow in two third of the cases, the early unfavourable character of reticulinic lesions, and the favourable signification of plasmocytosis.

After i.v. administration, the drug is present in all tissues except central nervous system. Its disappearance from the plasma is biphasic with a long terminal half life, justifying intermittent chemotherapy. Anthracyclines metabolism occurs mainly in liver micrososomes, and 90% metabolites are excreted in the bile. The main toxicity is cardiac, as a congestive heart failure which appears when a cumulated drug dose is overcome. In man only, a few derivatives have been studied, compounds with activity and no cardiotoxicity are still in research. Action of malignancies depends on type of derivative. We use DNR since 1967, it is a remarkable active drug in induction treatment of AML, it is the only active drug on acute promyelocytic leukemia, and it increases number of remissions in all of adult patients and severe forms of children ALL. Adriamycin (ADR) is active on solid tumors (osteosarcoma, breast and thyroid cancers) and lymphomas. With rubidazone (RBD) we obtain 2/3 of remissions in acute monoblastic leukemia, and it is easier to use than DNR and equally active on AML. RBD is also active on severe cases of lymphomas (lymphosarcomas and Hodgkin's disease). A new compound DEA 14 DNR seems interesting: experimental antitumor activity is high (compared to DNR, RBD and ADR) and it appears to possess activity on solid tumors in man.",,,,,,,,,,

Raised specific binding was found in the extracts from leucocytes of eight of 14 patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia, in four substantially so (389, 121, 108, 59.7 pg/mg protein), but was only marginally increased in one of eight cases of acute myeloid leukaemia and in two of five cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Binding was normal in the extracts of all three cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia tested. Among the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract binding was greatest by the duodenal mucosa and liver. Extracts of carcinoma of the stomach and colon bound greater amounts of (3)H-folic acid than the corresponding normal mucosal extracts but the differences were not large. Sephadex G-200 gel chromatography showed more than one binding peak in the extracts of liver and duodenum but only one peak in the other tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, and only one peak, of molecular weight either about 50 000 or over 200 000, in the leucocyte extracts.",['10.1136/jcp.31.7.659 [doi]'],PMC1145370,,,,,,,,

Shortly after infection, a decrease in the number and percentage of villous cells occurred, with a concomitant increase in the number of cells that were larger and smoother. Within 10 to 20 days after infection, the majority of splenocytes were smooth, large cells showing many distinct morphological charges, including surface ""holes"" and a ""spongy"" appearance. By days 25 to 35 after infection, most splenocytes were abnormal in appearance. Similar changes occurred in the lymph nodes after FLV infection, but the rate of change was much lower. Abnormal and larger smooth-surfaced cells did not become prominent until after week 2 or 3 infection. Thymus and bone marrow cells showed little if any change in surface morphology until late in the infectious process. However, even at that time only a few of the cells were abnormal in appearance. The changes in cell population in the spleen but not the lymph nodes paralleled the rapid decrease in the percentage of cells which stained positive for surface immunoglobulin and theta antigen. Futhermore, FLV antigen rapidly appeared on spleen cells after infection; fewer lymph node cells were positive, and only low numbers of marrow and thymus cells stained positive for FLV antigen.

These cells subsequently infiltrated the whole spleen and 3 weeks after infection about 60% of the spleen consisted of large immature erythroblast-like cells. Repeated injections of 3H-Thymidine led to uniform labeling of 85% of the spleen cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that for bone marrow as well as for spleen cells the total duration of the cell cycle did not differ from the cell cycle times of normal erythroblasts. From the difference between the actual doubling time and the potential doubling time (estimated on the basis of the cell cycle time) it can be calculated that considerable cell loss must occur. This cell loss is only to a minor extent due to the release of blasts into the peripheral blood. Probably cell death and extrusion of nuclei during erythroid differentiation are the main factors involved.",,,,,,,,,,

The patient did not respond to combined chemotherapy, but splenectomy brought about significant improvement in anemia and thrombocytopenia. She is now doing well without cytotoxic treatment. Hairy cell leukemia was diagnosed on the basis of electron microscopic findings in peripheral lymphocytes and histologic findings in bone marrow and spleen. The tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was positive. Immunologic tests in the hairy cells showed surface immunoglobulins of monoclonal origina and the T-cells were shown to be decreased. The tests for phagocytosis and nonspecific esterase were negative. The hairy cells in this patient exhibited no colony stimulating activity in culture studies with bone marrow from 4 normal donors, as compared with the stimulating activity of normal monocytes in the same assay. In the light of this case report the question is discussed whether the hairy cells are mainly cells with lymphocytic (B-lymphocytes) or monocytic characteristics.

The size resolution of the gels was better than that of sucrose gradients used in previous analyses, and two virus-specific mRNA's of 38S and 24S were detected. The 24S virus-specific mRNA is predominantly derived from the 3' half of the M-MuLV genome, since cDNAgag(pol) (complementary to the 5' half of the M-MuLV genome) could not efficiently anneal with this mRNA. However, sequences complementary to cDNA synthesized from the extreme 5' end of M-MuLV 38S RNA (cDNA 5') are present in the 24S virus-specific mRNA, since cDNA 5' (130 nucleotides) efficiently annealed with this mRNA. The annealing of cDNA 5' was not due to repetition of 5' terminal nucleotide sequences at the 3' end of M-MuLV 38S RNA, since smaller cDNA 5' molecules (60 to 70 nucleotides), which likely lack the terminal repetition, also efficiently annealed with the 24S mRNA. The sequences in 24S virus-specific mRNA recognized by cDNA 5' are not present in 3' fragments of virion RNA that are the same length. Therefore, it appears that RNA sequences from the extreme 5' end of the M-MuLV genome may be transposed to sequences from the 3' half of the M-MuLV 38S RNA during synthesis and processing of the 24S virus-specific mRNA.

The cells were assayed for synthesis of DNA and poly-(adenosine diphosphate ribose) (poly[ADPR]) immediately after isolation and on successive days following their treatment with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Two different techniques were used to measure DNA synthesis. In the standard technique, DNA synthesis was measured by incubating intact cells with [(3)H]deoxythymidine. In the new technique, the lymphocytes were first rendered permeable to nucleotides, then DNA synthesis was measured by incubating them with [(3)H]deoxythymidine triphosphate in the presence of deoxyATP, deoxyGTP, deoxyCTP, ATP, and Mg(++). Both assays showed the anticipated rise in DNA synthesis after PHA stimulation of normal cells. PHA-stimulated lymphocytes from patients with CLL demonstrated low levels of DNA synthesis in both assay systems. The initial levels of poly(ADPR) synthesis were greater in CLL lymphocytes than in normal cells. Studies with a T-cell-depleted population of normal cells showed the same activity for poly(ADPR) synthesis that was demonstrated by the original population of normal cells. PHA stimulation produced an increase in poly(ADPR) synthesis in both the normal and CLL cells. The increase in poly(ADPR) synthesis in normal cells was coincident with the increase in DNA synthesis. The increase in poly(ADPR) synthesis in the CLL cells was dissociated from the delayed and diminished increase in DNA synthesis. Thus, CLL cells have higher than normal initial levels of poly(ADPR) synthesis. Poly(ADPR) synthesis is dissociated from DNA synthesis in CLL cells whereas it varies directly with DNA synthesis in normal lymphocytes.",['10.1172/JCI109094 [doi]'],PMC371743,,,,,,,,

Repeated challenge of rabbits with whole Raji cells with bound complexes or eluates from such cells resulted in antibody production against the antigens of the immune complexes, although reactivity against cellular and serum components was also elicited.

(1) The level of circulating virus was controlled by at least two genes. An H-2 linked gene, tentatively called Rmv-1, displayed a dominant sensitivity. Alleles for resistance existed in H2b and H-2r haplotypes and alleles for sensitivity in H-2a, H-2d and H-2f. Another gene with dominant resistance mapped outside the H-2 complex and probably interacted with Rmv-1.

This procoagulant activity is increased greatly when leukocytes are stimulated by endotoxin. The tissue factor is derived almost exclusively from the monocytes and not from lymphocytes and granulocytes. Monocytes are stimulated to the same extent by adherence to plastic surfaces. The fibrinolytic activity of lysates of mixed leukocytes is due to a nonspecific protease and a plasminogen activator. Only granulocytes can cause fibrinolyses. Endotoxin stimulation enhances the plasminogen activator but not the protease. Normal leukocytes and leukocytes of patients with chronic leukemias also exert an antithrombin activity.,,,,,,,,,,

The 30 oligonucleotides were mapped on the genome by determining their yields in various size classes of 3' terminal fragments of Mo-MuLV RNA. The physical map obtained in this way suggested that oligonucletoide 21 was present very near the 3' end of the geome as well as in another location near or at the 5' end. The genome structure suggested by these results was confirmed by analyzing oligonucleotides in Mo-Mulv RNA complementary to strong stop DNA, which is shown to be a copy of the 5' terminal 134 nucleotides of the MoMuLV genome. Some of the oligonucleotides in the RNA protected from RNAase digestion by hybridization to this DNA, including oligonucleotide 21, were present near both the 3' and 5' ends.

This effect was observed with several different subclones of three independent Friend tumor cell lines. After BrdU treatment, globin mRNA content may reach up to 10-20% of the levels in DMSO induced cultures. The induction of erythroid differentiation is also apparent when accumulated heme content or the appearance of benzidine positive cells is monitored. One Friend cell line (745) we examined was not induced by BrdU although it incorporated an amount of BrdU into its DNA comparable to that incorporated by the other cell lines. In addition, BrdU did interfere with DMSO induction in this cell line. These results suggest that two different mechanisms may be operative in regulating erythroid differentiation in Friend leukemia cells.

This assay gives little cross-reaction with spleen ferritin. Tissue ferritins have been fractionated by anion exchange chromatography and assayed with both spleen and heart antibodies. The spleen ferritin assay detects the more basic ferritin and the heart ferritin assay the more acidic ferritin. Acidic ferritins were found in heart, kidney, reticulocytes and HeLa cells. In sera from normal subjects and patients with iron overload, myocardial infarction, leukaemia and carcinoma only low concentrations of heart ferritin were found, although in the pathological sera spleen ferritin concentrations were generally raised.
